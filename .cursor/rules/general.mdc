# General Rules

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Core Principles
1.  **Communication Language**: We communicate and discuss in **English**, especially for .mdc files in .cursor/rules. Please remember to use English for our communication.
2.  **Code Language**: All code, comments, and documentation in the project must be in **English**.
3.  **YOLO Mode**: All commands to be executed will run automatically in YOLO mode by default, without requiring your approval.
4.  **Prohibit Batch Modification**: It is strictly forbidden to use `sed`, `awk`, or other similar scripting tools for batch code replacement. All modifications should be made individually to ensure accuracy.

## Workflow
1.  **Understand Requirements**: Before coding, please thoroughly analyze my requirements and think from different perspectives to ensure a complete understanding of the problem's essence.
2.  **Solution Analysis**: For the problem, propose different solutions and analyze their respective advantages, disadvantages, and potential risks.
3.  **Logic Check**: Before starting specific work, carefully check your reasoning process for any loopholes.
4.  **Coding Implementation**: Write clear, standardized Rust code, and adhere to the existing code style in the project.
5.  **Testing**: For code changes, consider and propose corresponding testing methods.
