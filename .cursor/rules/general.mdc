General Rules

Core Principles
	1.	Communication Language: All communication and discussion—especially in ‎⁠.cursor/rules⁠ ‎⁠.mdc⁠ files—must be in English for clarity and collaboration.
	2.	Code Language: All code, comments, and documentation in the project must be written in English.
	3.	YOLO Mode: All commands should be executed automatically by default (YOLO mode), without waiting for manual approval.
	4.	No Bulk Modifications: It is strictly forbidden to use ‎⁠sed⁠, ‎⁠awk⁠, or similar scripting tools for bulk code replacements. All changes must be made individually to ensure accuracy.

Workflow
	1.	Understand Requirements: Before coding, thoroughly analyze the requirements from multiple perspectives to ensure a deep understanding of the problem.
	2.	Solution Analysis: Propose different solutions for the problem, analyzing the pros, cons, and potential risks of each.
	3.	Logic Check: Carefully review your reasoning process for any flaws before starting implementation.
	4.	Coding: Write clear, well-structured Rust code that follows the existing project style.
	5.	Testing: For any code changes, consider and propose appropriate testing methods.
