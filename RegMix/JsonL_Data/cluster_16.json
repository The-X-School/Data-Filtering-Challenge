      "text": "Researchers at Boston College invented nanocoax in 2005, and patented their technology some time last year.\n\nWhat is The \"Thick and Thin\" Dilemma?\n\nMost thin-film solar technology is hampered by competing optical and electronic constraints.\n\nA solar cell needs to be thick enough to collect sufficient light, but thin enough to extract current from. It also has to meet the challenges of the Staebler-Wronski effect -- a form of light degradation that decreases the longevity of cells.\n\nMost groups looking for solutions, focus their research on the use of crystalline semiconductors. Boston College's scientists claim that their new nanocoax technology does not require crystalline materials -- making it easier to manufacture, and considerably more cost-efficient.\n\nNanoscale Coax Architecture:\n\nOptically, the nanocoax is thick enough to collect light. But it's architecture, as seen in the photo below, is such that it allows a more efficient method of current extraction.\n\nOther good news is that testing has found the nanocoax to run at about 8% efficiency--a better rate than any thin-film solar cells to date. Plus it appears to reduce the effect of light degradation (mentioned above).\n\n\"This nanocoax cell architecture,\" says co-author Michael Naughton, a professor of physics at Boston College, \"does not require crystalline materials, and therefore offers promise for lower-cost solar power with ultra-thin absorbers. With continued optimization, efficiencies beyond anything achieved in conventional planar architectures may be possible, while using smaller quantities of less costly material"

      "text": "Producing Stronger, More Efficient Solar Cells Using Polymers\n\nNSF-funded engineers have developed a way to build more efficient solar cells with polymer materials in an environmentally friendly process.\n\nThe use of plastic materials can lead to more robust, flexible and cheaper solar cells, which could lead to more widespread adoption of solar energy as a sustainable energy resource. Introducing a process free of toxic liquid solvents minimizes the environmental impact of solar cell manufacturing.\n\nA dye-sensitized solar cell uses a photosensitizer dye to absorb sunlight and convert solar energy into more practical electrical energy. It uses a liquid electrolyte to conduct charges within the cell. However, the liquid electrolyte is prone to leaking and severely limits how the cell can be deployed. Replacing it with a solid polymer electrolyte that can perform the same function as the liquid electrolyte is a significant step forward. The solid polymer can completely fill the nanoscale pore spaces of the solar cell construct, meaning greater cell efficiency.\n\nOne hitch: Polymer-built solar cells are constructed using a \"wet\" method that interferes with the cell. But Kenneth Lau of Drexel University and his research team developed an efficient technique for making polymer cells that eliminates use of toxic liquids.Thus the wettability issues are eliminated and the process is more environmentally friendly.\n\nCells made using this processing technology have shown higher efficiencies. The results of this research were published in the journal Nano Letters.\n\nImages (1 of )\n\nResearchers have figured out how to use polymer materials to build a better solar cell.\n\nacrylicartist\n\nScanning electron microscope images of a polymer electrolyte effectively built into a solar cell using Lau's liquid-free and environmentally green process. The polymer is able to completely fill into the nanoscale pore spaces of the solar cell construct that leads to higher cell efficiency."

I wonder if this will, once perfected, make solar cells capable of turning light in to electricity at a far greater efficency than is possible today.\nAnyone of the physically/quantumly inclined care to venture how well this might work?\n\nHere's a link to the AIP's Physics News Update article on this research. Since it's written by a scientist with some journalism training instead of a journalist with no science training it actually makes some sense. I find that AIP (and APS) releases are much better than anything you'll find on science in the mainstream press."

In this process, plants synthesize carbohydrates (tissues) from airborne carbon dioxide and water, using light as an energy source.\n\nWilliam Arnold and Robert Emerson\nidentified the photosynthetic unit in pio-neering studies that led to Arnold's\n1966 discovery of delayed\nlight, an internationally recognized fundamental discovery in photosynthesis.\n(Arnold also is known for coining the term \"nuclear fission,\" used\nuniversally to describe the process of splitting atomic nuclei.) Roderick\nClayton provided evidence for the electronic nature of the first step of\nphotosynthesis.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s Robert Pearlstein developed theoretical models that described the migration of light energy in the chlorophyll antenna lattice of green plants and bacteria. Later in the 1980s Elias Greenbaum and his ORNL colleagues Perry Eubanks, Jim Thompson, Mark Reeves, and Ginger Tevault used photosynthesis in spinach and later algae to split water molecules to produce oxygen and the energy-rich gas, hydrogen. In 1985 Greenbaum demonstrated direct electrical contact of photosynthetic electrons with platinum metal nanoparticles; this work was featured on the cover of Science magazine. In 1995, Greenbaum, working in collaboration with Ida Lee and James Lee, discovered the diode properties of isolated Photosystem I reaction centers. In 2000, the continuation of this work led to the first measurement of photovoltages of isolated photosynthetic reaction centers.\n\nIn 2002 Greenbaum and his associates at ORNL and the University of\nSouthern California investigated the use of photosynthetic reaction centers for restoring sight to the legally blind. ORNL has had\nonly a handful of photosynthesis researchers, but they all have made noteworthy contributions to this field."

If the technology catches on, camera\nperformance will be no longer be limited by the software that comes\npre-installed by the manufacturer.\n\nVirtually all the features of the Stanford camera - focus, exposure,\nshutter speed, flash, etc. - are at the command of software that can be\ncreated by inspired programmers anywhere.\n\nThe researchers imagine a future where consumers download applications\nto their open-platform cameras the way Apple apps are downloaded to\niPhones today. When the camera's operating software is made available\npublicly, users will be able to continuously improve it, along the\nopen-source model of the Linux operating system for computers or the\nMozilla Firefox web browser.\n\nProgrammers will have the freedom to experiment with new ways of tuning\nthe camera's response to light and motion, adding their own algorithms\nto process the raw images in innovative ways.\n\nA big step towards construction of a massively powerful quantum computer\nhas taken place, following research by a team at University of Bristol's\nCentre for Quantum Photonics.\n\nThe mathematical computation investigated was to find the prime factors\nof 15, which although trivial, points the way to more important\nquantum-based calculations, once the hardware can be scaled up to herald\nfully functional optical quantum compute systems. The system outputs the\ncorrect prime factors of 15 as three and five.\n\nThe three main components of the system was a photon source, a single\nphoton detector, and circuitry sandwiched in between to perform a simple\ncryptographic calculation.\n\nPlatinum remains the best material for speeding chemical reactions in\nhydrogen fuel cells, although the scarcity and cost of this element keep\nfuel cells from becoming more affordable and practical. Most alternative\napproaches involve simply replacing the platinum in the electrodes. Now\nUK company ACAL Energy has overhauled fuel cell design to reduce the\namount of platinum used by 80%.\n\nIn a conventional fuel cell, platinum is embedded in porous carbon\nelectrodes. ACAL's design replaces this with a solution containing\nlow-cost molybdenum and vanadium as the catalyst. The resulting fuel\ncell works as well as a conventional one but should cost 40% less.\n\nACAL says its design gives power densities of 600 milliwatts per square\ncentimetre at 0.6 volts. Adding pressure should increase the power\ndensity further and could reach 1.5 watts per square centimetre,\naccording to ACAL.\n\nThe company has already made a one-kilowatt system that it intends to\nsell to select customers next year, and the fuel cells should be\navailable more widely in 2011. The plan is to first target the market\nfor diesel generators with one- to 10-kW systems, then move on to larger\napplications such as home power generation and electric cars.\n\nBorrowing from Mother Nature, a team of MIT researchers has built a\nschool of swimming robo-fish that slip through the water just as\ngracefully as the real thing, if not quite as fast.\n\nThe sleek robotic fish was designed to more easily manoeuvre into areas\nwhere traditional underwater autonomous vehicles can't go. Fleets of the\nnew robots could be used to inspect submerged structures such as boats\nand oil and gas pipes; patrol ports, lakes and rivers; and help detect\nenvironmental pollutants.\n\nRobotic fish are not new: In 1994, MIT ocean engineers demonstrated\nRobotuna, a four-foot-long robotic fish. But while Robotuna had 2,843\nparts controlled by six motors, the new robotic fish, each less than a\nfoot long, are powered by a single motor and are made of fewer than 10\nindividual components, including a flexible, compliant body that houses\nall components and protects them from the environment. The motor, placed\nin the fish's midsection, initiates a wave that travels along the fish's\nflexible body, propelling it forward.\n\nThe robofish bodies are continuous, flexible and made from soft\npolymers. This makes them more manoeuvrable and better able to mimic the\nswimming motion of real fish, which propel themselves by contracting\nmuscles on either side of their bodies, generating a wave that travels\nfrom head to tail.\n\nLaser beams are about to get a whole lot more precise. Independent teams\nhave found ways to shrink lasers to nanoscale dimensions in two\nradically different ways; one creating a spherical laser device 44\nnanometres in diameter, while the other can concentrate laser light into\na gap just 5 nm across.\n\nSources of electromagnetic waves cannot normally focus a beam to a size\nsmaller than half its wavelength. For the spectrum of visible light,\nthat's 190 to 350 nm. To go smaller, the teams used quasiparticles\ncalled surface plasmons - fluctuations in the density of electrons on a\nmetal surface - which can absorb light, travel along the surface and\nre-emit that energy. They are much smaller than the wavelength of\nvisible light, so it's possible to sustain a laser in a smaller area.\nThe trick to using them in a laser is to couple them with a medium which\ncan amplify their light. Silver sheet\n\nThe 'plasmonic laser', developed at the University of California, uses\nan optical laser to create surface plasmons in a specially designed\nnanowire. The wire rests on a sheet of metallic silver covered by a film\nof insulating material. The surface plasmons are created on the silver\nsurface, with the wire acting to contain these plasmons and amplify them\nbefore they release their light. The researchers generated laser light\nat 489 nm, and they succeeded in focusing it onto a zone just 5 nm wide.\n\nSeparately, a group at Norfolk State University created a device called\na 'spaser', which amplifies surface plasmons in a similar manner to a\nlaser's amplification of light.\n\nResearchers at Ben-Gurion University in Israel have developed software\nthat can decipher previously unreadable ancient texts and possibly lead\nthe way to a Google-like search engine for historical documents.\n\nThe program uses a pattern recognition algorithm similar to those law\nenforcement agencies have adopted to identify and compare fingerprints.\nBut in this case, the program identifies letters, words and even\nhandwriting styles, saving historians and liturgists hours of sitting\nand studying each manuscript.\n\nBy recognizing such patterns, the computer can recreate with high\naccuracy portions of texts that faded over time or even those written\nover by later scribes, according to the researchers. The computer works\nwith digital copies of the texts, assigning number values to each pixel\nof writing depending on how dark it is. It separates the writing from\nthe background and then identifies individual lines, letters and words.\nIt also analyses the handwriting and writing style, so it can fill in\nthe blanks of smeared or faded characters that are otherwise\nindiscernible, the researchers say.\n\nThe team has focused their work on ancient Hebrew texts, but they say it\ncan be used with other languages, as well. A program for all academics\ncould be ready in two years, they say."

      "text": "Articles tagged as: Dwight Look College of Engineering\n\nDr. B. Don Russell, Distinguished Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, was a member of an expert task force commissioned to review the vulnerability of the electrical power system in the United States.\n\nThe task force, which was formed in 2005, along with the National Research Council and the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), recently released its report, \"Terrorism and the Electric Power Delivery System.\"\n\nThe report, which was presented to the Department of Homeland Security, stated that concern exists that an orchestrated terrorist plan could significantly disrupt the economy, safety and defense of the United States by attacking the electric grid.\n\n\"In a worst case scenario, it is not the power disruption alone, but coordinated attacks that hit the power system simultaneous to other large-scale attacks that are the concern because it hinders our ability to function and communicate,\" Russell said. \"If the power system is down at the same time as a coordinated attack, the magnitude of the problem is enormous.\"\n\nThe committee was tasked with identifying any and all vulnerabilities and suggesting approaches that could be reasonably taken to mitigate the effects of a terrorist attack.\n\nRussell is the past chair of the Electric Power and Energy Engineering section of the NAE and past president of the Power and Energy Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.\n\nHe is an expert on monitoring and protection of electric power systems and is the recipient of the IEEE Halperin Award, the highest recognition for electric power engineering given by IEEE. Dr. Russell holds the rank of Distinguished Professor and is Regents Professor of the Texas A&M University System. He is director of the Power System Automation Laboratory and has been a member of the faculty of Texas A&M for 37 years.\n\nDr. Russell is internationally recognized for his development of automated techniques for detecting arcing faults and failures on electric power systems. His recent work has emphasized predictive diagnostic tools for detecting failing power system equipment before catastrophic failure. This will allow utilities to repair systems before an outage occurs. His work is currently being extended to detect power system failures that cause wildfires, an area of great importance given the increasing drought conditions in the U.S.Using materials known as piezoelectrics, Cagin, whose research focuses on nanotechnology, has made a significant discovery in the area of power harvesting, convert energy at a 100 percent increase when manufactured at a very small size — in this case, around 21 nanometers in thickness.\n\nWhat's more, when materials are constructed bigger or smaller than this specific size, they show a significant decrease in their energy-converting capacity, he says.\n\nHis findings, which were detailed in Physical Review B, the journal of the American Physical Society, could have potentially profound effects for low-powered electronic devices such as cell phones, laptops, personal communicators and a host of other computer-related devices, which everyone from the average consumer to law enforcement officers and even soldiers in the battlefield use.\n\nKey to this technology, Cagin explains their physical properties change\nCigarette lighters in automobiles also contain piezoelectrics. Pressing down the lighter button causes impact on a piezoelectric crystal, which in turn produces enough voltage to create a spark and ignite the gas.\n\nOn a grander scale, some nightclubs in Europe feature dance floors built with piezoelectrics that absorb and convert the energy from footsteps in order to help power lights in the club. And a Hong Kong gym is reportedly using the technology to convert energy from exercisers to help power its lights and music.\n\nAlthough advances in those applications continue to progress, piezoelectric work at the nanoscale is a relatively new endeavor with different and complex aspects to consider, Cagin says.\n\nTahir Cagin\n\nFor example, imagine going from working with a material the size and shape of a telephone pole to dealing with that same material the size of a hair, he says. When such a significant change in scale occurs, materials react differently. In this case, something the size of a hair is much more pliable and susceptible to change from its surrounding environment. These types of changes have to be taken into consideration when conducting research at this scale, he says.\n\n\"When materials are brought down to the nanoscale dimension, their properties for some performance characteristics dramatically change,\" says Cagin, who is a past recipient of the prestigious Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology. \"One such example is with piezoelectric materials. We have demonstrated that when you go to a particular length scale — between 20 and 23 nanometers —###Among the most effective ways for Texas A&M University to help build the educational pipeline in Texas is through outreach, which is especially critical in the high need STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and math).\n\nOne proponent of the outreach and recruitment model is Joseph Morgan, professor of engineering technology and director of the Mobile Integrated Solutions Laboratory ESET (electronic systems engineering technology) program. Morgan noticed that over the last few years the number of undergraduate students in electrical and mechanical engineering and computer science was in decline.\n\n\"We all knew we had a national and state need for professionals who were proficient in the STEM fields and that we weren't training enough of them,\" says Morgan.\n\n\"We realized that it was imperative to do more outreach at the high school level,\" Morgan adds. \"In this department, we wanted to engage students in the world of electronics and software development so they would be prepared to meet the complex technical challenges of society and ultimately make a real contribution to the state of Texas and beyond.\"\n\nJay Porter, professor of engineering technology and program director for ESET, agrees. \"All of us recognize that students need to see the value in being able to produce things, be innovative and build products in the United States – this is a national need that must be met.\"\n\nJay Porter\n\nFour years ago, students in the electronic systems program (formerly known as electronics and telecommunications) came up with the phrase: \"There is a crisis at Texas A&M and we're it.\" But as Morgan explains, \"The phrase is ironic; because crisis was spelled 'krisys,' and referred to the code name for the overwhelmingly successful robotics workshop that was developed by the undergraduate students.\"\n\nIn a Krisys Robotics Workshop, students are divided into teams of four (three high school students paired with a sophomore engineering student) and within a week, not only build and assemble a small three-wheeled \"robot/vehicle\" but then populate the control/ driver circuit board, install it on the mechanical robot and design the program that allows the vehicle to navigate and race on a circuitous path. As daunting as that sounds, the workshops not only inspire and motivate the student team members, but the racing competition that caps the experience brings out the competitive spirit of all participants.\n\n\"What's really exciting about Krisys,\" says Porter, \"is that we discovered that when college sophomores are mentoring high school students, those high school students not only learn more, but also say to themselves: 'Hey, in two or three years I can be YOU!' And that epitomizes how we think outreach and recruiting should be done. The challenge, of course, is to reach these kids even earlier in the education pipeline — in grade school and middle school — so they take the right courses to prepare for a STEM major.\"\n\nThese programs have been responsible for helping the university attract more students to engineering, especially talented, high-performing minority and female students.\n\n\"In addition to providing real value to the outreach and recruiting efforts of the College of Engineering, the Krisys workshops have spawned innovation and entrepreneurship, which is really what the curriculum in electronic systems is built on,\" says Porter.\n\n\"In our product innovation and development initiative, our students come together to design educational products for middle and high school students. Currently, they have sold Krisys kits to three high schools; our hope is that by making programs like these available to Texas school districts, we'll be improving the number and quality of the students who enroll in the STEM fields at Texas A&M,\" Porter states.\n\nBased on the success of the Krisys robot workshops, the electronic systems program responded to two NASA solicitations that focused on outreach and recruiting.\n\nThe first proposal that was funded called for Morgan and Wei Zhan, associate professor in ESET and co-principal investigator, to develop and deliver a ten-week workshop to students in three different high schools. The project is part of the NASA HUNCH (High Schools United with NASA for the Creation of Hardware) program. Texas A&M teamed with the Project Management Institute (PMI) Clear Lake-Galveston chapter to develop the curriculum and then deliver it to the six HUNCH project teams at Conroe, Cy-Ranch, and Cy-Woods High Schools.\n\nMatt Leonard, Texas A&M class of 1986 and a senior project manager with NASA has been a major catalyst for Texas A&M/NASA interactions. Leonard states, \"Unless Texas A&M gets great students, the industry isn't interested. The joint project is one way to reach out to the top high school students and get them interested in Texas A&M and engineering.\"\n\nIn the second NASA-funded project, a team of four undergraduates are working on their ESET Capstone Design project to design, develop, deliver, and document a new wireless-based power monitoring and control system to be used in the Deep Space Habitat (DSH) mockup at NASA-JSC. As part of their project, the team members are mentoring high school students in the understanding and use of PMI-recommended project management tools and processes.\n\nWhen the high schools students see that ESET undergraduates are using the same tools and processes to plan, manage, and control their projects, they become highly motivated to emulate the college students. Again, college students directly interfacing with high school students has been a key element of this unique and highly successful outreach project sponsored by the NASA HUNCH program.\n\nAs a result of the TAMU/PMI-CLG/NASA collaboration, these high school students will have an opportunity to sit for the Certified Associate Project Manager examination administered by PMI which is the first step in seeking professional certification. Both NASA and PMI are looking for ways to replicate this overall outreach concept at other universities on a regional or national level.\n\nIn yet another opportunity for STEM outreach and recruiting, the ESET program learned that Clear Springs High School had been selected to develop a microgravity plant growth chamber that might eventually fly on the International Space Station. The high school team, under the direction of Ms. Allison Westover, needed technical assistance in the areas of electronic hardware and embedded software design and development.\n\nWhen Porter and Morgan learned of this need through Leonard, they decided this would be an excellent opportunity for the program to give back to the community while adding a new aspect to its recruiting of top-notch high school students.\n\nEight sophomore students in Morgan's digital design course have volunteered to mentor Ms. Westover's team and help them successfully field and test their system, designed to fly as part of NanoRacks' NanoLab program.\n\n\"We hope to continue and expand our STEM outreach efforts through the support and partnering of organizations like NASA and PMI,\" says Porter.\n\n\"What better way to recruit new students to Texas A&M than to let them interact and learn from current undergraduate students?\" asks Porter. \"Whether it is robotic workshops, project management tools and processes, or designing space-worthy lab projects, we have definitely found an innovative way to help build the STEM pipeline and improved our outreach and recruiting efforts for the university, the Dwight Look College of Engineering and our own electronic systems program.\"\n\nThe split allegiance is obvious from their family photos, but if you ask Texas A&M University Professor of Industrial Distribution Malini Natarajarathinam whether their true loyalty lies with the Aggies or the University of Alabama's Crimson Tide, her response will be, \"Roll Tide!\"\n\nThe family photos of Malini Natarajarathinam, husband Sudarsan Rangan and their son, Vaishnav, show allegiance to A&M and Alabama.\n\nNatarajarathinam and her husband, Sudarsan Rangan, a clinical assistant professor at Texas A&M's Mays Business School, both earned graduate degrees from the University of Alabama and are looking to this weekend's gridiron match with great anticipation. \"We have a room in our house dedicated to Alabama football,\" laughs Natarajarathinam. \"My husband will be useless to me during the game; there's no way he will do anything but watch that game.\"\n\nBoth Natarajarathinam and Rangan were born in India, she in Tirumangalam and he in Chennai, and although they knew one another prior to attending Alabama, \"The relationship got serious at Alabama,\" she contends. \"We were in the same department and had the same Ph.D. dissertation adviser.\"\n\nNatarajarathinam is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Engineering Technology and Industrial Distribution, within the Dwight Look College of Engineering at Texas A&M, and says she sees many similarities between the two universities. \"Obviously both Texas A&M and the University of Alabama students are passionate about their football,\" she notes. \"And both schools are located in smaller, college towns. The people in both cities are very nice and friendly. But while Alabama has a few traditions, it's nowhere near what A&M has.\"\n\nAfter receiving her bachelor's degree in industrial engineering in India, Natarajarathinam came to the states in 2000 and first attended another SEC school, Auburn, where she earned a master's in industrial engineering. The University of Alabama followed, where she earned two more master's degrees, in management science and statistics, and a Ph.D. in operations management.\n\nShe says she was first inspired to pursue a degree in industrial engineering by her uncle who lived in the U.S. and worked in that field. \"I looked at him as a solution provider and that interested me,\" she recalls. \"Plus, industrial engineering applies to so many different areas, from airlines to automobile production; I like that flexibility.\"\n\nIn one of her academic areas of interest, supply chain management (SCM), Natarajarathinam has been afforded the opportunity to collaborate with some colleagues back at Alabama. In \"Supply Chain Management Competency and Firm Financial Success,\" published in the Journal of Business Logistics in 2011, she, along with Alexander Ellinger and Frank Adams of the University of Alabama, studied the relationship between a business's financial success and its efficiency in SCM. \"What we wanted to know was: is bigger always better?\" she explains. \"We looked at Fortune 500 companies to see if the most successful businesses were also the ones that had the most efficient operations.\" The study found that SCM does play a major role in creating (or destroying) a company's value by influencing revenue, operating costs and working capital.\n\nNatarajarathinam again joined forces with Alabama colleagues for a study on how businesses can find a balance between inventory and transportation. Published this year in the International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, the study, \"Near-optimal Heuristics and Managerial Insights for the Storage Constrained, Inbound Inventory Routing Problem\" was conducted along withJennifer Stacey and Charles Sox at Alabama. \"When you are routing trucks to pick up products, such as in auto manufacturing, you have these large assembly plants that don't want to carry more than a few hours of supply because they have limited storage space,\" Natarajarathinam explains. \"So they want to increase the number of times the trucks come. But if you do this too often, you run the risk of having transportation costs that are too high.\" The study provides new analytical methods and managerial insights to help with such inventory routing problems.\n\nBesides collaborating on their now eight-month old son, Vaishnav, Natarajarathinam and her husband also get to work together occasionally. Rangan is with the Department of Information and Operations Management at Mays. He earned both his master's in operations management and his doctorate of philosophy in operations management at Alabama. \"Both of our passions lie in undergraduate teaching,\" says Natarajarathinam. \"We worked together on a handbook on recruiting, and how companies can make themselves attractive to today's students. This generation is very different – they don't want to be micromanaged, they are very socially connected and they do things passionately. We asked, how can a company best appeal to the unique senses of this generation?\"\n\nAlthough they're Alabama fans tried and true, Natarajarathinam says she and her husband both carry admiration for their Aggie students. \"Their passion and respect for one another and for the university, and their respect for tradition, we both admire that,\" she says, adding that she views all her students as her kids. \"At the end of the day, whether it's the students at Texas A&M or Alabama, they're all my kids and I never give up on them.\"\n\nLow Earth Orbit is overcluttered with rogue objects and collision shrapnel that are a constant threat to spacecraft.\n\nExperts say that a traditional satellite mission to go capture each object is not efficient enough to make an appreciable difference due to the high cost of orbit transfers. Many alternate proposals are politically controversial, costly or dependent on further technological advances; therefore, they are not adequate solutions at present, and none have been proven feasible.\n\nDr. Daniele Mortari, professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering, and his Ph.D. student Jonathan Missel are developing a new and creative mission structure that reinvents the way the problem is approached.\n\nTraditional missions plan to rendezvous with each object, capture them softly, and then transfer to the next object. In terms of fuel consumption, these maneuvers are hugely expensive. The proposed mission, \"TAMU Sweeper,\" and the novel satellite design, \"Sling-Sat,\" reclaim the fuel losses of a traditional mission by capturing and then ejecting each object through plastic collisions.\n\nWelcoming collisions strongly reduce (or even eliminate) the need to burn fuel for rendezvous, and ejecting the debris mass keeps the craft light. In addition, the momentum exchanged in the capture and ejection of each object can be intelligently planned to act as a free impulses for the satellite to transfer to the next object, in place of fuel. The free impulses from capture and ejection are both considered in trajectory optimization to maximize their effectiveness.\n\nThe proposed satellite design, Sling-Sat, also exploits existing momentum to save fuel. Debris is captured at the ends of a spinning satellite. Adjustable arms control the angular rate to achieve a desired tangential ejection speed. Timing the release exacts the ejection angle. Through this process, debris can be redirected to burn up in the atmosphere or, by lowering the perigee; the consequent drag increase will then reduce the debris lifetime. Detailed design studies that aim to establish a feasible hardware realization will be conducted over the coming year."

      "text": "New Solar Panels Get Their Power From Light We Can't See\n\nThere is a lot of the light spectrum that doesn't register to the human eye (or to conventional solar panels). A new device which could go right on top of existing panels, helps get more of the energy from the sun.\n\nWhile the sun beats down a lot of light and energy on earth, we can only see a tiny percentage of it. All that light we can't see is the new frontier for solar power. Today's photovoltaics, like our eyes, are designed for the visible spectrum: a good chunk of the sun's energy passes by unnoticed (except as the occasional sunburn).\n\nBut that's inefficient since a standard solar cell will capture, and convert, only a fraction of the solar energy that reaches its surface. The near-infrared part of the solar spectrum--about one-third of what hits the panel--is essentially wasted. Capturing this energy, even at low efficiencies, could prove worthwhile by significantly boosting energy production, as long as the new panels are cheap to make.\n\nResearchers at MIT have now done that. Their first \"all-carbon\" solar cells, reported in Advance Materials this month, uses carbon instead of silicon as the primary material. The cells work by employing carbon nanotubes and C60--also known as buckyballs--to turn infrared light into an electric current.\n\nAffordable large-scale production of purified carbon nanotubes is only now becoming a scientific reality. But with further refinements, carbon-based infrared solar panels could spread throughout the industry (and on to many surfaces). Since the material is transparent to visible light, it can overlay conventional solar cells or other materials. \"It's very much a model system and other groups with help increase the efficiency,\" says Rishabh Jain, a graduate student and a lead author of the study.\n\nAnd MIT's carbon solar cells are not alone in their pursuit of infrared. Researchers have started harnessing such solar energy with dyes and spray-on nano-materials"

These\nfields would stretch outward a few meters and would only affect the\nreceiving--or companion device--which would be outfitted with a\nsecond copper ring tuned to a specific frequency. Team leader Marin\nSoljačić says he began working on the concept because he\nwanted to find a better alternative to having to recharge his\nlaptop computer and cell phone so frequently. He presented the\nteam's findings today at an American Institute of Physics forum in\nSan Francisco, California.\n\nThe technology shouldn't harm other electronics or humans, says\nteam member John Joannopoulos. Computer simulations, he says, have\nshown that the essential mechanism--magnetic resonance--means\nlittle or no power is transferred to extraneous objects, such as\ncomputer hard drives or even magnetic stripes on credit cards.\nJoannopoulos says that \"for certain designs, the effect on a person\nis weaker than the Earth's own magnetic field.\"\n\nAlthough the concept has yet to be verified--the team is\npreparing prototypes that will be tested sometime next\nyear--Joannopoulos says he is confident the tests will be\nsuccessful. \"Our computational experiments have been as close to\nreality as they can be,\" he says. In principle, he adds, \"you could\npower everything in the room,\" and looking much farther into the\nfuture, he predicts that someday this technology could power motor\nvehicles down highways, using transmitters buried in the\npavement.\n\nIt's an \"extremely original\" and \"extremely exciting\" idea, says\nphysicist Mordechai Segev of the Technion-Israel Institute of\nTechnology in Haifa. If the concept is found to be reasonably\nefficient, he says, it \"could revolutionize technology by making\nmany battery-powered products lighter and smaller.\""

      "text": "Posted\nby\nSoulskillon Monday March 28, 2011 @08:05PM from the make-like-a-tree-and-catalyze-the-electrolysis-of-water dept.\n\nsciencehabit was one of several readers to tip news of a sunlight-harvesting artificial leaf, writing:\n\"Nearly all the energy we use on this planet starts out as sunlight that plants use to knit chemical bonds. Now, for the first time, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have created a potentially cheap, practical artificial leaf that does much the same thing—providing a vast source of energy that's easy to tap. The new device is a silicon wafer about the shape and size of a playing card coated on either side with two different catalysts. The silicon absorbs sunlight and passes that energy to the catalysts to split water into molecules of hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is a fuel that can be either burned or used in a fuel cell to create electricity, reforming water in either case. This means that in theory, anyone with access to water can use it to create a cheap, clean, and available source of fuel.\"\n\nThere's only so much insolation to harvest. If this is cheaper and higher efficiency than existing solar cells, then great. Based on the article, it's only 5.5% efficient, so meh. But even if it were 100% efficient, it's not some magical free energy machine, and never can be. While it's true that \"nearly all the energy we use on this planet starts out as sunlight\", a lot of that energy arrived at earth several millenia ago. In the long run, we're going to need to either use less energy (preferably by making things more efficient, not making do with fewer things) and/or get some near-unlimited fuel source, like fusion.\n\nYup, I linked to a page claiming to \"debunk\" this \"myth\" on the basis it would take a solar panel the size of Georgia to power the whole earth. Big deal! Vastly more land is consumed by agriculture. Just reclaiming all the space on rooftops, roadways, and parking lots for solar would account for a lot of that, puttng power generation right where it's needed.\n\nAnd then there's there's the 2/3 of the earth covered by water nobody is making much use of. If cheap solar devices can produce hydrogen, it can be shipped long distances efficiently.\n\nAs you have discovered, the economics are precisely the key to solar energy. The power density (Watts/m^2) is unimportant, except for installations with unique constraints (e.g. spacecraft). For terrestrial applications, Watts/$ is the most interesting term.\n\nSimilarly, for economic reasons, I don't think electrolysis (or H2) is likely to succeed on a wide scale. The dirty secret of the H2 \"economy\" is that the hydrogen fuel cell cycle has a round trip efficiency of about 25%. A fuel cell is effectively a battery, and we already have substantially better batteries at a tiny fraction of the cost.\n\nPeople keep claiming that something the size of Georgia is a sane amount of the earth's surface to cover. You know that agricultural land isn't completely covered with manufactured material, right? Even if it were, how is doubling the human footprint on the planet reasonable? That article really is a successful debunking.\n\nI'm completely for solar energy research, and it can totally make sense for some applications, and why not cover an otherwise unused roof when solar cells are cheap enough. But you just have to look at the energy densities of various energy sources to understand that nukes are it. Nukes are much more sustainable than anything that requires to cover 0.01% or more of the earth's surface with anything manufactured. Nukes aren't perfect, but they're by far the most sustainable, safest, cheapest source of energy, if we could ever act rationally as a species.\n\nI mean, energy density ( isn't the whole story, but even the most pedestrian nuke fuel is four orders of magnitude denser than the most exotic chemical fuel. Five would be a realistic comparison, and then another order of magnitude for more refined fuel, and then another three orders of magnitude when fast breeders become really practical. We're talking about eight orders of magnitude denser energy!\n\nUranium isn't cheap to mine, but it almost doesn't matter, and silicon is not so cheap to refine, either.\n\nSo, I'm no expert, and I'm happy to hear some detailed arguments refuting my back-of-the-envelope ones. But even the most cursory glance at the issue from an engineering perspective says nukes are quite safe enough to be the most sustainable form of energy, even if you use TMI technology and just blow up a nuke plant every 10 years. The energy density, and therefor logistical considerations, are just ridiculously lopsided.\n\nAgain, I'm all for developing everything, and I'm working hard on residential-scale solar myself as a hobby. But basic physics says there will not be a fairytale ending for solar, wind, biofuels, or fossil fuels. Certainly, there will be local niches where each of these will be the right tool for the job, but at the planetary scale, we can do better than evolution. We have harnessed the power of the atom. WTF is wrong with us."

But for analyzing batteries, this limitation actually proved to be an advantage.\n\nRadio frequency fields can't go through metal, but they can take very sensitive measurements on its surface. With lithium-ion batteries, for example, an MRI can show the build-up of lithium ions on the battery's electrodes. These images can be used to determine how safe and functional the battery is. Before now, such analysis wasn't possible without opening and destroying the battery.\n\nMRIs may also be used to improve on battery technologies to make lighter, safer, more versatile batteries in the future, either by changing the batteries' design or using different materials. This method may even be used to develop better fuel cells for storing electrochemical power, such as solar. The research was published in Nature Materials on Sunday.\n\nThis story was also featured on this week's episode of How on Earth on KGNU.

This is not a practical system yet as it is not optimized, but it is proof of concept.\"\n\n\"When we try to use microbial fuel cells to generate electricity, the conductivity of the wastewater is very low,\" said Logan. \"If we could add salt it would work better. Rather than just add in salt, however in places where brackish or salt water is already abundant, we could use the process to additionally desalinate salty water, clean the wastewater, and dump it and the resulting salt back into the ocean.\"\n\nBecause the salt in the water helps the cell generate electricity, as the central chamber becomes less salty, the conductivity decreases and the desalination and electrical production decreases - which is why only 90 percent of the salt is removed.\n\nAnother problem with the current cell is that as protons are produced at one electrode and consumed at the other electrode, these chambers become more acidic and alkaline. Mixing water from the two chambers together when they are discharged would once again produce neutral, salty water, so the acidity and alkalinity are not an environmental problem - assuming the cleaned wastewater is dumped into brackish water or seawater. However, the bacteria that run the cell might have a problem living in highly acidic environments.\n\nFor this experiment, the researchers periodically added a pH buffer avoiding the acid problem, but this problem will need to be considered if the system is to produce reasonable amounts of desalinized water."

By employing cryosurgery to freeze cancerous tissues, it is possible to: (i) destroy tumours residing deep in organs without major resection; (ii) destroy tumours without significant loss of blood; (iii) preserve more of the normal surrounding tissues; and (iv) combine cryosurgery with other treatment methods such as chemotherapy, surgical resection, radio-frequency therapy to significantly enhance the destruction of cancer cells. In addition, cryosurgery offers itself as a viable option for treating cancers that are considered inoperable or do not respond to standard treatments. The destruction of tissues by cryosurgical means involves a complex interplay between a number of different mechanisms of tissue damage. Recently, we have mapped out several directions for further studies. These include: (i) optimising treatment plans for multiprobe cryosurgery in order to realise effective freezing protocols; (ii) designing 'smart' miniaturized cryoprobes whereby the cooling parameters can be precisely controlled based on feedback of biological information such as maximum cell destruction rate, size and shape of the tumour; and (iii) designing of specially shaped cryoprobe tips to \"cryo-sculpt\" irregularly shaped tumours or tumours located on hard to reach regions. With the increasing death toll in Singapore related to cancer, this work has direct and immediate impact on effective tumour treatment. Key results from this research work will assist surgeons in dealing with present limitations of cryosurgery arising from cryo-ablating large and irregularly-shaped tumours.\n\nRenewable Energy-Cogeneration/Trigeneration\n\nThis area of work focuses on clean energy technologies that evolve new hybrid tri-generation systems that produce cooling, heating and electrical power output. The potential for such hybrid systems is enormous, especially in the study of performance of combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plants in a future carbon constrained world. The technologies and know-how will enable Singapore to establish a key position in the global energy marketplace. This is particularly relevant when Singapore is embarking on projects such as eco-cities and sustainable cities so as to gain a competitive advantage building on intellectual capital and skilled manpower.\n\nPresent project aims at novel hybridization of renewable energy technologies that generate heat and power will contribute in the design of hybrid co-generation or tri-generation systems. The specific objectives of this project include: (i) to study the various renewable energy options in order to produce highly energy efficient hybrid systems that meet the cooling, heating and power generating needs; (ii) to design cost-effective hybrid energy systems that are self-sustaining in delivering cooling, heating and power from a single integrated unit without any reliance on power-grid and equipped with the ability to feed back to the grid excess generated electricity; (iii) to significantly reduce the carbon emission quantity; and (iv) to optimise suitable hybrid systems based on the cooling load, constraints and requirements and to design the most efficient and cost-effective systems for implementation.\n\nThis project seeks to develop an enhanced refrigeration cycle based on heat recovery and pressure lift in the compression stage assisted by a jet pump. The fundamentals of the system will be studied and modeled for computer simulation. Extensive experimental work will be carried out to determine the various heat ad mass transfer characteristics of the hybrid system and to optimize the cycle performance. Results of the study will help in the design and operation of energy-efficient heating and refrigerating plants driven by heat recovery and renewable energy."

The circuits could eventually be packed into touchscreens and other consumer devices that would run without a battery or any other source of power, as long as they have a beam of sunlight to harvest.\n\nWhen it comes to energy efficiency, there's still no substitute for millions upon millions of years of evolution. Scientists at UC Berkeley have found a way to hack common tobacco plants to grow synthetic photovoltaic and photochemical cells that can be extracted, dissolved in solution and sprayed onto a glass or plastic substrate to create solar panels. That's the idea, anyhow.\n\nWhat happens when you add 64,000 tiny components to a base of oil and water? Depending on the nature of the components, you might end up with a delectable vinaigrette. University of Minnesota researchers found something even more tantalizing: a self-assembly method that is particularly effective at joining extremely small components in electronic devices.\n\nSuburban rave-goers, women of Jersey Shore, and Elton John, take note: your lives just got a little bit greener. The sartorial risk-takers over at Sandia National Labs have created glitter-sized photovoltaic cells that could revolutionize solar energy collection the way Liberace revolutionized the dress code for concert pianists.\n\nEven as some of the world moves into a future of unimaginably complex technology, many communities still lack the basic electrical infrastructure needed to power even simply electric devices like light bulbs. Unwilling to wait for the wiring to catch up to the demand, Danish researcher Frederik Krebs has created an LED lamp embedded within a flexible, printable solar panel that could replace the kerosene lamps still used around the developing world.\n\nOne of the problems plaguing solar cells is their inability to absorb all of the light they receive. Currently, the bluish anti-reflective coating you see on most cells is 60 or 65 percent efficient, meaning nearly a third of the light is bounced back into the sky. That's because the coating is only able to absorb a narrow range of wavelengths from the sun's rays. Now, however, researchers at the University of Florida and Portland State University think they may have found a better way and their inspiration comes from an unlikely source: moth"

Though a car powered entirely by the reaction of water and light seems\nfar-fetched, the research of Gary W. Brudvig, professor and chair of chemistry, and\nVictor Batista, associate professor of chemistry, may one day make this a reality.\n\nAerobic life on earth is made possible by plants that split water molecules through\nphotosynthesis, thereby releasing oxygen into the atmosphere. The key enzyme\ninvolved in this process is the photosystem II (PS II) complex, whose central element\nis the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). It is here that a series of oxidation-reduction\nreactions involving manganese ions take place, driving the process of\nwater-splitting.\n\nIn the paper they recently submitted to The Royal Society of Chemistry Journal of\nPhotochemical & Photobiological Sciences, Brudvig and Batista present some novel\nideas about the mechanism of water-splitting. One such proposal is that the arginine\n357 residue in the OEC acts as a catalytic base in the reaction—an unusual role for\narginine residues. Using computational chemistry and quantum mechanics, Batista\nhelped develop a model of the OEC, which he then incorporated, using molecular\nmechanics, into a model of the entire PS II complex that closely fits experimental\ndata.\n\nAccording to James P.

Through out my research, I found that phone battery as a power source, it is expensive, consuming valuable resources on manufacturing, presenting a disposal problem and harmful to the environment.\n\nThe concept is using bio battery to replace the traditional battery to create a pollution free environment.\n\nBio battery is an ecologically friendly energy generates electricity from carbohydrates (currently sugar) and utilizes enzymes as the catalyst.\n\nBy using bio battery as the power source of the phone, it only needs a pack of sugary drink and it generates water and oxygen while the battery dies out.\n\nBio battery has the potential to operate three to four times longer on a single charge than conventional lithium batteries and it could be fully biodegradable.\n\nMeanwhile, it brings a whole new perception to batteries and afternoon tea.\n\nYes, cornballer, I see your point. But, you see, the coke part was just to give an example of a commercial drink. That way, people will notice it more. However, the drink doesn't have to be coke, or any soda, for that matter. It could be your leftover tea (if you use sugar). Or you could just make sugar water. I'm glad you raised the point, though, and it should be stressed that that does not create an excuse to by coke. Make your own sugar water.\n\nSugar to water and oxygen plus power, Wow, 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry!

Only see crystal clear water at the end.\n\nNow, this is an interesting, and somewhat viable idea, but I have to say that the whole green debate, as good as the intentions are, is being held for all the wrong reasons.\n\nSure it's a great thing to want to save the planet, but to say we're doing it for the well being of the planet is rediculous. The planet will be fine when we're gone, no matter what we do to it. It will take time, but eventually the Earth will be able to reset itself, and balance out the harm we have done to it. Even plastics degrade eventually.\nWhat we should really be worried about is ourselves. Eventually we are going to run out of the resources needed for us to survive as lavishly as we've become accustomed to. Be as green as you can, its always smart, but do it for the right reasons. Otherwise you just start to sound a bit rediculous after a while.\n\nOne more thing about all of this green/eco-friendly talk:\nWhen someone starts harping about the CO2 emissions from, well, pretty much any source you can think of, please remember that the CO2 in question was either around in the first place (i.e. the fizz in soda, dry ice, etc.) or was converted from some other chemical (oil) and will eventually be returned back to its constituant parts via photosynthesis, or some other chemical function.\nIf you're really concerned about the CO2 content in the air, breath less. Every time you breath out, you're expelling CO2 from your body as a waste product of the energy you consume simply being alive.\n\nSugar based batteries are demonstratable – give it a google. This outlines a phone using such a battery, which is entirely plausible. Turns out, batteries are used to power things.\n\nAs for ecology, what kind of impact does the construction of a battery have on the environment? Is the argument that the production of any/all soda worse than that of any/all commonly used batteries? Is this just an opinion?\n\nCan't believe that out of 68 comments… only 2 people are sensible enough to realize that this is just a concept picture!\nIf a designer would invent the first workable sugar-powered battery, then the thousand of researchers that actually know what they are doing would feel really stupid!\nThis is common misconception of science… things are not so easy: having an idea and actually make it work are two different worlds!\nAlso, instead of taking time to write some widely off track comments that ends up in validating a false claim, people should be a little more critical about what they read and accept as truth.\nFor those dumbasses who still think that such a phone really exists: I have plenty at home, just send me 100$ and you'll receive it within 2 weeks!\n\nHi,\nWe always look for new and strange products to deal with, specially when it comes to protecting the environment. Your product is very interesting. Can we get hold of the product for trade purpose?

Isn't it wonderful how science fiction/fantasy can become reality. Of course if we really cared about the planet we wouldn't be using lithium batteries installed in plastic and worked metal cases just for the convenience of wasting time, we would go visit people in person, not call or text every 35 seconds.\nMost of the 'green' products we see are wonderful, makes everyone think they are helping the environment, alleviates guilt but are they truly green or just a brilliant marketing campaign. What are the costs of making a hybrid car.\nEVERYTHING we use extracts a price from the planet. Basically we are just picking our poison. Paper bags, bad for trees: plastic bags, bad for landfills, now cloth bags, at what cost to grow the cotton, linen, flax, synthetic….\n\nI agree with sue street. a biochemical process that is found in nature to turn sugar into energy is going on all the time in your body.

That is more than enough to power cellphones with power-draining functions like colour widescreens or Wi-Fi and GPS connections.\n\nThe developers hope their suspended-load backpack will be a particular boon for troops, field scientists, explorers and disaster relief workers in remote locations.\n\nThe generator has been developed by Larry Rome and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania, US, with funding from the US Office of Naval Research. Their aim was to relieve soldiers already carrying 36-kilogram backpacks of the need to carry many spare batteries to power their GPS, communications and night-vision devices.\n\n?The extra weight [of the batteries] compromises the amount of food, medicine and armament they can carry,? Rome explains.\n\nUpside-down pendulum\nAn earlier answer to this was the ?heel strike? generator ? a piezoelectric crystal-based device in a boot heel that generates a battery-charging current when crushed by the wearer?s weight on every footstep. But these gadgets only produce power in the region of 10 to 20 milliwatts. A basic cellphone uses between 1 and 2 watts.\n\nSo Rome?s team has worked out how to electrically capture some of the energy a backpack wearer expends when carrying a load.\n\nTheir trick is to make use of the fact that a walking person moves like an upside-down pendulum. ?One foot is put down and then the body vaults over it, causing the hip to move up and down by 4 to 7 centimetres,? he says. And as the hip goes up and down by that vertical distance, so does any load, with the backpack-wearer expending the energy to make it do so.\n\nTo retrieve some of that energy as electricity, the team separate the load-carrying sack from the backpack?s frame by mounting it on a spring-loaded plate that is free to move up and down on rail-like rods.\n\nGaggle of gadgets\nThe result is that as the wearer walks, their hip motion makes the load oscillate up and down (see a video ? mpeg format, 15 MB). To harvest energy from the load?s motion, a toothed rod fixed to the mobile load-plate meshes with a gear wheel on a dynamo fixed to the top of the frame. The load-motion generates a current which can either run a gaggle of gadgets or charge a battery.\n\nIn tests of a prototype, six men carried different loads at varying walking speeds. The backpack?s power output increased with walking speed and with the weight of the load in the pack.\n\nNevertheless, Rome says: ?The suspended load backpack is much more comfortable to wear than a normal backpack, because the springs cushion the load and reduce peak forces. So everyone from the military to kids carrying heavy book bags will be benefit from lower forces.?\n\nHe has now set up a company, Lightning Packs, to commercialise the idea. ?We need to reduce the weight and put in a more efficient generator,? he says.\n\nChris Bonington, the British explorer and mountaineer, currently carries solar panels to charge the digital camera batteries he uses in remote places. ?Whether this backpack is going to be any good depends on how heavy it is to be useful and how bulky it is. I?d really like to try it though,? he told New Scientist.\n\nTrevor Baylis, inventor of the clockwork radio, warns that after events like the London tube bombings, strange-looking backpacks might raise interest at security checks at airports. He abandoned a heel-strike generator he developed in 2001 for this reason: ?With the electronics fixed to the side of the shoe, it made the wearer look like a shoe bomber,? he says. ?Investors didn?t want to know.?\n\nOr you could buy a case of these and put them in a standard backpack.avalible on E-bay now~1XSL5~ CASE OF (5) SHAKE FLASH LIGHTS ~~BATTERY FREE~~\nYOU ARE VIEWING AN AUCTION FOR A CASE OF (5) VERY RARE SHAKE LIGHTS.

The generator consists of a magnet able to slide inside a plastic tube which is wound with an external coil - all you do is shake the magnet back and forth inside the tube in order to generates a voltage on the coil - really simple stuff. It wouldn't work to capture walking motion without considerable modification though.\n\nMaybe something along the lines of a balanced 'neutral line' magnet/keeper/coil system, ah-la Wesley Gary? That might make for a very simple, small, and sensitive energy capture system that is able to couple to normal walking motions.\n\nJoel, I thought of that same thing when I heard this.

It seems to me that the bulk of the flashlight, sans the bulb, would be mounted vertically in the backpack. You'd have a spring in the tube with the magnet, so that the magnet is essentially weightless and would move under the easy bobbing of someone's gait.\n\n_________________ Disclaimer: I reserve the right not to know what I'm talking about and not to mention this possibility in my posts. This disclaimer also applies to sentences I claim are quotes from anybody, including me.\n\nYes, adding some form of counterbalancing spring system to the magnet would be required - as I said, \"It wouldn't work to capture walking motion without considerable modification though.\"\n\nI think a more popular product would involve a device that does not require a large, cumbersome backpack, but rather one that is small and perhaps clips to a persons belt - maybe about the size of a mobile phone?\n\nYes Bill, it would not work without considerable modification and that being \"Lenz law\" Hand shaking will overcome this as it is what is making the energy but walking would not create enough forceable motion.\n\nRemember the trick, drop a magnet down a piece of conductive pipe and wait for it to fall through. Your shaker flashlight works the same way.\n\nRalph\n\nP/S: If you find a way to violate Lenz, Butch Lafonte would like to shake your hand with or without the flashlight. :-)\n\nAll that backpack does is allow the wearer to convert some of his muscular energy into electrical energy. There are other ways to this that would not require the soldier to work harder while marching along. How about some sort of photovoltaic material on the surface of the soldier's clothing that would convert sunlight into electricity that would be stored in a battery built into his belt? He could then recharge his other electrical gadgets by plugging them into an outlet on the belt.Ralph, you seem to be confusing Lenz Law with coil loading - ie: no load on the coil will allow the the magnet to move completely freely. Of course if too much load is placed on the coil it will just lock up (although that probably can't happen with the flashlight system because it uses an air-core coil and also the magnetic coupling is pretty loose).\n\nIt is probable that some here on the forum have accumulated sufficient knowledge regarding the generation, modulation and transduction of angular momentum to effect meaningful leaps in efficiency regarding the ways in which EM induction is exploited.....Should any be so inclined.\n\nThe dynamics at work are a mechanical analogue to some of Gary's observations on a certain level. There appear to be numerous possibilities regarding passive field suppression/swtiching, here.\n\nThe above demonstration is a great launch point for those motivated by it's obvious merits, or even illusory inference as the case may be. As well, anyone who as ever watched vertical window blinds fluttering in a steady breeze and compared such observation to standard wind generators may wish to explore various possibilities.\n\nPeace,\n\nTSYou and I both have been around the block more that once when it comes to magnets and a conductor. So I do not see a need for me to get ambiguous about an open air coil and Lenz. We both know without Lenz there will be no battery chargingGary and I discussed this on his forum about an open coil building a static charge. Problem is if you attach a volt meter you have closed the loop and it is gone if it was ever thereYes, with an open circuit the magnet is free to move unimpeded - it's not doing any work. I also agree that a short circuit is useless for charging a battery.\n\nI'm not talking about an open circuit or a closed circuit. The load should be matched to the supply, as usual.\n\nI happened to have a magnet and a piece of pipe with me the other day.\nI showed it to a friend That had never seen the magnet/pipe trick.\nAfter some time, we picked up a piece of alum pipe. Same result.\nSlow fall rate.\n\n'Then we went over to a large piece of flat alum. It was approx. 4 in. thick,and the surface was very flat.\nWe laid the spear magnet on it and when given a slight push, the magnet did not roll at the normal rate it would if it were just a bearing.\nWhat do you think is going on?\nMy simple theory on the magnets in the pipe is that it is no more than impurities in the material.\n\nYou do not get pure copper in copper pipe. The impurities may be iron.\n\nWheeler, induced eddy currents in the conductive metal produce a magnetic field that opposes the motion of the magnet. Irreversible eddy current heating of the metal is driven by momentum loss of the magnet.\n\nI've saw a similar effect that demonstrates Lenz' Law which used a super conducting alloy disc. In the demonstration, a disc of special super conducting alloy (I think it was a tin/niobium alloy) is dipped into liquid helium and, at that temperature, it loses all electrical resistance and becomes a perfect conductor.\n\nNext, a small cube shaped permanent magnet is dropped onto the center of the frozen super conducting disc of alloy and mysteriously begins floating in the air above the disc! The explanation is that, as the magnetic fields from the magnetized cube penetrate the super conducting disc, they induce electrical currents there that then generate their own magnetic fields that oppose the magnetic fields of the magnetized cube. Because of magnetic repulsion that results, the magnetized cube will continue to \"levitate\" above the disc until the latter warms up and loses its superconductivity"

      "text": "Jul 30, 2012\n\nPanasonic has developed an artificial photosynthesis system which converts carbon dioxide (CO2) to organic materials by illuminating with sunlight at a world's top efficiency of 0.2%. The efficiency is on a comparable level with real plants used for biomass energy. The key to the system is the application of a nitride semiconductor which makes the system simple and efficient. This development will be a foundation for the realization of a system for capturing and converting wasted carbon dioxide from incinerators, power plants or industrial activities.\n\nCO2 is one of the substances responsible for greenhouse effect and as such, efforts are being made to reduce the emissions of CO2 worldwide. The problem of CO2 is also directly connected to an issue of the depletion of fossil fuels. Artificial photosynthesis is the direct conversion from CO2 into organic materials, which can solve both of these problems.\n\nIn the previous approaches so far, the systems have had complex structures such as organic complexes or plural photo-electrodes, which makes it difficult to improve their efficiency in response to the light. Panasonic's artificial photosysnthesis system has a simple structure with highly efficient CO2 conversion, which can utilize direct sunlight or focused light.\n\nFig.2 Experimental picture of artificial photosynthesis system (Left: nitride semiconductor, Right: Metal catalyst) The change of color from yellow to blue on the right represents that the system is actually reducing the carbon dioxide.\n\nWe found firstly that a nitride semiconductor has the capability to excite the electrons with enough high energy for the CO2 reduction reaction. Nitride semiconductors have attracted attention for their potential applications in highly efficient optical and power devices for energy saving. However, its potential was revealed to extend beyond solid devices; more specifically, it can be used as a photo-electrode for CO2 reduction. Making a deviced structure through the thin film process for semiconductors, the performance as a photo-electrode has highly improved.\n\nThe CO2 reduction takes place on a metal catalyst at the opposite side of nitride semiconductor photo-electrode.(See Fig. 1) The metal catalyst plays an important role in selecting and accelerating the reaction. Here, it is noted that the system comprises of only inorganic materials, which can reduce the CO2 with low energy loss. Because of this, the amount of reaction products is exactly proportional to the light power. This is one of the merits in such an all-inorganic system while some conventional systems cannot follow the light power in general because of their internal or external rate-limiting processes in the complex structures.\n\nThe system with a nitride semiconductor and a metal catalyst generates mainly formic acid from CO2 and water with light at a world's top efficiency of 0.2%. The efficiency is of a comparable level to real plants used in the biomass energy source. The formic acid is an important chemical in industry for dye and fragrances. The reaction rate is completely proportional to the light power due to the low energy loss with simple structure; in other words, the system can respond to focused light. This will make it possible to realize a simple and compact system for capturing and converting wasted carbon dioxide from incinerators and electric generation plants.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nImagine being able to use electricity to power your car — even if it's not an electric vehicle.

But they are not as good at converting light into electricity.\n\nIn dye-sensitized solar cells, photons knock electrons from the dye into a thin layer of titanium dioxide, which relays them to the anode. Hu's group found that adding graphene to the titanium dioxide increased its conductivity, bringing 52.4 percent more current into the circuit.\n\n\"The excellent electrical conductivity of graphene sheets allows them to act as bridges, accelerating electron transfer from the titanium dioxide to the photoelectrode,\" Hu said.\n\nThe team also developed a comparably foolproof method for creating sheets of titanium dioxide embedded with graphene. It first made graphite oxide powder, then mixed it with titanium dioxide to form a paste, spread it on a substrate (such as glass) and then baked it a high temperatures.\n\n\"It's low-cost and very easy to prepare,\" said Hu. But not just any recipe will do. \"If you use too much graphene, it will absorb the light in the solar cell and reduce its efficiency,\" he said.\n\nTheir work was presented at the US-Egypt Joint Workshop on Solar Energy Systems, held March 12-14 in Cairo. It was funded by the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund and the National Science Foundation.

The United States Department of Energy has $65 million to spend.\n\nThe funding will go toward research and development on fuel cell components with the goal of reducing costs and increasing reliability of the solid-state devices that convert hydrogen, natural gas or another fuel into electricity through an electrochemical process.\n\n\"The department will be funding research and development initiatives related to fuel cell system balance-of-plant components, fuel processors, and fuel cell stack components such as catalysts and membranes, as well as innovative concepts for both low and high temperature systems to help meet commercial viability targets in terms of cost and performance,\" the Energy Department said Wednesday. \"Applicants will likely include teams of university, industry and national laboratory participants.\"\n\nFuel cells have been something of a stepchild of the green energy boom of recent years. The technology can generate electricity 24 hours a day – unlike solar and wind energy – emit fewer greenhouse gases than conventional power plants and can be plugged directly into the power grid. But high costs and thorny technology hurdles have limited fuel cells' use.\n\nEarlier this year fuel cells burst into the media spotlight when Bloom Energy, a once-secretive Silicon Valley startup that had secured more than $400 million in venture funding, announced in February that it had overcome many of those obstacles. The company unveiled its solid oxide Bloom Energy Server at a media event attended by the Valley's tech elite and the 100-kilowatt fuel cells have been installed a plethora of Fortune 500 companies, including Google, Wal-Mart and Bank of America.\n\nUnlike the bulky industrial look of past fuel cells, the Bloom Energy Server is encased in stainless steel and evoke Apple's design esthetic. The Bloom fuel cells retail for between $700,000 and $800,000 though state and federal incentives can cut that cost in half.\n\nAdobe Systems, for instance, placed a dozen Bloom Energy Servers on the roof of a parking garage in September to supply a third of the electricity consumed by the three office towers in its downtown San Jose, Calif., headquarters. The maker of the Flash media player then bought contracts for methane captured from a Pennsylvania landfill to offset the fuel cell's use of natural gas. Adobe paid the tariffs for the methane to be put in interstate pipelines though the company acknowledged it's unlikely to actually be used in San Jose.\n\nOther fuel cell companies, such as United Technologies Corp. and FuelCell Energy, also have seen sales rise.\n\nAccording to a recent report from International Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy, 22,000 fuel cells were shipped worldwide in 2009, a 40 percent increase from the previous year.\n\n\"A decade of sustained global research, development and demonstration (RD&D) is now producing the necessary technological breakthroughs for hydrogen and fuel cells to compete in the market,\" the report stated."

In particular, they have worked on a light trapping strategy utilizing metal nanostructures that allows plasmons to increase the absorption within the solar cell structure.\n\nNanostructured metals can absorb and intensify light at specific wavelengths. This phenomenon, called plasmonics, has many promising applications: it may be exploited to transmit optical signals through nanosized interconnects on chips, in nanoparticles that recognize and interact with biomolecules, or in solar cells, to increase the light absorption in the cell's photoactive material, paving the way toward thinner and therefore less expensive energy generation. During the course of the European FP7 PRIMA project, imec and its project partners Imperial College (London, UK), Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden), Photovoltech (Belgium), Quantasol (UK), AZUR SPACE Solar Power (Germany), and Australian National University (Australia) gained essential knowledge in the use of metal nanoparticles to enhance solar cell efficiency.\n\nOne of the project achievements was the development and demonstration of a method to fabricate organic solar cells with a plasmonic nanostructured silver (Ag) rear electrode using hole-mask colloidal lithography (HCL). This low-cost, bottom up and extremely versatile technique was shown to be compatible with the fragile organic semiconductors located underneath. The introduction of a plasmonic nanostructured Ag rear electrode resulted in an efficiency enhancement of more than twofold in the absorption tail.\n\nWith respect to wafer-based solar cells such as those based upon silicon, our results indicate that to enhance solar cell efficiency, plasmonic structures need to be integrated on the back side of the solar cells, and not on the front side. Ag nanodiscs on the front side dielectric antireflection coating (ARC) of silicon-based solar cells resulted in an improved light absorption but no efficiency increase, due to parasitic absorption in the nanoparticles and destructive interferences.\n\nA 3D simulation tool was developed, accurately modelling both optical and electrical characteristics of solar cell devices based on inorganic semiconductors incorporating plasmonic nanostructures. The model indicated that gold or silver nanoparticles can enhance solar cell efficiencies at certain wavelengths, while at other wavelengths, the solar cell performance degrades. Aluminum nanostructures, on the other hand, can enhance the efficiency over the entire relevant spectral region of a solar cell due to their intrinsically low light absorption and strong scattering.

      "text": "Video: Electric backpack\n\nIn the days immediately following Hurricane Katrina, radio and phone communication suffered, in part, when rechargeable batteries died and could not be recharged due to widespread power outages. A new backpack design may offer a way for first responders and disaster relief workers to generate their own electricity for communications devices, night vision goggles, water purifiers or other crucial, portable electronics.\n\nAll the person wearing the backpack has to do is walk — the backpack does the rest. The backpack captures energy from the up-and-down movements of its heavy contents and converts this energy to electricity.\n\nThe new research is published in the Sept. 9 issue of the journal Science published by AAAS, the nonprofit science society.\n\n\"I wrote the first draft of the Science paper during the relief effort following the 2004 tsunami. I was struck by continual reports of people not being able to communicate because satellite phone batteries went dead,\" said backpack inventor Larry Rome.\n\nIn light of the power outages that are burdening relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, it's clear that disaster relief workers who can generate their own electricity would be more effective than relief workers without the ability to generate their own power, explained Rome, a biology professor from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA and the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA.\n\nThe backpack looks a lot like the metal framed packs people use to carry their gear during long trips. The backpack captures energy from this movement with a series of gears connected to an electric generator.\n\n\"The idea behind the suspended-load backpack isn't complicated. It just took a person with the right background and a little creativity to put the pieces together,\" said Rome.\n\nRome is an accidental backpack inventor. Much of his research is focused on the muscles that allow fish to swim and frogs to jump. He first envisioned a backpack as a sustainable way for humans to generate electricity from walking when he worked on a project aimed at making a submersible vehicle that swims like a fish.\n\nElectrifying hip movement\nThe side-to-side sway of a person's hips may be more familiar, but it's the up-and-down movement of the hips that can power a gadget that feeds on electricity.\n\nWhen you walk, you put one foot down and then your body vaults over that leg, causing the hip to move up and down by about five centimeters.\n\nIf you are carrying a heavy backpack when you walk, it takes extra energy to vault the backpack over your leg. The new backpack harvests this energy by separating the movement of the backpack's heavy cargo from the movement of the frame.\n\nThe cargo compartment of the new backpack, which was filled to weigh between 20 and 38 kilograms (44 to 83 pounds) for a variety of trials, is suspended by springs and moves up and down with respect to the frame. It is this movement of the cargo compartment with respect to the frame that turns a gear connected to an electric generator that is mounted to the frame. Inside this generator, coils of wire within a magnetic field turn when you walk, leading to the production of electricity.\n\nIn one backpack \"test drive,\" the backpack consistently harvested about 7 watts. For comparison, cell phones, global positioning system receivers, and LED headlamps each use less than one watt. So, it appears that walking with the backpack could allow the wearer to run multiple devices at the same time. The generated electricity could also be used to charge batteries.\n\nAn 80 pound backpack worn by a disaster relief worker or field scientist often includes 20 pounds of replacement batteries, so the new backpack could allow people to carry fewer replacement batteries.\n\nPower walking for real\nThere are many creative, though not always efficient, ways to generate electricity on a small scale. For example, a spinning hamster wheel generates enough energy to power a cell phone.\n\nScience\n\nThis illustration shows the \"suspended-load\" backpack. The pack frame is fixed to the body, but the cargo compartment is suspended with springs from the frame. During walking, the cargo compartment rides up and down (lower inset). To generate electricity, researchers attached a green toothed rack to the \"load plate\" of the backpack (upper inset). When this toothed rack moved up and down during walking, it meshed with a gear mounted on a generator which generated electricity.\n\nEfficiency is a critical issue for any energy harvesting technique. Clearly, carrying a hamster and all its supplies into the wilderness is much harder than carrying a cell phone replacement battery. Similarly, if carrying the new backpack burned huge numbers of calories, compared to a regular backpack of the same weight, then you would need to carry so much extra food that simply carrying extra batteries might be more efficient.\n\nA series of treadmill tests measuring how much human energy it takes to walk with the backpack revealed that the backpack can serve as an efficient source of electricity. It's true that you burn a few more calories when you walk with the backpack than a traditional backpack of the same weight. But, you are generating electricity at the same time, and the weight of the extra food that you must carry is far less than the weight of the batteries that would be required if you didn't have an electricity-harvesting backpack, making this source of energy a \"good deal.\"\n\nLeg vaulting\nThe backpack inventors are still in the process of figuring out why the new backpack lets you walk so efficiently. It appears that your leg muscles save energy during the transition between steps: when both feet are on the ground, your legs are bent and your leg muscles are working hard.\n\nAlso, each leg appears to supports a greater share of the weight of the pack than usual at the \"top\" of each step, when only one leg is on the ground. This leg is relatively straight. During this phase of each step, when the body is vaulting over the extended leg, adding extra weight doesn't make much of a difference.\n\nIt is these subtle differences that could make this backpack more comfortable to wear and better for your back, said Arthur Kuo, an engineer from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI. Kuo wrote a background article that accompanies the new Science research.\n\n\"The backpack's suspension system might make it more comfortable to wear and the gain in comfort might be well worth it, even without the energy-harvesting capacity"

      "text": "Tuesday, June 26, 2007\n\nWhat A Different World, Should This Happen!!\n\nRunning a Car on Salt Water A new method to separate hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water has been discovered by Ohio inventor John Kanzius. This video has been making the rounds, but most who have seen it are skeptics. I think it's worth a look. Separating hydrogen and oxygen from water economically has been one of the holy grails of energy production for a long time. Such separation has long been achieved, but unfortunately, not in an economical manner. Let's see how this new method does.\n\nHow did John Kanzius stumble on his invention? Interestingly enough, he was seeking to cure cancer. His idea was to use radio waves to heat certain metals, like gold. Nano-particles of gold would be injected into cancer patients, and those particles would be attracted to cancerous cells. Next, radio waves would heat those particles and kill only the cancer cells. He did not discover a cure for cancer (not yet, anyway), but he did discover that his radio frequency generator could burn salt water. There are obvious implications, such as powering turbines or engines now running on gasoline, if his solution could work on a scalable basis. When asked what he would do with profits from his invention, his reply was, \"Keep looking for a cure for cancer.\" A Question of Efficiency So far, his method fails, as the article \"Fire From Salt Water\" shows: \"John Kanzius has found a way to burn salt water with the same radio wave machine he is using to kill cancer cells. Kanzius was testing his external radio wave generator to see if it could desalinate salt water, and the water ignited. A university chemist determined that the process is generating hydrogen, which can be burned as fuel. While the phenomenon is interesting, it is not yet practical for energy generation. More energy is consumed by the radio frequency device than is produced for burning. Efficiency-wise, they are presently at around 76% of Faraday's theoretical limit.\n\nConventional Electrolysis Devices such as the Hofmann voltameter have been used to produce hydrogen from water, as the article \"Electrolysis of Water\" shows: \"The Hofmann voltameter is often used as a small-scale electrolytic cell. It consists of three joined upright cylinders. The inner cylinder is open at the top to allow the addition of water and the electrolyte. A platinum electrode is placed at the bottom of each of the two side cylinders, connected to the positive and negative terminals of a source of electricity. When current is run through the Hofmann voltameter, gaseous oxygen forms at the anode and gaseous hydrogen at the cathode. Each gas displaces water and collects at the top of the two outer tubes, where it can be drawn off with a stopcock… \"Plants electrolyze water in the process of photosynthesis with very little energy required using a natural catalyst. If this method were developed industrially high levels chemical energy in the form of hydrogen could be produced at little cost and with absolutely no environmental damage.\" The old problem was generating electricity cheaply enough to make the process energy efficient. The new problem seems to be inability to produce radio waves cheaply enough to make the process practical for large-scale applications. Can this possibly work in theory? Easy to Disbelieve There are tons of Internet articles out there claiming it is impossible. Do a search. You will find them. The one common theme in most of them is the idea that Kanzius claims to have invented a perpetual motion device. Burn water (or, rather, oxygen and hydrogen separated by his device) to achieve energy. What do you get when you burn oxygen and hydrogen? Water. Perpetual Motion Device? Not Really As I see it, he is using radio waves to heat up sodium ions hot enough to cause the hydrogen and oxygen in water to separate. Stop the radio waves and the process stops. That is far from perpetual motion. Can it possibly be that some magic frequency causes salt water to turn into hydrogen and oxygen, producing more energy than it took to generate the microwaves? I am not a physicist, so I simply do not know. But I am convinced that this is both a new method and not a hoax. Proof that it is not a hoax are the patents given to the process. Here is a list of John Kanzius' patents. As best as I know, not a single patent has ever been erroneously given to the maker of a perpetual motion device. But that does not mean this process has any practical application unless the process is efficient enough. So the key question, then, is… Is This Theoretically Possible? The good old formula E=MC2 tells us that there is more than enough energy in the universe for us to exploit. All we have to invent are the technologies that can achieve efficient conversion. Let's now turn to an article I found regarding this process on the Web siteDesalination Research and Development: Update: I talked on the phone to one of the scientists, Ed Apsega at APV Engineering in Akron Ohio. They tested John Kanzius process. I was told the flame burned at more than 1,700 degrees Celsius, or 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. (It's not clear to me currently as to whether the energy yield is more or less than 1:1. Why? Well, the APV Engineering scientist Ed Apsega said the energy yield was much more than 2:1, and later I talked to John Kanzius -- he said the energy yield was less than 1:1.)\" But in a later comment to \"Fire From Salt Water,\" we see this set of replies: June 1, 2007 \"I am in the process of redesigning the electronics for the salt water as to see what efficiency we can achieve. \"Why does everyone think this is a form of electrolysis? \"Some scientists who have made comments on certain Web sites actually understand the mechanism of action. Regarding moving this forward, I want to see what are the best results we can achieve with joules in versus joules out. A chemist in Houston whom I know is going to be doing a couple of things for me this weekend.' -- John Kanzius (June 01, 2007) June 06, 2007John Kanzius writes: Since it appears we now have now achieved more than unity, I am going to do an embargo on releasing all further information. Actually, there are smart individuals who have posted on different Web sites and actually have a pretty good idea of what is happening. Once again, there are two interpretations for those comments. Both are readily available on the Internet. Here they are: Kanzius is not talking, because his device is a hoax and has been disproved. Kanzius is not talking, because he is on the verge of success, if he has not achieved outright success. I cannot say if Kanzius has achieved practical application success or not, but I am willing to say that this is not an outright hoax. I am also willing to suggest that practical application could be theoretically possible. Any physicists out there can feel free to chime in. For those who think Mish is perpetually gloomy, I hope this article proves otherwise. I firmly believe that the free market, if left alone, will eventually solve the energy crisis, and most other problems as well. (Now can we please let the free market handle things?!) Running a car on salt water may be impractical (or not), but running turbines to generate electricity is another matter. Regardless of practical application, we can all admire the spirit of John Kanzius. Everyone but the oil companies and oil exporters can wish him the best of luck in solving this problem Sound"

      "text": "Artificial Leaves Generate Power by Pumping Water\n\nAug 03, 2009 by Lisa Zyga\n\nInspired by water transport in natural leaves (shown), researchers have created a synthetic, microfabricated \"leaf\" that can generate power from evaporative flow. Image credit: pdphoto.org\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Natural leaves constantly lose water through evaporation, as the water in their veins is pumped up to the top of the tree. This process, called transpiration, could also create a mechanical water pump effect in synthetic leaves, and be used to generate power.\n\nResearchers from the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Michigan, and MIT have constructed leaves out of glass wafers with tiny veins through which water can flow. The veins open at the tips of the glass \"leaves,\" where evaporation draws water out of the veins at a rate of about 1.5 cm/sec.\n\nThen, the researchers wired the leaves by adding metal plates to the walls of the central stems and connecting them to a circuit. By charging the metal plates, the researchers created a capacitor made from the two conducting plates separated by an insulating layer.\n\nNext the researchers added air bubbles into the leaf veins to periodically interrupt the flow of water. Every time a bubble passed between the metal plates, it changed the capacitance and generated a small current. The current then passed to an external circuit where it increased the voltage on a storage capacitor.\n\nEach bubble could create about 2-5 microvolts, or 2 microwatts per cubic centimeter.

The advantage of a multi-layer generator is that it produces a higher power than a single-layer generator having the same total thickness. In addition, a lower voltage is required to polarize a multi-layer generator reducing the risk of breakdown during polarization. Moreover, the optimum resistive load of a multi-layer generator is much lower than that of a single-layer generator, which makes it easier to couple to the electrical domain. In this work, it was found, experimentally, that a double-layer generator produces 41.5% and 19.4% more power than a singlelayer generator with the same total thickness of PZT and resonant frequency. This was verified theoretically. The generators have been fabricated by screen printing which is attractive for low cost mass production."

New inventions that convert human power into electricity make that notion a very real possibility.\n\nThink about walking or jogging. The pressure of your foot striking the pavement is a form of mechanical energy. Several engineering groups are successfully building \"heel-strike\" mechanisms that will capture that mechanical energy and convert it into electrical energy. The key to this technology? Electroactive polymers. These human-made plastics generate an electric charge when they are compressed or bent. When placed inside the heel of a boot or shoe, electroactive materials become power generators as each step stretches and squashes them into performance.\n\nMaking these electricity generators function inside the boot heels of soldiers is the aim of engineers at SRI International in Palo Alto, CA, and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, MA. The trick has been to develop a durable material capable of sufficient energy output that can be electronically interfaced with the devices needing power. SRI International has created a rugged electricity-generating material that meets these needs. When engineered into boot heels, the system is expected to generate enough electricity from eight hours of walking to power the wearer's communication device, GPS (global positioning system), and night vision goggles. Engineers at MIT are working on their own microscale version of an energy-harvesting system. It uses a mini-hydraulic mechanism to collect energy from foot pressure. This mechanism then supplies the degree of pressure needed to activate an electroactive material with high electrical output.\n\nBoth the SRI International and the MIT boot generators are months away from field-testing, but prospects look good. This new technology will eliminate batteries, lighten pack loads, and extend power availability. Not to mention—maybe?—be applied to little brothers with excess energy!\n\nVocabulary\n\nhydraulic:\n\nOf, involving, moved by, or operated by a fluid, especially water, under pressure.\n\nActivity\n\nWhat is an electroactive polymer?\n\nWhy are electroactive polymers a useful invention when they are placed inside of a boot heel?

For comparison purposes, these cells could achieve twice the power output of today's most efficient solar cells.\n\nUntil now, these tandem cells have been producible only by using very special, expensive semiconductor materials, and at very high costs. Natcore's process has the potential to allow tandem cell mass production at a lower cost/watt than anything available today.\n\nNatcore envisions its LPD process allowing the manufacture of a tandem cell consisting of up to three cells arranged one on top the other, starting with an ordinary silicon solar cell on the bottom.\n\nSomething called a cell interconnect comes next, then a second cell made of silicon quantum dots. This solar cell is tuned to absorb light in the middle of the spectrum, represented in the picture by the green color.\n\nA second cell interconnect follows and a third cell, another silicon quantum dot device, sits on top. This uppermost cell is tuned to absorb the blue end of the spectrum.\n\nThe combination of all three operating in tandem would produce over 35% efficiency - or about double the output of current technology.\n\nNatcore's edge in this process is the ability to embed the two types of silicon quantum dots in the two cells within a layer of silicon dioxide using our liquid-phase film growth process. All current and recent attempts to create viable tandem cells have used vacuum deposition techniques that are expensive and do not allow independent control over the formation of the quantum dots and the way they are arranged. That is a major disadvantage.\n\nIn fact, Natcore's LPD process is what makes it possible to even consider producing a tandem cell on a commercial scale, let alone in the lab. Not only that, the full device can also utilize our proprietary AR coating deposition process, thereby realizing additional production cost savings.\n\nThrough the combination of these two applications, Natcore hopes to bridge the economic gap between solar power and conventional energy production - an achievement that represents the \"Holy Grail\" of the alternative energy industry."

'For example, we created a solar cell with an active layer of amorphous silicon that is only 70nm thick. This is a significant improvement, because typical thin-film solar cells currently on the market that also use amorphous silicon have active layers between 300nm and 500nm thick.'\n\nThe 'active' layer in thin-film solar cells is the material that actually absorbs solar energy for conversion into electricity or chemical fuel and is sandwiched between layers of dielectric material.\n\n'The technique we've developed can be generally applied to many other solar cell materials, such as cadmium telluride, copper indium gallium selenide, and organic materials,' said Cao.\n\nThe first step is to create a pattern on the substrate using standard lithography techniques. The pattern outlines structures made of transparent, dielectric material measuring between 200nm and 300nm.\n\n'The nanostructures act as very efficient optical antennas focusing the solar energy into the active material. This focusing means we can use a thinner active layer without sacrificing performance.

The lead author is Wonjoon Choi, a an MIT doctoral student in mechanical engineering.\n\n\"One property that nanotubes have is that they conduct heat very, very well along their length, up to a hundred times faster than in metals,\" Dr Strano said in an interview with BBC News.\n\n\"We asked what would happen if you perform a chemical reaction near one of these, and the first thing we found is the nanotube will guide the reaction, accelerating it up to 10,000 times.\"\n\nA nanotube\n\nThe key ingredients in the recipe are the carbon nanotubes, submicroscopic hollow tubes made of a chicken-wire-like lattice of carbon atoms. These tubes, just a few billionths of a meter (nanometers) in diameter, are part of a family of novel carbon molecules, including buckyballs and graphene sheets, that have been the subject of intensive worldwide research over the last two decades.\n\n\"The team found that when a carbon nanotube is coated with a layer of reactive fuel, and then ignited, the result is a fast-moving thermal wave traveling the length of the nanotube. The heat produced by the combustion will then push electrons along the tube, creating an electrical current.\n\n\"The energy produced by this novel system puts out energy, in proportion to its weight, which is about 100 times greater than an equivalent weight of a lithium-ion battery. (Strano said) the phenomenon \"…opens up a new area of energy research, which is rare.\"\n\nDitto\n\nBecause this is such a new discovery, Stano said in an MIT press release, it's hard to predict exactly what the practical applications will be. But he suggested that one possible application would be in enabling new kinds of ultra-small electronic devices—for example, devices the size of grains of rice, perhaps with sensors or treatment devices that could be injected into the body. Or it could lead to \"environmental sensors that could be scattered like dust in the air,\" he said.\n\nIn theory, he said, such devices could maintain their power indefinitely until used, unlike batteries whose charges leak away gradually as they sit unused. And while the individual nanowires are tiny, Strano suggested that they could be made in large arrays to supply significant amounts of power for larger devices.\n\nA reaction wave travels across a centimeter-long bundle of carbon nanotubes in 100 ms, consuming the energetic fuel with which they are coated.

The method is able to bring an entire container of fluid to boiling point, even a container of icy cold water.\n\nThe new method has many potentially very useful applications. These include the creation of very inexpensive and compact devices that can purify water, the sterilization of medical equipment, sewage treatment, and more energy-efficient alcohol distillation.\n\n\"This research opens up a revolutionary new application of nanoparticles in solar energy,\" said Paul Weiss, Ph.D., editor-in-chief of ACS Nano, the journal in which the new study was published. \"The method is based on the use of metallic nanoparticles that can absorb very large amounts of light, which results in a significant rise in their temperature. That's a very useful ability, and has generated a lot of interest amongst researchers. Other potential applications include cancer treatment, \"laser-induced drug release,\" and enhanced bio-imaging.\n\nPrevious research on the potential uses of nanoparticles in solar power technologies has focused almost entirely on using them to increase the ability of fluids to conduct heat. There hadn't been any research done on the abilities of nanoparticles that are mixed into fluids. But as the new research shows, by mixing them directly into a fluid you can create very interesting effects.\n\n\"The new report explains that nanoparticles illuminated by light can quickly rise to temperatures above 212 degrees Fahrenheit, the boiling point of water. Steam forms around the surface of each nanoparticle, billons of which can be placed in water or other fluids. Eventually.\"\n\nThe report documents, in detail, the varying amounts of steam that are generated in sun-exposed water solutions containing different types of nanoparticles. The two types experimented with were a silicon dioxide/gold type and a carbon type. Both solutions began producing steam in 5-20 seconds after being exposed to sunlight. \"The gold nanoparticle solution produced steam in small 'microexplosive' bursts. The scientists used the gold nanoparticles to distill alcohol from water and got higher yields of alcohol than would have occurred by boiling the solution.\"\n\nThe efficiency of the technology is one of its most impressive qualities, over 82 percent of the sunlight that was absorbed by the nanoparticles went directly to generating steam. The overall energy efficiency of the process was 24 percent, and that is without any kind of effort to optimize it.\n\n\"These results clearly indicate that solar steam generation is a process that has significant potential for use in a wide variety of energy- and sustainability-relevant applications,\" the report states. \" WithThe new discovery was just outlined in the American Chemical Society (ACS) journal ACS Nano\"The method is able to bring an entire container of fluid to boiling point without the use of any heat.\"\n\nI think that statement conflicts with something I know as physics!\n\n Zachary Shahan\n\nnot sure how that got in there / where it came from — just updated the sentence\n\nUKGary\n\nThere is clearly an error here in how the process is described.. I would say that in reality what is happening is that a very small proportion of the fluid is heating very rapidly so that it undergoes a rapid phase change whilst making very little difference to the bulk temperature of the fluid..\n\nIf it were possible to construct nano particles to preferentially attach to molecules which it is desirable to separate from bulk fluid, and have the particle absorb heat as described, you could perhaps as an example distil alcohol out of a water based solution by selectively vapourising alcohol with only a small temperature rise occurring in the bulk fluid saving much of the energy which would otherwise be required to heat the bulk fluid.\n\nYou would also tend to have better separation as the bulk fluid which is mostly water would not heat enough to develop a significant vapour pressure."

These cells will come in handy in situations and scenarios where batteries are not available, or cannot be recharged.\n\nUsing a £1.42 million ($2.29 million) grant from the European Research Council, investigators at Leeds decided to focus their efforts on bacterial enzymes. These molecules can use light or hydrogen gas to produce electricity, unlike molecules in other biofuel cells, which use glucose as a power source.\n\nThe research is being led by expert Dr. Lars Jeuken, who holds an appointment with the Faculty of Biological Sciences at the University of Leeds. He is a scientist at the Interdisciplinary Center for Microbial Fuel Cells (ICMFC), at the Universities of Leeds, Sheffield and York.\n\n\"Technology that creates an electrical signal from a biochemical reaction is already in commercial use, for example in blood glucose biosensors. However, developing an efficient biofuel cell that can create sufficient electricity for general use has proved much more difficult,\" the expert says.\n\n\"This is mainly because the systems developed to date have only limited control of how inorganic materials and biological molecules interact,\" he goes on to say. Jeuken adds that the new study combines advanced concepts from several fields of research.\n\nThese include surface physics, colloid and organic chemistry, membrane biology and electrochemistry. The goal is to create electrodes that can exert total control on the biochemical interactions that need to go on inside the biofuel cell so that the latter can produce energy.\n\nIf these devices can be inserted into membrane proteins, then bacteria could become capable of using light or hydrogen gas for electricity generation. At this point, there is no way of knowing when this technology will be brought to the market.\n\nIn the field of microbial fuel cell research, there is currently a trend towards using a combination of synthetic biology and nanoengineering to obtain more advanced devices.

But now, researchers from Denmark have designed an LED lamp that runs on solar cells, which costs less than one-quarter of the annual cost of using kerosene lighting. The solar-LED lamps are expected to last at least a year, making them an affordable alternative to kerosene.\n\nFrederik Krebs and other scientists at the Ris? National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy in Denmark have developed an inexpensive way to integrate solar cells, LEDs, and ultrathin lithium batteries to create a lamp that can produce reading-quality light. The lamp's polymer solar cells and circuitry are printed onto large flexible plastic films, and then the LEDs, flat batteries, and diodes are mounted using silver epoxy. After being encapsulated in a second sheet of film, the sheets are rolled up and snapped together at the corners with metal fasteners.\n\nThe devices are very inefficient by today's standards, capturing just 1-2% of the energy that hits them. Still, they're cheap enough to be practical in some off-grid villages. In rural areas of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, the average household spends $40-$80 per year for kerosene lamps. Even the cheapest solar-LED lighting devices on the market today cost about a year's worth of kerosene, which would not be very advantageous. But the total cost of the Denmark scientists' solar-LED lamps is only about $27, and they think they can manufacture an improved version for about $10. They estimate that using cheaper labor in China could reduce the cost again by as much as 50%.\n\nLast summer, the scientists field-tested 196 prototypes with the help of children who attended a Danish-run summer school in Zambia. The results showed that some of the lamps had problems due to excessive flexing and light quality degrading after 10 to 20 minutes, which the scientists are fixing by repositioning the solar cells and adding circuitry to deliver power to the LEDs at a constant current. The researchers plan to test improved versions of the lamps in Mali and Malawi.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nSolar energy has the potential to improve the living conditions of poor rural households in India as well as contribute to the country's future energy security, according to Professor Govindasamy Agoramoorthy from Tajen University,(PhysOrg.com) -- Although you can buy solar charging devices for rechargeable batteries, it would be even more convenient if batteries had built-in solar cells.

      "text": "Recent techniques developed in nanoengineering have made zinc oxide (ZnO) an ideal material for the growing market of 'energy harvesting' technologies. These devices convert ambient or 'waste' energy—derived from sources as diverse as human power, body fluids, heat differences, vibration, or visible light—into electricity and are a central technology in the future of 'smart' electronics.\n\nResearchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York announced that they have successfully developed a new method of converting waste heat into electricity by altering zinc oxide's material properties. The research team led by Ganpati Ramanath, in collaboration with researchers at the University of Wollongong in Australia, increased ZnO's electrical conductivity (its ability to transfer an electric current) while reducing its ability to transfer heat by baking the metal with aluminum in a common household microwave oven.\n\nUnlike many nanomaterials that are fabricated directly onto a surface, the new microwave method produces marble-sized pellets that can be applied to different surfaces making them adaptable for a wide range of energy harvesting applications.\n\nRamanath said that his team is \"the first to demonstrate such favourable thermoelectric properties in bulk-sized high-temperature materials, and we feel that our discovery will pave the way to new power harvesting devices from waste heat.\"\n\nCurrent commonplace energy harvesting applications have included the application of photovoltaic cells on calculators and roadside electronic signs or bicycle dynamos to power lights or radios. However a number of advances in nanotechnology have expanded the variety and complexity of applications and can now be found powering pacemakers from contractions of the heart to controlling lighting and heating of buildings through temperature sensitive sensors.\n\nZnO and energy harvesting\n\nThe development of these new aluminum-doped zinc oxide pellets offer new opportunities to expand heat to electricity conversion in a number of commonplace electronics such as laptops, cell phones and televisions. These advancements will allow the respective technologies to reduce the devices' energy consumption and enable them to become increasingly self-sufficient – often for years.\n\nBut because of the malleability of the pellet forms, opportunities for larger applications also exist in cars, aircraft, and even power plants. Ramanath says that \"our process is amenable to scaling for large-scale production\", which \"would lead to greater efficiency in nearly everything we do and, ultimately, reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.\"\n\nWhile ZnO's suitability for energy harvesting applications is limited by the specific type of available ambient energy, other thermo-electric materials (those which conduct electricity through temperature difference) have already evolved into a number of prototypes, such as Volkswagen's 2009 concept car which in 2008 was able to increase fuel efficiency by 5 percent.\n\nExpanding ZnO's Uses\n\nThis is not the first use of ZnO as an energy harvesting material. Researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology have successfully developed zinc oxide nano-wires which can be inserted onto the human heart to power other nano-sized devices that detect blood pressure, glucose levels or hypoglycaemia. Expansion of ZnO into larger-scale energy harvesting applications, however, could lead to wider changes in the ZnO market which currently accounts for about 9 percent of the total zinc consumption and is focused primarily in the production of tires, ceramic tiles, medicines and household paints.\n\nZnO is a prime candidate for a variety of energy harvesting applications because of its high electrical conductivity and melting point, as well as being non-toxic and inexpensive. High material prices have been a persistent challenge for the energy harvesting industry in recent years, limiting the use of several materials.\n\nZinc prices have been sliding over the past three months, as three-month forward prices for zinc have fallen from around US $2,500 per tonne at the end of July to just below $1,900 in late October. Further, the persistently high surplus levels of zinc in the world markets make the material a relatively safe and accessible source for expanded applications.\n\nWhile commercial application of the ZnO pellets are still a ways off, these recent developments offer a promising opportunity for the pellets application in a number of markets. While not the only oxide capable of converting heat to electricity, ZnO is positioned to become a competitive and low-cost material in a world which will see nanomaterials play an increasingly important role"

      "text": "I am working on a method of configuring an efficient cell, based on operating voltage. At present, it only pertains to Plates. I have Tubes started but it is going to be more complicated.\n\nFaraday tells us that 1.24 volts is the optimum voltage for electrolysis efficiency, with the least amount of heat loss. That is, 1.24 volts between 2 plates that make a water compartment. Higher voltage results in excess heat. Yule Brown uses 1.48 volts and Bob Boyce uses 2.0 volts. Through trial and error, I have concluded that Faraday's 1.24 volts is impractical when using a 12 to 15 volt power source, because of the amount of electrolyte needed to lower the resistance of the water.\n\nWe know that the cell voltage is obtained by dividing the operating voltage by the number of cells in Series (isolated water compartments located between positive and negative terminals).\n\nWe know that each square inch of a plate surface, on one side, operates efficiently with 0.5 amps of electrical current. Higher amperage, per square inch, increases HHO production, but causes excessive heat.\n\nWe also know that the amount of HHO gas produced is in direct proportion to the amount of watts we use. So more surface area will increase the optimal operating amperage we can use. Surface area can be increased by increasing the size of the plates, and by increasing the number of plates.\n\nWe also know that Hydrogen and Oxygen are produced on opposite plates.\n\nSo now we can use this information to configure an efficient Cell. First, we need to measure the output of our power source. Why? Because it is required in order to figure the optimum voltage between adjacent plates (cell water area).\n\nIf our vehicle's alternator is supplying 13.5 volts, under a load, and we want to try and achieve 2 volts per cell, then we need to divide 13.5 volts by 2 volts in order to get the number of cells needed. If we figure 8, that will be close, 1.93 volts, 7 cells would be 2.25 volts per cell.\n\nNow add 1 to the number of cells and that is how many Plates we will need.\n\nTo make this easy, I made a simple Calculator for you. It lets you enter your operating voltage, and the size of your plates, then it calculates the number of plates needed to achieve the optimal amperage for maximum efficiency with minimum heat loss. Heat is what drives us nuts. We pour on the amps in order to get out more gases. In doing so, we loose operating efficiency by creating excess heat. The configurator also can do plates that have round gaskets. I even made it possible for you to change the number of plates; good for comparison, and good for calculating your old cells.\n\nThe most efficient cell has one Positive plate and one Negative plate, with Neutral plates between them. That is a Series Configuration. The same electrical current passes from the negative plate (-) to each neutral plate on its way to the positive plate. It would look something like this ( - n n n n n n n n + ). The neutral plates cause a voltage drop between plates. It is that voltage drop that we need to calculate for efficiency. Simply counting all of the water spaces, regardless of the number of positive and negative plates, will not cut it if there are multiple positive and or negatives. If the voltage drop in each cell (between positive and negative), does not add up to the value of the operating supply voltage, then you are not doing correct calculations.\n\nSeries Parallel cells have multiple positives or negatives ( - n n n + n n n - ). A Series Parallel Cell is actually 2 Series cells ( - n n n +) (+ n n n - ). They can not be calculated as 1 cell. The reason is, they are 2 cells. The cell voltage is cut in half, every time a neutral is added. No neutrals means full battery voltage or alternator voltage. One neutral cuts that in half. Two neutrals cuts it in half again; etc. etc. etc.\n\nIf your cell has alternating positive and negative plates, you will never achieve operating efficiency\n\n(+ - + - + - + - ). You will always have operating voltage supplied to each cell. That is about as Brute as you can get. It will make a lot of gas and a lot of heat. Plus, the amperage will eat up the positive plates faster than any other configuration. Have you ever seen a Wire cell? Hello ! They make good water heaters. You pour the amperage to them in order to get them to make gas. It does not take long for them to heat up and to deteriorate. What Wire cells do best is create water vapor. It is that water vapor that is providing most of the fuel efficiency increase. It has to be. Wire cells just do not make enough HHO to account for the benefit they provide. (ok Ozie, your secret is out).\n\nSo, now we have come full circle. We started out with Brute Force alternating positive and negative plates. Then we figured out that a series of Neutral plates lowered the heat and produced more gas. Then we figured out how to combine two series cells into one big cell, and how to maximize the efficiency and produce more gas than heat. All along the way, the ratio of gas increased while the water vapor decreased. We did this because the experts warned us to keep the water vapor out of the engine. It is bad for the engine. It will rust the engine. It will rust the injectors. Blah Blah Blah. Hog wash. Your engine was designed to handle the vapor. Modern engines even measure the vapor and adjust to it. So in closing, I will offer one suggestion. If you want to make HHO and or water vapor, start with a safe container; one that can take the Heat."

Each dye, able to absorb a certain wavelength of light, would be deposited on the substrate in sequence; although the plate would look dark to the human eye, a cross-section would reveal a rainbow of colored layers piled on top of one another.\n\nBy layering the dyes, Van Patten and his colleagues hope to capture as much available light as possible -- ultimately, more than can be collected with current semiconductor solar panels.\n\nFor example, a layer that appears green to the naked eye absorbs most of the spectrum except for the green wavelength, which is reflected back to the human eye to be seen. Other layers capture other portions of the spectrum and reflect back the portions that appear to the human eye as the layers' respective colors. To a human observer looking down on the plate, very little light would be reflected back, so the plate would appear dark, or black if it were absorbing all visible wavelengths.\n\nVan Patten and his Los Alamos collaborators are using chemicals that will allow them to build up layers simply by dunking the substrate into a dye solution. This low-tech, low-cost method avoids the use of potentially hazardous organic chemicals common to some thin-film deposition techniques.\n\nThe simplicity comes from the chemicals themselves. In order to build up the layers, researchers coat the glass substrate with a polymer that has positively charged sites. Next, the substrate is dipped into a solution that contains negatively charged dye particles. The dye ions are attracted to the positively charged polymer layer and they stick to it. After the dye layer is applied, another layer of polymer is added and the collector is ready for dipping into another dye solution. The process can be repeated until all dye layers are applied.\n\nVan Patten and his colleagues -- Victor Klimov, Duncan McBranch and Robert Donohoe of Los Alamos's Chemical Science and Technology Division -- are working to perfect the first dye layer. Van Patten and the Los Alamos group are using a dye that comes from a class of molecules called porphyrins.\n\n\"Porphyrins are the same class of dye as chlorophyll found in plants,\" said Van Patten.\n\nThe porphyrin molecule has four negatively charged branches radiating from a central cluster of chemical rings. Van Patten is experimenting with how different metal ion species added to the interior affect energy transfer. In this case, Van Patten and his colleagues are using porphyrins with zinc ions in the center.\n\nWhen light hits the porphyrin, the molecule absorbs a photon and moves to an electronically excited state. Since molecules like to remain at the lowest stable energy level possible, the porphyrin will try to transfer its energy to a neighboring molecule of lower energy, which in turn will try to pass energy to its neighbor and so on - like a line of people passing a bucket of water from a well to a burning barn.\n\nThe idea behind Van Patten's light-harvesting multi-layer film is to get the molecules to pass their energy from one molecule to the next through all the different dye layers until the energy can be passed into a \"trap.\"\n\nA similar mechanism occurs in plants. When a plant porphyrin captures a photon, it passes its energy around to other porphyrins that are clustered around an energy center. Like a pinball bouncing off bumpers, the energy is transferred between porphyrins until it strikes the energy center. The plant then can \"digest\" and use the energy.\n\nZinc-space porphyrins transfer energy well while in solution, but they behave differently on the film. Van Patten believes that part of the problem is the way in which the molecules attach themselves to the substrate.\n\n\"We will experiment with the chemistry of the molecules to see if we can get them to line up on the substrate in an orderly fashion once the substrate is dipped into the dye solution,\" he said.\n\nVan Patten and his colleagues are experimenting with other dyes to see how they behave on a substrate and how well they transfer energy.\n\nIf the Los Alamos research is successful, it may have applications beyond solar collectors. Energy-transferring films could be used in a number of applications, including devices that could use sunlight to transform toxic environmental contaminants into harmless substances.\n\nLos Alamos National Laboratory is operated by the University of California for the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nLaser Tool for Studying Mars Rocks(Sep. 30, 2010) — The NASA Mars Science Laboratory Project's rover, Curiosity, will carry a newly delivered laser instrument named ChemCam to reveal what elements are present in rocks and soils on Mars up to 7 meters ... > read more\n\nHydrogen Storage Gets New Hope(Sep. 7, 2009) — A new method for \"recycling\" hydrogen-containing fuel materials could open the door to economically viable hydrogen-based vehicles.

      "text": "Scientists unlock some key secrets of photosynthesis\n\nJul 02, 2012\n\nNew research led by chemists in the Baruch '60 Center for Biochemical Solar Energy Research at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is seeking to detail the individual steps of highly efficient reactions that convert sunlight into chemical energy within plants and bacteria.\n\nIn a paper published in the recent edition of the Royal Society of Chemistry journal, Energy & Environmental Science, the scientists – led by K. V. Lakshmi, Rensselaer assistant professor of chemistry and chemical biology and scientific lead at the Baruch '60 Center – have provided important information on a specific portion of the photosynthetic process called photosystem II. It has been a major challenge to directly observe the individual steps of the solar water-splitting reaction that takes place in photosystem II, Lakshmi said. This finding provides new foundational research into how plants efficiently convert energy from the sun and could help inform the development of a new, highly robust, and more efficient generation of solar-energy technologies.\n\n\"The photosynthetic system of plants is nature's most elaborate nanoscale biological machine,\" said Lakshmi. \"It converts light energy at unrivaled efficiency of more than 95 percent compared to 10 to 15 percent in the current man-made solar technologies. In order to capture that efficiency in solar energy technology, we must first tackle the basic science of photosynthesis by understanding the chemistry behind its ultra-efficient energy conversion process in nature.\"\n\nThe new research focuses on the first of two photochemical reactions that plants use to convert solar energy into chemical energy that takes place within photosystem II. Specifically, the researchers studied the binding and activation of the substrate water molecules in the catalytic site of photosystem II. Photosystem II is a protein complex in plants and cyanobacteria that uses photons of light to split water molecules. This is known as the solar oxidation of water. The protons and electrons resulting from this split are then used by the plant to fuel the remaining systems in the photosynthetic process that transforms light into chemical energy.\n\n\"Photosystem II is the engine of life,\" Lakshmi said. \"It performs one of the most energetically demanding reactions known to mankind, splitting water, with remarkable ease and efficiency.\"\n\nOne of the difficulties in studying photosystem II is that conventional methods have not yet been able to deeply probe the photosystem II complex, according to Lakshmi, and the mechanism of the photochemical reactions must be fully understood before bio-inspired technologies that mimic the natural processes of photosynthesis can effectively be developed.\n\nIn the new research, the scientists investigated the catalytic site of photosystem II, referred to as the oxygen-evolving complex. This is part of the system that breaks down the water. It does so in five distinct stages. Only the first two of these stages have been investigated in any detail, according to Lakshmi, because the remaining stages are relatively unstable and quickly change.\n\nTo understand the more unstable stages of the process, scientists need advanced scientific tools that can probe these complex systems at the atomic level. For this research, Lakshmi and her colleagues trapped three different species of photosystem II in one of the more unstable stages of the process – the third stage in the oxygen-evolving complex called photochemical S2 intermediate – by using low-temperature illumination of photosystem II. They then analyzed the system using an advanced spectroscopic technique called two-dimensional hyperfine sub-level correlation spectroscopy.\n\nThe tool detects the weak magnetic interactions in the catalytic site to uncover the structure and activation of the substrate water molecules in the S2 intermediate of photosystem II. The technology, found in few labs in the world, according to Lakshmi, identified four important groups of hydrogen atoms arising from substrate water molecules within the oxygen-evolving complex. This is a significant step in determining the fate of the water molecules in the solar water oxidation reaction that occurs within photosystem II, Lakshmi said.\n\n\"Water is a very stable molecule and it takes four photons of light to split water,\" she said. \"This is a challenge for chemists and physicists around the world as the four-photon reaction has very stringent requirements.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process used by plants to convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into the energy-rich chemicals upon which all life-forms depend. The energy trapped in these compounds comes from sunlight, and photosynthetic ...\n\nSplitting hydrogen and oxygen from water using conventional electrolysis techniques requires considerable amounts of electrical energy. But green plants produce oxygen from water efficiently using a catalytic ...\n\nFuture prospects for clean, green, renewable energy may hinge upon our ability to mimic and improve upon photosynthesis – the process by which green plants, algae and some bacteria convert solar energy ...\n\nThomas R. Baruch, a member of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Board of Trustees and alumnus of the Class of 1960, has donated a gift that will help to establish a new center at the Institute devoted to bio-energy research. 3\n\nPhotosynthesis presents a major problem for any evolutionary thought or philosophy in that such magnificent nanoscale engineering does not happen by chance. It further present the problem that photosynthesis had to have been in place before other lifeforms that depend on it could exist. So in order to explain how life arose on earth, those who are currently tasked with explaining how it got here via natural processes will basically have to solve this intractable conundrum first: How DID photosynthesis arise from natural processes, unaided by interference from an outside intelligent agent? Notice how in the article the researchers are focused on the reallife, operational science and how they do not need any evolutionary story to do their work. In this case it's clear: the story of evolution contributes NOTHING to science. In fact, if anything, it's detrimental to progress because people are forced to cow-tow to it's religious demands, thereby being prevented from raising contrary ideas steam"

      "text": "See-through solar cells turn windows into power sources\n\nMany people look at skyscrapers and see symbols of human ingenuity and power. Richard Lunt sees actual power—in the form of electricity. Lunt, an engineering professor at Michigan State University, aims to develop solar windows capable of turning tall buildings into zero-emissions power plants.\n\nEmbedding an electricity-generating solar cell in a window is not a new concept, and Lund is only one of several researchers working on the problem. But existing examples of the technology are either not very efficient (meaning they are not very good at being solar cells) or not very transparent (meaning they are not very good at being windows).\n\n\"We take an approach where we actually make the active layer itself transparent,\" Lunt says. His solar cells use a variety of small organic molecules—some modeled on buckyballs, others on compounds found in plants—to absorb light. \"We can tune these materials to pick up just the ultraviolet and just the near-infrared\" wavelengths, he explains. Because the materials don't absorb light in the visible spectrum, they look transparent to the human eye.\n\nSo far, Lunt has made a laboratory-scale solar cell that absorbs near-infrared wavelengths, generating enough electricity to power a small clock. (1)\n\n\"There's a lot more potential in the near-infrared,\" Lunt says. In part, that's because more than half the photons that reach Earth are in this portion of the spectrum, so it's possible to generate more electricity by capturing a smaller proportion of photons.\n\nMoreover, near-infrared light streaming through windows heats up the interior of buildings; capturing those wavelengths with a solar cell could help keep buildings cool. In fact, manufacturers already put low-emissivity coatings on window glass to absorb near-infrared light—Lunt just wants to make such coatings pull double duty.\n\nOne day, transparent solar cells could be available in the form of a flexible film that building occupants could install on their windows, much like existing light-blocking or privacy films. \"That would make it a lot easier to retrofit,\" Lunt says. And because the materials used in the solar cells are so low-cost and are applied in layers thinner than the thickness of a human hair, Lunt argues that it should be feasible to cover whole buildings with them.\n\nAlternatively, solar cells could be incorporated into the windows themselves, sandwiched in the middle of double-paned glass. They could also be added to other transparent surfaces, such as electronics screens. Either way, the approach gets around one of the bugbears of existing solar technology: installation costs.\n\nLunt's transparent solar cells are only about two percent efficient now, but he has calculated that the approach could theoretically yield devices that are at least 23 percent efficient. (2) So Lunt is currently working to increase their efficiency to at least 10 percent and is also discussing with several companies how to commercialize and scale up the technology."

And through the use of titanium dioxide nanotubes, the battery's operational capacity gradually increases over time.\n\nBut how does this work? As it turns out, the group, led by nanoscientist Tijana Rajh and battery expert Christopher Johnson, discovered that these titanium dioxide nanotubes can \"switch their phase as the battery is cycled\". What this means is that the structures orient themselves to improve the way that energy flows through them. In the video below, you can see the structure \"evolve\" or become less random to improve efficiency.\n\nIn the past, the US Department of Energy and other groups have done related research with nanotubes and graphene due to their unique physical and electrochemical properties. In 2010, The U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory made a unique discovery involving graphene that could allow batteries to charge in a matter of minutes.\n\nHowever, unlike the graphene research where the graphene remains stationary, Argonne's nanotubes are actually capable of self-orienting.\n\nArgonne notes that there is some level of plasticity to the system that allows the structures to move about and therefore improve their own performance. In other words, this new technology is a significant breakthrough because it's a self-improving structure.\n\nAccording to an Argonne chemist, Jeff Chamberlain, this is a highly unusual behavior for a material. As Chamberlain says in the press release, \"We're seeing some nanoscale phase transitions that are very interesting from a scientific standpoint, and it is the deeper understanding of these materials' behaviors that will unlock mysteries of materials that are used in electrical energy storage systems.\"\n\nSo far, Argonne has done a number of tests with the titanium dioxide nanotubes and lithium-ion battery technology that show that the nanotubes not only improve the speed at which the batteries charge, but they also improves the reliability and safety of the batteries.\n\nThe new technology might also be used for sodium-ion batteries in the time to come; one researcher, Sanja Tepavcevic, has already adopted the technology to make a sodium-ion nanobattery. Someday this technology may reach your laptops, smartphones, and other electronic device,s giving you more time to do what you want without forcing you to stand next to an outlet"

Fear not: while working at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, engineer Blake Farrow showed you don't need the far corners of the periodic table to put together a solar cell. Just grab some tea-time staples. (These Are just some steps to give you a general idea on how to do it, if you want more details you can get a full guide on how you can build your own solar panels.)\n\n1. Treat yourself to some powdered doughnuts and herbal tea. The powdered sugar on US-style doughnuts contains titanium dioxide (TiO2 or E171). This is a semiconductor that can be used to make solar cells. To extract the TiO2 in a useful form, first scrape off all the powder and put it in a cup of warm water. Stirring this will dissolve all the sugar (there is a lot of it).\n\n2. Running the whitish water through a coffee filter will leave behind a white blob -- this is the precious TiO2, along with some unwanted fat.\n\n3. Because the fat is useless for solar cells, you'll need to put the residue in a hot oven for a few hours to vaporise it. The TiO2 remains as nanoparticles, each around 100nm wide.\n\n4. Throw these particles into high-proof ethanol (vodka will do: use 1ml per doughnut) and shake.\n\n5. Now conductive glass is needed (tough to find, but indium-doped tin oxide is best). With an eye dropper or syringe, drop ten layers of the nanoparticle spirit on the glass, allowing it to dry with each layer. Then put it back in the oven.\n\n6. This is now a solar cell, but it will work only with UV light (the bad kind). Here is where the tea comes in. Leave the nanoparticle solar cell sitting in a cup of hibiscus tea for a couple hours, and soon it will have absorbed the colour, shifting its useful range from UV (useless) to visible light.\n\n7. To collect energy from this solar cell, you'll need a counter-electrode. Take another piece of conducting glass and use a dark pencil to cover the surface with graphite.\n\n8. To get your electricity to your counter-electrode, a generous amount of iodine in high-proof alcohol works well as an electrolyte. Use one part alcohol to three parts Lugol's solution -- available from health stores and aquarium suppliers.\n\n9. Cut a hole in some thin plastic or tape to use as a spacer, and place it on the nanoparticle cell. Drop some electrolyte on top, and quickly sandwich the two electrodes together with some bulldog clips.\n\n10. You're done! A multimeter connected to both of the conducting electrodes should show about half a volt when in the sun.\n\nDid you know there is a cost effective way to create your own electricity? How is this possible you might be asking? This can be done simply, by building your own residential renewable energy source. Solar power is a very efficient source of natural power supply that will give you unlimited power from the sun. It is so cost effective that if you should create more energy than you need for your home, you can sell that excess energy back to your electricity company. This article will show you how you can create your own inexpensive solar renewable energy to power you home.\n\nAll you will need to buy is a couple of solar cells in order to create your own solar panels. You will also need to buy one or several auto batteries, according to the amount of electricity you plan to generate. The same goes for the solar cells; you will need to buy according to the amount of power you plan to generate.\n\nYou will also need to buy an AC to DC electricity inverter. This is necessary because the power type that will be generated from the sun to your solar cells will be DC, but since most of the appliances in your home require AC to work, an electricity inverter will be important.\n\nA charge controller will also be necessary, you can always go out and get one at an electrical store. This will be important to regulate the charge of the batteries in order to maintain a steady flow of electricity to power your home.\n\nSome good length of electrical wires will also be needed to connect your solar system together, which you can pick up at any electrical store.\n\nBuilding a residential solar system may seem to be a very hectic task, but in actuality, it won't be very difficult if you have a good DIY guide that you should have no problem finding if you search Google. Building your own solar system is safe and will save you a whole lot on the cost of electricity than it would cost to buy an entire unit.\n\nWhat I've shared with you in this article, are just the major components that you will need in order to build your own inexpensive solar system. But you will need to get a DIY guide so you have a step-by-step manual to follow, which will give you all the other parts you will need, and will make the process a lot easier. Get your Guide now on how to build your own solar panels\n\nFinally after a hundred years, the suppressedfree energy deviceis exposed in public. People will be taught on how to utilize this hundred-year old device to produce electricity for free. The fact is that people can now discover using energy that is 100 percent free at their home through this device invented. The revelation about this device also unveils other benefits that it can offer.\n\nThe free energy device is invented to let the consumers become aware that there is another possible way to solve electrical consumption problems. By simply using this device, people can save maximum energy without the requirement of gas, coal, oil or any other fuel. After a hundred years, the energy device is prepared to pave way to new concepts and ideas about energy saving.\n\nThis free energy device is invented by a genius named Nikola Tesla, the one who discovered the electricity which people are using today. In 1934, Tesla had stated a shocking statement that electric power can be everywhere and it is available in limitless quantities. It can power the world's machinery without using gas, oil, coal or any other types of fuel.\n\nAccording to Nikola Tesla, people can possibly get unlimited amounts of energy for free whenever they want. Through the announcement he made, many people got more curious and interested in finding the real essence of using this free energy device. The exposure of this device is also a way to recognize the efforts and thoughts made by Tesla for so many years.\n\nThe suppressed free energy device that is now exposed is amazingly useful for every individual on earth. Through other people's analysis of Tesla's papers, new conclusions were made and it opened the door to opportunities to recognize his inventions especially the free energy device. Tesla explained how the free energy device works and how people obtain free electricity.\n\nSome people who have already encountered this free energy device stated their personal views and below are some of their testimonials:\n\n\"The first time I heard about the unreleased project of Nikola TeslaI was really interested in knowing more. At first I thought it was just a scam. How could electricity be free and how could this machine generate electricity by itself? Anyway, given that it was so cheap I tried it, and it worked! I built a bigger generator that cost me less than $100, and the effort paid off really well. Now I have my own source of free energy.\" – Mike John\n\n\"Nikola Tesla Secret is revolutionary. I became instantly intrigued and decided to give it a try (given that it carried a money back guarantee) Now, whenever I look at my electric bill, I cannot take the smile off my face! My electricity bill comes in the form of a credit – the power company is paying me for the extra electricity that I sell them.\" – Tom Victor of Texas, United States. Click Here to Visit Nikola Tesla Secret Official Site this process, here are some common prepping mistakes you'll want to avoid:\n\nNot having a survival library. Books are less common these days because we do so much reading on the Internet and Kindles. But if the power goes out, having a good collection of survival books could save your life. They'll give you something to read when you're bored, and will have important instructions on things like purifying water, building fires, and medical care. While you want to learn as much of this info as you can ahead of time, no one can know everything, and there are bound to be times when a survival library will come in handy. Check out the Books section and also read the article, Best Books on Survival.\n\nFocusing on supplies instead of skills. Of course, just because you have all the best books on survival doesn't mean you shouldn't bother to learn survival skills. It's possible your books will be destroyed or you won't be able to get to them. The same rule applies to your survival food and gear. What if you're at work when your home is destroyed by an explosion, earthquake or some other disastrous event? Would you still have the skills to survive, or are you completely dependent on your food and gear?\n\nNot having enough water preps. I cannot overemphasize the importance of water. There are many survivalists who have six months of food and only two weeks of water on hand. Considering that you can survive without food about ten times as long as you can survive without water, you'd be better off with two weeks of food and six months of water. Don't do that either, but at least make sure your water will last as long as your food. If you don't have enough room for that much, there are many ways to collect and purify water. Visit the Water category.\n\nNot having enough variety in food supplies. Too many new preppers buy nothing but rice, beans, flour, salt and sugar. If that's all you have to eat after a disaster, you're going to be miserable. Your body will have trouble adjusting to the new bare-bones diet and you'll suffer from food fatigue, where your survival food won't be appetizing even when you're very hungry. Make sure you buy the ingredients for a variety of possible meals so you'll feel satisfied every time you eat. This leads to my next point…\n\nNot eating what you store. This was the first mistake I made when I started stocking up on food. I bought all kinds of food, sealed it up, put it in the closet, and forgot about it. Inevitably, some of my food went bad and I had to throw it out. It's important you store what you eat and eat what you store. If you're not sure how to cook meals from the basic ingredients, I'd recommend getting some cookbooks and a guide like Emergency Food Storage & Survival Handbook which has a lot of great recipes.\n\nNot having enough vitamins. Personally, I think everyone should be taking multivitamins since most modern diets don't provide the nutrition we need, but this will be even more important in a survival situation. The stress of having your life turned upside down, constant threats to you and your family, and manual labor will take a lot of energy and tax your immune system. Vitamins will help keep you strong and healthy, especially Vitamin C.\n\nRelying only on food storage. While the last few points have been about food, don't forget all your other survival needs. When a lot of people think of prepping, the first things they think about are food and water and they proceed to stock up on them while neglecting health and beauty supplies, first aid kids, bug out bags, cooking implements, clothes, weapons and other important items. While food should be your first priority, don't forget your other priorities.\n\nRelying only on an arsenal. At the other end the spectrum, there are some preppers who focus all their attention on guns and ammo. The reasoning is that not only will they be able to protect themselves, they'll be able to hunt their food and trade ammo for other supplies. This is unrealistic, especially if you're in or near a city. The little bit of wildlife in your area will be picked clean by others, and most people won't be interested in your ammo as they, like you, will be looking to trade for food and other vital supplies. Sure, have some weapons for self defense, but don't go overboard.\n\nNot taking care of pets. As much as we all love our pets, for some reason it's easy to forget that they need preps, too. Animals require more than just food and water. Check the article, Pet Survival Kit.\n\nPlanning on bugging out. Although having a bug out bag and a vehicle survival kit is important, unless you have advance warning of a disaster it will be very difficult to get from your home to your bug out location. The streets will be congested, roads and entire areas could be inaccessible, and gas could become unavailable. That's why I think it's so important to be ready to shelter in place.\n\nScientific journals, by their very nature, ought not to be biased towards a particular point of view because such bias can lead that journal's editorial staff to quash or ignore any legitimate scientific research and data refuting any pre-determined viewpoints.\n\nAnd yet, as reported online by Earth Open Source, it appears as though the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology may have compromised itself recently by hiring a biotechnology insider who, on the surface, would sure seem to have a pro-industry prejudice.\n\nFrom the website:.\n\n'I am shocked by the extreme negative health impacts'\n\nThe report noted that both Monsanto and genetically modified foods experienced a rash of bad publicity following the September 2012 publication of a study in the journal citing evidence that GM corn and Roundup both caused organ damage and were linked to increased rates of tumors and premature deaths in rats\n\nThe study was the first of its kind; it examined \"the long-term effects of Monsanto's Roundup weedkiller\" and \"the NK603 Roundup-resistant GM maize also developed by Monsanto,\" Britain's widely popular food publication, The Grocery, reported.\n\n\"This research shows an extraordinary number of tumors developing earlier and more aggressively - particularly in female animals,\" said Dr. Michael Antoniou, a molecular biologist at King's College London, who was involved in the study. \"I am shocked by the extreme negative health impacts.\"\n\nDespite the publication of this data, FCT decided earlier this year to add Richard E. Goodman, a former Monsanto researcher with close biotech industry ties, to its senior editorial staff. \"Goodman was given the specially created position of associate editor for biotechnology,\" Earth Open Source said.\n\n\"Goodman's fast-tracked appointment straight onto FCT's upper editorial board raises the question of whether Monsanto is now effectively deciding which papers on GM foods and crops should be published and which should not,\" Claire Robinson, research director at the science policy platform Earth Open Source and a co-author of the new article, said.\n\nCensoring conflicting data\n\nAccording to Robinson, Goodson's appointment is only the latest in a string of cases in which biotech insiders have either attempted to control the publication of conflicting data or prevent it from seeing the light of day at all.\n\nWhen data wasn't being censored or controlled, some scientific journals let hacks savage dissenting scientists whose conflicting research was belittled or otherwise called into question when it revealed problems with GM foods. And in many cases, the insider critics never revealed to readers their ties to the biotech industry, and editors did not force them to do so.\n\nWhere is scientific and journalistic integrity when you need it?\n\n\"Unfortunately, the public and the scientific community can no longer trust that peer-reviewed journals reflect the true state of scientific knowledge,\" said Dr. Jonathan Latham, executive director of the nonprofit Bioscience Resource Project and co-author of the new article. \"Some journals have become a vehicle for a narrow interest group - biotechnology corporations - to control scientific discourse.\n\nBoth authors noted that this recurring problem within scientific publishing circles is indicative of a wider issue within the scientific community, and that is that it is increasingly dependent upon industry funding. As long as Monsanto is footing the \"research\" bill, for example, the public will be denied access to any data that would refute, embarrass or otherwise harm Monsanto's business. How's that for ethics?\n\n\"Conflicts of interest have become the defining problem of modern science and limiting them amongst public sector scientists has become a fundamental necessity,\" they write.\n\nIt sometimes seems as if our planet has no secrets left – kilometers – the Vostok station. It soon became a byword for hardship – –Join our Facebook page \n\nWhat is the pineal gland?\n\nThe pineal gland is a small endocrine gland in the brain, it is located between the two hemospheres in the brain. It produces melatonin, a hormone that affects wakefulness/sleeping patterns, regulates the puperty in females and helps to protect the body from cell damage caused by free radicals.\n\nThe pineal gland is linked to the third eye or the \"all seeing eye\". It has been a very popular aspect in human history, represented in the form of an eye in Roman Catholic, Egyptian and other ancient art. Activating the third eye allows a person to enter their subconsious mind that modern-day scientists claim we do not use. It also aids in yoga, meditiation, enables a person to travel to other dimensions (known as astral travel or astral projection) if it is tuned into the right frequencies.\n\nHow your pineal gland is being blocked.\n\nIn the 90's, Jennifer Luke carried out a study on how fluoride affects the pineal gland in the brain. She found that flouride accumulates in the pineal gland in shockinghy high levels, more than in any other part of the body. This contradicts the dentists' claims about fluoride being good for the teeth and bones. Fluoride is found in 90% of the US water supply, including food and brewages from the market. It is much less common in Europe and Asia. Here is a list of bottled water without fuoride added:  However, there has been a reasonable amount of controversy about the safety of bottled water. The best way to get sodium fluoride from your water is to buy a reverse osmosis machine or water distiller. Or perhaps drink fruit juice instead? (That was a joke). Also, use fluoride-free toothpaste (available in organic/health stores). Some people say that by drinking distilled water you are not getting the minerals needed by your body that are normally found in spring or mineral water. Fluoride, as a natural element is needed by the body in small amounts, but the sodium fluoride that you commonly find in your tooth paste and water is a chemical waste product of the alluminium and fertilizer industries. In fact, it is considered toxic and it is the only ingredient found in rat poison!\n\nThere have been many other health problems linked to fluoride. These include:\n\nToxicity\n\nArthritis\n\nBone fracture\n\nDental fluorosis (another contradiction of the dentists' claims)\n\nCancer\n\nLowering of IQ\n\nKidney problems\n\nInfertility\n\nAnd many others.\n\nSo why would they want to poison us with this toxic chemical? Well, as you know the authorities want us to be their mind slaves with no independent thought and they are achieving it by blocking our pineal gland. Not giving us a chance to activate our \"all seing eye\".\n\nEither way, I would suggest to avoid sodium fluoride in every way possible, protect your pineal gland and continue to expand your consiousness through the third eye. I suggest research on sodium fluoride and how it was first used by nazi's in concentration camps. Also, about the third eye to gain a higher level of consiounsess.\n\nGoogle's tiny, pugnacious search rival DuckDuckGo is using advertising to warn people about advertising. It bought a billboard in L.A. for a cool $7,000 and posted this anatidaephobic ad that says, \"Google tracks you. We don't.\" The issue, says DuckDuckGo founder, coder and sole employee Gabriel Weinberg, is that Google sends along your search query to the sites you visit. That means advertisers and other unsavory people will know you got there by searching \"transvestite cuties.\" I use that example because I'm guessing the objection is that amoral advertisers could find out about your penchants and use them against you. Sometimes I think people overestimate how much marketers and advertisers care about their personal lives. I'm not saying they don't care. It's just that they care about really specific things, which, in the case of all the brands I know, aren't salacious or even mildly interesting to anyone else. Besides, Google only sends information about the specific search that led you a site. You can type \"goat sex\" 80 times into Google, but when you search for \"cool watches\" and land on Tokyo Flash's site, Google only tells Tokyo Flash that you searched for \"cool watches.\" It doesn't mention goat sex or that other search you did on monkeys who drink their own pee. And even if it did, Tokyo Flash won't embarrass you by buying up BillHendersonLikesGoatSex.com. Still, DuckDuckGo's queries have jumped to about 5 million a month after getting some attention for its lack of tracking. Can somebody please tell America that advertisers don't wake up in the morning and perv-search terms in order to start some office betting pool on who you'll be dating next?\nJoin our Facebook page \n\nThis past week, the Justice Departmentannounced that HSBC Bank had agreed to forfeit $1.256 billion and \"enter a deferred prosecution agreement\" for engaging in money laundering that involved the financing of drug cartels and groups with ties to terrorism. The agreement indicated there would be no criminal prosecution. Not one bank executive or lower-level banker would be put on trial and possibly sentenced to jail for his or her role in allowing money to be transferred to drug cartels or terrorists.\n\nMeanwhile, that same day, Nima Ali Yusuf, 26, a Somali woman who fled war-torn Somalia when she was a child, was sentenced to eight years in prison for sending $1,450 to \"members of a terrorist organization in her native country.\" The scale of the crime committed by Yusuf, who pled guilty to charges just over a year ago in December 2011, is incredibly minor and insignificant when compared to the acts engaged in by bank executives at HSBC.\n\nLaid out in detail in a Senate report released in July of this year, HSBC was engaged in banking with the Al Rajhi Bank, which is run by members of the Al Rajhi family alleged to have been \"major donors to al Qaeda or Islamic charities suspected of funding terrorism.\" They established \"their own nonprofit organizations in the United States that sent funds to terrorist organizations, or used Al Rajhi Bank itself to facilitate financial transactions for individuals or nonprofit organizations associated with terrorism\" in the years after the September 11th attacks, according to the report.\n\nIn March 2002, the US Treasury Department conducted a \"search of 14 interlocking business and nonprofit entities in Virginia associated with the SAAR Foundation, an Al Rajhi-related entity and the Al Rajhi family.\n\nAs outlined in the Senate report:\n\nThe SAAR Foundation is a Saudi-based nonprofit organization, founded by Sulaiman bin Abdul Aziz Al Rajhi in the 1970s, named after him, and used by him to support a variety of nonprofit endeavors, academic efforts, and businesses around the world. In 1983, the SAAR Foundation formed a Virginia corporation, SAAR Foundation, Inc., and operated it in the United States as a tax-exempt nonprofit organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. tax code. In 1996, another nonprofit organization was incorporated in Virginia called Safa Trust Inc.These and other nonprofit and business ventures associated with the Al Rajhi family shared personnel and office space, primarily in Herndon, Virginia. In 2000, SAAR Foundation Inc. was dissolved but the Safa Trust continued to operate.\nAn affidavit filed by the United States in support of the search warrant alleged that the Safa Group appeared to be involved with providing material support to terrorism. Among other matters, it alleged that members of the Safa Group had transferred \"large amounts of funds …directly to terrorist-front organizations since the early 1990's,\" including a front group for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad-Shikaki Faction, a designated terrorist organization. but the Safa Trust continued to operate. It also detailed a $325,000 donation by the Safa Trust to a front group for Hamas, another designated terrorist organization.In addition, the affidavit expressed suspicion about a transfer of over $26 million from members of the Safa Group to two offshore entities in the Isle of Man. The affidavit further alleged that \"one source of funds flowing through the Safa Group [was] from the wealthy Al-Rajhi family in Saudi Arabia.\"\nThe search produced about 200 boxes of information which was then analyzed and used in other investigations and prosecutions, although neither the SAAR Foundation or Safa Trust has been charged with any wrongdoing. In 2003, Abdurahman Alamoudi, who had worked for SAAR Foundation Inc. from 1985 to 1990, as executive assistant to its president, pled guilty to plotting with Libya to assassinate the Saudi crown prince and was sentenced to 23 years in jail. He had also openly supported Hamas and Hezbollah, two terrorist organizations designated by the United States.According to an affidavit supporting the criminal complaint against him, Mr. Alamoudi admitted receiving $340,000 in sequentially numbered $100 bills from Libya while in London, and planned \"to deposit the money in banks located in Saudi Arabia, from where he would feed it back in smaller sums into accounts in the United States.\" According to the affidavit, he also admitted involvement in similar cash transactions involving sums in the range of $10,000 to $20,000.\n\nAdditionally, a key founder of the Al Rajhi Bank was one of twenty key terror financiers Osama bin Laden dubbed the \"Golden Chain.\"\n\nThe small sum of money Yusuf is alleged to have provided pales in comparison to the transactions highlighted above, which HSBC is believed to have enabled in part through its business with the Al Rajhi Bank.\n\nYusuf wrote a letter to the judge seeking to explain her contributions saying they were \"motivated by a desire to provide food and medical care for those in need.\" Her attorneys backed her up on this saying she had wanted to help \"friends with living expenses and debt relief\" and never intended to provide \"direct support\" to any members of al-Shabaab.\n\nAccording to her lawyers, Yusuf \"discouraged the young men from engaging in martyrdom operations, such as suicide attacks but was otherwise supportive of their willingness to give up everything to fight against the Ethiopian troops and the transitional federal government of which she herself had been a victim.\" (Her lawyers suggest she was sympathetic to al Shabaab, even if she opposed certain tactics of fighting.)\n\nIn December 2010, Yusuf was one of four Somalis being prosecuted for giving money to people in Somalia. Local Somalis skeptical of the prosecutions, like Bashir Hassan, expressed the feeling that the government was criminalizing Muslims.\n\nHassan urged federal prosecutors to understand that \"most Somalis here regularly send money to their homeland.\" He added, \"People are starving. People don't have food to eat. So if you have some extra bucks, you better send them so they can survive. So sending money is something routine to our community.\"\n\nAn attorney defending an imam charged with supporting al Shabaab in Somalia declared, \"I think Islamic giving, because that's part of the religion, has given difficulties to the government because they don't know how to deal with this…How can we stop Muslims from giving money? Because we really can't attack their religion directly because that would blow up in our face.' And I think these are politically motivated cases because really the government I don't think wants Muslims to give.\"\n\nThere does not appear to have been any intent to support the terrorism of al Shabaab proven in Yusuf's case, but all the prosecutors had to prove was there was a transaction where money likely wound up in the hands of Shabaab fighters and that was enough for a conviction. In contrast, in the case of HSBC one wonders what the bank would have had to do to be prosecuted criminally for their actions and have executives go to jail. The Justice Department found they had violated the Trading with the Enemy Act—the act a bank would be convicted of violating if they were financing or providing material support to terrorism. Whether they intended to violate these acts or not, they did commit violations so at least some from HSBC should be facing the prospect of being sentenced to jail.\n\nWhat if any of the HSBC bank executives involved in allowing or looking the other way had been Muslims?\n\nIn a 2009 report by the American Civil Liberties Union, the discriminatory enforcement against Muslim charities was highlighted the US government crackdown on Muslim charities for giving money to troubled areas where terrorism activities were believed to be occurring:\n\nWithin the space of ten days in December 2001, the federal government froze the assets of the three largest Muslim charities in the United States—the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, Global Relief Foundation, and Benevolence International Foundation—effectively shutting each of them down. The government seized these charities' assets during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, at the height of annual Muslim charitable giving. These charities, which had been operating without incident for years—and for over a decade in the case of the Holy Land Foundation—were not on any government watch list before their assets were frozen. Indeed, before it was shut down the Holy Land Foundation had made repeated requests to government officials for assistance in complying with the law, only to be rebuffed.\n\nThe ACLU characterized this crackdown as the \"start of a pattern of conduct that violated the fundamental rights of American Muslim charities.\" And it \"has chilled American Muslims' charitable giving in accordance with their faith, seriously undermining American values of due process and commitment to First Amendment freedoms.\" (The Holy Land Foundation case is particularly egregious. Five individuals are in prison now and their cases can be read about here.)\n\nDepending on one's ethnicity, religion, class or occupation, the system of justice (or injustice) in America is now that a major bank can settle for what in HSBC's case was, according to Matt Taibbi, about two months' worth of profits when they engage in terrorist financing or banking where money is being transferred to drug cartels.\n\nExecutives can expect pretty \"swift justice\" too. The Senate report that created headlines was put out in the summer and in less than six months the Justice Department had an agreement with a settlement worked out. Yusuf was charged in 2010, pled guilty about a year later and then was in confinement for another year before being sentenced for 8 years for giving a little over a thousand to some poor people she knew and wanted to help in Somalia, the country where she was born.\n\nThe overwhelming conclusion one can draw is there is no limit to the political will the Justice Department or Treasury Department has to crackdown on Muslims for charity. They will go to immeasurable lengths to conflate giving with financing of terrorism. Jewish and Christian organizations give to countries with ongoing conflicts in ways similar to Muslim organizations and do not face government prosecutions. On the other hand, the Justice Department and the Treasury Department have no political will to hold banks accountable for crimes of terrorist financing with groups that have ties to al Qaeda. They will bend over backwards to ensure there is an outcome where the bank appears to be brought to justice but is not broken in such a way that it cannot continue business as usual.\n\nSyrian warplanes have attacked a Palestinian refugee camp close to Syria's capital city, Damascus, killing eight, activists report. The camp not only hosts Palestinians, but also Syrians displaced by the country's ongoing conflict.\n\nThe UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that at least eight people died when at least one rocket struck a mosque that houses refugees who had fled from the fighting in Damascus.\n\n\"Warplanes staged an air strike on an area near Al-Bassel hospital… in al-Yarmuk camp, hurting several people,\"said the Observatory. They added that \"the toll may rise, because several of the injured are in a critical condition.\"\n\nA video allegedly filmed by a witness shows several dead bodies sprawled in what appears to be a mosque yard in al-Yarmouk. The surrounding streets were covered with shattered glass and blood stains. The video was uploaded to youtube by QudsNetwork, a Palestinian news outlet, but cannot be independently verified.\n\nAl-Watan daily reports the area erupted in violence Sunday as government troops clashed with opposition forces. The edition says Palestinian self-defense forces support pro-Assad fighters. Other sources insist Palestinians are divided over the conflict and can be found fighting on both sides.\n\nThe most powerful earthquakes in the history of the United States happened along the New Madrid Fault in 1811 and 1812. Those earthquakes were reportedly felt more than 1,000 miles away. Scientists assure us that one day we will once again see very powerful earthquakes along the New Madrid fault.\n\nIt is only a question of when it will happen. Today, the New Madrid fault zone covers portions of Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi. However, a major earthquake of magnitude-8.0 or greater would likely have a dramatic effect all the way from the Great Lakes all the way down to the Gulf of Mexico.\nWhen most Americans speak of the \"big one\", they think of what may happen along the coast of California someday, but the truth is that a New Madrid earthquake could potentially do far more damage. So is there evidence that the New Madrid fault zone is waking up? Yes, there is.\nAccording to Bloomberg, there has been \"a sixfold increase in the number of earthquakes that have shaken the central part of the U.S. from 2000 to 2011″. Much of that increase is being blamed on human activity such as mining, drilling and fracking. So could human activity aggravate the fault zone so much that it could set off a truly history-making earthquake at some point? Well, the potential is certainly there.\n\nThat is why so many people are so concerned about the monster sinkholes that have appeared in the region in recent months. For example, a massive sinkhole down in Louisiana is now over 8 acres in size and it has forced hundreds of people to flee from their homes.\n\nYou can see video of the Louisiana sinkhole right here. Over in Ohio, a giant sinkhole has suddenly formed that is more than 30 feet deep and that is the size of four football fields.\nThat sinkhole caused part of State Route 516 to collapse and authorities say that it will likely be closed for many months.\nYou can see video of the gigantic sinkhole in Ohio right here. Are these monster sinkholes an indication that major earth changes are coming along the New Madrid fault? Has reckless human activity awoken a sleeping giant that we should never have messed with?\nThe sinkhole down in Louisiana is of particular concern because it has been venting natural gas.\n\nA few days ago it reportedly \"burped\" which sounds kind of ominous. Could we see some kind of an \"explosion\" at some point?\nMany of those living in the area may not be able to return to their homes for quite a long time.\n\nThe following is from a recent Huffington Post article…\nAt the eight-acre, Bayou Corne sinkhole in Assumption Parish, owners of slab houses are waiting for methane-gas monitors to be installed in December. The sinkhole deepened in November and coughed up debris and hydrcarbons late in the month. Cypress trees fell into the gap.\n\nResidents are watching natural gas being flared from the site and are ventilating homes while bayous around them bubble.\nBut if human activity is capable of producing sinkholes that are 8 acres in size and capable of causing a \"sixfold increase\" in the number of earthquakes in the middle part of the country, is human activity also capable of setting off the New Madrid fault?\nSadly, even most Americans that are living in that part of the country don't really understand how incredibly massive and how potentially destructive this fault zone actually is. The following is from a recent report from WREG in Memphis, Tennessee…\nMany people don't realize that north Alabama lies in the impact zone of the New Madrid fault line, a sleeping giant that is approximately twenty times larger than California's famed San Andreas fault.\n\nThe biggest earthquake in U.S. history happened in the New Madrid seismic zone in 1812, and in just the last few weeks, activity along the fault line is starting to heat up.\nIf the earthquakes that happened along the New Madrid fault zone in 1811 and 1812 happened today, the devastation would be unimaginable. Back then, there were not that many people living in the area. But even so, the destruction was incredible…\n\nAccounts of the 1812 quake vary since there were no measuring instruments at the time, but most geologists say evidence shows it was at least a magnitude 8 earthquake, and possibly a 9 or higher.\nThe shaking was so intense that church bells started ringing as far away as Boston and New York.\nChimneys toppled from the Deep South to Canada, and President James Madison was awoken by the violent shaking as he slept in the White House.\nEyewitnesses said it even caused the Mississippi River to flow backwards for a time.\n\nUnfortunately, there are now indications that the fault zone is becoming more active as a recent Examiner article explained…\nTuesday evening, two shallow earthquakes, although small, were felt in Mt. Carmel, Ill. as well as five miles outside Edmond, Okla. Illinois had the largest at 3.6 magnitude, leaving Oklahoma with a smaller 2.9 magnitude quake as reported by the USGS.\nThe fact that both of these quakes were shallow and follow on the heels of Kentucky's 4.3 just 10 days ago makes the questions begin to fly. Is the New Madrid waking up? Is it gearing up for 'the big one'? When Ky. Experienced a 4.3 two weeks ago, it was felt across 10-12 states. Although it didn't knock runners off their feet, it did alarm many.\n\nKnoxville was among the cities that felt the quake. The shaking was not minor in many areas, and it scared people as walls shook and many began to pray.\nThis is something that I have written about previously, and we all need to keep our eyes open for more reports about earthquakes in the middle part of the country.\nWhen the \"big one\" does finally hit the New Madrid fault zone, it will be one of the biggest news stories ever.\nWe are talking about a catastrophe that would be so immense that it would be hard to imagine. According to ABC News, a study by the Mid-America Earthquake Center found that in the event of a major earthquake along the New Madrid fault, \"nearly 750,000 buildings would be damaged, 3,000 bridges would potentially collapse, 400,000 breaks and leaks to local pipelines and $300 billion in direct damage and $600 billion in indirect losses would occur.\"\nYou can ready much more about the New Madrid fault right here.\nAll of this is even more frightening when you consider that there are 15 nuclear reactors along the New Madrid fault zone.\nIn the event that the \"big one\" strikes, we could be looking at Fukushima times 15.\n\nWe have been blessed to have avoided a major earthquake like that for so long in the middle part of the country, but there is no guarantee that the New Madrid fault zone will always be stable – especially considering how much it is being aggravated by man-made activity.\nThere are even some that believe that eventually we will see an earthquake of magnitude-9.0 or higher along the New Madrid fault. Such an earthquake could literally change the face of the entire continent.\n\nWe are talking about an event that could potentially change the course of the Mississippi River and create bodies of water where none existed previously.\nWe seem to be moving into a time of increased seismic activity on the earth, and many scientists are convinced that the New Madrid Fault zone is definitely overdue for a major earthquake.\nSo will we see one in the coming years?\nFeel free to post a comment with your opinion below…\n\nIs there a connection between UFOs, alien abductions, channeling spirits, demonic possessions, the new age movement, secret societies, and satanism?\n\nIn Age of Deceit: Fallen Angels and the New World Order, we investigate why the New World Order and the Global Elite are tirelessly working to form a One World Government and who they are getting this instruction from.\n\nA biblical look at the history of fallen angels and it's relationship to the New World Order and the new age movement.\nThis seven part television event explores New York City's rich history as a premier laboratory of modern life. A sweeping narrative covering nearly 400 years and 400 square miles, it reveals a complex and dynamic city that has played and unparalleled role in shaping the nation and reflecting its ideals.\n\nThe Country and the City. Beginning in 1609, episode one chronicles the arrival of the Dutch, the impact of the English, the horrors of colonial slavery, and New York's critical role in the American Revolution.\n\nOrder and Disorder. Episode two looks at New York's rise as a burgeoning cultural center and multi-ethnic port, concluding with the Civil War Draft Riots — America's bloodiest civil disturbance.\n\nSunshine and Shadow. Episode three turns the spotlight on the period when greed and wealth fueled an expanding metropolis, even as politics and poverty defined it.\n\nThe Power and the People. Episode four follows New York into a new century, examining the interplay of capitalism, democracy, and transformation, in the wake of an extraordinary wave of immigration and the birth of the skyscraper.\n\nCosmopolis. In episode five, the post-war economic boom, the rise of consumer culture, and the birth of new mass-media industries fuel the convergence of an incredible array of human and cultural energies, ending with the Crash of 1929 and the construction of the Empire State Building.\n\nThe City of Tomorrow. The sixth episode chronicles the dramatic events that followed the Crash of '29, as the greatest depression in American history plunged the city and the nation into economic gloom.\n\nThe City and the World. Episode seven charts the turbulent and often harrowing years from 1945 to the present. Emerging from the Depression and the Second World War as the most powerful metropolis on earth.\n\nProf. Dawkins titled his talk as The Purpose of Purpose and began with an anecdote of Peter Atkins being asked by one of the Royal Family,But what about the why questions?, and Atkins replying, That is a silly question.\n\nDawkins noted that asking why for inanimate objects like air or rocks is almost always considered inappropriate. But asking why living organisms are seems to often have been done in the past.\n\nHe noted a number of amusing instances, such as claims that domestic animals provide a means to keep their meat fresh until we have need to eat them, lice were a strong incentive to personal cleanliness, large predators allowed hunters to test their courage, and horseflies encouraged industry and the use of wits in combating them.\n\nThis mindset persists to this day, said Dawkins, popping up the Ray Comfort bananavideo, which got an especially large dollop of audience laughter with Comfort's assertion that the banana has just the right shape to fit in the human mouth.\n\nDawkins noted that, unfortunately, the video was not simply a joke. Comfort apparently has offered to give Dawkins $10,000 to debate Comfort. Dawkins responded saying that he would take Comfort up on that only if Comfort donated $100K to Dawkins' new foundation.\n\nThen Dawkins compared the modern, domesticated version of the banana to the fruit of the wild banana, showing that many of the properties that Comfort was ascribing to God's design were actually choices made in artificial selection by humans.\n\n.\n\nAdd to this the already extensively documented impact that the television has on all of us, the power it has to literally alter our consciousness and shut down critical thinking, and it is no wonder that it was long ago dubbed the idiot box.\n\nAs reported by Reuters this month, researchers from the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW), found that background noise emitted from television is so distracting and mesmerizing to children that it is impacting their ability to interact with other human beings and potentially slowing down cognitive thinking and language development.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Pediatrics, found that children in the US are now exposed to more than five hours a day of television. Matthew Lapierre, who led the study, explained that children who are subjected to the most TV spend less time interacting with other children and parents.\n\nLapierre also found that younger children are subjected to the most background television.\n\n\"This is a clear warning signal to parents that if they are not watching TV, they ought to turn it off,\" said Dr. Victor Strasburger, a pediatrician from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque who has previously studied media exposure among children. \"[It is also] a reminder that parents should be avoiding screen time in infants under two.\" he said.\n\n\"It's confusing for babies who are trying to get their language together to have indistinguishable voices in the background.\" Strasburger also noted, telling reporters that when parents bring their children to him, he can tell which toddlers are over exposed to TV.\n\n\"The babies that are being read to are just chattering away, and the babies that sit in front of a TV are silent,\" he said. \"It means their language development is threatened – they may catch up, but it's a concern.\"\n\nIn a separate study, doctors at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health in London found that children born today will have watched a full year of television by the time they are seven years old. The study also found that on average children now spend more time watching television than they do in school.\n\nDr Aric Sigman published the study in the Archives Of Disease In Childhood, a medical journey jointly own by the British Medical Journal group.\n\nSigman noted that such extensive exposure to television can lead to a void when it comes to social relationships, can lead to attention deficit problems, and can promote significant psychological difficulties.\n\nSigman also noted that over exposure to new technologies such as 3D televisions and consoles could seriously affect the development of depth perception in children.\n\nThe study recommends preventing children under three years old from watching television altogether, and says that all children should be limited to less than two hours of TV per day.\n\n\".\" Sigman noted.\n\nIn a report issued one year ago, the American Academy of Pediatrics pointed out that scores of previous studies have come to the same conclusions; that there is a direct link between increased TV time and developmental delays in children.\n\nIn 2010, another study published in Pediatrics, found that during analysis of over 1,000 children between the ages of ten and eleven, those who spend at least two hours a day in front of a television screen are 60 percent more likely to have psychological problems than children who spend less or no time. The study also noted that even children taking part in physical activities but still watching TV are still fifty percent more likely to suffer problems such as hyperactivity, difficulty with peers and friends, poor conduct and antisocial kinds of behavior.\n\nFurther studies published in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, found that children exposed to more TV are significantly more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior and perform poorly in school. In addition, the findings noted that children who watch more TV are more likely to eat more junk-food and suffer bullying at the hands of classmates – consequences that have their own brain re-wiring effects.\n\nOther recent scientific studies have noted that many programs produced specifically for children may have even worse effects on their development because they are very fast moving, thus overtaxing the brain and promoting reduced attention span.\n\nOwing to such proven effects of television and video games, children's minds are being numbed before they have even developed. By the time they reach adulthood, they act according to decisions made to a great extent unconsciously. They are effectively zombies; humans operating with an impulsive, reactionary mind set, at the expense of logical analysis and critical thought.\n\nAnd kids are not the only ones who are susceptible to television's ability to create armies of the walking dead.\n\nIt is commonly known that television flicker rates induce alpha brain waves, lulling the brain into a more subconscious state that can be compared to sleep, literally inducing a type of hypnosis within the viewer that makes them more susceptible to suggestion.\n\nThis has been known since the 1960s, and was most notably proven in an experiment in 1969, by Herbert Krugman. The research, undertaken by Krugman as part of a larger project concerned with advertising, revealed that the brain's left hemisphere, which processes information logically and analytically, effectively tunes out almost completely when an individual watches television.\n\nThe radiant light and flicker rate of television screens cause brain activity to drop toward more of a theta state. Critical thinking reduces, leaving the parts of the brain that hold memories, sensations and emotions the most active. Whatever is coming from the TV therefore somewhat bypasses the logical mind and is embedded directly into the subconscious. In other words, TV appeals more to emotions than logic.\n\nNumerous studies have also found that flicker rates in video games cause altered consciousness. Some have been shown to reduce brain activity to below Delta frequency.\n\nOther studies have also flagged up a link between watching too much television and Alzheimer's disease. The semi conscious state induced by television is thought to directly contribute to the symptoms of memory, speech and perception problems.\n\nKrugman also discovered that reading and listening to audio increases cognition and builds neuron paths because you have to think critically and envision the \"theater of the mind\".\n\nIn addition, the crossover from the left to the right brain induced by watching television, causes a release of the body's natural opiates, similar to a release of endorphins when exercising. This has the effect of making the viewer feel good. Consequently, withdrawal symptoms can kick in if viewers turn off the turn. As with any form of opiate-withdrawal, symptoms include increased anxiety, frustration, and depression.\n\nExperiments conducted in the 1970s found that people who turn off their TVs for long periods after prolonged viewing suffer from depression, with some noting that they felt as though they had \"lost a friend.\"\n\nA combination of four studies, published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, concluded thattelevision shows can instill a sense of belonging in viewers with low self-esteem and a lack of social relationships. Referring to the notion as social surrogacy hypothesis, psychologists at the University at Buffalo and Miami University, Ohio, found that in order to fill the emotional void of social deprivation, some people forge relationships with fictional characters in TV shows.\n\nTV really is the opiate of the masses.\n\nOf course, what I describe here is only a snapshot. We are today bombarded from all angles with distractions, substances, and conditions created to transform the way we interpret our reality. We are being conditioned from birth to act increasingly without consciousness; the one thing that sets us apart from every other living thing in the known universe.\n\nWe are literally being programmed into a waking sleep, a zombie-like existence. We must act vigilantly and educate others if we are to break this programming and preserve our humanity."

      "text": "Hot swap\n\nThe deployment of large-scale solar energy utilities could be made more economically viable with photovoltaic (PV) materials that are being developed in Oxford.\n\nThe technology has been developed by researchers at ISIS Innovation, Oxford University's technology transfer company.\n\nAndrew Watt, from Oxford's Department of Materials, explained that the new ISIS photovoltaic system is based on visible-light-absorbing metal oxides commonly used as pigments in paints.\n\n'Current PV technologies are costly, around $0.25/kilowatt hour compared to oil, gas, coal, nuclear and wind, which come in around $0.05/kilowatt,' he said. 'The reason for this is partly associated with the cost of manufacture and partly the materials used.'\n\nScientists have looked for a number of years for replacements for silicon, which is commonly used in photovoltaic systems.\n\nWatt said a number of thin-film inorganic systems are commercially available. Those include CIGS (copper indium gallium diselenide) or Cadmium Tellurium devices, which offer good solar-power conversion efficiencies. However, the systems rely on rare elements and contain highly toxic materials.\n\n'There is now a resurgence looking at cheaper and more environmentally friendly semiconductor technologies that do not use Cadmium or expensive metals such as Indium, which has a projected supply of 20 years,' he added.\n\nWatt said the challenge for the ISIS team in its new photovoltaic system was changing the semiconducting nature of its material for photovoltaic devices. To accomplish this, he explained that the team had to reconfigure the crystal structure of the photovoltaic system, adjust its chemistry and create a new doping process.\n\nOtherwise the design of the device is similar to existing technologies, which include a metal anode-cathode with p- and n-type semiconductors in between them.\n\nWatt added that the inorganic thin-film photovoltaic system is not yet ready to compete with silicon on a performance level. 'At the moment, our power conversion efficiencies are lower than standard silicon devices,' he said. 'We hope to push efficiencies to between 6-8 per cent in the next three years.'\n\nYet Watt said it offers other advantages. 'The real advantage comes from cost of processing,' he added. 'A ten-fold decrease in efficiency makes devices 100 times cheaper. So if space is not an issue the material is ideal. Think solar farms in desert area converting sunlight to electricity to hydrogen for distribution around the world.'\n\nThe ISIS team points out that its system has good photochemical stability relative to other low-cost organic systems. It is compatible with existing industrial coating methods and the system's metal oxides offer aesthetic advantages such as transparency and the possibility to create a variety of colours.\n\nStuart Wilkinson, project manager with Isis Innovation, said the technology is patented and the group hopes to attract investors and development partners.\n\n'We aim to develop a suite of materials with bespoke semiconducting and light-absorbing properties,' he added. 'Then using a device modelling package we can optimise the device's design and generate the highest efficiency devices possible"

Photo: Richard Howard\n\nKwabena Bediako was first drawn to energy studies by the power of the African sun. Growing up in Ghana, he said he was struck by\n\"a simple thought: Why aren't we doing more with solar energy?\"\n\nToday, in collaboration with the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI), Bediako is a Saudi Aramco-MIT Energy Fellow working on an \"artificial leaf\" — a device invented in the lab of Professor of Chemistry Daniel Nocera that uses energy from the sun to make chemical fuel.\n\n\"MIT has made energy a priority,\" Bediako said. \"MIT brings together many different fields of research — from architecture to chemistry,\" he said, to consider the broader problem of energy and to work toward progress from a range of disciplinary angles.\n\nBediako helped Nocera improve the catalysts needed to channel the sun's energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. \"Hydrogen is the fuel,\" Bediako explained. \"When you burn hydrogen you get water, so you close the cycle. It's a zero carbon process.\"\n\nA third-year doctoral candidate, Bediako is just one of nearly 200 graduate and postdoctoral fellows who has benefited since MITEI was founded five years ago. The Society of Energy Fellows currently includes researchers in 20 different departments — spanning all five\nschools — supported by 22 companies.\n\n\"When MITEI started, one of the big problems we noticed was that there weren't a lot of faculty members on campus whose research programs were focused specifically on energy,\" said Robert C. Armstrong, MITEI deputy director who is also the Chevron Professor of Chemical Engineering. Today, he said, nearly 30 percent of the faculty is involved in energy — more than 270 faculty members. \"In the first five years, we've done, or are doing, some 700 projects with $360 million in funding.\" As a result, he noted, \"The graduate pipeline at MIT is pretty full.\"\n\nUndergraduates are also benefiting from the uptick in energy research on campus — gaining hands-on experience through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). \"These kids are doing extraordinary things, from exploring the theory of light and luminescence to the microbial understanding of critters able to digest material and produce energy from it,\" said Amy Glasmeier, co-chair of the MITEI Energy Education Task Force, professor of geography and regional planning, and head of the Department of Urban Studies and Planning.\n\nMITEI introduces incoming freshmen to campus energy activities through its Freshman Pre-Orientation Program and supports such student activities as the Energy Club, the Electric Vehicle Team, and Biodiesel@MIT, a group working to produce fuel from used vegetable oils.\n\nA major minor\n\nBut a significant educational accomplishment of MITEI is the 2009 launch of the Energy Studies Minor, made possible by gifts from Derry and Charlene Kabcenell, the S. D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation, and an anonymous donor. The minor offers undergraduates an integrated, multidisciplinary view of energy and its implications. \"It's an innovative program,\" Armstrong said. \"It's the first really interdepartmental, interschool academic program we have on campus.\"\n\nThe curriculum — including more than 40 classes across all five schools — last year enrolled nearly nine percent of undergraduates. Nearly 40 students have minored in energy to date. \"The minor allows any student to put a coherent overlay of energy subjects on any major,\" Armstrong said. \"There's not a better place in the world to be an undergraduate if you're interested in energy.\"\n\n\"As soon as I heard about the energy minor, I knew I wanted to do it,\" said Lucy Fan '12, a chemical engineering major. Initially focused on sustainability and renewable energy, Fan said that when she took a class called Energy Decisions, Markets, and Policies — a requirement for the minor — it opened her eyes to the need to consider not just technical solutions but also the economic feasibility and policy implications of technology. Regarding complex energy challenges, she says, \"there's no one solution; you need to have a portfolio.\"\n\nFan's energy studies led her to intern last summer with Exelon Corporation, where she worked on load forecasting and gas-storage models for the quantitative and business analytics department. \"Before the energy minor, I had been focused on technology,\" Fan said. Now she plans to work as a consultant in the electric power industry, helping to guide the evolution of the electrical grid.\n\n\"Our education program gives [students] this breadth of understanding that makes them capable of leaving the Institute and conveying the value of perspective in assessing energy issues in the modern world,\" Glasmeier said."

      "text": "1839 –Sir William Grove observed that the process known as \"hydrolysis\" can also go backwards – hydrogen will react at one electrode and oxygen at the other producing water and an electrical voltage between the electrodes. It was only a century later that Francis Bacon began to develop practical fuel cells.\n\n1950s – Pratt and Whitney (now United Technologies) licensed Bacon's technology and developed it for the US space program. The Gemini, Apollo and space shuttle program all used fuel cells to generate electricity and produce drinking water on-board by just bringing hydrogen fuel and oxygen with them.\n\nFuel Cell Principle\n\nIf an electrical voltage is applied on water, by placing two electrodes into the liquid and attaching a DC battery to them, the voltage induces a chemical reaction; hydrogen and oxygen is produced at each electrode:\n\nH2O + DC voltage è H2 + O2\n\nIn 1839, Sir William Grove observed this process, known as hydrolysis, can also go backwards – reversible.Hydrogen will react at one electrode and oxygen at the other, producing water and DC electrical voltage between the electrodes.\n\nDuring reverse hydrolysis, hydrogen would act at one electrode and oxygen at the other, producing water, heat and electrical voltage (DC) between the electrodes.\n\nFuel (H2) + O2 + platinum catalyst è H20 + DC voltage\n\nFuel Cell Characteristics\n\nOperates as a continuous battery – continuous fueling\n\nNever needs recharging\n\nBased on reverse hydrolysis – converts hydrogen and oxygen into water and electricity\n\nCurrent depends on electrode area\n\nVoltage depends on materials of construction, typically less than 1 volt.\n\nBalance of Plant Equipment\n\nPower-conditioning equipment needed are expensive\n\nFuel processing comprises a large part of cost and project development.\n\nCombined Heat and Power (CHP) is the simultaneous generation of electricity and steam (or heat) in a single power plant. It has been long used by industries and municipalities that need process steam or heat as well as electricity. CHP or cogeneration is not usually used by large utilities which tend to produce electricity only. It is advisable only for industries and municipalities if they can produce electricity cheaper or more conveniently; otherwise, buy from the utility instead.\n\nIn theory, CHP provides the most efficient use of energy resources, often utilizing up to 90% of the heat energy of the fossil fuel. In practice, while the efficiency of entire process is recognized, its application has been limited."

      "text": "The New Eco Battery – Turning Trees into Batteries\n\n16May\n\nIf you thought rechargeable batteries were as environmentally-friendly as it gets, think again. Sure, they reduce landfill waste to some extent as they can be recharged and reused numerous times before being thrown away (or confined to a box along with other AA batteries you're not sure have charge or not) but they still require rare and non-renewable metals such as cobalt to be produced.\n\nTraditionally, these precious metals – which also include lithium, nickel and manganese – have been used to make the battery cathode, which is the part where current flows out. Now however, two European researchers have discovered an altogether more natural alternative that may just revolutionise the industry.\n\nGrzegorz Milczarek of the Poznam University of Technology in Poland teamed up with Olle Inganäs of the Linköping University in Sweden to work on proving a theory that lignin, a natural substance present in all plants, could be made to hold charge.\n\nLignin makes up between 20% and 30% of a plant's structure and is a natural polymer (a long chain of molecules). If reading this is making you worried that yet more of our rainforests are going to be destroyed to supply the 40,000 tonnes of batteries the UK buys every year, let alone the rest of the world, then don't worry as lignin is also a natural by-product of paper production.\n\nTo turn trees into paper, they're first cooked at a high temperature to break down the cell structure and allow it to be turned to pulp. This cooking leaves behind 'brown liquor', a substance rich in lignin that is normally thrown away as a waste product. However, by mixing the lignin from this otherwise useless liquid with polypyrrole, another polymer, a working battery cathode can be formed, absolutely metal free!\n\nDon't expect to see 'tree batteries' on the shelves of your local supermarket any time soon though – these prototype lignin-based batteries slowly lose their stored charge when not being used, so more research and development is needed to improve them and get them up to consumer standards. When they're ready to go on sale though, expect battery prices to drop – they'll be made from a cheap waste product after all!"

      "text": "Where there's power being produced, there are researchers looking into how it might be harvested and put to use, no matter how small the amount.\n\nTake triboelectric charging – it's what's behind the shock you get when you shuffle across a carpeted room and then, say, grab the refrigerator door handle. Friction got you charged up, and your subsequent contact with the metal led to a quick discharge.\n\n\"The fact that an electric charge can be produced through this principle is well known,\" said Zhong Lin Wang, a Regents professor in the School of Materials Science & Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \"What we have introduced is a gap separation technique that produces a voltage drop, which leads to a current flow, allowing the charge to be used. This generator can convert random mechanical energy from our environment into electric energy.\"\n\nWhat might be the point of this?\n\nWell, the researchers suggest that their triboelectric generator could give a boost to nanogenerators that use the piezoelectric effect (that's the generation of a charge by applying stress to certain materials) to create current from the flexing of zinc oxide nanowires (as talked about here).\n\nOne potential use: Because the triboelectric generators can be made nearly transparent, they could offer a new way to produce active sensors that might replace technology now used for touch-sensitive device displays.\n\nThat opens up the possibility that your incessant typing, sliding and tapping on your iPhone won't take a toll on the device's battery.\n\n\"Transparent generators can be fabricated on virtually any surface,\" Wang said. \"This technique could be used to create very sensitive transparent sensors that would not require power from a device's battery.\"\n\nThe key to the system working is the matching of materials of different types in order to exploit the charge differential. So Wang's system has a sheet of polyester rubbing against a sheet made of polydimethysiloxane (PDMS); the polyester gives up electrons and the PDMS takes them.\n\nWith an electrical load connected between the two surfaces, continually rubbing the surfaces together and then separating them creates the electric current.\n\nWang said they've ratcheted up the current production in the system by putting microscopic pyramid shapes on the rubbing surfaces instead of keeping them smooth.\n\n\"The patterning enhanced the generating capacity by boosting the amount of charge formed, improving capacitance change due to the air voids created between the patterns, and by facilitating charge separation,\" the university said.\n\nIt would be interesting to see an analysis of how much energy can actually be captured from these seemingly effortless actions like swiping and typing. I would guess that it is not nearly enough to compensate for the energy burned by running a processor, transmitting signals over wifi, and displaying images on a screen.\n\nLoading comments…\n\nThis is an intriging idea to be pursued. It has been thought of and tried before, but we have better technology today. Best of luck. Energy is all around us.\nCalling it renewable energy or Green energy does not quite ring true. There is no such a thing as renewable energy and no energy use is Green. Those are strictly advertising words.\n\nRenewable sounds like the energy source is somehow rechargeable, which is slightly inaccurate for stuff like wind or solar power.\nSustainable is probably the most technically correct term, plus it describes the purpose quite nicely; the whole point being to actually limit secondary harms to those that can be repaired or naturally absorbed by the environment.\n\nDCcyclist: Renewable sounds like the energy source is somehow rechargeable, which"

As described in the journal Angewandte Chemie, they have successfully activated CO2 for use in a chemical reaction by using a special new type of metal-free catalyst: graphitic carbon nitride.\n\n\"Chemical activation of carbon dioxide, meaning its cleavage in a chemical reaction,\" explain chemists Goettmann, Thomas and Antonietti, \" is one of the biggest challenges in synthetic chemistry.\" The bonds in this molecule are very stable, so a lot of energy is needed to split them. To date, only a few special metal catalysts are known to be capable of breaking the C–O bonds in CO2.\n\nIn contrast to most previous approaches, Antonietti's team worked with metal-free catalysts, turning toward plants for inspiration. Photosynthesis in modern green plants involves an important intermediate step: the bonding of CO2 to nitrogen atoms to form carbamates.\n\nThe German researchers thus also experimented with nitrogen-rich catalysts with structures that allow them to form carbamates. Their new class of catalysts is made of flat, graphite-like layers. The individual layers consist of ring systems involving carbon and nitrogen atoms. This porous material, called graphitic carbon nitride, is very heat-stable and, although it enters into many chemical interactions, it is so stable that it nearly always re-forms—an\n\nFrom a purely formal point of view, this reaction cleaves the CO2 into an oxygen diradical and CO. However, like photosynthesis, the reaction seems to occur by way of carbamates: In the first step, CO2 binds to individual free amino groups present in the carbon nitride. It then oxidizes the benzene to phenol, and in the end the highly desirable CO separates from the catalyst. \"This could make novel, previously unknown chemistry of CO2 accessible,\" hopes Antonietti. \"It may even be the first step in artificial photosynthesis.\"\n\nRelevant PhysicsForums posts\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Global production of phosphorus fertiliser could peak and decline later this century, causing shortages and price spikes that jeopardise world food production, five major scientific societies warn today (March"

      "text": "It isn't often (like almost never) that a new technology with potential impact on the environment comes with its own natural solution. According to two papers published by scientists from Rice University (Texas, USA), this is the case with graphene oxide.\n\nGraphene, a form of carbon, can be simply described as a form of graphite (as in pencil lead) that exists in sheets or layers one atom thick. It has an incredible number of potential applications. For example, it can be used in making plastics (polymers), ceramics, reinforced metals, electronics, drug-delivery devices, hydrogen storage, and with modification as a semiconductor. However, most of these applications require mass production to be significant.\n\nOne of the principle forms of graphene is graphene oxide, which is mostly carbon with oxygen and a few atoms of hydrogen. Graphene oxide is an insulator, meaning it doesn't conduct electricity, but has many other properties that it shares with basic graphene. It is also potentially used as an intermediate form in the process of making graphene.\n\nThe long march from scientific discovery to a successful technology typically has a critical phase: Competitive mass production. It's one thing to make something in a lab, or even produce a number of prototypes; it's quite another to produce something in large numbers. It's common for products and technologies to fail because they couldn't be successfully mass produced – or even more commonly because they couldn't be produced cheaply enough to compete with other similar or alternative products. So it's important when a highly touted new technology, in this case the nanotechnology based on graphene, finds methods of mass production that have numerous advantages, including low cost.\n\nThe new process, described in the paper Improved Synthesis of Graphene Oxide published in the American Chemical Society (ACS) Nano, uses flakes of graphite, which is treated with potassium permanganate, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid. Though obviously very 'active' chemicals, they are inexpensive, well understood, and suited for mass production of graphene oxide. They also do not produce the kinds of explosive gas by-products common to other approaches.\n\nIn the opinion of James Tour, professor of chemistry at Rice and lead researcher for the graphene oxide production paper:\n\n\"Many companies have started to make graphene and graphene oxide, and I think they're going to be very hard pressed to come up with a cheaper procedure that's this efficient and as safe and environmentally friendly,\"\n\nThe 'environmentally friendly' element comes from a discovery described in the second paper also published in ACS Nano as Reduction of Graphene Oxide via Bacterial Respiration. Andreas Lüttge, Rice professor of earth science and chemistry, had already been studying the effects of bacteria on carbon when James Tour came to him with idea that graphene oxide might become a prominent form of carbon nanotechnology. This would mean its widespread use and distribution throughout the environment. Was there any biological way of controlling graphene oxide?\n\nAs it turned out the answer was a comfortable 'yes.' Bacteria from the common bacteria genus Shewanella easily convert graphic oxide into simple graphene, which then arranges itself into graphite. Graphite is largely inert and harmless in the environment.\n\nThus graphene oxide, which apparently can be mass produced relatively easily and inexpensively, can find wide application in the knowledge that 'cleanup' can be accomplished by common naturally occurring bacteria. It's a neatly green package. Now it needs to go toward the implementation steps – all of this has been lab work – but the Rice studies were developed in partnership with a Houston based oil drilling company, which has plans for the commercial use of the graphene oxide."

      "text": "Jan 10, 2012\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Md., have developed an inexpensive sensor that can warn of impending catastrophic failure in lithium-ion batteries. The sensor is based on the researchers' discovery of an intrinsic relationship between the internal temperature of lithium-ion cells and an easily measured electrical parameter of the cell.\n\nDue to their high energy density, lithium-ion batteries power millions of consumer electronic devices and are the most common type of battery used in hybrid and electric vehicles. They are also growing in popularity for power grid, military and aerospace applications.\n\nBut safety concerns remain a challenge to the industry. Battery malfunction and fires in electric vehicles, mobile phones and laptop computers have been reported in the media. Such failures typically result from thermal runaway, a self-perpetuating condition that occurs once a cell reaches a critical temperature.\n\n\"An abnormally high internal cell temperature is a nearly universal manifestation of something going awry with the cell,\" says Rengaswamy Srinivasan, a chemist in APL's Research and Exploratory Development Department and one of the inventors. \"These changes can occur within seconds, leading to a potentially catastrophic event if corrective measures are not taken immediately. When things start to go wrong inside the cell, time is not on your side.\"\n\nSrinivasan and his colleagues discovered that a very small alternating current, when applied to a lithium-ion battery at specific frequencies, is modified by the cell in a way that is directly related to the temperature of the critical electrochemical interface between the electrodes and the electrolyte.\n\n\"We discovered that we can measure the temperature of the protective layers between the electrodes and the electrolyte of the battery during normal operation,\" Srinivasan says. \"These layers are where the conditions that lead to thermal runaway and catastrophic cell failure begin. This discovery enables us to detect potentially unsafe thermal conditions before surface-mounted temperature sensors, which are the current state of the art, are able to register that any change has taken place.\"\n\nThe sensor operates through a simple electrical connection at the positive and negative terminals of the cell and can operate using power from the battery it is monitoring. With multiplexing circuitry, a single sensor can monitor multiple cells in a battery pack.\n\n\"Ultimately, the new sensor enables battery management systems to more closely manage battery performance and, more importantly, detect unsafe thermal conditions at the critical moment when they occur and before the cell vents or sets itself and the battery on fire,\" Srinivasan explains. \"By integrating this technology into their products, manufacturers of batteries, battery management systems, and battery solution providers can increase both the safety and performance of their products.\"\n\nAPL has applied for U.S. and international patents for the sensor and is pursuing licensing opportunities.\n\n\"At the heart of lithium battery safety is not only the development of safer battery chemistries but also the availability of accurate and reliable technologies that measure the actual battery cell temperature,\" says Michael Hickman, APL's technology commercialization manager for the sensor. \"This technology provides the most accurate and immediate method available for measuring the true temperature of a lithium-ion cell; and, it is the only method for measuring a cell's temperature where it counts: inside the cell where temperature changes originate.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nA Japanese research group has developed a solid state lithium battery that appears to perform just as well as conventional liquid lithium ion batteries.

      "text": "Silicon Nanowires To Increase Battery Life Tenfold\n\nJoseph Lopez\n\nThursday, May 08, 2008\n\nResearchers at Stanford University have found a way to use silicon nanowires to give rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as much as 10 times more capacity. This potentially could give a conventional battery-powered laptop 40 hours of battery life, rather than 4 hours.\n\nThe battery capacity was increased using a new type of anode that utilizes silicon nanowires. Traditional lithium-ion batteries use graphite as the anode. This limits the amount of lithium--which holds the charge--that can be held in the anode, and it therefore limits battery life.\n\nSilicon anodes have the highest theoretical charge capacity, but they expand when charging and shrink during use: a cycle that causes the silicon to be pulverized, degrading the performance of the battery. For 30 years, this dead end stumped researchers who poured their battery life-extending energy into improving graphite-based anodes.\n\nThis problem was overcome by constructing a new type of silicon nanowire anode. In this particular anode, the lithium is stored in a forest of tiny silicon nanowires, each with a diameter that is a thousandth of the thickness of a sheet of paper. The nanowires inflate to four times their normal size as they soak up lithium, but unlike previous silicon anodes, they do not fracture. Fortunately there are few barriers to commercializing this technology. Researchers at Stanford University are working on scaling up and evaluating the cost of this technology.\n\nAssistant professor, Yi Cui, at Stanford's Department of Materials Science and Engineering has filed a patent on the technology and is considering formation of a company or an agreement with a battery manufacturer. He expects the battery to be commercialized and available within \"several years,\" pending testing."

The promise is that it could pack several times more energy per pound than lithium-ion batteries that currently dominate the market.\n\nLast year, researchers had demonstrated that lithium-air batteries showed improved efficiency with catalysts based on noble metal.

Researchers say that when heated, the keratin protein in chicken feathers become very strong and porous. As a result, they can absorb hydrogen as well or better than other materials. And let's not forget, chicken feathers are cheap.\n\nWool and his ACRES program colleagues are more than a little familiar with chicken feathers.

And in 2007, after seeing a composite that he and his students made from soybeans and chicken feathers at the state fair, Tyson Chicken gave him 2 billion pounds of chicken feathers to go and experiment.\n\nProfessor Wool used the material to design a circuit board he said is a lighter, stronger, cheaper product with high-speed electronic properties.

      "text": "(PhysOrg.com) -- Stop-and-go driving can wear on your nerves, but it really does a number on the precious platinum that drives reactions in automotive fuel cells. Before large fleets of fuel-cell-powered vehicles can hit the road, scientists will have to find a way to protect the platinum, the most expensive component of fuel-cell technology, and to reduce the amount needed to make catalytically active electrodes.\n\nNow, scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory have developed a new electrocatalyst that uses a single layer of platinum and minimizes its wear and tear while maintaining high levels of reactivity during tests that mimic stop-and-go driving. The research - described online in Angewandte Chemie, International Edition, and identified by the journal as a \"very important paper\" - may greatly enhance the practicality of fuel-cell vehicles and may also be applicable for improving the performance of other metallic catalysts.\n\nThe newly designed catalysts are composed of a single layer of platinum over a palladium (or palladium-gold alloy) nanoparticle core. Their structural characterization was performed at Brookhaven's Center for Functional Nanomaterials and the National Synchrotron Light Source.\n\n\"Our studies of the structure and activity of this catalyst - and comparisons with platinum-carbon catalysts currently in use - illustrate that the palladium core 'protects' the fine layer of platinum surrounding the particles, enabling it to maintain reactivity for a much longer period of time,\" explained Brookhaven Lab chemist Radoslav Adzic, who leads the research team.\n\nIn conventional fuel-cell catalysts, the oxidation and reduction cycling - triggered by changes in voltage that occur during stop-and-go driving - damages the platinum. Over time, the platinum dissolves, causing irreversible damage to the fuel cell.\n\nIn the new catalyst, palladium from the core is more reactive than platinum in these oxidation and reduction reactions. Stability tests simulating fuel cell voltage cycling revealed that, after 100,000 potential cycles, a significant amount of palladium had been oxidized, dissolved, and migrated away from the cathode. In the membrane between the cathode and anode, the dissolved palladium ions were reduced by hydrogen diffusing from the anode to form a \"band,\" or dots.\n\nIn contrast, platinum was almost unaffected, except for a small contraction of the platinum monolayer. \"This contraction of the platinum lattice makes the catalyst more active and the stability of the particles increases,\" Adzic said.\n\nReactivity of the platinum monolayer/palladium core catalyst also remained extremely high. It was reduced by merely 37 percent after 100,000 cycles.\n\nBuilding on earlier work that illustrated how small amounts of gold can enhance catalytic activity, the scientists also developed a form of the platinum monolayer catalyst with a palladium-gold alloy core. The addition of gold further increased the stability of the electrocatalyst, which retained nearly 70 percent of reactivity after 200,000 cycles of testing.\n\n\"This indicates the excellent durability of this electrocatalyst, especially when compared with simpler platinum-carbon catalysts, which lose nearly 70 percent of their reactivity after much shorter cycling times. This level of activity and stability indicates that this is a practical catalyst. It exceeds the goal set by DOE for 2010-2015 and it can be used for automotive applications,\" Adzic said.\n\nHe noted that fuel cells made using the new catalyst would require only about 10 grams of platinum per car - and less than 20 grams of palladium. Currently, in catalytic convertors used to treat exhaust gases, 5 to 10 grams of platinum is used. Since fuel-cell-powered cars would emit no exhaust gases, there would be no need for such catalytic converters, and therefore no net increase in the amount of platinum used.\n\n\"In addition to developing electrocatalysts for automotive fuel cell applications, these findings indicate the broad applicability of platinum monolayer catalysts and the possibility of extending this concept to catalysts based on other noble metals,\" Adzic said.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nChemists at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory have received three patents for developing catalysts to accelerate chemical reactions in fuel cells. The newly patented catalysts, ...\n\nCreating catalysts that can operate efficiently and last a long time is a big barrier to taking fuel-cell technology from the lab bench to the assembly line. The precious metal platinum has been the choice Material scientists at Washington University in St. Louis have developed a technique for a bimetallic fuel cell catalyst that is efficient, robust and two to five times more effective thanjust some simple arithmetic for ya: if you drove your car 4 times a day, 200,000 cycles would last you 136 years. Not bad, i would like to see a gas engine go for 200,000 miles in 1 mile, stop and go, driving.\n\nI also understood that any (big) change in the production like stopping to traffic lights is one stop and go -instance. Therefore one trip through say a city could mean tens of cycles.\n\nLow cycle life had been big issue to fuel cells, along with big needed amount of precious metals needed. So fuel cells have been expensive and you have had to replace them regularly, obviously an unworkable equation. But this new innovation seems to solve these two issues, making fuel cell cars much more realistic devices. So ICE has again more competition.\n\nin my commute i get into a stop and go situation where i literally stop probably 15-20 times before it smoothes out and then i stop at least 8 times in the parking structure if not just to turn a corner. I would estimate i stop probably 40 - 60 times on the way to work and 25 times on the way home in clear traffic... got to count those traffic lights and stopping to trun a corner. hemitite - you read the article correctly.\n\nTry counting these stops yourself and see what huge number you come up with... remember EVERY stop counts. so every corner turned.. every traffic light stopping in parking lots - heck parallel parking, and stopping at a gate to use your card or punch in a number. And do you inch closer to the car in front of you at lights, yep me too - got to count those.\n\nwith an average of 75 stops/cycles a day gives you 7.3 years on 200,000 stops - till you reach 70% effeciency. That is pretty darn good. --\n\nThe loss of REACTIVITY not efficiency is what they are talking about. That means that the fuel cell will put out 1/3rd less power not 1/3rd less mileage. So you 100kW Fuel cell would put out 70kW at peak output.\n\nAlso cycles count as any major change in output.... climbing a hill to coasting down the other side to climbing the next one, or speeding up for passing on the highway to coasting back down to your normal speed.\n\nAll of this is sort of silly. They should always make fuel cell/battery hybrids. If you do fuel cell only operation you are planning the system to be less efficient (i.e. no Regen braking, and the average driver only use peak power 1-5% of the time). The vehicle should run on a battery with the fuel cell to recharging/maintaining the battery. This allows the fuel cell to be smaller (cheaper) and to run at a steadier output that is best for fuel cell operation.\n\nIt is things like this that make me think that the manufacturers don't really want it to work"

Well, sort of - in 1930, Einstein and his former student Leo Szilard designed a refrigerator that required no electricity and had no moving parts. However, as refrigerator technology became more efficient, Einstein's design was nearly forgotten.\n\nNow, Malcolm McCulloch, an electrical engineer at Oxford, is trying to bring Einstein's refrigerator back. McCulloch explains that the design is environmentally friendly and could prove especially useful in developing countries, where demand for cooling appliances is quickly increasing.\n\nMcCulloch's team has recently built a prototype of Einstein and Szilard's refrigerator. Instead of compressing man-made greenhouse gases called freons, as typical refrigerators do, the prototype uses pressurized gas to keep items cold. The refrigerator just requires a way to heat the liquids, and McCulloch has been working on developing a solar energy system to meet this requirement.\n\nThe refrigerator is based on the idea that liquids boil at low temperatures when the surrounding air pressure is low.\n\n\"If you go to the top of Mount Everest, water boils at a much lower temperature than it does when you´re at sea level, and that´s because the pressure is much lower up there,\" McCulloch said.\n\nIn their refrigerator prototype, the scientists filled a flask with liquid butane (which is also commonly sold as a liquid in cigarette lighters and as a gas for cooking). Then the scientists introduced a new vapor to decrease the air pressure, which decreases the liquid boiling temperature, causing the butane to boil. As the butane boils, it takes energy from the surroundings, and lowers the temperature inside the refrigerator.\n\nAlthough Einstein and Szilard´s original design was not as efficient as the freon refrigerators that replaced them, McCulloch plans to improve the design by using different kinds of gases. He predicts these improvements could quadruple the refrigerator´s efficiency.\n\nThe fact that the refrigerator has no moving parts could also be advantageous, he explains, as it would require minimal maintenance and so could be particularly useful in rural areas.\n\nMcCulloch emphasizes that the refrigerator is still just a prototype, but he hopes to one day commercialize it. The work is part of his team's three-year project to develop robust appliances that can be used in locations without electricityCheck out this article about the Zeer_Pot - an invention by Mohammed Bah Abba, a teacher from Nigeria. It keeps food fresh without electricity, using wet sand and evaporative cooling: \n\nThis is similar to the gas adsorption refrigerator. These use ammonia, water and hydrogen. It seems the Einstein version replaces the hydrogen with butane. In either case, the partial pressure of hydrogen is much higher on the evaporator side than the condensor side. This reduces the partial pressure of ammonia, causing it to boil. The key to the operation is the hydrogen (or butane) is not soluable in water, so it can't cross a water trap boundary. Here's a link that explains all this:\n\n\nI have done a lot of research on this topic; the Einstein cycle is scientifically different from the adsorption cycle. The Einstein cycle uses the ammonia to make the butane evaporate, and condense due to partial pressure. This is the complete opposite of the adsorption cycle. The Einstein cycle is reversible like the compression cycle ware the adsorption cycle is not"

In addition to this problem, the construction of desalination plants requires intensive capital expenditures.\n\nCapacitive Deionization is a technological alternative to Reverse Osmosis provided it is a non-membrane and low-pressure process, which are possibly the two main drawbacks of the Reverse Osmosis technology. The Capacitive Deionization concept is schematically represented in the Figure. During the deionization cycle, an external electrical charge is applied on a pair of electrodes introduced in the feed water, this makes the ions dissolved in the water to migrate towards the electrode of opposite charge, where they are adsorbed. In the regeneration cycle, the electrical load of the electrodes is switched off, therefore adsorbed ions are released. If an electrical circuit is connected at this stage, an electrical current will be produced, just like in the discharge of a capacitor.\n\nEarly studies almost 40 years ago showed that Capacitive Deionization could be a feasible technology for low-cost water desalination, but by that time appropriate materials were not available yet. However, nowadays with the most recent advances in electrochemical capacitors, there are improved electrodes with performances good enough to bring the Capacitive Deionization systems from research laboratories to real life applications.\n\nWith this aim the company PROINGESA and the foundations IMDEA Energy and IMDEA Water have launched a research project to design a low-cost Capacitive Deionization device based on nanomaterials that have been developed for last generation electrochemical capacitors.

Ashley Taylor, both engineering researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, have described a new energy-harvesting technology that promises to dramatically reduce our dependence on batteries and instead capture the energy of human motion to power portable electronics.\n\n\"Humans, generally speaking, are very powerful energy-producing machines,\" said Krupenkin, a UW-Madison professor of mechanical engineering. \"While sprinting, a person can produce as much as a kilowatt of power.\"\n\nCapturing even a small fraction of that energy, Krupenkin points out, is enough to power a host of mobile electronic devices - everything from laptop computers to cell phones to flashlights.\n\nIn their study, Krupenkin and Taylor describe a novel energy-harvesting technology known as \"reverse electrowetting,\" where mechanical energy is converted to electrical energy by using a micro-fluidic device consisting of thousands of liquid micro-droplets interacting with a novel nano-structured substrate.\n\nThis technology could enable a novel footwear-embedded energy harvester that captures energy produced by humans during walking, which is normally lost as heat, and converts it into up to 20 watts of electrical power that can be used to power mobile electronic devices, they said.\n\nEven though energy harvesting is unlikely to completely replace batteries in the majority of mobile applications, the UW-Madison researchers believe it can play a key role in reducing cost, pollution and other problems associated with battery use.\n\nThe study was recently published in the journal Nature Communications.

      "text": "Desalination might sound boring, but it's super important. Around 97% of the planet's water is saltwater and therefore unpotable, and while you can remove the salt from the water, the current methods of doing so are laborious and expensive. Graphene stands to change all that by essentially serving as the world's most awesomely efficient filter. If you can increase the efficiency of desalination by two or three orders of magnitude (that is to say, make it 100 to 1,000 times more efficient) desalination suddenly becomes way more attractive as a way to obtain drinking water.\n\nDesalination works exactly as you might expect; you run water through a filter with pores small enough to block the salt and not the water. It's a process called reverse osmosis. The issue is that the thicker your filter is, the less efficient the process is going to be. If you know anything about graphene, you know where this is going. Graphene sheets are one atom thick. It's sort of a best case scenario. Because it's nanoporous and so insanely thin, it can let water (but not salt) through it without requiring the comparatively high levels of pressure that current filters do.\n\nThat said, there are a couple of roadblocks to using graphene for desalination. First of all, if you want to use a graphene filter, it's important to have a lot of control of the size of the holes in the filter, or more accurately, the variation of the sizes of the holes. Put simply, you need to make sure that all the holes are small enough to keep the salt out if you want to achieve true desalination. When it comes to that level of accuracy, we aren't quite there on the production side. We are, however, pretty close and getting closer every day. Second, you've got to make sure that the filter stays stable under pressure; if it breaches you're going to lose a lot of process. The standard methods of reinforcing traditional filters should translate pretty easily to graphene though, so all in all it's looking pretty promising.\n\nWe may not have jetpacks or flying cars yet, but graphene is looking like it may prove to be the sort of infinitely useful space age material that always gets such stupid names in sci-fi movies. And if the past is any indication, this isn't the end of graphene's application potential. Any bets on what's next?\n\nNot currently doable with modern materials. When they figure out how to make cable out of graphene or carbon nanotubes, then we'll be in business.\n\nAnonymous\n\nGulf countries would greatly benefit from this. The current water/electric infrastructure setup are power plants running on natural gas: boil sea water, turbines spin, collect fresh water from the boiled sea water!\n\nGiles1414\n\nWhat's to prevent the filter from quickly getting blocked (with salt) and what method is there to prevent this? What energy is required to flush the salt from the blocked filter?\n\nOMCV\n\nThis is just a better RO membrane. Most membranes packs are spiral wound to maximize surface area which makes pumps more effective then gravity or a centrifuge for applying pressure. When you don't know how well your system works you can always claim the theoretical maximum.\n\nOMCV\n\nJust as a reference the osmotic pressure of sea water is 20-25 atm. To reach that pressure via gravity requires a column >190 meters. lifting water 190 meter requires a lot of pumps and infrastructure and it would be better just to use the pumps to push the sea water against the membrane.\n\n Will Curry\n\nIn a vertically mounted or inclined drum the excess salt will be constantly flushed from the inner surface (the mineral side) by simply introducing more raw water than can be processed through the filter and allowing the excess to fall through, then reintroducing the higher salinity waste back into the inflow until it reaches a saturation level, which becoming inefficient, requires introduction of a refreshed salt water supply.\n\nCheddarlump\n\nYou simply leave an outlet for the salty water. So, out of 100 gallons going in to the filter, you get maybe 20 gallons of fresh water out, and flush the remaining 80 gallons of slightly saltier water back out.\n\nAnonymous\n\nI hope the process does get commercialized. It would be great for southern California. Would give them a readily available source of water, they would no longer have to steal water from farmers and other distant sources to maintain their lifestyles.\n\n Levi Clark\n\nWhat about using this process to sort heavy water from water, also if the size of the mesh is that perfect won't it sort bacteria and other imputities. This might move beyond desalination to your every day sewer and water plant.\n\nBTW I would think that the centripetal force would exacerbate removing impurities from the \"dirty\" side. Maintaining a constant waste flow might simplify that, but that is probably a part of reverse osmosis already?\n\nJoe Green\n\nOr you backflush, which if you use salt water will leave a little salt on the wrong side, but probably not too much.\n\nDoug Jones\n\nNope, sorry, it's bullshit. Most of the energy required for RO desalination is simply the pressure needed to force the water against the osmotic potential, the thickness of the membrane does NOT waster 99% of the pumping power. Graphene might make RO a few percent more efficient, but it's already very close to the thermodynamic limits. Typical press release hype.\n\nDoug Jones\n\nI just did some searching, current high efficiency seawater RO systems need about 40 bars of pump pressure to overcome 27 bars of osmotic pressure. So the absolute BEST that graphene systems could accomplish would be to reduce power by (40-27)/27, or about 48%. Potentially useful, but not world-changing.\n\nAnonymous\n\nThis is probably a stupid question, but why not flip the filter so water dripps vertically downward and filtered water is then physically separated from the filter.\nMy understanding of your comment is 27bars is needed to keep the filtered water from passing backward through the filter (natural mechanism to balance concentrations), but if you put the water on \"top\" and drip through the filter wouldn't a) that create natural pressue to push water through the filter and b) prevent water from passing back up because it already dripped away from the filter physcially??\n\nDoug Jones\n\nGravity won't get a chance to form drips if the water never gets through the membrane in the first place. The 27 bars is absolutely required to get any flow at all- what happens to the water after passing through is irrelevant.\n\nMaxsuel, Brasil\n\ne filtrar o vapor? pode ser viável.\n\nSlacknup\n\nNo Back flushing. Just do what traditional RO units do. Recycle the salt water on the high pressure side and bleed off concentrate to maintain desired concentration.\n\nHeres an idea. Sell the concentrate to a \"sea salt\" company. Of courrse they would have to set up manufacturing close to the source.\n\nGuest\n\nSome kind of device for making legible marks on paper?\n\nAbc\n\nwater changes everything…\n\nMercurytraveller\n\nThe main question is: \"what is the required pressure for this system to work?\" Is it the same as with the other membranes, or much lower?\n\nWindfarmer\n\nNot if the membrane exits to air, for example on a drip tube irrigating plants but fed with saline water.\n\n Robert Davis\n\nBut you also need to consider membrane flow rate. Even if the pressure is still 40 bars but the flow rate is much faster, you will purify that much more water for a given pump power. That assumes the flow rate is mainly limited by the membrane rather than the pump."

      "text": "Recently, Boston College researchers observed the so-called \"hot electron\" effect in a solar cell for the first time, and then harvested the charges with ultra-thin solar cells.\n\nWhat does this mean for you and for me? The short answer is: improved solar panel efficiency.\n\nGenerally speaking, when UV light is captured in solar cells, it generates free electrons in a range of energy states. In order to capture the charges and convert them to renewable electricity, the electrons must reach the bottom of the conduction band. In the past, one of the biggest hurdles has been the fact that the highly energized \"hot\" electrons lose much of their energy to heat along the way.\n\nYou can see hot electrons in devices like semiconductors. Yet, the high kinetic energy can cause the electrons, also known as \"hot carriers,\" to degrade a device. For years, researchers have theorized about the benefits of harnessing hot electrons for solar power through so-called \"3rd generation\" devices.\n\nThin Solar is In\n\nScientists are now using ultra-thing solar cells (less than 30 nanometers thick) in a mechanism that can extract hot electrons before they cool. This may effectively open an \"escape hatch\" through which they typically don't travel.\n\nProfessor of Physics Krzysztof Kempa used the analogy of trying to heat a swimming pool with a pot of boiling water:\n\nDropHe noted:\n\n\"We have shrunk the size of the solar cell by making it thin. In doing so, we are bringing these hot electrons closer to the surface, so they can be collected more readily. These electrons have to be captured in less than a picosecond, which is less than one trillionth of a second.\"\n\nWith ultra-thin solar cells, an overall increase in efficiency of 3% can be expected with absorbers 1/50th as thick as conventional cells! The Boston College research team determined that the gains were the result of capturing hot electrons and an accompanying reduction in voltage-sapping heat. Currently, the film's efficiency is limited by the negligible light collection of ultra-thin junctions. However, by combining the film with new light-trapping technology — such as nanowire structures –we could significantly increase efficiency in an ultra-thin hot electron solar cell technology"

      "text": "Archive for the 'Burnham Energy' Category\n\nDevelopmentRelated Posts:\n\nEfforts to create electrical power from the sun's rays have been underway since the early 20th century. Historically, though, solar energy has been prohibitively expensive. Reducing its cost is a top priority of renewable energy researchers, who have focused most of their efforts on improving the output of photovoltaic panels. However, researchers at Stanford University are taking a different approach. They are working to boost the efficiency of quantum dot solar cells.\n\nSilicon surfaces have been used to generate electrical power since the 1950s, but they are limited by the fact that conventional materials can only absorb a particular wavelength of light. Due to this, their maximum theoretical efficiency rating is 31%.\n\nTo get around this problem, quantum dots were developed. They're made from minute semiconductor particles. Since the light wavelength they can absorb varies according to their size, they can potentially convert up to 65% of the solar power that reaches them into electricity. They are also cheaper to produce than traditional panels, as they are made from simple chemical reactions easily created in laboratories or industrial settings.\n\nUnfortunately, research into quantum dot solar technology has lagged behind that of other approaches. Hence, they remain inefficient in terms of real-world results. Stanford professor of chemical engineering, Stacey Bent, was pondering this when she hit upon an idea. \"I wondered if we could use our knowledge of chemistry to improve their (quantum dots) efficiency,\" she said in a recent interview.\n\nTo that end, she and a group of research assistants applied a layer of organic molecules to a group of quantum dots. When they did so, their efficiency tripled. Bent is confident that they can improve on these results.\n\nThe outcomes achieved by the Stanford team are part of a global effort to make solar power a cost-effective solution. It has already become competitive with nuclear reactors and is approaching the price levels of fossil fuels. Continuing research points towards the day when much, if not most, of humanity's energy needs will be provided by the sun.\n\nWind powered energy is an essential part of any green energy solution for the United States. However, one problem with using land-based turbines is that movement from the Earth causes friction and turbulence that cuts down on their overall efficiency. To help overcome this limitation, NASA is experimenting with an approach that solves the problem by locating the turbines 2000 feet in the air, where high-velocity winds will keep them suspended like a kite.\n\nTwo Types of Airborne Power Systems\n\nThe space agency is currently looking at a pair of systems. One relies on a spinning windborne design to rotate the generating turbine. The resulting energy is fed to the grounds by a conducting tether. The other uses a large, commercially designed kite attached to a land-based spool. Electricity is created by a cable that reels in and out continuously as the kite gains and loses altitude.\n\nThe concept relies on the fact that 90% of the power generated by turbines is created by the outer edges of the blades because they spin faster than the sections closer to the hub. This allows the spinning kite to act as a single blade tip. It also takes advantage of the fact that winds are much stronger and steadier at 2000 feet than at ground level.\n\nKept in the Air by Software\n\nUnlike conventional kites, which are usually flown by enthusiastic children on a windy day, the NASA versions will be controlled by pattern recognition software that will keep them continuously moving in a figure-eight pattern. The application that controls it is similar to Microsoft's Kinect. It alters speed, position, and orientation on a second-by-second basis to keep the device airborne and operating at peak efficiency to produce the most wind powered energy.\n\nNASA's freedom from corporate ties allows it to experiment with unusual ideas that may not have the immediate payoff expected by private enterprise. Commenting on this, NASA engineer David North said, \"we have the luxury of focusing very specifically on problems, and not having to worry about getting a commercial product fielded by a certain date.\"\n\nThe prototype models used thus far have a 10-foot wingspan, but plans call for commercial models to stretch 200 feet across. The project is based at Langley Research Base in Virginia. Test flights thus far have been done at relatively low altitudes, but NASA is seeking permission to conduct them at a 2000-foot height, considered by engineers to be the \"sweet spot\" for airborne power generation.\n\nPrivate Effort Underway in Italy\n\nAn Italian firm is in the midst of constructing their own version of a kite-driven generator near Berzano, Italy. Power yields so far are in the 1 GW per hour range, roughly equal to the output of a small nuclear reactor but with much lower operating costs. It is estimated that the facility could stay in operation 80% of the time over the course of a year, at a 90% cost savings benefit over more conventional sources.\n\nProjects Rely on Continuous Bands of Wind\n\nThe power that can be harvested from wind increases by the velocity cubed. In simple terms, this means that doubling wind speed results in eight times as much energy that can be generated. This is why airborne power systems have such great potential.\n\nA pair of massive wind bands continuously circle the earth at high altitudes, one in each hemisphere. This is free energy that literally blows right past us every moment of every day. By harnessing just a fraction of it, humanity's electricity needs could be met by wind powered energy for centuries to come, without a trace of greenhouse gases formed in the process. To take advantage of this resource requires only that we have the vision to do so.\n\nPerhaps the oldest form of renewable energy is the one that has driven windmills, flown kites, and guided sailboats for thousands of years. Yet, most people in the US are unfamiliar with the benefits of wind farms, which include:\n\nThe creation of tens of thousands of stable, high-paying jobs. The Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that by 2030, offshore and land-based wind projects could create in excess of 500,000 such positions across the country.\n\nThe potential to harvest vast amounts of green energy. The feasibility of wind farming has been demonstrated in Europe, where offshore farms capable of generating 4,000 MW of power have been built. That's enough electricity to meet the needs of 1.3 million typical US households. By 2020, European nations will have the capacity to create 40,000 MW from their offshore facilities alone. That would power almost 13 million US homes\n\nOffshore wind farms will be used to generate power for coastal cities and Great Lakes states, which together consume 80% of the electricity generated in the United States. Additionally, a 2007 DOE study showed that developing land-based farms from northern Texas to the Canadian border could supply 20% of the nation's power needs.\n\nWind energy can greatly reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses released into the air from power plants. Currently, wind farms generate around 10 million MWh annually in the United States. To create the same amount of electricity using traditional sources would release 1.8 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. That's enough carbon to fill 18,000 rail cars.\n\nOffshore wind farms actually run better during heat waves. Given some of the current weather plaguing various parts of the US, this is one of the major benefits of wind farms.\n\nOcean breezes are more powerful on hot summer days, making wind power an excellent way to meet increased demand during the months from June through August. This was proven in 2011, when farms located off the Gulf Coast helped to fill emergency needs in Texas caused by unusually hot temperatures.\n\nThere are plenty of other reasons for the United States to launch a major wind farm initiative. For example:\n\nWind power can act as a cushion against the economic shocks associated with price spikes in energy costs. Since wind is free, utilities can lock in their prices for as long as 20 years. There will be no more stock markets panics due to instability in oil production.\n\nLarge US population centers will benefit from vastly improved air quality. Traditional power plants that depend on fossil fuels spew billions of tons of particulate matter into the atmosphere, which contribute to respiratory and other diseases.\n\nThe economic benefits of wind farms will be concentrated in areas where jobs are few and far between, such as isolated rural communities in the Midwest. This will raise the standard of living for millions of Americans and offer their families a brighter future.\n\nWind farms create no air pollutants or soil contaminants. They require no mining, radioactive materials, or other threats to the environment. Tapping into the unused power that blows past our homes and businesses every day can make the world a cleaner, safer, better place to live, for us and for generations to come.\n\nAt Burnham Nationwide, we're proud to be part of the movement towards adopting eco-friendly building and power creation methods. We offer a wide range of services, including sustainability training, assistance with code compliance, and solar facility inspections. Browse our site and see what we have to offer; then, contact us with any questions or concerns you may haveTheAs renewable energy sources play an ever greater role in meeting society's power demands, solar panels will become an increasingly common sight across the country. With this trend comes the need to understand and prepare for the both the permit acquisition and solar panel inspection processes, which are required before a photovoltaic system can be switched on. Here's a look at what to expect.\n\nNOTE: This list is intended only to provide the reader with a general introduction to the subject. Specific details of the permit and inspection process will vary from one location to the next, and interested parties are encouraged to consult their local utility for more information.\n\nObtaining a Permit\n\nThe number and types of required permits will vary depending on locale. Some areas will require only building and power permits. Others may mandate approval from zoning and fire department officials as well.\n\nA set of line drawings must be submitted to the permit board, outlining the proposed project. The form these drawing must take will vary among jurisdictions, but approval of them is required before construction can commence.\n\nIf renewable energy installations are uncommon in your area, local code officials may have difficulty understanding how to examine and approve your plans. You or your representative may need to educate them on the benefits of, and procedures for, adding a solar panel array.\n\nWhat the Inspector Will Look For\n\nThe inspector will check installed panels for hot spots or other factors that may compromise safety. If problems are found, a licensed electrician will need to make the necessary corrections.\n\nThe presence of a utility AC disconnect switch will be verified. The switch should be easily seen and accessible. It should also be lockable.\n\nThe position of the circuit breaker will be located. It must conform to plan specs and not exceed 20% of the BUS rating.\n\nThe inspector will verify the presence of an AC grounding electrode system; this can either be an ufer or a rod driven into the ground. Additional grounding rods may be required as well.\n\nThe inspector will check for AC and DC disconnects near the inverter.\n\nIf DC wiring is installed within the structure, the inspector will make sure it's contained inside a metal raceway.\n\nReflective marking should be placed on cable assemblies, junction boxes, and conduits, stating \"CAUTION: SOLAR CIRCUIT.\" The inspector will verify their presence as part of the solar panel inspection.\n\nIf gas meters are nearby, the distance from them to electrical equipment will be measured. Minimum distance requirements must be met for project approval.\n\nIf a new rooftop installation is in progress, the inspector will verify all connections are in place, roof entry points are flashed and counter-flashed, and all wiring is secured properly.\n\nEquipment on the DC side of the inverter should be rated for 600 volts DC; this will be checked.\n\nIn structures with solar and through-the-lines electrical connections, the inspector will verify that the disconnection points for both are clearly marked.\n\nDon't Be Caught Unprepared\n\nObtaining an initial permit can be confusing or time-consuming. Failing an inspection can have serious consequences. Here at Burnham Nationwide, we help with both phases of your project. We're experienced permit expeditors as well as inspectors. We'll make sure your permit is approved, and your project passes the first time. We will be your liaison with local officials. We will set up the time and date of the inspection, meet with the inspector, answer his or her questions, and deliver the proper forms.

Contact us today.\n\nGenerating electricity from wave power technology has enormous potential for meeting the world's energy needs. The effort to turn the idea into reality is about to take a giant leap forward, as Lockheed Martin is partnering with New Jersey-based Ocean Power Technologies (OPT) to build a facility off the Oregon coast. Composed of 200 separate buoys, the project is expected to create 100 MWs of electricity in a clean, sustainable fashion.\n\nThe Latest in a Series of Initiatives\n\nThis isn't the first time that the aerospace giant has joined with OPT. A smaller-scale project near the Jersey shore was commissioned by the US Navy to provide power for their offshore installations. Another one off the coast of Australia is currently being built and is expected to create 19 MW of power continuously. That initiative was underwritten by Australia's Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, which provided a grant of $67 million US.\n\nDriven by Ocean-Grounded Pistons\n\nThe buoys are anchored to the ocean floor by a cable. It in turn runs into a generator driven by a piston-like structure at its base. Electricity is created by the up-and-down motion of the buoys as they bob on ocean waves. They will create enough power for 40-50,000 homes, with no use of fossil fuels or other pollutants.\n\nBuilt to Withstand Hurricanes\n\nTwo concerns about using ocean waves to create power are (1) damage from storms, and (2) periods when there are no waves. However, buoys built by OPT withstood the full force of Hurricane Irene with no problems, and excess power created by them is diverted to battery charging stations, to provide continual energy even when the ocean is calm.\n\nVast Potential\n\nSince almost half of all Americans live within 50 miles of a coastline, the potential of wave power technology and these buoys to meet residential energy needs is enormous. Along with offshore wind farms, buoy stations could be meeting most of the country's electrical demands within a decade.\n\nSome critics still say that deriving significant amounts of power from the sun's rays is a pipe dream, but a growing body of evidence is proving them wrong. As an article published in the March 16th 2011 issue of Scientific American shows, the costs of harvesting solar energy have declined dramatically over the past several decades. In fact, it appears that high efficiency solar panels are following their own version of Moore's Law.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with that term, it stems from a prediction made by Gordon E. Moore, one of the founders of Intel. In 1965, he predicted that the number of transistors that could be placed on a silicon chip would double every 24 months \"for at least 10 years.\" The prophecy was later clarified by Intel executive David House, who said that actual chip performance would double every 18 months.\n\nMoore's and House's predictions have proven uncannily correct, so much so that Intel and other chip manufacturers set their research and production goals according to them. In 1965, computers with the processing power of an arithmetic calculator filled giant rooms. Today, a single laptop computer can do vastly more work than ones built just a few years ago. As far as calculators are concerned, today we have ones that not only add and subtract, they also compute complex data using trigonometric and calculus formulas and perform other highly advanced functions – yet they fit in a shirt pocket.\n\nSolar cell prices have followed a Moore's Law-like trend during their history. In 1956, it cost $300 to generate a watt of electricity from sunlight. This figure fell to $50 per watt in the 1970s, then to $10 a watt during the 1990s. Today it hovers around $1.00 on average, with manufacturing prices as low as 75 cents a watt in some settings.\n\nThis amount is still prohibitively high compared to coal-fired power generation, which currently costs a shade under 10 cents per watt. However, if current trends continue, by 2030, high efficiency solar panels will generate energy at half the cost of methods that use fossil fuels. Years before then, they will be competitive with coal, oil, and hydroelectric plants on an economic basis. Additionally, that's not taking into consideration the environmental and financial benefits of cutting the amount of greenhouse gasses pouring into the atmosphere.\n\nSeveral factors are driving the reductions in expenses. The silicon wafers in solar cells can now be made more efficiently, thanks to the use of diamond-tipped industrial blades and other enhancements to the manufacturing process. Advances in software allow panel farms to track the sun's path across the sky more precisely. Sanyo has pioneered the construction of double-sided panels, and developments in thin-film and quantum dot technologies promise a revolution in efficiency.\n\nThe potential for harvesting energy from the sun is astounding. Every day, the amount of power that reaches the earth's surface from our home star totals 89 petawatts of power. That's 89,000,000,000,000,000 watts, more than 6,000 times the energy consumed by all human activities in a year. By capturing 1/1000th of that energy, we could supply six times the amount of electricity needed to maintain civilization at its current level and produce virtually no pollutants in exchange. The potential benefits of pursuing solar energy stagger the imagination.\n\nBecoming part of this revolution requires going through a variety of permit applications and inspections. Let us help you with that end of things. We can assist in expediting the permit process, allowing your project to commence faster. Also, upon completion, we can help with solar panel inspection as well, letting you enjoy the benefits of sustainable power generation sooner. Contact us todayThe degree of solar panel maintenance is directly correlated to the region of the country in which one lives. If you live in an area accustomed to snow, you can pretty much expect a higher degree of maintenance, but short of that, solar panel maintenance requires rather minimal effort.\n\nWhy is solar panel maintenanceso minimal a task? Three words: No moving parts. The first clue to solar panels' inherent low maintenance needs lies in the life of their warranties—most coming with 25- to 30-year manufacturers' performance guarantees. The only moving part involved in a solar array is the pump; so, if anything, that might be the main focus of attention.\n\nEarly versions of solar panels had somewhat fragile surfaces, which heightened the need for maintenance. However, today's versions feature practically indestructible surfaces. Despite this virtual indestructibility, solar panels are not immune to getting dirty. So removal of grime—dirt, soot, pollen, dust, bird droppings, leaves, and the like—represents the biggest single area of solar panel maintenance. In some regions of the country where pollen is prevalent, homeowners and business owners who have outfitted their buildings with a solar panel array report big accumulations when pollen particles start to bond. For this reason, pollen—a fine or coarse powder derived from seed plants—poses a major maintenance menace. Other parts of the country are dustier, and while dust may seem benign, its accumulation can negatively impact energy output.\n\nAs a result, it is recommended to clean panels at least twice a year, perhaps in March or April after the end of the rainy season and again in August or September toward summer's end. Such upkeep is a key consideration, as dirty panels tend to lose up to 15 percent of their output versus those that are kept clean.\n\nYou can take the hose to them with a moderate stream, using a gentle brush if needed to clean major grime or dirty accumulation. If you live in an area of hard water on tap, you might consider cleaning solar panel surfaces with bottled water to avoid the residue sometimes associated with some tap water.\n\nIt's not advisable to use strong detergents in cleaning solar panels. It's best to use soapy water containing a mild solvent that can then be hosed off gently. Just because panels are all but indestructible doesn't mean you shouldn't be gentle with them!\n\nAs with any technology, malfunctions might also occur with solar panels. It's a good idea to monitor power output regularly to discern if there are any variations that might alert to malfunction. Check your solar inverter's display to keep an eye on such variances, monitoring consistently on each month or with an even greater rate of frequency. In doing so, you arrive at a baseline as it relates to energy provision and can more easily spot any deficiencies.\n\nThe only other area of solar panel maintenance revolves more around their surroundings rather than the panels themselves. To avoid pollen accumulation and obstruction from falling leaves, it's good to always keep an eye on tree limbs that may stretch onto the vicinity of a solar panel array.\n\nIn short, solar panel maintenance requires little effort that building owners can easily accomplish themselves with minimal physical exertion. If this still poses a challenge, however, cleaning companies often include solar panel maintenance as part of their services.\n\nAs the trend toward sustainability grows, we have detected a growing number of clients intent on environmentally conscious design. As a result of this, Burnham increasingly advises clients on such matters.

In the future, many manufacturers will replace batteries with energy harvesting technology-a cost-effective process of converting freely available energy into electricity.\n\nThe Virginia Polytechnic Institute is located less than 100 miles from Steele's Tavern, VA, site of the first successful demonstration of a mechanized agricultural implement in 1831. Cyrus McCormick's reaper revolutionized farming in the 19th century. Today, engineers at Virginia Tech are busy working on another type of harvesting that may revolutionize consumer electronics and other industries.\n\nBatteries take up valuable space, add weight and provide limited robustness. In the future, many manufacturers plan to replace batteries with energy harvesting technology-a cost-effective process of converting freely available energy into electricity.\n\n\"Unused power exists in various forms, such as industrial machines, human activity, vehicles, vibrating structures and other environmental sources,\" says Shashank Priya, an associate professor of mechanical engineering and material science. \"Ambient, unused energy around us, just waiting to be harvested, is continually transmitted by various sources, such as radio and television towers, satellites, cellular phone antennas and portable electronics.\"\n\nPriya and his colleagues hope to tap into the vast amounts of light, thermal, mechanical, wind, acoustic and chemical energy that is wasted every day. That's why they created the Center for Energy Harvesting Materials and Systems (CEHMS) two years ago. It is the only facility of its type in the United States.\n\n\"Demand for energy harvesting products has been increasing, but industry has been unable to meet the product requirements, thus delaying the launch of this vital sector,\" says Priya, who serves as CEHMS associate director. \"At the same time, new applications have emerged, creating [a need] to discover novel materials and conversion mechanisms, and to invent micro-to-macro scale components and systems.\"\n\nThe CEHMS, a collaborative effort between academia (Virginia Tech is the lead school, working with the University of Texas at Dallas) and industry, was formed to address these critical needs. Priya believes the organization's R&D efforts will spawn a new generation of products and industries. Smart homes, smart highways, cell phones, music players, radar, GPS and automobiles are a few areas that will directly benefit from CEHMS achievements.\n\nThe Virginia Tech engineers are also developing the architecture for \"self-powered sensors\" and opening the pathway for distributed power sources. Priya says they plan to \"demonstrate harvesters utilizing single and multimodal conversion mechanisms, adaptive energy harvesting circuits, intelligent energy management systems and conformal storage media.\"\n\nFourteen Virginia Tech faculty members from the College of Engineering and College of Science are currently involved in CEHMS research involving both civilian and defense applications. For instance, they're working on aircraft structural health monitoring, bridge health monitoring, cell phone recharging, human body energy harvesting and ocean wave energy harvesting. Other activities involve replacing wiring for sensors and actuators with wireless devices that generate their own electricity.\n\n\"Currently, the focus is on full system design, where we try to integrate all the components- harvester, electronics, storage and wireless sensor node-within the given constraints,\" says Priya. \"Each of these components always should have high efficiency.\"\n\nThe CEHMS hosts an annual meeting that attracts a wide variety of energy harvesting experts.

      "text": "The Initiative for Sustainability and Energy at Northwestern (ISEN) and the Argonne-Northwestern Solar Energy Research Center welcome you to the 5th annual ANSER Solar Energy Symposium, titled Solar Fuels: Challenges and Opportunities.\n\nHarnessing the power of the sun to produce electricity has become wide-spread reality. Photovoltaic solar cells are an increasingly common sight in our daily lives. However, solar electricity is only one thrust of current cutting-edge research in this field. While electricity is critical for sustaining many of our needs for energy it provides insufficient and inadequate solutions for transportation, i.e. fuels for cars, trucks and airplanes. New synthetic routes for these transportation fuels must be created and developed to sustain global economic progress and worldwide population growth. Solar electricity is hampered by the fact that the sun does not shine for 24 hours on the same spot and that the energy must therefore be intermittently stored in batteries. What is the problem with current batteries? About half a ton of the best batteries available today have an energy equivalent of about 2 gallons(!) of gasoline. This comparison dramatically highlights the need for producing fuels directly from the sun.\n\nThese so-called Solar Fuels are not derived from plants and other living organisms. They are synthetically produced by exploring efficient, earth-abundant catalysts that can convert sunlight and water into hydrogen, and ultimately, combine the latter with CO2 to obtain combustible liquids that drive our vehicles. Developing an efficient supply system for solar fuels requires the build-up of a new solar fuel industry, similar to the great industrial productions lines that manifested the birth of the modern petrochemical industry. The renowned speakers at the 2012 Symposium will present their research results and focus on the fundamental scientific challenges that need to be overcome in order to accomplish this perhaps greatest goal of our times.\n\nPlease join us for the entire day, or just for one talk - whatever your schedule may permit. I hope that you will arrive with an open mind, ask questions while you are here, and leave feeling engaged and informed. Please refer to the schedule here."

      "text": "WASHINGTON - A bacterium that can remove uranium contamination from groundwater may also be able to generate electricity, U.S. researchers said Thursday.\n\nScientists who deciphered the gene map of Geobacter sulfurreducens say it has more than 100 genes that should enable it to make chemical changes in metals that would generate electricity.\n\nWriting in the journal Science, they said the bacterium might be useful in generating electricity deep underwater, for instance, and might be far more useful than previously thought in cleaning up the environment.\n\n\"The genome of this tiny microorganism may help us to address some of our most difficult cleanup problems and to generate power through biologically based energy sources,\" U.S. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham said in a statement.\n\n\"This genome sequence and the additional research that it makes possible may lead to new strategies and biotechnologies for cleaning up groundwater at DOE (the Department of Energy) and at industry sites.\"\n\nThe team at The Institute for Genomic Research in Rockville, Maryland and at the University of Massachusetts found G. sulfurreducens had 100 or more genes that appear to encode for various forms of c-type cytochromes. These are proteins that help move electrons back and forth.\n\nIt also has genes that help it find metallic compounds. Plus the bacterium, previously thought to be able to exist only in the absence of oxygen, may have genes that would allow it to function when oxygen is present.\n\n\"We've provided a comprehensive picture that has led to fundamental changes in how scientists evaluate this microbe,\" said Barbara Methe, the TIGR researcher who led the study.\n\nThe first Geobacter species to be discovered, G. metallireducens, was found in sediments from the Potomac River, which separates Maryland from Virginia in the Washington D.C. area.\n\nG. sulfurreducens was found in a soil sample in Oklahoma that was contaminated by hydrocarbons -- breakdown products of fossil fuel combustion.\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts researcher Derek Lovley and colleagues have previously found that G. sulfurreducens can convert uranium that is dissolved in water to a solid compound called uraninite, which can then be removed.\n\nThe bacteria removed about 70 percent of the uranium from a contaminated underground aquifer.\n\nA manga about the effects of the United States using depleted uranium in its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq will be published in book form following massive public acclaim, according to publisher Kodansha Ltd.\n\nHundreds responded to the story when it ran in the weekly Shonen Magazine, prompting Kodansha to bring out the book some time next month.\n\nManga has helped formulate many people's views on the wars and taught others about depleted uranium bullets for the first time. \"Newspapers and TV haven't really devoted a great deal of time to coverage of the depleted uranium issue, so the manga seems to have slipped into that gap,\" a Kodansha spokesman said.\n\nShonen Magazine started in May to run a column by Tetsu Nakamura, head of an NGO offering medical support in Iraq.\n\nWhen it was completed, Kodansha editors decided to run a follow-up featuring the war in Iraq. Cartoonist Yoshiharu Mitsue, who also illustrated Nakamura's column, decided to tell the story of Takashi Morizumi, a photojournalist focusing on the use of depleted uranium bullets. The acclaimed story tells of Morizumi's encounters with victims of the Iraq war and the effects radiation from the controversial bullets has had on their bodies.\n\nResponse to the story was astounding, primarily coming from male students, housewives and high schoolgirls.\n\nAbout 80 percent of messages the publisher has received have been antiwar or anti-American in nature. Dissenting voices have also been heard.\n\n\"Don't make out the United States as the only bad guy,\" one letter read, while another pointed out: \"(Deposed Iraqi President Saddam) Hussein was also bad. It would have been a better story if you had written what caused the wars.\" (Mainichi Shimbun, Japan, Dec. 12, 2003)\n\nChancellor Gerhard Schröder has said he will not rethink his decision to allow Siemens to ship a mothballed nuclear reprocessing plant to China. His government's junior coalition partner, the Greens, must deal with the dissent within the party on their own, he said.\n\nForeign Minister Joschka Fischer, a member of the Greens, called the decision \"bitter\" but said the government had no legal basis to withhold export approval. \"This isn't a question of credibility or a lack of credibility but an obligation to uphold the law. On the other hand, if you ask me about the political implications of the whole thing, I can only stress that we are all convinced that we should not only get out of atomic energy but that we should also implement that decision.\"\n\nThe Environment Minister, Jürgen Trittin, who pushed through legislation to phase out nuclear energy in Germany, has not made a statement on the facility's sale. \"The minister of the environment went into hiding, but it's not right that he hasn't said anything about this issue,\" said Albert Schmidt, a member of parliament.\n\nLacking support from their own top-ranked politicians, the Greens said they hoped Washington would move to stop the sale. Greens party leader Angelika Beer speculated that the United States would intervene because of China's nuclear armament. \"I don't think that the Americans are excited by this,\" she said on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. state department said the government does not oppose the sale, according to Handelsblatt newspaper. Schröder preempted potential controversy with Washington by promising to involve the International Atomic Energy Commission in the sale of the plutonium enrichment facility.\n\nThe chancellor had announced his intention to support the sale of the reprocessing plant during his visit to China last week, where he also called for an end to the 14-year EU weapons embargo against that country. Imposed after troops gunned down a revolt on Peking's Tiananmen square in 1989, this embargo has come to be seen by EU businesses as a political boomerang for trade. If the EU arms embargo falls, a much bigger beneficiary could be Germany's struggling armaments industry, which is currently being bought up by U.S. investors because the volume of EU military contracting is too small to sustain it.\n\nSchröder, who is on record for opposing this sellout of weapons technology to non-European interests, has taken concrete steps to protect the domestic weapons industry from foreigners. On Wednesday, his cabinet signed off on legislation that would put the final decision about the sale of stakes in German military contractors in the hands of the government.\n\nGermany's plans to promote the EU's weapons industry received another boost earlier this week when the EU heads of government and state agreed to adopt the joint proposal of Germany, France and Belgium made last May to set up a general staff for central military planning and execution, a plan that is fiercely opposed by the U.S. government.\n\nThis autumn, the U.S. diplomat at Nato, Nicholas Burns, had called the EU's plan to set up its own general staff for planning and carrying out military action \"the most significant threat to Nato's future.\"\n\nIndividual member countries are free to join the new military alliance. The EU military staff in Brussels will be expanded. At the same time, the EU's military planning group, which currently has its office at Nato, will be established on a permanent basis.\n\nThe expected uproar over the likely export of a plutonium plant to China has now been raised - not by the three Green party ministers in Germany's coalition government, but among second and third-level politicians. And the arguments of parliamentarians, who years ago found strong words to condemn the \"nuclear mafia,\" sound strangely feeble.\n\n\"This has to be examined,\" they say, adding that \"everything needs to be done\" to prevent the export. Those are the words of people who know they have already lost the fight. The cabinet has already made its decision, and what follows now is nothing but a futile rearguard action.\n\nThe callousness with which Chancellor Gerhard Schröder is now supporting the sale of the plutonium plant, sitting unused near Frankfurt, mocks the propaganda with which the constructors of the facility were once forced to capitulate in Germany. In fact, Germany is one of the few countries in which the hazardous business of dealing with plutonium can be carried out safely; the necessary precondition is an open society with reliable watchdogs and high technical standards, but China, as a single-party state, does not entirely fulfill these preconditions. Therefore, selling the technology to the Chinese is less responsible than operating it in Germany.\n\nIndeed, the use of nuclear energy in Germany is being wound down not because the risks cannot be controlled, but because of political resistance to the technology. To this day, Social Democrats and Greens are proud to have spoilt this business for industry through \"exit-oriented legislation\" that is nothing more than bureaucratic bullying.\n\nThe world noticed, with both bafflement and amusement, that Germany voluntarily relinquished its leading position in this technology and instead concentrated on the production of wind mills. Meanwhile, the high-temperature reactor, which is immune to the much-feared core meltdown and was also invented in Germany, is being readied for serial production in South Africa and China.\n\nIt might return to Germany from there one day.\n\n-------- india / pakistan\nPakistan Holds Scientists for Questioning\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nNEW YORK TIMES\n\n\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Dec. 11 - Government officials confirmed Thursday that they were questioning two Pakistani nuclear scientists who were reported missing on Sunday. But they denied newspaper reports that the scientists were under investigation for sharing nuclear weapons technology with Iran.\n\nMasood Khan, a foreign ministry spokesman, said there were no links between the scientists and Iran's nuclear weapons program. He said the scientists were only being \"debriefed\" and had not been taken into custody.\n\n\"People associated with sensitive programs in Pakistan are governed by stringent personnel dependability,\" he told reporters here. \"The debrief program will end soon.\"\n\nTwo major Pakistani newspapers carried reports this week identifying the scientists as Dr. Yasin Chohan and Dr. Muhammad Farooq and saying that they were being questioned for possible links to the Iranian nuclear program.\n\nThe men held senior positions in Kahuta at the Khan Research Laboratories, named for Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, the founder of Pakistan's nuclear program.\n\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- One of two Pakistani nuclear engineers detained for unspecified reasons has been released, officials said Friday.\n\nYasin Chuhan, a senior engineer at Pakistan's main nuclear weapons laboratory, was released Thursday after four days in custody.\n\nHis colleague, Mohammad Farooq, a former director general at the laboratories, was still being questioned but might be freed soon, officials said. He is a former aide to Abdul Qadeer Khan, the founder of Pakistan's nuclear program.\n\nThe government insists the two men were not arrested but has refused to say why they were being questioned.\n\nOn Friday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan said Chuhan has ``resumed his normal duties'' after the completion of ``debriefing sessions.''\n\nChuban works for the main nuclear weapons program at Khan Research Laboratories, according to the Federation of American Scientists.\n\nPakistan, a nuclear-armed nation, has been accused of sharing its technological know-how with other countries -- including Iran and North Korea. It denies the charge.\n\nLast year, Pakistan detained a former nuclear scientist, Sultan Bashiruddin Mehmood, on suspicion of having links with Osama bin Laden.\n\nMehmood, who worked for Pakistan's Atomic Energy Commission until his retirement in 1999, was later freed.\n\nKARACHI (Reuters) - With one eye on nuclear rival India, Pakistan launched its first home-made submarine on Friday in what the navy called a ``quantum leap'' toward military self-reliance.\n\nAt a ceremony at Karachi's naval dockyard, President Pervez Musharraf inaugurated the Agosta 90B submarine five years after construction began with the help of French state-controlled naval shipbuilder Direction des Constructions Navales (DCN).\n\n``It has given a considerable boost to our defense capabilities,'' the military leader said. ``Pakistan has joined the elite group of countries which can construct submarines. It is a step toward self-reliance.''\n\nThe launch of the vessel was delayed by the U.S.-led war in neighboring Afghanistan and the killing in May 2002 of 11 French naval technicians working on the project by a suicide bomber. The attack has been linked to Islamic militant groups in Pakistan.\n\n``I express my heartfelt condolences to the families of the French engineers who lost their lives in this gruesome attack,'' Musharraf said.\n\nThe diesel-electric submarine is the second of three to be constructed under a deal with France, and the navy said in a statement it would go on building conventional submarines once they were finished. The first of the three was built in France and has been in service with the Pakistan navy since 1999.\n\nThe Agostas have been fitted with modern command and control systems and are capable of launching anti-ship missiles and torpedoes. It is designed as an anti-submarine, anti-surface and intelligence gathering resource.\n\nMAIN THREAT INTERNAL\n\nMusharraf said the main threat to Pakistan was not ``external,'' but came from religious extremism and sectarianism.\n\n``This menace of extremism is eating us like termites. All Muslims are facing a threat because of it,'' he said.\n\nBut the navy made a pointed reference to India:\n\n``The induction of this new submarine...will help maintain peace and stability in this volatile region by deterring our main adversary from any kind of adventurism,'' the statement said.\n\nPakistan has become increasingly alarmed at aggressive defense acquisitions by India in recent years, saying that they could further upset the military balance in South Asia in conventional and nuclear forces.\n\nMusharraf recently banned six radical Islamic groups, some of which had already been outlawed but reappeared under new names.\n\nThe groups have been blamed for a wave of violence aimed at Western and Christian targets as well as Pakistanis from rival Muslim sects.\n\nSome outfits have been linked to the al Qaeda network and others are involved in a separatist insurgency in the disputed Kashmir region, the trigger for two of three wars between India and Pakistan since independence from Britain.\n\nThe neighbors are taking tentative steps toward peace after coming to the brink of war last year, although there is little prospect of a swift resolution to the core Kashmir issue.\n\nMusharraf criticized India for building a fence along the heavily militarized de facto border dividing the two countries in the Himalayan region.\n\n``There should be no change on the Line of Control, especially when there are talks of rapprochement.''\n\nBoth countries are holding to a cease-fire along the frontier ahead of a regional summit in Islamabad in January which may provide a platform for further peace initiatives.\n\n-------- israel\nAgency Thinks Israel Has Nuclear Weapons\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said in an interview published Friday that he believes Israel has nuclear weapons and suggested Israel rid itself of the stockpile to promote Mideast peace.\n\nMohamed ElBaradei also revealed that he has toured some of Israel's nuclear plants, although not the reactor in the southern town of Dimona where it is believed Israel produces arms.\n\nElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, spoke to the Israeli daily Haaretz at his office in Vienna. The newspaper didn't say when the interview was conducted.\n\nElBaradei said he has made several visits to Israel, most recently in the late 1990s when he met with Benjamin Netanyahu, who was then prime minister. The visits were not made public at the time.\n\nThe newspaper said ElBaradei came as a guest of the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission. ElBaradei has been a senior member of the International Atomic Energy Agency since 1984.\n\nElBaradei said his most recent contact with Israeli leaders was a meeting in Vienna with Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom. The newspaper did not say when the meeting occurred.\n\nElBaradei said he cannot confirm independently that Israel has nuclear arms, but that ``we work on the assumption that Israel has nuclear capability.''\n\n``I haven't seen that Israel ever denied it,'' he added.\n\nIsrael has refused to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, aimed at stopping the spread of nuclear weapons, because it objects to international inspections.\n\nAlthough widely assumed to have a stockpile of nuclear weapons, the government's public policy is purposely vague, stating only that Israel will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle East.\n\nIn 1986, Mordechai Vanunu, a former technician at the Dimona plant, gave pictures of his workplace to The Times of London. Based on the photographs, scientists at the time said Israel had the sixth-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world. Vanunu is serving an 18-year term for treason and espionage.\n\nIn his talks with Israeli officials, ElBaradei said he ``raised the regional situation and issues of nuclear weapons with them. The status quo is not one with which I feel comfortable.''\n\nHe told Haaretz that opening discussions on the nuclear issue does not prejudge their outcome but dialogue is essential to reduce tension.\n\n``My fear is that without such a dialogue, there will be continued incentive for the region's countries to develop weapons of mass destruction to match the Israeli arsenal,'' he said.\n\n``As I go around the Middle East there is a sensation of frustration and impotence. People say there is an asymmetrical situation and a situation that is not sustainable and that we cannot go on like this, and I agree.''\n\nA northern village is in the running for a multinational fusion project.\n\n`If researchers come to Aomori, the impression of outsiders will change.' MITSUO HAYASHI President of the Aomori chamber of commerce\n\nA village in Japan's northern snow country could become the home of a roiling cauldron of power to rival the sun. How hot would it get? Somewhere above 100 million degrees.\n\nRokkasho, in Aomori Prefecture, is one of two candidates for an international fusion project. It is also the site of a facility now under construction to reprocess spent nuclear fuel so plutonium can be extracted and used in the nation's nuclear-fuel recycling program.\n\nThe other candidate to host the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is Cadarache in France, which was chosen by the European Union in November.\n\nNuclear fusion is considered a dream energy source because it would use fuel and materials that are fairly abundant. A nuclear fusion reactor could not operate on a commercial basis until the end of the century, experts say.\n\nTheoretically, one gram of fusion fuel will produce the same energy as eight tons of petroleum. The goal of the ITER project is more modest: to produce more than 10 times the energy used and to maintain nuclear fusion continuously-for more than five minutes.\n\n-Still the operation will have to cope with extraordinary levels of energy. About 500,000 kilowatts of electricity will be needed. Part of the problem, then, will be to harness all that power-enough to rip apart atoms and vaporize their cores.\n\nThe solution will be a tokamak-style vacuum container shaped like a doughnut. Its outer diameter will be about 20 meters.\n\nSuperconducting magnetic coils will confine and heat the fuel, deuterium and tritium, to temperatures above 100 million degrees. At that temperature, the fuel becomes a plasma, in which atomic nuclei and electrons are separated.\n\nThe site to host the ITER is expected to be selected at a ministerial meeting set for Dec. 20 in Washington, D.C. Victory, however, will come at a price, with the finalist contributing the lion's share of about 300 billion yen for construction and equipment.\n\nThe total cost for all participants is expected to reach 1.3 trillion yen over the 20-year life of the project. The budget was decided in Dec. 4-5 negotiations in Vienna. ITER members are Japan, the EU, Russia, Canada, the United States, China and South Korea.\n\nInternational negotiations to pick the construction site, as well as participants in operating the ITER facility, got under way in November 2001. Japan offered Rokkasho as a candidate in May 2002.\n\nThe selection of the construction site will be made through a vote of the seven members.\n\nScience and technology ministry officials have been lobbying their counterparts in China and South Korea to back Japan. However, an official with the Cabinet Office said China appears to be leaning toward France, but Russia may back Japan.\n\nOther government officials said they hoped lingering ill will between the United States and France over the war in Iraq will work in Tokyo's favor.\n\nAomori business circles are keen for Rokkasho to win.\n\n``If advanced technology and researchers come to Aomori, which has a negative image as being at the end of the northern part of Honshu, the impression of outsiders toward us will change,'' said Mitsuo Hayashi, president of the Federation of Aomori Prefecture Chambers of Commerce and Industry.\n\nConstruction of the experimental reactor will cost about 570 billion yen and take about a decade to complete. In addition, about 600 billion yen will be needed to operate and maintain the facility during its life span.\n\nCanada said it cannot pay its share, which leaves financing to the other six members. The United States, China, Russia and South Korea will pay 10 percent each.\n\nThe winner of the construction site contest, either Japan or France, will pay about 48 percent and the loser the rest.\n\nIn addition to construction, the winner will pay all costs for equipment: price tag about 90 billion yen.\n\nExpenses will also be incurred for improving roads to the facility and housing and schools for foreign researchers and their families.\n\nThe Cabinet approved the Rokkasho candidate on condition no special fiscal measures would be implemented. That means the budget for other science and technology projects will have to be cut.\n\nAmong the projects that could be affected are the high-intensity proton accelerator under construction jointly by the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization and the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI).\n\nTOKYO: Japanese protesters on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to change his mind about sending troops to Iraq, saying the plan was a violation of the country's pacifist constitution.\n\n\"Don't kill!\" said a banner held by about 20 members of the anti-war group Peaceboat, as they gathered across a street from the prime minister's official residence.\n\n\"Dispatching the Self Defence Forces to Iraq violates our constitution, which forbids the use of military forces,\" Peaceboat director Tatsuya Yoshioka said through a loud-hailer. \"If Japan cannot follow its own laws, how can it be a protector of democracy in Iraq?\" he added.\n\nProtesters held placards denouncing Koizumi and his allies as \"war criminals\". Japan's post-war pacifist constitution bans the use of Japanese force as a means of settling international disputes.\n\nThe dispatch has prompted deep unease among the Japanese public, with the latest survey by the national broadcaster NHK showing only 17 percent of voters supported sending the troops as soon as possible, while 28 percent opposed the plan outright.\n\nMalaysian PM warns: Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi has warned Japan its troops face unknown dangers in Iraq in an interview with Japanese media ahead of his visit here for a regional summit. \"You are going into a situation where you don't know what is going to happen,\" Abdullah was quoted as saying by Kyodo News agency on Tuesday.\n\n\"The situation in Iraq at the moment is not very predictable. The situation is so volatile. Opposition to the US presence in Iraq is very strong...it's a pity that the war has been won but not the peace,\" Abdullah said according to Kyodo. -AFP\n\nSouth Korea is investigating but has yet to confirm reports of fresh activity this month at North Korea's main nuclear center at Yongbyon, Unification Minister Jeong Se-hyun said yesterday.\n\nSouth Korea's JoongAng Ilbo newspaper quoted US and South Korean officials as saying an American intelligence satellite detected fumes rising from a coal-fired boiler at the nuclear lab at Yongbyon. The fumes were traced on four days this month.\n\nYongbyon, about 90km north of the capital Pyongyang, contains a nuclear reactor and a plutonium reprocessing plant at the center of the year-long crisis over the secretive communist state's attempts to build nuclear weapons.\n\n\"We are trying to confirm the activities, but at this stage I have no definitive information to disclose,\" Jeong told reporters at his weekly news conference in Seoul.\n\nState Department spokesman Steve Pike said he had not heard of new activity in the Yongbyon facility.\n\n\"It's the first I've heard,\" Pike said.\n\nJoongAng Ilbo quoted Seoul officials as saying the fumes were detected on Dec. 2, 3, 4 and 7, and that a truck was spotted travelling in and out of the premises of Yongbyon's five-megawatt nuclear reactor on Dec. 3.\n\nThe latest report comes as the US, South Korea, Japan, China and Russia are trying to convene a second round of six-way talks on the nuclear dispute with North Korea to follow an inconclusive first round held in Beijing in August.\n\nJeong said that a nuclear crisis resolution proposal worked out last week by South Korea, the US and Japan had been conveyed to North Korea by China.\n\nBut he said North Korea had not given a reply -- a critical step in getting the talks started before the end of the year, which remains a goal of South Korea.\n\nEchoing remarks on Wednesday by South Korea's Foreign Minister Yoon Young-kwan, Jeong said he didn't think a statement by North Korea on Tuesday calling the three-country proposal \"greatly disappointing\" represented Pyongyang's formal reply.\n\nNorth Korea's Foreign Ministry proposed a deal on Tuesday under which it would freeze its nuclear activities in exchange for energy aid and other diplomatic concessions from Washington and regional powers.\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) - Six-country talks to try to halt communist North Korea's nuclear weapons program -- which had been expected this month -- are likely to be put off until mid-January, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported on Friday.\n\nA senior South Korean official said a December meeting could not be ruled out, but it looked more likely the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and Russia would hold a second round of nuclear talks with North Korea next month, it said.\n\nBut Japan's Fuji TV network reported that preparations were still underway to try to hold the talks in Beijing from Dec. 17, which remains the goal of South Korea and its allies.\n\nA senior U.S. official in Washington played down the chances of talks this month, saying: ``I guess at this point I would say it's not impossible, rather than it's possible.''\n\nThe official said if there were to be talks next week, the last full week before the Christmas and New Year's holidays, a U.S. team would probably have to leave on Sunday or Monday.\n\nA European Union delegation, which arrived in South Korea on Friday after visiting North Korea, said officials in Pyongyang indicated the North would quickly join the six-way negotiations if their conditions were met.\n\n``They would answer that they're willing to go right away, but of course the question would be on which terms,'' Percy Westerlund, a senior European Commission official, said after the three-day mission to North Korea.\n\nHe said the North Koreans, including Foreign Minister Paik Nam-sun, repeated demands for security assurances and stressed a proposal they made earlier this week to freeze their arms programs in exchange for aid.\n\nThe EU officials stressed that Brussels was not a party to the six-way talks.\n\nUNDERMINING SECURITY\n\nThe Yonhap report pointed to signs that prospects for opening talks before the end of the year had dimmed: Both the South Korean and Russian chief delegates to the talks had postponed plans to fly to Beijing.\n\n``The trend is moving toward opening talks in mid-January,'' Yonhap quoted an unnamed official as saying.\n\nU.S., Asian and Russian officials have conducted intensive shuttle diplomacy in the months since Beijing hosted an inconclusive first round of six-way talks in August to try and convince North Korea to attend a second round.\n\nEarlier this week, South Korea, the United States and Japan conveyed to China their proposed wording for a resolution to end the 14-month-old crisis. Beijing then passed it on to North Korea.\n\nPyongyang, apparently responding to media reports of elements of that U.S.-led plan, pronounced it ``greatly disappointing'' and published a counter-proposal that repeated demands for energy aid and diplomatic concessions in exchange for freezing its nuclear program.\n\nPresident Bush rejected the idea of a freeze, saying Washington wanted North Korea's nuclear arms program dismantled ``in a verifiable and irreversible way.''\n\nThe EU officials said they told Pyongyang development aid and deeper economic ties required a resolution of the crisis.\n\n``They see the nuclear weapons option as an indispensable part of their national security,'' said Westerlund.\n\n``We tried to persuade them that the development of nuclear weapons did not enhance their security. In fact, we suggested to them that it undermines their security -- that the nuclear weapons issue is the core of their problem,'' he said.\n\nThe North was unmoved by such reasoning, he added.\n\nThe CIA believes the North has produced one or two nuclear weapons. The nuclear crisis erupted in October 2002 when Washington said Pyongyang had admitted having a covert nuclear program.\n\n----\nSeoul suspects nuke activity\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nTHE WASHINGTON TIMES\n\n\nSEOUL - South Korea is investigating but has yet to confirm reports of fresh activity this month at North Korea's main nuclear center at Yongbyon, Unification Minister Jeong Se-hyun told reporters yesterday.\n\nSouth Korea's JoongAng Ilbo newspaper quoted U.S. and South Korean officials as saying an American intelligence satellite detected fumes rising from a coal-fired boiler at the nuclear lab at Yongbyon. The fumes were observed on four days this month.\n\nYongbyon, about 60 miles north of the capital, Pyongyang, has a nuclear reactor and a plutonium reprocessing plant that are at the center of the year-long crisis over the secretive communist state's attempts to build nuclear weapons.\n\n\"We are trying to confirm the activities, but at this stage I have no definitive information to disclose,\" Mr. Jeong told reporters at his weekly news conference in Seoul.\n\nState Department spokesman Steve Pike said he had not heard of new activity at the Yongbyon facility.\n\n\"It's the first I've heard,\" Mr. Pike said.\n\nThe latest report comes as the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and Russia are trying to convene a second round of six-way talks on the nuclear dispute with North Korea to follow an inconclusive first round held in Beijing in August.\n\nMr. Jeong said that a nuclear crisis resolution proposal worked out last week by South Korea, the United States and Japan had been conveyed to North Korea by China.\n\nBut he said North Korea had not given a reply.\n\nIn a separate development, the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) warned yesterday that up to 3.8 million North Koreans - 17 percent of the country's population - could be deprived of critical international food aid by the end of winter.\n\nAs the first snows fall, 2.2 million are already missing WFP deliveries because of global cutbacks in donations, the agency said in a statement. The group expects to have delivered 300,000 tons of food aid, only 62 percent of what it originally requested, in 2003.\n\nThe WFP also criticized North Korea for banning the group's activities in 43 out the country's 206 counties. The WFP has a policy of not sending aid to areas its staff can't enter.\n\n\"The restrictions imposed by the government continued to seriously impact operations and made some donors reluctant to provide food aid,\" the WFP said.\n\nAccess is a key issue for the United States, which in February said it would give North Korea 40,000 tons in food aid and could offer 60,000 more depending in part on whether Pyongyang let donors track its distribution and provided access to all vulnerable groups in the country.\n\n-------- missile defense\nMissile benchmark\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nWashington Times\nInside the Ring\nBy Bill Gertz and Rowan Scarborough\n\n\nTomorrow marks the second anniversary of President Bush's announcement that the United States would pull out of the stale Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The move paved the way for deployment next year of a ground-based interceptor. When done, the missile shield is supposed to be composed of \"layered\" defenses to knock out rockets and warheads at various launch and descent phases.\n\nThe Senate Republican Policy Committee is using the anniversary to issue an eight-page call to continue funding the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency.\n\n\"A single architecture likely will not deter rogue states from ballistic missile development or proliferation,\" the report says. \"Multiple layers of missile defense - reinforced by additional allied capability - will serve as an anti-proliferation measure. As U.S. vulnerability to ballistic missiles is reduced, so will the incentive for rogue states to produce them.\"\n\n-------- u.s. nuc weapons\nU.S. Dismantles Last Nuclear Artillery Shell\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) held a ceremony today to mark the dismantling of the last nuclear artillery shell in the U.S. nuclear stockpile.\n\nThe agency has now completed the elimination from the U.S. arsenal a type of battlefield nuclear weapon that comprised a key element of America's Cold War arsenal.\n\n\"Eliminating the last nuclear artillery warhead marks the end of an era in U.S. defense policy that included ground launched battlefield nuclear weapons,\" said NNSA Administrator Linton Brooks.\n\nThe United States introduced artillery fired atomic weapons in its defense arsenal in 1957. Six types were deployed over the years - the final shell dismantled this year was a W-79, a shell designed to be fired from an eight inch artillery piece.\n\nIn 1991, President George H.W. Bush announced his decision to retire artillery fired atomic weapons in the U.S. stockpile - the decision was made unilaterally, apart from any arms control agreement with the former Soviet Union.\n\nU.S. Secretary Spencer Abraham praised the dismantling of the weapons and said the administration of President George W. Bush is \"committed to reducing the threat of nuclear weapons worldwide.\"\n\nBut critics say the Bush administration's policies are increasing the threat. The White House requested, and received from Congress, funding to research new types of nuclear weapons and the lifting of a decade old ban on researching new low yield nuclear weapons.\n\nCongress has also approved a Bush administration request to shorten the time required to prepare for a full scale nuclear test from 24 months to 18 months.\n\nThe administration received $7.5 million for research into nuclear \"bunker buster\" weapons and $6 million for low yield nuclear weapons less than five kilotons.\n\nThe Bush administration says research into these new nuclear weapons will make the nation's nuclear arsenal into a more effective deterrent, because these kinds of weapons could reduce the potential for causing civilian casualties and could improve the effectiveness of nuclear weapons in destroying deeply buried and hardened targets.\n\nBut critics are concerned that the Bush administration's plan blurs the line between the use of nuclear and conventional weapons and could undermine the international effort to contain the world's development of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe United States has more than 10,000 nuclear weapons.\n\n----\nNew nuke\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nWashington Times\nInside the Ring\nBy Bill Gertz and Rowan Scarborough\n\n\nPentagon officials were quietly overjoyed last week when President Bush signed into law the 2004 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act. Tucked away in the spending law is $7.5 million for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator. It was half the $15 million request.\n\nThe money will be spent studying the ultimate precision guided weapon: a high-yield nuclear bomb designed to drill through rock and destroy deep underground bunkers and facilities. If the weapon is built, rogue states like North Korea and Iran can forget about hiding weapons of mass destruction in rock-hardened, blast-proof shelters.\n\nAnd the penetrating nuke also would put Russia, China and other nuclear states on notice that they will be unable to protect hardened silos or cave missile complexes. Russian underwater submarine caves also could be taken out with the bomb. Pentagon officials would love to chalk a note on the penetrator before firing one into the cave used by Osama bin Laden and company in Afghanistan, when he is eventually located.\n\nLittle has been said in public about the new weapon. Linton Brooks, director of the National Nuclear Security Administration, told a Senate hearing earlier this year one idea is to use a B-61 or B-83 nuclear warhead on a new guided aerial bomb with a special nose cone that can burrow through solid rock. \"It's not just that you have to be able to penetrate,\" he said. \"We know how to make things that will penetrate. You have to be able to penetrate and still have nuclear weapons, which are actually quite intricate machines, to work right.\"\n\nBoth warheads have 350 kilotons or more of explosive power - the equivalent of 350,000 tons of TNT. The Pentagon wants a bomb that can go through 30 feet to 60 feet of solid rock before detonating. The bomb could also be used for what the Pentagon calls \"agent defeat\" - frying deadly biological or germ weapons.\n\n----\nNASA HIRES PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRM TO HELP BLUNT OPPOSITION TO NUCLEAR ROCKET\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nFrom: \"Global Network\" <globalnet@mindspring.com>\n\nFearing another public relations defeat like they got during the 1997 Cassini campaign, NASA has hired a public relations outfit to gather information from potential critics of their latest space nuclear project. Project Prometheus, the nuclear rocket, is now being developed under the Bush Nuclear Systems Initiative that will spend $3 billion during the next five years to expand the launching of nuclear power into space.\n\nI actually began organizing the Cancel Cassini Campaign in 1994 by writing articles, speaking to groups around the world, and expanding the numbers of interested contacts. By the time the 1997 launch came around and the media began paying attention to the issue, there was a tremendous grassroots movement in place to oppose the plutonium launch. Even the TV program 60 Minutes covered the issue with a story just a week before the lift-off.\n\nThis time NASA wants to be prepared. While Project Prometheus is just now in the development stage, NASA has retained The Keystone Center, based in Colorado, to gather information about potential critics so they can effectively combat any expected opposition.\n\nThe Keystone Center called the Global Network office this fall and wanted to send one of their representatives to our office in Maine to \"interview\" me about our concerns. It was clear from the conversation that the real intention of the visit was to find out what strategies we intended to employ to block the launch of the nuclear rocket. I didn't want to have any part in helping NASA -- they have lots of money and easy access to the corporate dominated media. Neither was I about to help The Keystone Center, which is being paid quite well with taxpayer dollars, I'm sure. I told them I was not interested in being \"interviewed\" and left it at that.\n\nJust today in the mail, I received a letter from The Keystone Center once again asking me to submit to an interview. In the letter they say that they'd like to \"converse with you about NASA's Project Prometheus Nuclear Systems Program......We are undertaking a round of meetings and structured interviews with some 25 people, many of whom are long-standing skeptics or critics of NASA. Our sole focus is to understand what public involvement strategies, above and beyond the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), might be appropriate for NASA as they begin to develop Project Prometheus.\"\n\nSo basically The Keystone Center is being paid big bucks by NASA to find out what \"critics\" are saying and/or planning around Project Prometheus so they can then advise NASA on the best way to sell the project to the public and blunt the critics. And they have the audacity to ask me to help them!\n\nI know we should take this as a supreme compliment. NASA is worried about the work of the Global Network. They fear the public response to Bush's plan to dramatically expand the launching of nuclear power into space. And so they should! But to ask us to help them create a plan to circumvent our very opposition is the height of arrogance.\n\nWhat made it fun though was that a reporter from the New York Times also called today. The Times is doing a story on Project Prometheus and wanted to know if we were going to organize to oppose it. I told him that we were already organizing and he wanted to know why he had not seen anything in the media. I told him the reason was because the corporate media usually isn't very interested in what we have to say. He then said that he doubted that NASA was very worried about our opposition and I said, \"Hey let me read you this letter I just got from The Keystone Center.\" After hearing the content the reporter asked me to fax him the letter, which I gladly did.\n\nThe New York Times called because Bush is expected very soon to make a big announcement about going back to the moon and Mars. The nuclear rocket will be a key component of this plan. At a time when we are facing massive budget deficits Bush is going to promote his \"big idea\" to spend $50 - $150 billion on this moon base mission.\n\nIt just goes to show that our work is being watched by the government and the corporate media. They know what we are doing, and as much as they like to make us think they ignore us, they don't. They watch all of us like a hawk because they are worried to death that the public might catch onto what we have to say. If anything should tell us to keeping doing what we are doing, this is it.\n\nSo put this one into your mental file cabinet -- NASA's Project Prometheus, the nuclear rocket. Keep it close to your heart because it is going to be another hot issue down the road. How do I know that? Well, The Keystone Center told me so.\n\nThe Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) has presented a report to Congress which raises serious questions about the safe long- term storage of weapons plutonium at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Savannah River Site (SRS), located in South Carolina.\n\nThe report will likely have impacts on both the DOE's troubled plutonium disposition (MOX) program as well as further plutonium shipments to SRS, the site chosen for consolidation of DOE surplus plutonium. (See URL for report below.)\n\nThe DNFSB, an independent panel which oversees the environmental impact of DOE's nuclear weapons programs, was required under the Defense Authorization Act of FY 2003 to produce a report on the storage of plutonium in aging facilities at SRS. Given DOE's consolidation of plutonium storage at SRS, Congress determined it necessary to evaluate the implemented plutonium storage plan, one which had been drastically altered from earlier plans.\n\nThe DNFSB pointed out that DOE lacked \"careful, consistent planning\" in regards to plutonium storage at SRS and that DOE had foreclosed \"cost-effective and safety-conscious\" options by choosing to store plutonium in a closed 50-year old nuclear reactor at SRS. DOE has stood by plans to store plutonium in the old K-Reactor building (K-Area Material Storage facility, KAMS) for the long-term (up to 50 years) but the DNFSB stated in the report that storage KAMS could be done safely only for a period of \"roughly 4 to 5 years\" and beyond this amount of time only if safety improvements were undertaken.\n\nGreenpeace International has long-maintained that KAMS, not built to store nuclear materials, was improper for long-term plutonium storage and was chosen simply to cut costs, thus placing cost concerns far above safety considerations. DOE refused to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the use of KAMS for storage of plutonium in spite of known concerns.\n\nDOE has shipped all remaining weapons plutonium to SRS from the Rocky Flats site in Colorado and is now secretly developing plans to ship several tons of contaminated weapons plutonium from the Hanford site in Washington State to SRS. Given the DNFSB concerns, stated in the report, that \"DOE has no apparent plan for the disposition of approximately 5 metric tons of excess plutonium\" the issue of shipping yet more plutonium to SRS will spark controversy given that \"disposition\" of this material is unknown.\n\nIt is believed that DOE is once again looking at building an immobilization facility to mix plutonium in existing high-level waste, a program which was terminated in 2002. Greenpeace continues to support immobilization of all surplus plutonium on cost, environmental and non-proliferation grounds and thus believes that DOE should manage surplus plutonium as waste. The DNFSB report should bolster arguments to slow down the costly MOX program and reevaluate rapid implementation of the cheaper and quicker immobilization option.\n\nDue to probelms with the MOX program in the US and Russia, it is rumored that the MOX program has fallen another year behind schedule though DOE has not publicly admitted this yet.\n\no \"DOE has no apparent plan\" to dispose of 5 tons of dirty plutonium which can't be processed into plutonium fuel (MOX) o proposes installation of fire protection systems at KAMS for storage longer than 4-5 years o DOE should proceed with plutonium removal from the 235-F Building and upgrade as necessary for long- term storage\n\no \"DOE recognizes the importance of establishing a disposition path, and to that end formed a team in 2002 to determine a disposition path for material not planned for MOX fuel. Unfortunately, progress made on this task has been slow. So far, no technically feasible path forward has been approved. DOE needs to expedite this task to preclude unnecessary extended storage of plutonium at SRS.\"\n\nGiven the environmental and health impact to residents of South Carolina and Georgia in case of an accident in a plutonium storage or handling facility at SRS, Greenpeace believes that DOE must take immediate steps to upgrade plutonium storage conditions and halt further consideration of more plutonium shipments to the old facilities at SRS.\n\nFriday, Dec. 12, the PBS television program NOW with Bill Moyers will air a report on Bush administration secrecy produced in collaboration with U.S. News. Please visit pbs.org for stations and airtimes in your area. The U.S. News article, \"Keeping Secrets,\" will be publshed in Monday's edition. Full text will be available on USNews.com Saturday, Dec. 13, at 6 p.m.\n\nThe Bush administration has removed from the public domain millions of pages of information on health, safety, and environmental matters, lowering a shroud of secrecy over many critical operations of the federal government.\n\nThe administration's efforts to shield the actions of, and the information held by, the executive branch are far more extensive than has been previously documented. And they reach well beyond security issues.\n\nA five-month investigation by U.S. News details a series of initiatives by administration officials to effectively place large amounts of information out of the reach of ordinary citizens, including data on such issues as drinking-water quality and automotive tire safety. The magazine's inquiry is based on a detailed review of government reports and regulations, of federal agency Web sites, and of legislation pressed by the White House.\n\nU.S. News also analyzed information from public interest groups and others that monitor the administration's activities, and interviewed more than 100 people, including many familiar with the new secrecy initiatives. That information was supplemented by a review of materials provided in response to more than 200 Freedom of Information Act requests filed by the magazine seeking details of federal agencies' practices in providing public access to government information.\n\nAmong the findings of the investigation:\n\n~Important business and consumer information is increasingly being withheld from the public. The Bush administration is denying access to auto and tire safety information, for instance, that manufacturers are required to provide under a new \"early-warning system\" created following the Ford-Firestone tire scandal four years ago. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, meanwhile, is more frequently withholding information that would allow the public to scrutinize its product safety findings and product recall actions.\n\n~New administrative initiatives have effectively placed off limits critical health and safety information potentially affecting millions of Americans. The information includes data on quality and vulnerability of drinking-water supplies, potential chemical hazards in communities, and safety of airline travel and others forms of transportation.\n\n~Beyond the well-publicized cases involving terrorism suspects, the administration is aggressively pursuing secrecy claims in the federal courts in ways little understood--even by some in the legal system. The administration is increasingly invoking a \"state secrets\" privilege that allows government lawyers to request that civil and criminal cases be effectively closed by asserting that national security would be compromised if they proceed.\n\n~New administration policies have thwarted the ability of Congress to exercise its constitutional authority to monitor the executive branch and, in some cases, even to obtain basic information about its actions.\n\nThere are no precise statistics on how much government information is rendered secret. One measure, though, can be seen in a tally of how many times officials classify records. In the first two years of Bush's term, his administration classified records some 44.5 million times, or about the same number as in President Clinton's last four years, according to the Information Security Oversight Office, an arm of the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nNew York Times\nBy ELISABETH BUMILLER\n\n\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 11 - President Bush on Thursday defended his policy of barring France, Germany, Russia and other nations from $18.6 billion in American-financed Iraqi reconstruction projects. But despite the anger the policy has aroused in foreign capitals, he said his personal envoy, James A. Baker III, would still meet with the leaders of several of those nations to ask that they forgive debts they are owed by Iraq.\n\nThe president's argument was that only those nations that contributed militarily to the American effort in Iraq should reap the benefits of the $18.6 billion that Congress approved last month for reconstruction.\n\n\"The taxpayers understand why it makes sense for countries that risk lives to participate in the contracts in Iraq,\" Mr. Bush told reporters after a cabinet meeting at the White House. \"It's very simple. Our people risk their lives. Coalition, friendly coalition folks risk their lives, and, therefore, the contracting is going to reflect that.\"\n\nAdministration officials acknowledged that Mr. Bush's position had enraged the very nations the administration was now seeking help from, and that Mr. Baker, who was appointed as the president's envoy last Friday, faced a more chaotic situation than he had expected. But the officials sought to portray Mr. Baker as undeterred.\n\n\"Was it helpful?\" said a senior administration official who asked not to be identified for fear of being seen as criticizing the president. \"Well, clearly not. But he'll find a way to work with the world as it is.\"\n\nMr. Baker is to leave on Monday from his home in Houston for a five-day, five-nation trip. He is to see the administration's chief foreign opponents in the debate over the war with Iraq: President Jacques Chirac of France, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Baker will also meet with two allies who supported Mr. Bush on the war: Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy.\n\nMr. Baker will return to Houston on Friday and brief the president by phone. Administration officials said he had no plans to return to Washington before the end of the year.\n\nA former secretary of state and former secretary of the treasury, Mr. Baker will travel to the foreign capitals by government plane from Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington. He will take with him staff members from the State Department and the Treasury Department as well as Gary Edson, a deputy national security adviser at the White House who handles international economics.\n\nMr. Baker will not have a press secretary, reporters will not travel with him, and he is not expected to hold news conferences overseas. Administration officials said Mr. Baker, who in previous administrations was extraordinarily accessible to reporters, was adamant that he not be seen as grandstanding or as undercutting Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who is the administration's chief representative overseas.\n\nBut administration officials said Mr. Baker would be seen in foreign capitals as having more leverage with Mr. Bush than Mr. Powell, who is viewed as a combatant in the Bush administration's policy wars.\n\n\"Baker is Bush,\" said a senior administration official who asked not to be identified because he was criticizing Mr. Powell. \"Other countries know that Powell doesn't win all the battles. If you deal with Baker, you know you're going to get what you need.\"\n\nMr. Baker met with Mr. Bush in the Oval Office on Wednesday, when the president gave him general instructions, a senior administration official said, to \"go and get the international community to do something about Iraq's crushing debt.\" The official said that Mr. Bush was not more specific because \"Baker knows how to do this.\"\n\nMr. Baker's approach with the foreign leaders, the official said, would be to make the president's case on keeping the $18.6 billion in the hands of alliance members while holding out the promise that there will be more construction contracts for other nations down the road.\n\n\"This is our money, but there's lots of other money for which contracting is completely open,\" the official said. \"Even with the U.S.-led reconstruction, as circumstances change on the ground, we want to look at that.\"\n\nMr. Bush left similar room on Thursday for Canada, which opposed the war and as a result was barred under the policy from the $18.6 billion in Iraqi projects. Canadian officials were so outraged that Mr. Bush telephoned Prime Minister Jean Chrétien on Thursday morning to reassure him.\n\nExactly what was said is not clear. Soon after Mr. Chrétien told reporters at a news conference that Canada would now be eligible to compete for projects in Iraq. But White House officials said later in the day that Canada was still excluded - though they kept their public comments vague and implied they were open to negotiating an agreement.\n\n\"We'll be glad to talk with Canadian officials about this decision,\" Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, told reporters. \"We do very much appreciate the contributions that they have made, both in Afghanistan and to Iraq, and we'll be glad to discuss those issues with them.\"\n\nMr. Baker, who was secretary of state for Mr. Bush's father during the 1991 Persian Gulf war, is volunteering his time as the president's personal envoy. In the decade since leaving the White House, he has created the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston. He has also worked as an lawyer for Baker Botts, the Houston law firm his grandfather founded, and as a senior counselor at the Carlyle Group, an international investment bank.\n\nAdministration officials said Mr. Baker would retain his positions at Baker Botts and the Carlyle Group while serving as the president's personal envoy, and added that he had been vetted by the White House counsel's office for potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Carlyle Group, which has $17.5 billion in gross assets under management, invests money for 550 investors in 55 countries, and has investors in the Middle East. It has no investors or investments in Iraq.\n\nChris Ullman, a Carlyle spokesman, said Mr. Baker had not personally raised money from overseas investors, and therefore would not be in the position of negotiating with his business clients on behalf of the White House. But Mr. Ullman said Mr. Baker did speak at Carlyle events intended to attract investors.\n\n\"He never asks for money, and does not follow up or do any of that,\" Mr. Ullman said. \"He effectively is a draw at fund-raising-type events.\"\n\n-------- MILITARY\n\n-------- afghanistan\nU.S. Soldiers Kill 4 Men in a Raid to Arrest an Afghan Commander\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy CARLOTTA GALL\nThe New York Times\n\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 11 - American soldiers killed four men in the eastern town of Jalalabad on Thursday when they raided a house and arrested a powerful commander allied to the government, local officials said. At least two others were wounded.\n\nThe raid appeared to be part of the continuing military effort against Taliban suspects and other militants who might try to disrupt a grand council that will convene Saturday to debate a new constitution.\n\nThe fighting erupted when soldiers tried to arrest General Esmatullah, a commander allied to the Northern Alliance faction led by Defense Minister Marshal Muhammad Qasim Fahim, the Nangarhar provincial governor, Din Muhammad, said.\n\nGeneral Esmatullah had traveled from his base in the neighboring province of Laghman to Jalalabad for a meeting with regional military commanders. It was not clear why American soldiers had tried to arrest him because he is opposed to the Taliban and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who are seen as the greatest threat to security. But aid workers familiar with the region said there had been complaints recently from the population about General Esmatullah and his soldiers.\n\nThe arrest is in keeping with the aggressive actions of American forces in the last nine days. United States officials say they have specific intelligence that the Taliban and Al Qaeda are planning actions to disrupt the loya jirga, and prevent delegates reaching the capital, and so troops have sought to take the offensive to prevent any attacks.\n\n--------\nDeadly U.S. Raid Leaves Some Afghans Bewildered\nVillagers Say Target Was Not a Terrorist\n\nNARAI KALAI, Afghanistan, Dec. 11 -- The village, surrounded by bleak winter fields, was deserted Thursday. A dozen U.S. soldiers were busy inside a mud compound; next to it was another farmhouse with one mud wall smashed to rubble. On a frozen slope nearby, eight new graves, marked with jagged rocks, were already partly covered by snow.\n\nSometime between midnight and dawn on Dec. 5, U.S. warplanes and ground forces attacked this mud-walled hamlet in eastern Paktia province, searching for a arsenal of weapons, U.S. military officials said Wednesday. In the rain of rockets and gunfire, an earthen wall collapsed on a sleeping family, killing both parents and their six young children.\n\nAccording to U.S. officials, the raid -- one of two military attacks that have killed a total of 16 Afghan civilians in the last week -- was aimed at an Islamic extremist identified as Mullah Jalani, who owned the compound. The officials said U.S. troops later found thousands of weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition inside, along with the bodies of the victims.\n\nResidents described Akhtar Mahmad Jalani as a controversial local tribal and militia leader who had crossed swords with provincial officials and changed sides several times in the region's seesawing political struggles. Provincial sources said he had supported the Taliban at one time and was known as a bully who used threats of force in tribal disputes.\n\nBut most people interviewed insisted that Jalani was neither a terrorist nor a threat to the government, and some professed outrage and shock at the U.S. attack. They noted that, until recently, Jalani had served as district commissioner and was also a leader of the local tribal council.\n\nSeveral residents said Jalani had supported the U.S. military campaign and met often with U.S. and Afghan troops based in Gardez, the provincial capital 20 miles west of here.\n\n\"This was always the safest place for Americans, and there has never been a single incident in our district,\" said Hairan, 29, a truck driver. \"Everyone knew Jalani, and the day before this happened the new district chief came to have tea with him. We are amazed that they would bomb his house.\"\n\nNaser Gul, 25, a brother of the man who was killed with his family in the attack, said the victims were sleeping when the sound of planes overhead woke them about 3 a.m. Gul said he ran outside, but the rest of the family was buried and died. He said the family, originally from Logar province, was visiting as guests of the Tutakhel tribe, which controls the district.\n\nGul identified the dead as Ikhtar Gul, 35, a farmer; Khela, his wife; four daughters, Ahmad Khela, Daulat Zai, Anara and Kadran; and two sons, Asif and Nematullah. He said the children's ages ranged from 1 to 12.\n\nTheir deaths came to light just days after a U.S. air assault on a village in neighboring province of Ghazni killed nine children and one adult. That raid was also aimed at an alleged Islamic extremist, Mullah Wazir, who apparently had already left the area.\n\nBoth cases have drawn strong statements of concern and criticism from U.N. officials, who are overseeing Afghanistan's difficult transition to democracy. They warned that such incidents could alienate Afghan civilians from the international community.\n\nU.S. military officials have apologized for the deaths in Ghazni, calling the episode a \"tragic mistake\" and saying they had no indication that civilians were in the immediate area. They have promised to investigate the incident in an effort to make sure similar mistakes do not occur in the future.\n\nIn the Paktia incident, however, U.S. officials have continued to strongly defend their actions. Lt. Col. Bryan Hilferty, the U.S. military spokesman at Bagram air base, said Wednesday that the raid netted a significant arsenal. He also said that if civilians \"surround themselves\" with weaponry in a compound used by a terrorist, \"we are not completely responsible for the consequences.\"\n\nAt a briefing Thursday, Hilferty again defended the high-powered military raid and added more detail to support it, saying that when U.S. troops attacked, they were met with heavy gunfire from inside the farmhouse.\n\n\"Certainly, we followed the law of proportionality in this compound,\" Hilferty said. \"From the compound, they were shooting at us with machine guns. Jalani has more ammunition at his house than the coalition keeps at Bagram.\" Hilferty said the compound contained hundreds of 107mm rockets, mortar shells, rocket-propelled grenades, antitank and antipersonnel mines and howitzers.\n\nHilferty further identified Jalani as a suspected associate of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the former Afghan prime minister who is believed to have formed an alliance with revived Taliban forces against the current U.S.-backed government.\n\nSome residents and tribal leaders scoffed at such descriptions, saying Jalani had always strongly opposed the Taliban and had frequent dealings with U.S. military forces here.\n\nNo one in the area Thursday was able to say where Jalani is now.\n\nSeveral residents said they thought he might have been killed in the raid but that they had not been allowed to enter the compound except to retrieve and bury the dead.\n\nBetween nine and 14 village men were detained by U.S. forces, but officials said Jalani was not among them. Sources in the province said it had been variously reported that Jalani escaped from his compound disguised in a woman's veil or had been in Pakistan at the time of the attack.\n\n\"We don't know if Hajji Jalani is alive or dead, and we don't understand the reason for this disaster,\" said Mahmad Yusuf, a retired army colonel and tribal leader from the district. \"If he committed a crime, he should be brought to justice, but the Americans killed innocent people for nothing, and this is a very bad work.\"\n\nU.S. Special Forces troops in the village Thursday refused to speak to a reporter and said she should leave the area. But several sources in Paktia gave accounts of the attack that cast the U.S. actions in a favorable light.\n\n\"The Americans surrounded the compound Friday night and gave everyone a chance to come out. The women and children eventually left, and the bombing did not start until several hours later,\" said a knowledgeable source in Gardez.\n\nIn the past several months, Taliban fighters and other armed guerrillas have staged numerous violent attacks in Afghanistan's southeastern provinces bordering Pakistan. A French U.N. worker was shot to death in Ghazni province, three foreign highway workers -- a Turk and two Indians -- were kidnapped, and a bomb wounded 20 people in downtown Kandahar.\n\nThe attacks have already led to cutbacks in many foreign aid projects and have threatened to disrupt a national constitutional assembly due to begin Saturday in Kabul.\n\nReuters reported from Bagram air base:\n\nNearly a week into what was described as the biggest ground operation in Afghanistan since the Taliban was overthrown in late 2001, thousands of U.S. soldiers have so far failed to engage any Taliban or allied militants, the army said Thursday.\n\nHilferty said soldiers of the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment who helicoptered into Paktia on Monday as part of Operation Avalanche had yet to make contact with the enemy. But he said they had conducted patrols and cave searches over a 40-square-mile area as part of the offensive.\n\n\"The fact that we did not hit the jackpot here is not indicative that the air assault was not successful,\" he said.\n\n-------- arms\nRights Group Faults U.S. Over Cluster Bombs\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nNew York Times\nBy THOM SHANKER\n\n\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 11 - The American and British armies could have prevented hundreds of civilian injuries or deaths during the war in Iraq by eliminating the use of cluster munitions in populated areas, according to a study by a leading human rights group.\n\nThe organization, Human Rights Watch, also says in a new report that while the Air Force was able to minimize civilian casualties in its strikes against fixed targets chosen in advance, it was not as successful in missions to kill leadership figures whose whereabouts became known only fleetingly, prompting quick attacks.\n\nThe report, \"Off Target - The Conduct of the War and Civilian Casualties in Iraq,\" states that 50 attacks aimed at senior Iraqi leaders failed to kill any of their intended targets, but resulted in dozens of civilian deaths.\n\nHuman Rights Watch says those strikes relied on the interception of satellite telephone calls for locating targets. But the map coordinates snatched from those satellite telephones were not precise enough to avoid civilian casualties when the attacks were conducted in urban areas.\n\nThe report makes no estimate of the total number of civilians killed or injured in the war.\n\nBut it says \"the widespread use of cluster munitions, especially by U.S. and U.K. ground forces, caused at least hundreds of civilian casualties.\" Cluster bombs are weapons that spread a large number of smaller bomblets over a broad area to halt troops or vehicles massing for attack.\n\nThe study says American and British ground forces fired almost 13,000 cluster munitions, which spread nearly two million smaller bombs. The report says the Air Force limited its use of cluster bombs, and that the greatest numbers of these munitions used in the war were fired by the United States Army.\n\nKenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said in a telephone interview that the use of cluster bombs in Iraq also left many unexploded munitions, \"littering the landscape, waiting for people to trip over them.\"\n\nA spokesman for the military's Central Command, Lt. Cmdr. Nick Balice, said that \"while civilian casualties of war are a tragedy, coalition forces have taken extreme care in Operation Iraqi Freedom to limit needless loss of human life and collateral damage.\"\n\nCluster munitions were used \"against very specific and valid military targets and only when deemed a military necessity,\" he said.\n\nThe Human Rights Watch report also criticizes Iraqi forces, saying they violated international law and likely contributed to civilian casualties.\n\nThese violations, the report said, included the \"use of human shields, abuse of the red cross and red crescent emblems, use of antipersonnel landmines\" and the \"location of military objectives in protected places,\" like mosques and hospitals.\n\n\"Clearly, when you're putting your artillery pieces in school yards or whatever, that increases civilian casualties,\" Mr. Roth said of the Iraqi tactic.\n\nMADRID - The US government needs to explain why the missile shipment on a vessel intercepted a year ago on the high seas by the Spanish navy ended up in Libya, a spokesman from Spain's Defense Ministry said this week.\n\nThe official was referring to declarations made by sources from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to the Madrid daily El Mundo that claim 15 complete Scud missiles, a set of conventional warheads and 85 containers of chemical products - some 20 holding nitric acid - were ultimately delivered to Libya under a Washington decision.\n\nThe episode began on December 5, 2002, when US intelligence services informed Madrid about the route of a freighter named So San, which they suspected of trafficking weapons and which was, at the time, crossing a zone under Spain's authority in the Indian Ocean. Four days later, a Spanish frigate and warship intercepted the So San after ordering the captain to halt and firing warning shots. The vessel was found to be sailing under the Cambodian flag.\n\nThe weapons and chemicals came from North Korea and did not appear on the ship's manifest, which showed only that the merchant vessel was carrying bags of cement. After intercepting the freighter, Spain then handed the ship over to the US Navy. Immediate official explanations out of Washington and Madrid said the missiles might have been headed for the al-Qaeda network, which the US government holds responsible for the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. However, just hours later, the US administration took Spain by surprise by turning the So San over to Yemen, explaining that the cargo was actually a legal shipment of weapons purchased from North Korea by the Yemini government.\n\nThe handover was preceded by a telephone conversation between US Vice President Dick Cheney and Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. When that conversation was made public, the White House justified the move by calling Yemen a friendly nation. So what initially came off as a brilliant Spanish military operation to prevent illegal trade in weapons of mass destruction was reduced to a suspected manipulation directed from Washington, with Madrid in the role of receiving and carrying out orders that were not very clear in their purpose.\n\nThe NATO sources cited in El Mundo said that at the time the shipment was intercepted, the United States was secretly negotiating the possibility that Libya would accept Saddam Hussein, then still president of Iraq, in exile. And Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who played the role of go-between during the Gulf War in 1991 by assisting in Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, had hopes of gaining access to the weapons.\n\n\"Gaddafi wanted the missiles and Yemen acted as intermediary. In the context of gestures with Libya, it was decided to look the other way, given that there was no international regulation that impeded it,\" said the newspaper, citing sources from the Pentagon.\n\nToday, as it was a year ago, Madrid's reaction of disappointment regarding the United States' handling of the shipment was immediate, but not very explicit, because Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar continues to be a staunch, unconditional supporter of the policies of his US counterpart, President George W Bush.\n\nAs a result, the opposition United Left (IU) has announced that it will petition Defense Minister Federico Trillo to inform parliament about the country's participation, \"past and present\", in relation to the case of the weapons shipment. Madrid's handling of the issue \"is one more demonstration of [Aznar's] erratic foreign policy and his troubling submission and total dependence on the policy marked by the US,\" IU general coordinator Gaspar Llamazares said. \"The IU is highly concerned that Spain is extending political and commercial ties to a country that does not provide any democratic guarantees,\" such as Libya, he added.\n\nNeither the Spanish government nor the opposition and civil-society organizations categorize the Gaddafi regime as terrorist and they agree on the need to facilitate his integration into the international community. In fact, Spain has not drawn up a list of countries it considers terrorist, noted a Foreign Ministry spokesperson, but the United States has, and Libya, which figures on that list, is subject to a commercial and military embargo. No US company is authorized to sell weapons to Libya directly or indirectly, nor to facilitate the delivery of arms.\n\nWhen the United Nations Security Council lifted sanctions against Libya, then-US ambassador James Cunningham abstained from the vote, stating that Washington did not want to give the idea that it believed Libya had done an about-face, because, said the ambassador, the country continued to try to obtain weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. But things appear to have changed radically, given that the weapons shipment intercepted by Spain, and which ended up in Libya, includes such arms.\n\nOne year after President Bush sought to energize the nation's bioterrorism preparations with an unprecedented smallpox vaccination campaign, the program has all but ground to a halt. A report released yesterday, meanwhile, finds that only two states -- Florida and Illinois -- are prepared to distribute and administer vaccines or medicines that would be needed in the event of a major outbreak or attack.\n\nFewer than a dozen states have written plans for dealing with other public health threats such as pandemic flu, the report added, and most remain ill-prepared for any large-scale emergency.\n\nAfter two years of work and $2 billion in federal aid, \"states are only modestly better prepared to respond to public health emergencies than they were prior to Sept. 11, 2001,\" the Trust for America's Health, a nonpartisan, nonprofit health advocacy group, concluded.\n\nDespite Bush's high-profile call on Dec. 13, 2002, for the immunization of millions of health care workers and emergency responders, the number vaccinated has been stuck at 38,700 for months.\n\n\"We are still underprepared to respond to even two cases of smallpox anywhere in the world,\" Michael T. Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, said in a telephone interview. Just as health care workers and the public \"panicked\" in the spring over a few cases of monkeypox, Osterholm predicted that a report of smallpox would send thousands rushing to hospitals in search of vaccine and find few people there ready to deliver it.\n\n\"You need a core group of vaccinated workers able to go out to the front lines, and we don't have that,\" he said.\n\nOther experts voiced fears that not enough attention has been given to lethal chemical agents, hospital surge capacity and sophisticated staff training.\n\n\"Are we ready or not? The answer is not,\" said Trust executive director Shelley A. Hearne. \"Now is the time to get serious about developing an all-hazards approach to public health to ensure we are ready for the range of possible threats we face.\" White House spokesman Trent Duffy said Bush is pleased with the progress made on smallpox defenses but \"would like more front-line workers to be vaccinated.\"\n\nJoseph Henderson, associate director for terrorism preparedness and emergency response at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the report \"tells us things we've already known. We know we have a lot of work to do.\"\n\nBut, he added, the swift response to naturally occurring outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome last year and influenza now \"demonstrate we are definitely more prepared.\" CDC expects to have more precise measures for evaluating the nation's preparedness next fall, but there will always be a reluctance to publicize that information, he said.\n\nIf, for instance, the president asked for a state-by-state assessment, Henderson said he is prepared to give it. \"We don't tell the public because we're afraid it might reveal too many vulnerabilities.\"\n\nState budget cuts, personnel shortages and red tape were the chief reasons identified by the Trust for the spotty progress. Although the report found significant improvement in communications capability and general terrorism response planning, researchers at the Trust and other experts identified several areas that are lagging.\n\nGeorges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said public health departments are able to respond more quickly, are better trained and are better equipped. He remains concerned, however, about staffing shortages, labs that are unable to identify chemical agents and the shortage of state influenza plans.\n\n\"I'm not sure this flu will be a pandemic flu, but we're going through a widespread flu epidemic now, and it worries me that states were not up to speed with those plans,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to tracking flu plans, the report scored states in nine other areas, such as lab capacity, availability of information on the SARS virus and appropriate distribution of federal dollars. States received one point for each category in which they met basic thresholds, with a 10 the highest possible score. More than 70 percent of the states received scores of 5 or lower.\n\nLocally, the picture is mixed. Maryland was one of four states to receive a 7, the highest score given. Virginia received a 5, and the District, a 3.\n\n\"While states have achieved piecemeal progress, the full-scale effort to comprehensively fix the nation's public health system is falling short,\" the report noted.\n\nRandall Larsen, a retired military officer and chief executive of the consulting firm Homeland Security Associates, endorsed the overall conclusions but counseled patience. \"People need to understand that although this is frustrating, we're not much better prepared. An enormous change is required to prepare us for homeland security in the 21st century,\" he said.\n\nJerome M. Hauer, the former Bush administration bioterrorism preparedness chief who now runs a terrorism response center at George Washington University, said he is concerned that hospitals have not done enough to prepare to handle mass casualties and that states are having trouble hiring specialists such as epidemiologists and laboratory technicians.\n\nHe and Larsen criticized CDC Director Julie L. Gerberding for recently denying that the administration had pursued a nationwide smallpox immunization program, calling her comments \"a very clever political move to distance herself from a failing program.\"\n\nWhen Bush announced the program -- he was among the first people to be inoculated -- the administration said it intended to immunize nearly 500,000 public health and hospital workers by the end of February this year. The plan called for vaccinating millions of police officers and firefighters by spring, and by summer, Bush promised, any American who insisted would be able to receive the vaccine. That has not happened.\n\nGerberding's spokesman, Tom Skinner , said, \"She fully supports the plan the president outlined last December. We're much better prepared even with only 40,000 vaccinated, but obviously we still have more work to do.\"\n\n-------- business\nBush Thinks U.S. Overcharged in Halliburton Contract\n\nWASHINGTON - President Bush, seeking to deflect criticism from the controversy surrounding Halliburton contracts in Iraq, said on Friday he believed a subsidiary overcharged the U.S. government for fuel deliveries to Iraq by $61 million, and expected it to be repaid.\n\nBush told reporters the Pentagon was investigating the overcharge after an audit found Halliburton's Kellogg, Brown & Root unit overcharged the U.S. Army by $1.09 per gallon for nearly 57 million gallons of gasoline for Iraqi citizens.\n\n\"Their investigation will lay the facts out for everybody to see. And if there's an overcharge, like we think there is, we expect that money to be repaid,\" Bush said.\n\nCritics of the Bush administration say Halliburton, the Houston-based oil company where Vice President Dick Cheney was chief executive, has unduly benefited from its government connections. The fuel deliveries fall under a contract awarded, without competition, to Halliburton in March.\n\nDemocrats are using Halliburton as a symbol of what they view as big business profiting from the Bush administration while regular citizens are short-changed.\n\nHoward Dean, running for the Democratic presidential nomination, told reporters in Council Bluffs, Iowa, that there should be an independent investigation of Halliburton's alleged overcharging and ties to the Bush administration.\n\nSo far the company has generated about $2 billion in business from a March contract and more than $2 billion from a logistics contract for which it supplies services ranging from delivering mail to doing laundry for U.S. troops.\n\n\"I would like to see such an investigation,\" Dean said. He said there was \"an appearance of impropriety.\"\n\nConnecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, also a Democratic presidential candidate, called on the Defense Department over a month ago to seek reimbursement from Halliburton for amounts it has overcharged the U.S. government.\n\n\"At a time of soaring federal deficits, we can ill afford to line the pockets of well-connected corporations at the expense of the American taxpayer,\" he said on Friday.\n\nHalliburton defended its work and said it welcomed a full review. Chairman and Chief Executive Dave Lesar denied the company had overcharged the government, citing Army Corps of Engineers audits.\n\nBush said: \"I appreciate the Pentagon looking out after the taxpayers' money. They felt like there was an overcharge issue. They put the issue right out there on the table for everyone to see and they're doing good work. We're going to make sure that as we spend the money in Iraq that it's spent well, spent wisely.\"\n\n\"PRESIDENT FOR BIG OIL\"\n\nDemocrats charged the case showed Bush was coddling Halliburton at the same time Bush was excluding Iraq war opponents from U.S.-funded reconstruction contracts in Iraq.\n\nThe Bush administration has decided to bar Iraq war opponents like France, Germany and Russia from competing for $18.6 billion in U.S.-funded reconstruction projects in Iraq.\n\nRetired Gen. Wesley Clark's campaign attacked what it called \"the Bush administration's ties to Halliburton.\"\n\n\"George W. Bush is a president for Big Oil, of Big Oil, and 'buy' Big Oil. He is more concerned about the success of Halliburton than having a success strategy in Iraq,\" said Chris Lehane, a communications strategist for Clark.\n\nNew Jersey Democrat Frank Lautenberg wrote this week to Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the Republican chair of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, to repeat his request for hearings on Halliburton's Iraqi reconstruction contracts, especially the size of the no-bid contract.\n\nCollins has previously declined the request. Her aides said she was unavailable on Friday.\n\n\"This is the sweetheart deal of the century that is grossly wasting taxpayer dollars. It's time for the vice president and the rest of the Administration to come clean on the Halliburton backroom deals,\" Lautenberg said through a spokesman.\n\nThe Pentagon has begun an extensive inquiry into Halliburton's activities in Iraq after evidence emerged that the oil services company, which was formerly run by the US vice president, Dick Cheney, overcharged the US government by as much as $120m (£69m).\n\nHalliburton has not been accused of wrongdoing, but this is the first time Pentagon officials have believed that major contracts for the war in Iraq have been mishandled.\n\nIn one case, Pentagon auditors found evidence that KBR may have overcharged the Army Corp of Engineers for petrol by $61m.\n\nAuditors say that KBR did not profit, but had overpaid for supplies from Kuwaiti companies, pushing up the final price. The Pentagon says KBR failed to adequately evaluate the costs and operations of its Kuwait subcontractor.\n\nThe other case of overcharging involved the supply of mess halls, and the Pentagon said it had found evidence that KBR may have overestimated the cost of catering by $67m.\n\nInvestigators at the Defence Contract Audit Agency are now examining all aspects of financial controls and subcontracting arrangements by KBR in Iraq, with around 20 auditors having been assigned to the job.\n\nIn a statement, David Lesar, the chief executive of Halliburton, said: \"We welcome a thorough review of any and all of our government contracts.\"\n\nMr Lesar defended the company's performance, and said that the questions were \"a normal part of the audit process and not a condemnation of KBR processes\".\n\nHowever, Democrats - who have criticised the lack of competition for contracts in Iraq - were quick to lay into the Bush administration.\n\n\"We've recently learned what many Americans have suspected for a long time - special interest contributor Halliburton is overcharging the American taxpayers,\" Howard Dean, the Democratic presidential contender, told the Washington Post.\n\n\"Now this president is preventing entire nations from bidding on contracts in Iraq so that his campaign contributors can continue to overcharge the American taxpayers.\"\n\nMr Dean was referring to a White House decision earlier this week to block firms from countries opposed to the conflict in Iraq from bidding for contracts, worth $18.6bn, to rebuild the country.\n\nThe move caused predictable outrage in the countries affected, which include France, Germany and Russia. However, companies from Britain and Italy - which were coalition partners - are eligible for contracts.\n\nKofi Annan, the UN secretary general, has urged the administration to reverse the decision, which he called \"unfortunate\", and the EU has raised the possibility that the US move violates World Trade Organisation rules.\n\nThe discovery that Halliburton could have overcharged the US government is certain to add to the arguments raging over Iraq's reconstruction. Halliburton has been under intense scrutiny ever since it was awarded a no-bid contract to provide billions of dollars in services in Iraq.\n\nCritics of the Bush administration say that Halliburton has benefited from White House patronage, because the company is a big donor to Republican party coffers.\n\nIt gave $708,770 in political contributions between 1999 and 2002, with 95% of that going to Republicans. Administration officials counter that few companies have the resources and expertise to carry out the work needed.\n\nMr Cheney, a former defence secretary under the first Bush administration, stepped down as chief executive officer of Halliburton when he became Mr Bush's running mate in 2000.\n\nHe has said that he played no role in contracts for his former company, of which he became head in 1995.\n\nKBR was first criticised in the summer by Congress for charging high rates to bring petrol into Iraq from Kuwait, but there have been accusations of overcharging before.\n\nLast year, the firm paid $2m in fines to settle charges of inflating prices for repairs and maintenance at Fort Ord, California.\n\nIn 1997 and 2000, the General Accounting Office, the congressional watchdog, found that KBR had billed the army for questionable expenses on its support contracts for operations in the Balkans.\n\nThose reviews cited instances such as charging $85.90 per sheet of plywood actually costing $14.06, and billing the army for cleaning some offices up to four times per day.\n\n----\nU.S. Sees Evidence of Overcharging in Iraq Contract\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nNew York Times\nBy DOUGLAS JEHL\n\n\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 11 - A Pentagon investigation has found evidence that a subsidiary of the politically connected Halliburton Company overcharged the government by as much as $61 million for fuel delivered to Iraq under huge no-bid reconstruction contracts, senior military officials said Thursday.\n\nThe subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown & Root, also submitted a proposal for cafeteria services that seemed to be inflated by $67 million, the officials said. The Pentagon rejected that proposal, they said.\n\nThe problems involving Halliburton, where Vice President Dick Cheney was chief executive, were described in a preliminary report by auditors, the officials said. The Pentagon contracts were awarded without competitive bidding and have a potential value of $15.6 billion; recent estimates by the Army have put the current value of the Halliburton contracts at about $5 billion.\n\nHalliburton denied overcharging and called the inquiry a \"routine audit.\" Dave Lesar, the company's chairman, president and chief executive, said in an e-mail statement, \"We welcome a thorough review of any and all of our government contracts.\"\n\nHalliburton, which had more than $12.5 billion in revenues in 2002, has emerged as a symbol for many people who opposed the war in Iraq and who claimed that the interests of such companies with close political ties were given too much consideration by the administration.\n\nCriticism intensified when Halliburton received the no-bid contract to provide billions of dollars in services in Iraq. Administration officials counter that few companies have the resources and expertise to carry out the work needed.\n\nMilitary officials said the Pentagon was negotiating with K.B.R. over how to resolve the fuel charges. But Michael Thibault, deputy director of the Defense Contract Audit Agency, said in a telephone interview that a draft report by the agency had recommended that the Army Corps of Engineers seek reimbursement.\n\nThe officials said Halliburton did not appear to have profited from overcharging for fuel, but had instead paid a subcontractor too much for the gasoline in the first place.\n\nHalliburton has also said that one reason it needed to charge a high price for fuel was that it must be delivered in a combat zone. Several K.B.R. workers have been killed or wounded in attacks by Iraqis.\n\nOther questions, in a second contract with the Army, involved unacceptable delays by the subsidiary in providing cost estimates for dozens of projects already under way in Iraq, Mr. Thibault said. These violations, for work that includes the construction of food, housing and other facilities for the military, could involve inflated costs as well, he added.\n\nA spokeswoman for Halliburton, Wendy Hall, said in an e-mail message that the inquiry was part of a \"routine audit\" and that it was \"not the fact that K.B.R. has overcharged.\"\n\nMr. Lesar, the chief executive, said in his e-mail: \"We will work with all government agencies to establish that our contracts are not only good for the United States, but also the company is the best and most qualified contractor to perform these difficult and dangerous tasks.\"\n\nMr. Thibault said that it would be \"premature\" to describe the auditor's conclusions as final, that the investigation was continuing and that the Halliburton subsidiary \"deserves a chance to respond to our findings.\" He said auditors expected to issue a final report this month, but added that the preliminary findings involved overcharging that was \"potentially very substantial.\"\n\nThe two Halliburton contracts are by far the largest awarded by the Pentagon in Iraq. Some Democrats have criticized the awarding of contracts to the Halliburton subsidiary, saying they might appear to be a political payoff to a company well connected with Republicans.\n\nBut administration and Halliburton officials have denied that politics played any role in the awards to K.B.R., whose work in Iraq involves a contract with the Army Corps of Engineers for repairing and restoring Iraq's oil industry. The initial value of the work was set at $7 billion. A second contract with the Army for logistical support has a maximum value of $8.6 billion, military officials said.\n\nMr. Thibault would not be specific about the basis on which the auditors have found evidence that the Halliburton subsidiary has overcharged for the fuel it is providing in Iraq under the oil contract.\n\nBut government documents show that the United States government is paying Halliburton an average of $2.64 a gallon to import gasoline to Iraq from Kuwait, more than twice what others are paying.\n\nRepresentative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who has been a leading Congressional critic of the contract, said the preliminary audit \"confirms what we've known for months: Halliburton has been gouging taxpayers and the White House has been letting them get away with it.\"\n\n\"It is deplorable and we need to put an immediate end to it,\" Mr. Waxman said in a written statement. \"There needs to be a top-to-bottom review of all the Iraqi contracts.\"\n\nDefense Department and other government officials said a draft report of the audit agency's finding was sent to K.B.R. on Dec. 5 and included \"harsh assessments\" of the company's handling of its contract to import fuel from Kuwait.\n\nMr. Thibault said that Halliburton had promised a response by Dec. 17, and that the agency would issue a final report within a week after that. Once that report is complete, it will be turned over to the clients, including the Army Corps of Engineers, which contracted with K.B.R. in March for tens of millions of gallons of gasoline, benzene and other fuel.\n\nThe audit agency has also discussed with K.B.R. the delays in the pricing of elements of the logistics contract, military officials said. Among projects under way, the company has provided the government with cost estimates for just 12 orders, with 69 outstanding and overdue, the officials said. They said the delays raised the possibility that the company would eventually claim an unacceptably high cost for a project whose work was already largely completed.\n\nThe company's work for the military in Iraq has evolved from putting out oil field fires to overseeing rebuilding of Iraq's oil infrastructure and providing fuel. K.B.R. also provides support to American troops, including serving meals.\n\nMr. Cheney, the former chief executive, left Halliburton in 2000, after President Bush asked him to become his running mate.\n\nThe Army awarded the logistics contract to Halliburton in 2001, on a competitive basis, but its size has swelled since the Iraq war, with additional work awarded to Halliburton without competition. The second contract, for oil reconstruction projects, was formally awarded in March on a \"sole source\" basis, but the decision to give the project to Halliburton was made in late 2002 by senior administration officials who were part of a secret task force planning for postwar Iraq.\n\nDon van Natta Jr. contributed reporting from London for this article.\n\n--------\nBush Says Halliburton Will Have to Repay Any Overcharges\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy DAVID STOUT\nThe New York Times\n\n\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 12 - President Bush said today that the Halliburton Company would have to pay back any money it might have have overcharged the government for work it is doing in Iraq.\n\n``If there's an overcharge, like we think there is, we expect that money to be repaid,'' Mr. Bush said this afternoon as he and his chief spokesman sought to distance the White House from a continuing controversy over Iraq-related work being done by Halliburton, which was once headed by Vice President Dick Cheney.\n\nAlluding to a Pentagon audit that has found that Halliburton may indeed have overcharged the government by some $61 million for fuel deliveries, the president said: ``I appreciate the Pentagon looking after the taxpayers' money. They felt like there was an overcharge issue.''\n\nIt was not entirely clear today just how much in supposed overcharges may already have been paid by the government to Halliburton, a huge oil-field services company. But it was clear that questions about the politically well-connected company may continue to nettle the White House.\n\nAsked whether Halliburton might be ``an albatross around this administration's neck, '' the president replied: ``I expect anybody doing business with the United States government to be transparent, and to give the taxpayers a good return on their money. That's what I expect. And if anybody is overcharging the government, we expect them to repay that money.''\n\nThe preliminary Pentagon audit has found that a Halliburton subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown & Root, may have overcharged the government for fuel deliveries under lucrative no-bid construction contracts. But Pentagon officials have said the company did not appear to have profited from overcharges but rather may have initially paid a subcontractor too much. Halliburton has vigorously denied any overcharges, declaring in a statement that it welcomes ``a thorough review of any and all of our government contracts,'' and asserting that the Pentagon inquiry is routine in any event. The company has said, too, that fuel deliveries in a combat zone are inherently costly.\n\nEarlier today, the president's chief spokesman, Scott McClellan, tried to characterize Halliburton and its contracts as the bailiwick of the Pentagon, not the White House.\n\n``We expect the Pentagon to look at this and get to the bottom of it,'' Mr. McClellan said.\n\nDefense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld also encountered the Halliburton issue, in a generally friendly question-answer session at a meeting today of the National Conference of State Legislatures in the capital.\n\nA Minnesota lawmaker said she was concerned about apparent overcharging by Halliburton and urged Mr. Rumsfeld to look into it personally. Mr. Rumsfeld replied that he was not ``intimately knowledgeable'' about the affair.\n\n``We've got auditors that crawl all over these things,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said. He emphasized that while there had been disagreements over charges, there had not yet been any actual overpayments.\n\nMr. McClellan, when asked whether the White House was planning any changes to guard against similar problems, indicated that no new measures were contemplated.\n\n``This was a matter, a contracting matter, that was decided at the Pentagon,'' Mr. McClellan said at a news briefing. ``There are some oversight measures that are in place to make sure that tax dollars are protected, to make sure that tax dollars are being spent appropriately.\n\n``And from our standpoint, we expect those measures and procedures that are in place for oversight purposes to be followed,'' Mr. McClellan went on. ``And we expect the Pentagon to look at this and get to the bottom of it.''\n\nFurther questions on the Houston-based Halliburton, where Vice President Cheney was chief executive until he joined the 2000 Bush ticket, should be directed to the Pentagon, Mr. McClellan said.\n\nDemocrats have had a field day with the Halliburton affair, asserting that the company is ``gouging taxpayers,'' as Representative Henry A. Waxman of California put it.\n\nMr. McClellan was asked today whether, in retrospect, it would have been better if Halliburton had never gotten any contracts. ``It's a Pentagon decision,'' he replied. ``It's a Pentagon matter.''\n\nDefense Department auditors have discovered that a Halliburton Inc. subsidiary may have overcharged the government $61 million on a contract to supply fuel for Iraq, a Pentagon official said at a hurriedly called news conference last night.\n\nIn another contract to operate U.S. military mess halls, Halliburton, which was headed by Dick Cheney before he became vice president, would have been overpaid $67 million if auditors hadn't questioned the arrangement, officials said, citing findings of a draft audit.\n\nWhile Halliburton isn't being accused of wrongdoing, and the government isn't yet seeking reimbursement, this is the first instance the Pentagon has said it believes that major contracts for the war in Iraq and its reconstruction have been mishandled.\n\n\"We have found some issues of concern that are worthy of immediate attention and we're making sure that that kind of aggressive action is taken so that we resolve these issues as expediently as possible,\" said William H. Reed, director of the Defense Contract Audit Agency.\n\nOn the gas contract, Halliburton subsidiary KBR has been charging the U.S. government $2.27 a gallon to deliver gasoline from Kuwait, while a similar contract for gas from Turkey sets the price at only $1.18, the official said.\n\nHalliburton didn't profit from that differential, officials said. \"This isn't money that went to the company,\" said Larry DiRita, the Pentagon's top spokesman. Rather, he said, the money the Pentagon believes was overcharged went to a private Kuwaiti company that is a subcontractor on the contract. He declined to identify that company. He also noted that during last spring's war, the Kuwaiti government provided fuel to the United States and its allies at no charge.\n\nHalliburton's problem with the contract, a Pentagon official said, was that it failed to adequately evaluate the costs and operations of its Kuwaiti subcontractor. On the contract to operate mess halls, the official said that Halliburton told the Pentagon its subcontractor price would be $220 million. But auditors examining Halliburton's operations found that at that time, the company already had awarded a subcontract under which the cost was actually $67 million lower than that.\n\n\"You'd have to be pretty stupid\" to do this on purpose, the official said, implying that it was an easy discrepancy to catch. He said he believes this was \"a clear, obvious, miscommunication error\" that resulted from a \"disconnect\" between the company's operations in the Mideast and its contracting office at its Houston headquarters.\n\nHalliburton chief executive David J. Lesar said in a statement, \"We welcome a thorough review of any and all of our government contracts.\" He defended the company's performance and said the questions were \"a normal part of the audit process and not a condemnation of KBR processes.\"\n\nOn the fuel pricing, he said only one supplier from Kuwait met the government's specifications and said the company has repeatedly tried to transfer the delivery work to another contractor. On the food contract, he said that the auditors were talking about \"a proposal, not an invoice.\"\n\nDemocrats have criticized the lack of competition and the prices being charged in the Halliburton contracts and were quick to jump on the Pentagon announcement about Cheney's former company.\n\n\"We've recently learned what many Americans have suspected for a long time -- special-interest contributor Halliburton is overcharging the American taxpayers,\" said former Vermont governor Howard Dean, a leading Democratic presidential contender. \"Now this president is preventing entire nations from bidding on contracts in Iraq so that his campaign contributors can continue to overcharge the American taxpayers.\"\n\nRep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.), who has taken the lead in questioning the Halliburton contracts, said in a statement that the draft report \"confirms what we've known for months. Halliburton has been gouging taxpayers and the White House has been letting them get away with it.\"\n\nCheney was defense secretary from 1989 until 1993, and then was chief executive at Halliburton from 1995 until 2000, when he resigned to join George W. Bush on the 2000 Republican ticket.\n\nBob Faletti, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers, which administers the fuel contract, said, \"We have a copy of the draft audit. We are going to let the process work. KBR has an opportunity to provide additional information and refute the charges. We will not be taking any action prior to the process being completed.\"\n\nThe two contracts in question are among the biggest the U.S. government has let for operations in postwar Iraq. They are open-ended arrangements under which about $5 billion has been spent so far, one of the Pentagon officials said.\n\n-------- china\nTaiwan's President Giving Bush Headaches\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\nTAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The latest guy giving President Bush headaches isn't an AK-47 toting leader of a shadowy terrorist group. And he's not a Stalinist recluse with nuclear ambitions.\n\nHe's Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian -- a 52-year-old workaholic attorney who wears plain blue suits and big wire-framed glasses, and who runs one of Asia's most vibrant democracies and richest economies.\n\nChen landed in Bush's inbox of problems by calling for Taiwan's first island-wide referendum. He says the March 20 vote will be on whether China should withdraw hundreds of missiles pointing at this tiny island.\n\nThe Taiwanese leader is under tremendous pressure to cancel the referendum, which Washington fears could lead to an independence vote that could spark a war with China. The two split amid civil war in 1949, and Beijing is demanding that the island agree to unify.\n\nOnce an enthusiastic supporter of Chen, Bush leaned on the Taiwanese leader this week, warning that America opposes unilateral moves to change the status quo. It was Chen's biggest slap from Washington since he took office four years go.\n\nSome members of Chen's Democratic Progressive Party said it's too early to say if Chen would scuttle the referendum to preserve friendly relations with America, Taiwan's most likely defender if China ever attacks. Much depends on whether Washington keeps the heat on Chen.\n\nLuo Wen-jia, a lawmaker close to Chen, doubted the president would back down on the referendum.\n\n``He has already compromised by proposing this anti-missile vote'' and not calling an election that directly involves the touchy sovereignty issue, he said. ``The president may twist and turn, but he won't easily give up.''\n\nChen is also locked in what could be the biggest election battle of his life. He's being challenged by two parties that have combined forces to defeat him in the March election. Dropping the referendum would be extremely embarrassing, his supporters say.\n\nChen has a long history as a scrappy fighter. He grew up in poverty in southern Taiwan; his father was a factory worker and his mother was a day laborer. He has said the family milk supply came from U.S. aid packages.\n\nChen excelled at school and majored in law at Taiwan's top school, passing the bar exam before graduating and settling into a career as a maritime lawyer.\n\nHe showed no strong interest in politics until the late 1970s, when he began defending dissidents arrested during the martial law era. He later became a Taipei city councilman and a member of parliament, where he often stormed around the legislature tossing papers as his party pushed for greater democracy.\n\nChen's political career brought pain to his family. His wife, Wu Shu-chen, was paralyzed from the waist down when a truck ran over her three times in 1985. The couple believes it was a politically motivated murder attempt.\n\nChen's upset election victory four years ago snapped the Nationalist Party's five-decade grip on the presidency. The win was an amazing success story for the Democratic Progressive Party, which the Nationalists had banned during martial law.\n\nThe party was founded by human rights, democracy and independence activists. But Chen remains flexible on independence, said Shen Fu-hsiung, a Progressive Party lawmaker.\n\n``Most of us think he's just trying to use this issue to his benefit,'' Shen said. ``Those in the heart of the independence movement have doubts about him.''\n\nShen acknowledged that from the broader perspective used by China and sometimes America, Chen's views and his referendum plans seem pro-independence.\n\nBeijing is also suspicious of Chen because he won't call himself ``Chinese.'' He has yet to embrace China's goal of eventual unification, and continues to insist that Taiwanese voters should have a choice.\n\nChen's program to remake Taiwan also includes holding other referendums and rewriting the constitution. Many analysts agree things need to be done, but some question whether Chen is the person to do them.\n\nDenny Roy of the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Hawaii noted that President Richard Nixon was a good man to restart U.S.-China relations because of his anti-communist background.\n\nBut Roy said he doubts Chen is the right person for the delicate tasks he wants to undertake. And Roy says the timing may not be the best.\n\nBEIJING, Dec. 11 -- China issued a rare thank you to the United States on Thursday when it applauded President Bush's strongest statement yet opposing any moves by Taiwan toward independence.\n\nThe statement from the Foreign Ministry, calling Taiwan \"the most important and sensitive\" issue in U.S.-Chinese relations, underscored a continuing improvement in dealings between China and the United States and followed this week's visit by Premier Wen Jiabao to the United States. A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Liu Jianchao, pronounced the visit a \"complete success\" and said, \"We appreciate President Bush's statement.\"\n\nStanding next to Wen on Tuesday, Bush said the United States opposed \"any unilateral decision by either China or Taiwan to change the status quo.\" Bush added: \"And the comments and actions made by the leader of Taiwan indicate that he may be willing to make decisions unilaterally to change the status quo, which we oppose.\"\n\nBush was responding to recent moves by Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, to call a \"defensive\" referendum asking voters whether they want China to withdraw the hundreds of missiles it has deployed within striking distance of Taiwan.\n\nWestern analysts have said Chen's move was based on a desire to heighten tensions between Taiwan and China in the run-up to Taiwan's presidential election on March 20. In 2000, Chen benefited from increased tensions with China and became the first opposition candidate to win Taiwan's presidency.\n\nChina has accused Chen of using the referendum as a ploy to push Taiwan one step closer to declaring formal independence. China has threatened to attack the island, which it considers to be part of its territory, if such a proclamation is made.\n\nIn Taiwan, citizens shrugged off the Chinese warning as bluster, and Chen's supporters dismissed any suggestion the referendum could provoke an attack. Chen argued that the United States would eventually support the referendum, a view shared by many on the island.\n\n\"I believe America is a democratic country. It will absolutely support and encourage the public opinion of Taiwan's 23 million people and their pursuit of deeper democracy and peace,\" he said in an interview with CNN, according to a presidential office statement.\n\nEarlier in the day, Chen said the referendum was in line with U.S. democratic values, which should allow voters to express opinions about a threat.\n\nTrong R. Chai, a pro-independence legislator and influential party official who has urged Chen to take a stronger stand against China, said the United States could do little to punish Taiwan if the island ignored Bush's warning and held the referendum.\n\n\"The U.S. won't tell China, 'You can take over Taiwan,' \" he said. And the Bush administration is unlikely to cancel arms sales to the island or impose economic sanctions, he said.\n\nPressing forward with his reelection campaign, Chen announced that Vice President Annette Lu would again be his running mate. Lu is fiery orator who openly advocates Taiwan's independence, and Chinese state media have labeled her a traitor and \"scum of the nation.\"\n\nCorrespondent Philip P. Pan in Taipei contributed to this report.\n\n-------- colombia\nColombian Terrorism Bill Expands Military Powers\n\nWORLD IN BRIEF\nFriday, December 12, 2003\nWashington Post\n\n\nBOGOTA, Colombia -- Senators approved a divisive anti-terrorism bill that gives the military sweeping powers to search homes, detain suspects without warrants and tap phones. The legislation, criticized by human rights groups, is part of President Alvaro Uribe's strategy to defeat a 39-year insurgency and restore authority in the country's lawless provinces.\n\n\"The country's citizens can feel more serene,\" Interior and Justice Minister Sabas Pretelt told Congress. \"They should know that the terrorists harming them will now face all the force of the state.\"\n\nThe decision came after Colombian troops launched a massive operation against outlawed right-wing paramilitary fighters, killing 24 and capturing 39. It was one of the largest campaigns against the militias since they opened disarmament talks with the government in July, the army said.\n\nColombia's main paramilitary umbrella group, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or AUC, has declared a unilateral cease-fire, but some members of the group have allegedly continued attacking villages and killing civilians.\n\n-------- europe\nGermans fed up with war legacy\n\nReuters in Berlin\nFriday December 12, 2003\nThe Guardian\n\n\nAlmost 70% of Germans say they are annoyed at being held responsible for the Holocaust and many believe Jews use Germany's Nazi past to their advantage, a survey showed yesterday.\n\nThe survey by Bielefeld University showed 69.9% were irritated at still being held responsible today for crimes against Jews.\n\nA quarter of 3,000 people surveyed also agreed with the statement: \"Many Jews try to use Germany's Third Reich past to their advantage and want to make Germans pay for it.\" A further 30% said there was \"some truth\" to the statement.\n\nAlmost two-thirds said they believed too many foreigners live in Germany, while 30% said foreigners should be sent home when jobs are scarce.\n\nEndorsing the survey, the German parliamentary president, Wolfgang Thierse, said he understood why so many people wanted to shed guilt for what happened before they were born. He said the survey did not prove there was widespread anti-Jewish sentiment.\n\nThe authors of the survey said they found that Germans who were worried about security threats and losing their jobs had become more hostile to Jews, Muslims, and immigrants.\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy SUSAN SACHS\nThe New York Times\n\n\nBAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 11 - The American administrator of Iraq said Thursday that the country's transition to independence could be marred by increased violence, but he expressed confidence that Iraqis could build a democracy that values religious and political freedom.\n\nL. Paul Bremer III, the former diplomat and counterterrorism official who has governed Iraq since May, expressed high hopes for Iraq's political future after 35 years of dictatorship and one-party rule, saying he believes Iraqis want and understand democracy.\n\n\"It is ambitious and it is possible,\" he said in an interview in one of Saddam Hussein's vast palace compounds, where the Coalition Provisional Authority has its headquarters in a building dating from the Iraqi monarchy in the first half of the last century.\n\n\"We're not going to have a Jeffersonian democracy here,\" he added. \"The process will be bumpy. We'll have bad days and good days.\"\n\nMr. Bremer, appearing relaxed and in good humor, spoke in broad terms about the next phase of the American occupation, a period that he predicted could bring a spike in violent attacks as well as an American-nurtured public debate over the shape of the new Iraq.\n\nUnder an agreement with the Bush administration last month, Iraq's political leaders are supposed to create a new legislative assembly by next spring and elect a provisional government by July 1. An elected body to write a constitution would then follow, with national elections possibly by 2006.\n\nBefore that, however, Iraq's transitional leadership must also tackle one of the more complicated questions about its future relationship with the United States, the country that many Iraqis applaud for ending Mr. Hussein's rule but also criticize for its handling of the seven-month-old occupation.\n\nBy March 15, the two sides are supposed to draw up a status of forces agreement on the future relationship between an independent Iraq and the American military.\n\nSeveral members of the Iraqi Governing Council, appointed by Mr. Bremer in July to nominate ministers and take a limited role in law-making, have said they would like to see the American troops stay in their base or bases unless called upon for help.\n\nWhile it is too early to say how long American forces might stay and under what conditions, Mr. Bremer said he believed Iraqis would ask for an agreement based on security conditions in the country.\n\n\"It's a question that really ought to be asked in six months, when we get through this very important crucial period and let's we see where we are,\" he said. \"My own guess is we're going to have an increase in violence over the next six months.\"\n\nAlthough the number of daily attacks on American troops surged as high as 50 in November before the military started cracking down harder, most parts of Iraq remained relatively calm, as was Baghdad until a series of unexplained explosions on Thursday night. Mr. Bremer and American military commanders, however, said they feared that terrorists, loyalists of the old government and Islamic militants could increase attacks on Americans and Iraqi officials in the period leading up to independence.\n\n\"The violence will be precisely because of the fact that we're building momentum toward success,\" Mr. Bremer said.\n\nIn the last 45 days, American commanders have already noticed what they call a regional command and control capability on the part of attackers who have executed nearly simultaneous bombings in the capital and other cities.\n\nAn attack on an American military convoy in Samarra last week added yet another element, with military officials reporting large numbers of men mounting a daytime assault. \"This was really an unusual attack,\" Mr. Bremer said. \"It's really the first time anybody larger than a squad even has stood and fought.\"\n\nAn rise in attacks in the coming months would necessarily bring a sharper military response, he added, and should be accompanied by a comparable increase in American investment in improving the daily lives of Iraqi civilians. Mr. Bremer said he planned to pour millions of dollars into local reconstruction projects over the next six months.\n\n\"As we respond to attacks - and we do have to respond to attacks to show that we mean to carry out our security obligations here - we have to be careful that we don't overdo that,\" he said. \"We balance that by putting an enormous amount of money into reconstruction efforts.\"\n\nSince the fall of Mr. Hussein's government in April, military commanders have said they spent more than $100 million on projects in the provinces under their control. The source of the money was the seized assets of the old government.\n\nMr. Bremer said he wanted to spend more than double that.\n\nAlready this month, American forces have adopted aggressive new tactics to flush out their attackers, dropping 500-ton bombs on urban sites believed to harbor guerrillas, setting up barbed wire cordons around villages and arresting relatives of wanted men.\n\nCommanders have acknowledged that their tactics could further alienate Iraqis.\n\nMr. Bremer said the coalition had become better organized to gather and analyze intelligence about its attackers, in part because because of greater Iraqi involvement. It is still too soon \"to say we've broken the code,\" he added.\n\nThe interplay between the military and civilian sides of the occupation has been a source of muted tension since the beginning, with Mr. Bremer inclined to make life in Iraq as normal as possible and Army commanders inclined to close roads, patrol city neighborhoods and set up checkpoints to ensure security.\n\nMr. Bremer said he had worked to reduce tensions by assembling the military and civilian commands under the same roof.\n\nThe relationship, however, will be tested in the coming months.\n\nThe new timetable for turning political control and sovereignty back to Iraqis will require some process to select a new Iraqi provisional legislature, possibly by people now serving as municipal and provincial council members.\n\nIn most provinces, American Army officers picked the local legislators months ago, but many have since fallen into public disfavor. Mindful of their importance in the upcoming political battle for control of the new provisional government, the Iraqi Governing Council has already started to replace some local officials, most recently the provincial governor of Babylon.\n\nMr. Bremer, who had appointed the governor, said he, too, wanted to recast the local governments and reduce their dependence on the American military.\n\n\"What we will try to do is beef up the civilian capability in the provinces by refreshing the provincial councils, making sure the provincial councils are more representative,\" he said. \"It's one of the issues we're working on right now with the Governing Council, so that there is a local Iraq political institution that is more or less representative\" to aid the transition from occupation to independence.\n\nOver the coming months, Mr. Bremer and his staff of 3,000 also have plans to engage Iraqis in a national debate over the shape of their nation.\n\n\"We want televised debates, town hall meetings, focus group meetings, meetings all across the country for people to sit down and talk about what kind of Iraq they want, what democracy means, what does separation of powers mean,\" Mr. Bremer said.\n\n\"It's never happened here and it needs to happen rather quickly.\"\n\n--------\nDISPATCHES: THE MILITARY\nMarines Plan to Use Velvet Glove More Than Iron Fist in Iraq\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy MICHAEL R. GORDON\nThe New York Times\n\n\nCAMP PENDLETON, Calif., Dec. 10 - No force has a tougher reputation than the United States Marines. But the marines who are headed to Iraq this spring say they intend to avoid the get-tough tactics that have been used in recent weeks by Army units.\n\nMarine commanders say they do not plan to surround villages with barbed wire, demolish buildings used by insurgents or detain relatives of suspected guerrillas. The Marines do not plan to fire artillery at suspected guerrilla mortar positions, an Army tactic that risks harming civilians. Nor do the Marines want to risk civilian casualties by calling in bombing strikes on the insurgents, as has happened most recently in Afghanistan.\n\n\"I do not envision using that tactic,\" said Lt. Gen. James T. Conway, the commanding general of the First Marine Expeditionary Force, who led the Marine force that fought its way to Baghdad and will command the more than 20,000 marines who will return to Iraq in March. \"It would have to be a rare incident that transcends anything that we have seen in the country to make that happen.\"\n\nThe increase in guerrilla attacks on American troops in Iraq has prompted Army units in the so-called Sunni triangle in central Iraq to adopt a hard-nosed approach - and spawned a behind-the-scenes debate within the American military about the best way to quash the insurgents.\n\nWhile some Army commanders insist the hard-nosed tactics have been successful in reducing enemy attacks, other military officers believe they are alienating Iraqis and thus depriving American commanders of the public support and human intelligence needed to ferret out threats.\n\nIn an interview at his headquarters at Camp Pendleton, General Conway was careful not to criticize the Army. Still, he indicated that he plans to pursue a very different strategy.\n\n\"I don't want to condemn what people are doing,\" General Conway said. \"I think they are doing what they think they have to do. I'll simply say that I think until we can win the population over and they can give us those indigenous intelligence reports that we're prolonging the process.\"\n\nThe Marines, General Conway says, will try to design their raids to be \"laser precise,\" focused on the enemy with a maximum effort made to avoid endangering or humiliating Iraqi civilians.\n\nAfter American forces invaded Iraq last spring, United States marines fought some of the fiercest battles of the war at Nasiriya and at a mosque in eastern Baghdad. After Saddam Hussein was ousted, the Marines assumed the responsibility for stabilizing south-central Iraq, where most of the inhabitants are Shiite Muslims who were persecuted under Mr. Hussein and were glad to see him gone. In contrast to the Army's experience, no marine was killed in action after mid-April.\n\nThe Marines insist their success also reflected their energetic efforts to work with the local population, an effort guided by their \"Small Wars\" manual, which derives from their 20th-century interventions in Central America.\n\nThere were several parallels between the Marine experience in southern Iraq and how the Army's 101st Airborne Division has approached northern Iraq - and many differences from the aggressive tactics of the Army's Fourth Infantry Division and other Army units in the Sunni triangle.\n\nOn their return to Iraq now, the Marines will be dealing with a much more challenging area which includes restive towns like Falluja, west of Baghdad.\n\nIn that region, American military units have come and gone so often that they have had little time to understand their surroundings. Falluja was initially occupied by the 82nd Airborne Division, which was soon replaced by the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment, which was in turn replaced by the Second Brigade of the Army's Third Infantry Division. In early summer, the Third Infantry Division had some success in helping to establish the local police. But it returned to the United States, handing the town back to the Third Armored Cavalry, which was soon replaced by the 82nd Airborne.\n\nIn Iraqi society, which emphasizes personal relationships, the constant rotations have made a difficult job that much harder. So have some tactics: in April, soldiers from the 82nd Airborne based themselves in Falluja and were fired on during an anti-American demonstration. The troops fired back. Iraqis say 17 people were killed and more than 70 wounded, many of them civilians who never fired on the American troops. The 82nd Airborne has disputed that account.\n\nStarting next March, nine battalions of marines will be deployed. In addition to infantry, the Marine force will include light armored reconnaissance units, engineers and attack helicopters. The Marines will also take command of a brigade from the Army's First Infantry Division, which is also going to Iraq in the spring.\n\nSuccess, Marine commanders say, will ultimately depend winning the trust of a wary Iraqi population. The measure of progress, General Conway says, will not be the number of American raids or enemy dead. It will be tips about potential threats that are provided to the Marines by ordinary Iraqis.\n\n\"The program we used in the south was a maturing Iraqi police, supported by an Army M.P. company in each of the cities, supported by a Marine quick reaction force,\" he said, defining this as a Marine infantry battalion. \"That worked very well for us. That is the model we intend to use.\"\n\nToward this end, the Marines are planning to work with the Iraqi police and also train and equip an Iraqi military force to take on the insurgents. \"We intend to create an Iraqi Marine battalion, maybe a brigade,\" General Conway said.\n\nMarine commanders have stressed the need to be sensitive to local traditions. Marines here have been told to remove their sunglasses and look Iraqis in the eye when they speak with them. A select group of marines also been selected for intensive Arabic language training. The marines will use Iraqi, not American names, to delineate the zones assigned to specific Marine units and will try to align them with Iraqi administrative districts. To limit the disruption to the local populations, the Marines also plan to set up their bases outside of Iraqi cities.\n\nBut the marines at Camp Pendleton are also prepared to fight.\n\n\"We carry an embedded offensive capability in every convoy,\" said Maj. Gen. James N. Mattis, the commander of the First Marine Division. \"To us you don't drive on through, you stop, you hunt them down and you nail them.\"\n\n\"We will try to go and restore a degree of civility,\" said General Mattis. \"If they choose to fight, they are going to regret it, but we also believe that part of the physicians' oath that says first do no harm. If to kill a terrorist we have got to kill eight innocent people, you don't kill them.\"\n\nGeneral Conway added: \"We will be as vicious with the resistance as we have to be. It is not that we intend to go in and coddle everyone. Our marines just have to be able to be aggressive and hostile one moment and the next moment be able to play soccer with the kids.\"\n\nGeneral Conway said, for instance, that if marines fire artillery shells, they will be special illumination rounds to light up terrain, not destroy targets.\n\n\"Right now, in some of the sectors they are firing artillery missions against radar hits,\" General Conway said. \"That will not be our method of operation.\"\n\n--------\nU.S. Draws on Israeli Methods for Iraq\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- In fighting insurgents in Iraq, the United States is drawing on some of Israel's methods and experiences in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including running checkpoints and tracking militants with drone aircraft, Israeli officials say.\n\nIsraeli and U.S. security experts have met repeatedly in recent months to discuss urban warfare and Israel's lessons from its grueling three-year fight against Palestinian militants.\n\nIn public comments, Israeli and U.S. officials acknowledge ``strategic cooperation'' and confirm high-level meetings, the most recent one last week in Tel Aviv. However, they play down the contacts as routine, apparently for fear the Arab world will be outraged.\n\nRecent U.S. methods in Iraq increasingly mimic those Israel uses in the West Bank and Gaza -- setting up impromptu checkpoints, keeping militants on the defensive with frequent arrest raids and, in at least one case, encircling a village and distributing travel permits.\n\nAn Israeli security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Israel has briefed the U.S. military on its frequent use of drones, or unmanned reconnaissance aircraft, which allow officers at Israeli military headquarters to watch operations in real time.\n\nThe Israeli security official said Israel has taught the U.S. military how to make use of intelligence information within minutes to attack a moving target. The U.S. military has not formally adopted targeted killings, though some wanted Iraqis have been killed in arrest raids.\n\nA U.S. Army officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S. troops try to stay clear of methods that look like collective punishment. Israel routinely demolishes the family homes of Palestinian attackers in hopes of deterring future attacks.\n\nThe British newspaper The Guardian recently reported Israeli advisers are training U.S. soldiers at Fort Bragg, N.C.\n\nLt. Col. Hans Bush, of the U.S. Army's Special Operations Command, said there are no Israeli forces ``currently teaching Army Special Operations Command forces at Fort Bragg.''\n\nLast week, a large delegation from the Army Training and Doctrine Command in Fort Monroe, Va., visited Israel. Harvey Perritt, the command's civilian spokesman, said the meeting was routine, but would not elaborate.\n\nThe Israeli army said in a statement it does not comment on ``ongoing strategic cooperation between the U.S. and the Israeli military.''\n\nBut military officials close to the sides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the meetings focused on lessons learned from Israel's fighting in the West Bank and Gaza and how to adapt them to Iraq.\n\nIsrael also gave the United States a training video for troops to illustrate an 11-point code on treating civilians, the rights of international relief groups and other issues ``very tied into...the daily dilemmas'' of urban warfare, said Lt. Col. Amos Guiora, commander of the Israeli army's school of military law. The Israeli military recently began showing the video to its troops, amid persistent Palestinian complaints of mistreatment by soldiers.\n\nIsrael has an entire doctrine on operating checkpoints: how many soldiers are needed for different types of blockades and how to differentiate between civilians and militants, said Eitan Ben-Eliahu, a former Israeli air force commander.\n\n``These are details that only people who were involved in it for many years can know, and other armies, like the U.S. military, haven't had ... enough experience,'' he said.\n\nUrban warfare is different from conventional fighting in every way, Ben-Eliahu said. Soldiers are often confronted with face-to-face battles against an enemy willing to commit suicide. And soldiers have to avoid killing civilians who mingle, knowingly or not, among militants, he said.\n\nAn Israeli security source said American officers have visited a mock-up of an Arab town used for Israeli training. Earlier this year, Israeli and American troops held joint exercises in Israel's Negev Desert, focusing on air defenses.\n\nBrig. Gen. Michael Vane, deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Army's Training and Doctrine Command, acknowledged in a letter to Army Magazine in July that ``we recently traveled to Israel to glean lessons learned from their counter-terrorist operations in urban areas.''\n\nMartin Van Creveld, an Israeli military expert, warned that just as Israel has been unsuccessful in eliminating militant groups and suicide bombers, the United States cannot expect to be victorious in Iraq.\n\nVan Creveld traveled to Camp Lejeune, N.C., last year to lecture U.S. military officials on the door-to-door fighting that took place in April 2002 in the West Bank refugee camp of Jenin. Twenty-three Israeli soldiers and 52 Palestinians were killed in the battle.\n\n``They are already doing things that we have been doing for years to no avail, like demolishing buildings ... like closing off villages in barbed wire,'' Van Creveld said. ``The Americans are coming here to try to mimic all kinds of techniques, but it's not going to do them any good.''\n\nIn Iraq, the Americans have a more difficult task than Israel's in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Van Creveld said. Iraq is larger, the borders are open and there is almost unlimited access to arms.\n\n``I don't see how on earth they (the U.S.) can win. I think this is going to end the same way Vietnam did,'' Van Creveld said. ``They are going to flee the country hanging on the strings of helicopters,'' he added, referring to the 1973 U.S. departure from Saigon.\n\n-------- israel / palestine\nA Bush Aide Criticizes Israel for Not Doing More for Peace\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy STEVEN R. WEISMAN\nThe New York Times\n\n\nWASHINGTON - In an unusually blunt criticism of a close ally, a Bush administration envoy on the Middle East said Thursday that Israel had \"done too little for far too long\" to foster peace negotiations with the Palestinian Authority.\n\nSpeaking at a conference in Rome held to raise money for the Palestinians, David F. Satterfield, a deputy assistant secretary of state, criticized the Palestinian side as well as the Israelis. But his comments about Israel were among the toughest any American official has publicly made in some time.\n\nHis statement was the third sign of American displeasure with Israel in the last month.\n\nIn late November, the administration reduced loan guarantees for Israel to punish the expansion of settlements and the construction of a barrier in the West Bank.\n\nLast week the administration rebuffed Israel as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met with self-appointed negotiators from Israel and the Palestinian side who proposed a peace plan to create a Palestinian state in most of the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nIsrael had asked the United States not to meet with the authors of that plan.\n\nMr. Powell met Thursday with two other freelance peace \"negotiators,\" Ami Ayalon, a former chief of Israel's security service, Shin Bet, and Sari Nusseibeh, a Palestinian professor, who have also advocated the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nMr. Satterfield's criticism of Israel occurred amid other signs that European, Arab and American diplomats were trying to restart the peace effort after months of inactivity.\n\nOmar Suleiman, the Egyptian security chief, met in Washington with Mr. Powell and other top American officials about the Arab efforts to get the Palestinian side to agree to a cease-fire.\n\nIn Rome international donors to the Palestinians said that, because of the installation of a new Palestinian prime minister, a \"window of opportunity\" had reopened, permitting the resumption of negotiations with Israel.\n\nThe donors also said they would consider establishing a special trust fund to help the Palestinian Authority deal with a $650 million shortfall in its budget. The donors provided $1.2 billion to the Palestinian Authority last year.\n\nThe conference in Rome included the first meeting with the Palestinian foreign minister, Nabil Shaath, and the Israeli foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, since the new Palestinian government was formed last month.\n\nSecretary Powell is to meet with Mr. Shalom on Friday, and administration officials said they were awaiting details of certain unilateral actions to be taken by Israel that have been circulating in the Israeli news media. They include closing some settlements and establishing an interim Palestinian state, according to the media reports.\n\nSome American officials said the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, might unveil these steps next week, the first anniversary of his endorsement of the administration-backed peace plan known as the \"road map.\"\n\nThe view in the administration is that the peace negotiating process is stalled right now but could be rekindled if the Israeli steps could be coupled with a cease-fire by the Palestinians and a promise to crack down on Palestinian militants. But few officials were willing to express certainty that something was in the offing.\n\n--------\n6 Palestinians Reported Killed in Gaza Clash\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy GREG MYRE\nThe New York Times\n\n\nJERUSALEM, Friday, Dec. 12 - Israeli troops on a predawn raid on Thursday shot dead six Palestinians, including militants and civilians during heavy exchanges of gunfire in the southern Gaza Strip, Palestinians said. If the death toll given by the Palestinians is correct, it would be one of the highest in a single day in recent weeks.\n\nIsraeli armored vehicles, supported by attack helicopters, entered Rafah around 4 a.m. in search of Khaled Qadi, a leading member of Islamic Jihad, a Palestinian militant group that has carried out many suicide bombings and attacks against Israel.\n\nThe military said Israeli troops were fired upon and shot back.\n\nThe army said its soldiers had shot three Palestinian gunmen and believed that all were killed. But Palestinian witnesses and doctors at Rafah Hospital said six Palestinians were killed, two of them militants and four civilians. More than a dozen Palestinians were wounded, the hospital added.\n\nThe dead included a man hit about a half-mile from the scene of the fighting by a stray bullet, a hospital official said. He added that a medic was shot while trying to help the wounded, and later died of his wounds. Israel said the medic belonged to the militant group Hamas.\n\nPalestinian gunmen wounded seven Jews who defied Israeli military orders early on Friday to try to reach a holy site in the West Bank city of Nablus, Israeli security officials told Reuters. The officials said one of the Jews was critically wounded when gunmen fired at the group near Joseph's Tomb.\n\nPalestinians in Nablus said the Israeli Army had moved in to seal off the area of the shooting.\n\nOn Thursday, the Palestinian prime minister, Ahmed Qurei, said it would be \"a terrible mistake\" if his Israeli counterpart, Ariel Sharon, tried to impose a unilateral political settlement on the Palestinians. Mr. Sharon has suggested he could take such action if peace efforts remain stalled.\n\n\"You cannot build a fence on our land, to cage us like chickens and hope all will be well,\" Mr. Qurei told the Israeli newspaper Maariv, referring to the barrier Israel is building in the West Bank. \"The conflict will continue, the fire will burn, terror will increase, nobody will benefit.\"\n\nJERUSALEM, Dec. 11 -- Six Palestinians were killed and about 20 were injured Thursday in the southern Gaza Strip when Israeli soldiers arrested a senior Palestinian militant and fierce gun battles erupted in the neighborhood surrounding his home, Israeli and Palestinian security officials said.\n\nLater in the day, Tel Aviv was rocked by a sidewalk explosion that bore the hallmarks of a Palestinian suicide bombing but turned out to be an attempted gangland hit that killed three bystanders, Israeli police officials said.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman said troops entered a refugee camp in Rafah, along the Egyptian border, at 4 a.m. to arrest Khaled Kadi, whom the spokesman described as a senior member of Islamic Jihad. He said that Kadi was involved in smuggling weapons into the Gaza Strip from Egypt and had previously planned attacks inside Israel and against Israeli soldiers and settlers in Gaza.\n\nPalestinian witnesses and security officials said that about 20 Israeli armored vehicles entered the Salam neighborhood in eastern Rafah and came under attack as they approached Kadi's house. The Israeli spokesman said that when Palestinians from two groups -- Islamic Jihad and Hamas -- opened fire with light weapons and antitank rockets, Israeli troops returned fire and killed three Hamas gunmen.\n\nPalestinian security sources and witnesses said that six people were killed, including two Hamas members -- Omar Abu Muhsin, 28, and Nasir Abu Naja, 28 -- and an emergency medical technician, Mohammed Vino, 23, who they said was shot in the head while aiding the wounded. Israeli military sources said that Vino was known to them as a Hamas operative.\n\nThe other victims were identified as Sabri Abu Loli, 25; Ayyad Mahmom, 55; and Kamal Akhras, 17. Palestinian security and hospital officials said at least 20 people were wounded, including a 10-year-old girl.\n\nIsraeli troops said they captured Kadi during the operation and destroyed three structures, including his family's house.\n\n[Early Friday, Palestinian gunmen ambushed an Israeli car heading toward a disputed holy site in the West Bank city of Nablus, wounding seven, one critically, the Associated Press reported, citing military officials and rescue workers. The Israelis, members of an extremist Jewish sect, were sneaking into the city to pray at a site where some Jews believe the biblical patriarch Joseph is buried. Israel abandoned the site in 2000 and banned Jews from going there.]\n\nIn Tel Aviv, Israeli police said the bombing Thursday targeted Zeev Rosenstein, who is considered one of the top organized crime bosses in Israel. He reportedly owns several casinos in Europe and has been the target of at least six previous assassination attempts.\n\nRosenstein and a bodyguard were slightly injured in the blast, police officials said. Three men killed in the blast had not been identified Thursday night but apparently were pedestrians, police said. At least 19 people were injured, they said.\n\nThe explosion occurred near a cafe and money changing store at a crowded intersection in central Tel Aviv. Police said the bomb was planted on an awning over the entrance of a shop.\n\nA police spokesman, Gil Kleiman, said Rosenstein had been released from police custody a few days ago after being held for investigation in a purported murder-for-hire scheme.\n\n-------- space\nUS will attack from space?\nChina and Russia call for space arms prohibition Statistics show that space-related industries grow at an annual rate of 20 percent, and the profit of international space industry exceeded US$80 billion in 2000, which is expected to increase by over 200 percent in the next 10 years. The human society has become inseparable from the outer space, and it has become a common concern of world countries to make peaceful use of the outer space and ensure space security.\n\nWho is challenging space security?\n\nThe end of the Cold War not only dramatically changed the global security circumstance, but put an end to the situation in which arms race in the space was more or less restrained. Superficially, the fast development of space technology and its wide application in military fields are the main factors threatening space security. As a matter of fact, the disintegration of the bipolar structure has made America the only superpower and its boundless expanding strength and ambition are also the actual factors challenging space security.\n\nThe dual-purpose space technology and its wide military application have provided potential driving force to space weaponization. Along with hi-tech development, the demarcation between technologies for military and civilian uses has become increasingly blurred. This is manifested as follows: firstly, many key technologies in military fields are at the same time pillar technologies for the development of the national economy; secondly, the convergence of military and civilian technologies is the orientation for technical renovation. The integration of these two kinds of technologies has made it difficult for people to tell one from the other. A case in point is space technology. Navigation, detecting and communication satellites can be applied to both military purposes and economic construction. During the Iraq War, America mobilized more than 100 satellites of various kinds, ranging from highly confidential electronic reconnaissance satellites to meteorological satellites accessible to anyone.\n\nBesides, the wide application of space technology to the military field has, on the one hand, enormously enhanced the US army's capability of global reach and real-time striking, enabling US troops to have a farther sight, faster action, more direct attacking and smoother communication than their enemies. On the other hand, due to the fact that the efficient use of space resources has become an important factor deciding the outcome of war, satellites and other space resources will therefore possibly become targets of attack and intervention during wars and conflicts. Civilian satellites, in particular, due to their role as supplements and substitutes for military satellites in wars, are much likely subject to attack in war. For this reason, the dual purpose and wide military application of space technology have, to a certain extent, intensified the danger of weaponization of the space.\n\nThe US space policy of one-sided search for absolute advantages may trigger off a series of chain reactions and new vulnerability in space. America's attempt, plan and action to control the outer space not only have long been in existence, but also have undergone new development thanks to the effort of the Bush administration. To take the military highland of space all to itself, the US army not only aims to rely heavily on the space, but also wants to dominate it exclusively. As clearly pointed out in the nation's space development guide, the \"space control\" defined by the US army is the capability to \"secure its own freedom of action in space\", and at the same time \"prevent its rivals from having such capability\". The Pentagon is organizing its space combat troops and Rumsfeld has ordered the air force to get ready for \"carrying out fast and continuous space operations\".\n\nWhat worth mentioning is that the Bush Administration is developing its missile defense system, aiming at missile interception in space by 2008. An official with the US Missile Defense Agency this year stressed efforts made on developing a space-based test platform, which includes at least three satellites at its initial stage, while a Space-Based Laser (SBL) in the missile defense program will be put into test by 2012. The application of SBL will go far beyond the needs of a missile defense system, experts pointed out. According to the SBL project director, the extra functions of SBL include \"defending/attacking anti-space-based fights (i.e., anti-satellite missions); \"preventing enemy use of space (such as destroying enemy launching); preventing information input/output of satellites (likely to use low-energy beams to jam satellites rather than directly destroying them); \"defending/attacking anti-space fights\" and \"striking high-altitude planes, cruise missiles and unmanned aircraft\". Although the efficiency of SBL is uncertain, the adverse current of space weaponization has appeared.\n\nDue to the development of space technology, existing international treaty framework for planning space activities fails to meet the new growing space security challenge. By now, international treaties relating to the prevention of outer-space arms race mainly include the \"Five United Nations Treaties on Outer Space\", \"Partial Test Ban Treaty\", \"Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques\", \"Agreement Concerning Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies\", as well as the \"Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty\" between the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\nThese treaties once played a positive role in preventing outer-space arms race, but limited by political, military and technological conditions, they are seriously flawed and unable to prevent arms race in the outer space. For example, the \"Five UN Treaties on Outer Space\" is weakened in its function of preventing outer-space arms race and laid perils for future weapons in space since it doesn't prohibit the deployment of non-WMD arms nor the development, production and use of outer-space weapons. Some treaties do have strict regulations, but they have ceased to be effective, such as the \"Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty\" of 1972. Some others fail to be universal because signatories are too few, such as the \"Moon Agreement\" of 1979. In a word, the current international mechanism for preventing space arms race is too weak to tackle the rapid development of space technology and weapons. The existing treaties must be added or revised, even new treaties need to be concluded through negotiations.\n\nTit-for-tat lines in space security\n\nThe new threat to space security has raised higher requirements on outer-space arms control. In recent years, although the international community has made much effort in this regard, the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, due to obstructions from the United States, remained stagnant in the aspects of preventing outer-space arms race and strengthening the outer-space legal system. Currently there are two lines of thought for preventing out-space arms race and securing space security. One is represented by America, which, in quest of absolute security, is against negotiations on space disarmament regardless of the interests of other countries. Now the Bush Administration is bent on expanding its space military capability, believing that actions must be taken to guarantee its security as long as they are technologically practicable. Washington's excuse is that America relies heavier on space than other countries do, so it is obliged to develop a unique space capability to ensure security. America declared its space weapons as defensive, then whom is it to guard against? Are they Russia and China, who have been taken by America as rivals?\n\nThe other line is represented by China and Russia. The two countries oppose outer-space armament and arms race, and advocate addressing related countries' space security concerns through international cooperation, this helps enhance international security and stability and is in the common interests of all countries. To this end, China has been making strenuous efforts to spur the international community to sign related international legal documents through negotiations and proposed to the Conference related documents together with other countries involved. China holds that a special committee for preventing outer-space arms race should be rebuilt as soon as possible to reach, through negotiation, agreements or treaties with legal effect for preventing outer space arms race.\n\nTo ensure the effectiveness of the treaties China suggested that they must contain the following articles: prohibition of test, deployment and use of any weapon, weapon system and their components in outer space; prohibition of test, deployment and use of any weapon, weapon system and their components used for outer-space war on land, sea and in the atmosphere; prohibition of the use, or threat of use, of weapons on outer-space objects; prohibition of helping and encouraging other countries, groups and international organizations to participate in activities forbidden by the treaty.\n\nThe existence of the two completely different lines shows that the international community must take immediate actions to bring the outer-space weapon control into track. Once a legal binding agreement on space disarmament is reached, it will help remove an important unstable factor in future international security and ensure the continuous peaceful use of space.\n\nWhile ABC might have a few points about being the only other network other than MSNBC to have a full-time reporter with the campaign, what they are missing, and hoping you will miss as well, is how they DON'T use the footage that Melinda Arons has collected over her period with the campaign. Melinda is a great person who is very dedicated to her work (I've met her several times and has had the opportunity to talk to her quite extensively), yet everytime I ask her why Dennis Kucinich is not mentioned more, she always refers the cause to upper-management: producers decide what to show and what not to show. So don't let ABC scare you away with their rhetoric about how they have been responsible and should be the last in line to be criticized. They should be criticized for not giving equal air time to all the presidential candidates, and they should be held responsible for the decisions they make. After all, does anyone really think Lieberman or Edwards is going to get the nomination? I didn't think so...\n\nThe controversy began when the White House said Air Force One was spotted by a British Airways plane but the president's pilots told the dubious British Airways pilots by radio that they were flying a Gulfstream V. The White House later said there was no British Airways plane involved and the conversation took place between British air traffic control and another plane while Air Force One was \"off the western coast of England.\"\n\nAs it happens, Air Force One was flying across the North Sea, off the eastern coast of England, when it was spotted by the mystery plane, a German charter jet. But that's being picky.\n\nOf more concern, air traffic controllers in Britain are seething over the flight, in which the president's 747, falsely identified as a Gulfstream, traveled through British airspace. Prospect, the controllers union in the United Kingdom, says the flight broke international regulations, posed a potential safety threat and exposed a weakness in the air defense system that could be exploited by terrorists.\n\n\"The overriding concern is if the president's men who did this can dupe air traffic control, what's to stop a highly organized terrorist group from duping air traffic control?\" asked David Luxton, Prospect's national secretary. Luxton said the flight was in \"breach\" of regulations against filing false flight plans set by the International Civil Aviation Organization, which he said should apply to a military aircraft using civilian airspace.\n\nLuxton said that by identifying itself as a Gulfstream V instead of the much larger 747, Air Force One could have put itself and other airplanes in danger. The Gulfstream can climb faster and maneuver more nimbly than a 747, which means controllers could have assumed the president's plane was capable of a collision-avoiding maneuver that it couldn't actually do. And the \"wake vortex\" of a 747, much larger than a Gulfstream's, could jeopardize smaller planes that were told by unsuspecting controllers to follow in the mislabeled plane's wake.\n\nAs it happens, Air Force One passed without incident. But Luxton said that's beside the point. \"It's important air traffic control have an accurate picture of what's up there in the sky they're controlling,\" he said.\n\nThe White House has declined to elaborate further on the flight plan and other security measures for the trip.\n\n-------- POLICE / PRISONERS / COURTS / JUSTICE\n\n-------- death penalty\nWhen DNA Meets Death Row, It's the System That's Tested\n\nInside a walk-in freezer in a Richmond, Calif., laboratory sits a tiny vial that holds one-fifth of one drop of a 20-year-old sperm sample. It is forensic DNA evidence extracted from the body of a brutally murdered young bride, evidence that no one is permitted by law to touch, evidence that -- if tested -- could determine whether an innocent man was executed in Virginia 11 years ago.\n\nThe case of Virginia coal miner Roger Keith Coleman -- put to death for the 1982 murder of his wife's sister, Wanda McCoy -- is one of a handful of death-penalty cases in which DNA evidence still exists in police labs and evidence facilities across the country that could cast doubt on the guilt of men already executed.\n\nSince DNA \"fingerprinting\" began to revolutionize criminal forensics in the late 1980s with precise identifications, it has freed more than 130 convicts, 12 of whom have walked off death row. But in other cases, prosecutors have successfully blocked the testing of DNA before an execution and then fought posthumous tests just as vigorously.\n\nNow two of those cases are moving toward denouement. In the Coleman case, advocates met recently with a senior aide to Virginia Gov. Mark R. Warner (D), who could order the DNA tested. Warner is seriously considering the request, said Robert Blue, the governor's chief counsel. And last Friday, in the Texas case of Richard Wayne Jones, a judge granted a prosecutor's motion to conclude legal efforts to obtain evidence for testing -- the last barrier stopping the state from destroying the evidence.\n\n\"The most critical reason to test these cases is that you can find the person who really committed the crime,\" said Barry Scheck, co-founder of the Innocence Project at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, which provides pro bono help to inmates seeking post-conviction DNA testing. \"It seems to me the community would have a compelling interest in knowing the truth, and we can learn from the truth.\"\n\nScheck points to the Florida case of Frank Lee Smith as the most unsettling example of the relevance of DNA testing. Smith -- black, poor and mentally ill -- was convicted of the 1985 rape and murder of an 8-year-old girl. He died of cancer on death row in 2000, waiting for the DNA testing that exonerated him 11 months later. The results identified a convicted rapist and murderer as the perpetrator.\n\nProsecutors say that they usually support post-conviction testing if the results could definitively resolve an inmate's guilt or innocence. But a number acknowledge that they remain opposed to what they see as baseless testing, in large part out of concern for the victims' relatives, who have waited years -- sometimes decades -- for closure.\n\nLegal experts say that the costs of testing, which run into thousands of dollars, contribute to the resistance. They also cite a prosecutorial fear that foes of the death penalty are simply trying to undermine the capital-punishment system. John Eastman, a Chapman University law professor, said that post-conviction DNA testing is not always \"about a particular guy being innocent, but an effort to open the door to build a case against the death penalty.\"\n\nIn the case of Joseph Roger O'Dell III, executed in Virginia in 1997 for a rape and murder, a prosecuting attorney bluntly argued in court in 1998 that if posthumous DNA results exonerated O'Dell, \"it would be shouted from the rooftops that . . . Virginia executed an innocent man.\" The state prevailed, and the evidence was destroyed.\n\n\"There are circumstances where enough is enough after going through 15 years of appeals,\" said Josh Marquis, an Oregon prosecutor who is co-chairman of the capital litigation committee of the National District Attorneys Association. \"At some point there has to be finality. They have no disincentive for stopping. . . . In most of these cases, it's the last-ditch effort, the Hail Mary pass.\"\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers agree that the spate of well-publicized wrongful convictions uncovered by DNA testing has taken its toll on the system. As Attorney General John D. Ashcroft encourages prosecutors to aggressively pursue the death penalty, jurors are showing increasing reluctance to mete it out. A 2001 Bureau of Justice Statistics study shows death sentences are down by half since 1994. Proof that an innocent man has been executed could be a tipping point in this national debate, according to both sides.\n\n\"There is no question\" that the vindication of an executed man \"could have a significant impact on the system,\" said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, an anti-death-penalty education organization in Washington. \"By putting a human face on a huge mistake, hesitation of the death penalty could turn into opposition -- not because people morally perceive it as wrong but because they would see the system is flawed.\"\n\nOthers, however, believe the impact would be minimal, and a recent survey supports that. A May 2003 Gallup Poll showed that 73 percent of Americans believe that an innocent man has been executed in the past five years -- but the same poll showed that 60 percent of those surveyed believe the punishment is applied fairly.\n\nIn four cases of executed men examined by The Washington Post, anti-death-penalty advocacy groups, relatives of the executed, lawyers or the media have tried to have samples tested. In two of the cases, the states thwarted DNA testing before the men were executed. Most recently, the Texas attorney general denied a request from The Post to test evidence in the case of Jones, executed in 2000 for the stabbing murder of a woman he was accused of kidnapping. Also in Texas, defense attorneys continue to try to obtain DNA evidence in the case of Windell Broussard, put to death for killing his estranged wife and stepson. The nonprofit Innocence Project has agreed to handle the testing if they are successful. In the Oklahoma case of Malcolm Rent Johnson, executed for the rape and murder of an elderly woman, the state had tentatively agreed to posthumous testing -- but then federal authorities seized the evidence for another investigation.\n\nMore than 30 states have in recent years enacted laws that permit some form of post-conviction DNA testing in the event that evidence -- or technology -- should develop years later that could spare a life. But when Coleman, Broussard, Jones and Johnson were convicted, they were afforded no such guaranteed protections.\n\n'Let Sleeping Dogs Lie'\n\nIn the decade that Roger Coleman sat on death row for the 1981 murder of his sister-in-law, he had more public support for his innocence claim than any other condemned man in recent history. Articulate and white, the coal miner from Grundy, Va., had going for him an ingratiating personality as well as a team of high-powered lawyers, an inmate aid organization, a supportive University of Virginia girlfriend and a press corps raising questions about his guilt. Days before his execution, Time magazine asked on its cover, \"Must This Man Die?\"\n\nBut in the end, no amount of public pressure could persuade the courts and the governor of Virginia at the time, L. Douglas Wilder (D), to spare Coleman's life. Coleman was electrocuted on May 20, 1992, after proclaiming, \"An innocent man is going to be murdered tonight.\"\n\nLast year, the Virginia Supreme Court rebuffed a pleading to obtain the sample for posthumous testing from Centurion Ministries, the inmate aid charity, and a group of media organizations, including The Post, ruling that the parties had \"no right\" to gain access to the sample for testing.\n\nBut the matter is not over.\n\nEdward Blake, a forensic scientist hired by the defense in 1990 to do an earlier form of DNA testing, could not at that time eliminate Coleman as the rapist and killer. But with more-advanced technology now at his disposal, Blake holds the small sample in his Forensics Science Associates laboratory freezer in California, refusing to return it to the state for fear it will be destroyed -- but also barred from testing it without a court order.\n\nAlthough Blake suspects Coleman is guilty based on his earlier work, he is also steadfast in his belief that the public has the right to know the truth. \"I'm not anti-death penalty; I'm pro-democracy,\" he said in an interview. \"How can the state take the position that this is not worth inquiring into? Why not find out once and for all?\"\n\nBlake also said that because he has not examined the sample in years, he cannot be sure there is enough left to test.\n\nColeman supporters have long challenged his conviction based on what they say was an implausible timeline and inexperienced trial lawyers. They argue that if he had been everywhere witnesses said he was, Coleman would not have had time to park his truck on the main road, wade through a creek, rape his sister-in-law, cut her throat and get home. He became suspect because of an earlier conviction for sexual assault -- a crime he also denied.\n\nAfter years of legal maneuvering, Coleman's defense team persuaded a judge in 1990 to allow the semen swab to be tested, over strong objections from the Virginia attorney general. Blake concluded that the semen was consistent with Coleman's, but DNA technology was still in its nascent stages. Blake raised the possibility that two different semen samples may have been present.\n\nWhen he lost the court battle to have the DNA tested, Jim McCloskey, head of Centurion Ministries, asked Warner to have the sample retested, a decision the governor can make unilaterally.\n\n\"That is not implying that I have any worry that Coleman was wrongly convicted,\" he said. \"What do we do about it in 10 years -- when more sophisticated technology comes up? Do we test it again? When does this Pandora's box stop opening?\"\n\nSharon Paul, Coleman's former girlfriend, lives in Seattle today and has tried to move on with her life. She said she is ambivalent about testing the sample -- but would like to see Coleman's name cleared. She said she has no apprehension about the results.\n\n\"I am very secure in my belief that Roger Coleman was innocent,\" she said. \"Any results that offer a different answer will just lead me to conclude mistakes were made.\"\n\n'Simply Unconscionable'\n\nWhen Richard Wayne Jones was arrested in 1986 for the kidnapping and stabbing murder of Tammy Livingston in Fort Worth, he and his girlfriend had in their possession the victim's checkbook, bank card and credit cards. His fingerprint was found on the victim's car, and a couple of drops of blood consistent with hers were on his pants.\n\nFrom the initial investigation, Jones never denied being at the crime scene. But after confessing to the murder, he later recanted. In a goodbye letter to his mother in 1993, after his first execution date had been set, he for the first time accused his sister, Brenda, and a friend of hers, Walt Sellers, of the murder, and claimed to have only helped dispose of the body to help Brenda. He admitted to driving the victim's car and to burning her body to cover up the crime.\n\nEvidence in the case still sits in a Fort Worth police lab, but none of it -- including swabs from Livingston's body and cigarette butts found in her car -- was ever tested for DNA. Jones's defense team asserts that testing would have spared his life by raising a reasonable doubt that he was the murderer. Jones's sister and Sellers were never charged.\n\n\"I have no doubt about his version of events. I have no doubt this man did not kill Tammy Livingston,\" said Tina Francis, an investigator who worked on the case for years. She said she came across numerous people who supported Jones's version of events.\n\n\"It's unforgivable that he burned the body -- but he shouldn't have been executed for it. It's still very raw for me.\"\n\nAccording to defense lawyers and Francis, Jones grew up in an unstable, poor family in rural Texas and had been in trouble with the law before this arrest. He had an IQ of 67, said Francis, which made him borderline retarded. The defense team was never able to persuade the courts to reopen the case. In a last-ditch effort shortly before his execution -- and immediately afterward -- Jones's attorneys and his two sons unsuccessfully tried to have the DNA tested. The effort was vigorously opposed by the state as a waste of time and resources.\n\n\"He always admitted to being present at the crime scene, so the DNA would never exclude him and therefore never exonerate him,\" said Ann Diamond, a prosecutor in the case, who is seeking the dismissal of the case.\n\n\"They found her blood on him. His fingerprint was on the car. He admitted to burning the body. There is no articulated basis, in any way, shape or form, that he could be cleared of this crime. If there were any possibility . . . we would have [tested]. But when we have so many cases, there was no justification to expend public resources.\" William Harris, Jones's appellate lawyer, said: \"It was simply unconscionable that they would not test the evidence before killing a man.\"\n\nJones was executed Aug. 22, 2000. After he died, a member of the defense team secured a DNA sample from Jones's body, which is tucked away in a lockbox in the event the state ever agrees to test the evidence.\n\nIn September, the Texas attorney general's office denied a request from The Post for the physical evidence in the case, stating that \"tangible physical evidence . . . is not public information.\" Then, last week, a judge agreed to dismiss all pending claims on the evidence. Jones's attorneys, Greg Westfall and Gerald Staton, did not oppose the prosecutor's motion.\n\n'Wasn't a Choirboy'\n\nIn April 1992, a little girl named Toccara Harris lay critically wounded in a Port Arthur, Tex., emergency room, just hours after a brutal stabbing attack that took the lives of her mother and 10-year-old brother.\n\n\"Who hurt you?\" a police officer asked her.\n\nShe was unequivocal in her response: \"My stepdaddy,\" she said. \"Windell Broussard.\"\n\nAt that moment, at 8 years old, Toccara became the most compelling witness against the estranged husband of her 28-year-old mother, a witness who the defense argued was far too young to make a definitive identification. The room was dark when the assailant stabbed the family, the lawyers argued. She could see only a man's profile, and furthermore, she was awakened in the middle of the night. How, the lawyers asked, could the child be so sure?\n\nBroussard denied involvement, but prosecutors built a strong case based on his criminal record, his volatile relationship with his wife, Dianna, testimony from an elderly aunt who quoted him as saying he killed someone -- and Toccara's eyewitness account.\n\nBroussard was convicted and sentenced to death. In April 2001, Texas passed emergency legislation to permit post-conviction DNA testing. Within weeks, Broussard's appellate lawyers filed suit in state district court in Beaumont to compel the testing.\n\n\"Windell wasn't a choirboy -- you'd never accuse him of singing too loud in church,\" said Michael Charlton, who filed the lawsuit. \"But I believed him. . . . I just liked the guy.\"\n\nDuring a hearing on the matter, Judge Charles Carver in Beaumont denied the request to test the scrapings but agreed to order the blood samples from the scene to be tested. A few weeks later, Charlton recalled, the judge changed his mind with no explanation. The lawyer appealed to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals but was not able to get a stay of execution.\n\n\"I don't know what the purpose of DNA testing would be -- for publicity or to find the truth,\" Jefferson County Assistant District Attorney Ed Shettle said yesterday. \"The little girl was an incredible witness.\"\n\n\"Windell maintained his innocence on the gurney,\" Charlton said.\n\nThis month the Innocence Project agreed to test any available DNA, and Charlton continues to press for whatever evidence may remain.\n\n'I'm Going to Heaven'\n\nOklahoma City public defender Robert Ravitz is not sure to this day whether his client Malcolm Rent Johnson was innocent of the 1981 rape and murder of 76-year-old Ura Alma Thompson. But the defense lawyer is nonetheless certain that Johnson did not get a fair shake from the legal system before he was executed for the crime almost four years ago.\n\nThe state's case relied on Johnson's possession of Thompson's personal property, as well as fiber, hair and semen analysis that was later challenged. \"Maybe [the state] could have made a case for being in possession of stolen property,\" Ravitz said. \"But I just can't believe in my wildest dreams that a jury, even back then, would give someone the death penalty based on that kind of flimsy evidence.\"\n\nJohnson maintained his innocence for 18 years. \"I'm going to heaven on a midnight train,\" he told the witnesses to his execution.\n\nJohnson was a young man with a low IQ and a troubled history when he was charged with Thompson's murder. A product of an abusive home life, he had served time for rape, robbery and assault by the time he was 23.\n\nOn the day Thompson's body was discovered by her nephew in her Oklahoma City apartment, Johnson was arrested on an unrelated weapons charge. The arresting detective noticed in Johnson's apartment a doll matching a description of one taken from another rape victim. A wider search uncovered a number of items belonging to Thompson -- a ring, a watch, a key to her apartment. Johnson said that he did not know how the items got there, that perhaps his brother brought them.\n\nThe forensic evidence presented at Johnson's trial had been handled and tested by now-disgraced police scientist Joyce Gilchrist, whose alleged mishandling of evidence threw the state law enforcement community into turmoil two years ago.\n\nGilchrist testified that semen samples allowed her to identify the blood type as being the same as Johnson's. She also testified that blue fibers at the apartment matched a shirt of Johnson's, and that the blue dye from the shirt was found on hairs at the scene -- a highly unusual conclusion. It was the first time Gilchrist had testified about fiber. The court denied Johnson's request for funds to hire an expert to refute her testimony.\n\nWhen questions were raised about Gilchrist's competence after Johnson's execution, a lawyer who never knew Johnson took up his cause. Douglas Parr sued the police for documents and to have tested the semen-stained evidence -- a bedspread, pillowcases and pantyhose.\n\nTwo years ago, an internal police memorandum was made public that contradicted Gilchrist's testimony at trial. A new exam of the slides that Gilchrist had said contained sperm showed they contained none -- which a defense expert would likely have caught. \"I was very upset,\" Ravitz said.\n\nA month later, the city attorney agreed to let Parr have the evidence. But before it could be tested, the federal government subpoenaed all the Johnson evidence as part of an investigation into Gilchrist's practices.\n\nOklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson said in an interview this week that he supports testing the evidence but added that he has no doubt that the state executed the right man.\n\n\"If we tried this case again today without DNA, you'd still get a conviction.\" he said. \"He was in the vicinity, his blood type was corroborative, her keys were in his apartment, and she's dead.\"\n\nEdmondson said he has tried unsuccessfully to ascertain whether the federal government has tested the evidence. Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office in Oklahoma City declined to say. The truth, one said, will be revealed in time.\n\nResearchers Lucy Shackelford and Alice Crites contributed to this report.\n\n-------- justice\nProbe Fails to Find Source of Leaks About Secret Service\n\nA government leak investigation into a 2002 magazine series that found widespread problems within the ranks of U.S. Secret Service has failed to identify anyone who improperly revealed information.\n\nThe Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General, in a report released yesterday under the Freedom of Information Act, said that it was unable to find current or former Secret Service employees who were involved with the \"unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information\" to U.S. News & World Report.\n\nIn a series of investigative reports, the magazine detailed a host of serious failings within an agency that considers itself the most elite and professional in law enforcement. The Secret Service employs thousands of uniformed officers and plainclothes agents to protect the president and other senior government officials and their families.\n\nThe magazine found gaps at times in the protective detail around some government officials and their families, though not the president. It described inadequate weapons training and accidents caused by Secret Service motorcades.\n\nThe articles also reported numerous instances of improper activity by Secret Service personnel, including allegations of criminal behavior, alcohol abuse and misuse of government property and reports that senior Secret Service officials had extramarital affairs with White House employees. The magazine detailed how a team of agents assigned to Vice President Cheney when he traveled to San Diego got into a drunken brawl when their shift ended.\n\nAfter the articles' publication, a senior official of the Secret Service's inspection division asked the inspector general of the Treasury Department, which includes the Secret Service, to find out whether Secret Service employees had broken the law by disclosing sensitive information or by making false statements about their contact with U.S. News reporters.\n\nThe inspection division questioned whether the release of such information could have harmed the service's mission and violated any law, rule or policy, according to the IG report.\n\nA Secret Service spokeswoman had no comment yesterday on whether the agency had asked for an investigation or taken any other steps to respond to the problems reported by U.S. News.\n\n\"We don't know whether the inspector general did any substantive investigation,\" said U.S. News Editor Brian Duffy. \"We know that the president asked [White House chief of staff] Andy Card to take it up with the then-head of the Secret Service, and we heard Card did raise it.\"\n\nDuffy added that the Secret Service refused to respond to the magazine's questions throughout the course of its inquiry.\n\nThe inspector general's report, which was completed April 28 but released only yesterday in redacted form, said that the inspection division identified employees it suspected of talking to U.S. News employees.\n\nOne of those Secret Service employees declined to provide a sworn statement to investigators and resigned from the agency.\n\nThe inspector general found that another employee \"probably did\" discuss Secret Service issues, but, in a sworn affidavit, denied speaking to reporters.\n\nIn the course of the probe, IG investigators examined Secret Service telephone and computer records.\n\nThe Justice Department \"declined to prosecute on the merits of the investigation,\" the IG report said.\n\n-------- terrorism\nEfforts to Fight Terror Financing Reported to Lag\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy ERIC LICHTBLAU and TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN\nThe New York Times\n\n\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 11 - The federal authorities do not have a clear understanding of how terrorists move their financial assets and are still struggling to prevent the flow of money to terror groups, according to a new Congressional report.\n\nThe report, by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, also finds that the Internal Revenue Service has not developed a formal plan for sharing financial information with state authorities about charities under investigation. And the report says the Treasury and Justice Departments have fallen nearly a year behind in developing a plan for attacking money laundering and issues like terrorists' use of black-market gems and gold. It says some agencies have failed to make terrorism financing a high priority or have set unrealistic goals for overhauling their tactics. The report is to be made public on Sunday.\n\nThe findings come at a time when some government officials and lawmakers say they have grown increasingly concerned about weaknesses in the government's ability to track how terrorists finance their operations.\n\nLaw enforcement officials point to several recent successes in investigating people in the United States and overseas suspected as major financiers of terrorism. But they acknowledge that gaining a clear understanding of how terrorists move their money has proven far more difficult than many anticipated and that recent attacks in Saudi Arabia, Turkey and elsewhere point to terror groups with continued access to significant resources.\n\nJustice Department officials acknowledged to investigators that the Federal Bureau of Investigation \"does not systematically collect and analyze\" information on financing used by terrorists. Such schemes have involved filtering money through charities or laundering it by selling diamonds and gold, or even cigarettes and household appliances on the black market.\n\nThe investigation \"is a real eye opener,\" said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, who requested the study along with Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa.\n\n\"This is an indication that we were naïve to believe that all of our attention had this problem under control,\" Senator Durbin said. \"I don't think we're close, and this report says that terrorists are going to continue to have resources at their disposal.\"\n\nSeveral current and former government officials said in interviews that they believed that federal agencies have made strong progress in the last two years in attacking terrorist financing, with the F.B.I, the Treasury Department, the Department of Homeland Security and others committing more agents and greater coordination to the problem.\n\n\"There have been real and material advances in the war on terrorist financing since 9/11,\" said David Aufhauser, the Treasury Department's former general counsel, who left the government in October after working extensively on the terrorist financing issue. \"It's now part of the international agenda and has to be part of the international agenda in order to be effective.\"\n\nMark Corallo, spokesman for the Justice Department, said he had not received a copy of the report. But he said, \"Since Sept. 11, the government has tirelessly pursued terrorist financing to great success.\"\n\nMr. Corallo said that \"tracking down terrorist financing is no easy matter, but we pursue all the leads in order to dry up the financing that makes terrorist activity possible.\"\n\nOther government officials say the course has been slow-going.\n\n\"Right now there is a lack of understanding of what the problem really is,\" a Justice Department official who works extensively on terror financing issues said in an interview. \"Tracing money in the best of circumstances is very, very difficult, and when you're talking about terrorist operations that can be carried out for $50,000 or $75,000, it's almost impossible.\"\n\nThe campaign to cut off terrorist financing has seen some high-profile successes and arrests in recent months, and investigators are continuing to delve into a complex network of Islamic charities and organizations in Northern Virginia that they say may have funneled money to terrorist groups. In the New York City and New Jersey area alone, investigators with the Department of Homeland Security have identified $100 million that they say was sent through illegal money-transmittal businesses, like hawalas, to countries with possible terrorist ties.\n\nBut the efforts to trace terrorist financing have been marred at times by turf wars between agencies and occasional conflicts in mission.\n\nSome agencies say they remain frustrated by a lack of resources to combat terrorist financing. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, part of the Treasury Department, said that it has felt stymied as investigators have either been let go or reassigned to other agencies.\n\nThe Treasury Department's efforts to freeze terrorist-related assets have slowed after an initial rush following the Sept. 11 attacks. More than $136 million has been frozen worldwide, most of it in the months immediately after the attacks.\n\nLaw enforcement officials say terrorists have proven adept at finding new ways to raise money, using commodities like stolen baby formula to launder money.\n\nThe report from the accounting office said investigators looked into suspected terrorists who were raising money by selling counterfeit household appliances; they simply created their own brand.\n\nIn Pakistan, a charitable group implicated in terrorist financing avoided a Pakistani intelligence investigation by moving its money to Afghanistan, the report said.\n\nAnd in Lebanon, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration ran into a dead end in investigating possible ties between drug smugglers and terrorists because of the group's \"indecipherable records\" on its financial transactions, the report said.\n\n\"We recognize that such analyses are difficult, but without an attempt do so, information about terrorists' usage and potential usage remains unknown, leaving vulnerabilities for terrorists to exploit,\" the report said in recommending a comprehensive, more analytical approach to identifying terrorist money.\n\nSenator Grassley said the report pointed up a need for a more integrated approach to investigating terrorist financing.\n\n\"What you're seeing in all of this is the left hand of the government doesn't know what the right hand is doing,\" he said in an interview. \"Why do we have a problem? Three words: lack of cooperation.\"\n\nCongressional investigators also faulted the F.B.I. for not distinguishing terrorist financing cases from broader international terror cases. \"The lack of such data hinders the F.B.I. from conducting systematic analysis of trends and patterns\" in financing and establishing clear priorities on areas it needs to attack, the report said.\n\nBut the F.B.I. said in a statement that it had aggressively analyzed the full range of unconventional financing schemes, including drug smuggling, charities and bulk-cash smuggling, in its effort to dismantle terrorist networks. \"We believe we have had significant success in this aspect of the war on terrorism,\" the bureau said.\n\nEric Lichtblau reported from Washington for this article, and Timothy L. O'Brien in telephone interviews from Moscow. David Johnston contributed reporting from Washington.\n\nHAMBURG, Dec. 11 -- The trial of a Moroccan man accused of helping the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers appeared close to collapse Thursday after the court announced that the German federal police had provided information, apparently taken from the interrogation of a top al Qaeda planner in U.S. custody, that the defendant had no advance knowledge of the plot.\n\nThe The judge said Mzoudi, alleged to be a member of the Hamburg cell that spearheaded the attacks in the United States, will have to continue to attend the trial but is otherwise free until a verdict is reached.\n\n\"There is the serious possibility that Mzoudi was purposefully left out of the attack plans despite his links to the Hamburg group and despite his stay in Afghanistan, and that his supportive actions were not consciously made,\" Ruehle said.\n\nThe surprise turn could also undo the guilty verdict a German court returned in February against another Moroccan, Mounir Motassadeq, on the same charges. With that ruling, he became the first person anywhere to be convicted of helping in the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nIn Washington, Attorney General John D. Ashcroft told reporters that he was \"disappointed that the case in Germany has taken the turn it has taken.\" He added that \"fortunately, in the United States, we enjoy a legal structure which anticipates the need for protecting both national security and adjudicating the innocence or guilt of individuals who are charged.\"\n\nRuehle, citing police information faxed to the court, reported that an unnamed witness had said that of the cell members who were based in Hamburg, only suicide pilots Mohamed Atta, Marwan Al-Shehhi and Ziad Samir Jarrah, along with and Ramzi Binalshibh, knew of the plan for the hijackings.\n\nRuehle said in court that he believed the unnamed witness was Binalshibh, a citizen of Yemen who was arrested in Pakistan on the first anniversary of the attacks, and is believed by investigators to have been one of the plot's central planners. Binalshibh is being held at a secret location by U.S. authorities.\n\nThe decision by the panel of five judges in Hamburg will increase pressure on the United States to release Binalshibh's interrogation transcripts so that his credibility can be assessed. If his statement were found to lack credibility, the court might ignore it and move to convict Mzoudi. Without such disclosure, the court could dismiss the cases against Mzoudi and Motassadeq solely on the strength of the police statement, lawyers said.\n\nThe judge said that because the court had no opportunity to question Binalshibh or review transcripts of his interrogations, it had no way to know how believable he is.\n\nUnder German law, authorities who become aware of potentially exculpatory evidence are required to report it to the court.\n\nProsecutors argued successfully in the Motassadeq case that the defendant knew what Atta and other members of the Hamburg cell were planning and willingly assisted them by transferring money to the United States and providing other services. Both Mzoudi and Motassadeq maintain that whatever help they gave was unwitting.\n\nThe three pilots and Binalshibh \"did not speak with others at any time about 'actual operations or creating a terrorist cell' for furthering the jihad,\" read the faxed statement from the Bundeskriminalamt, the German equivalent of the FBI.\n\nMotassadeq's attorney said in an interview that he would immediately petition the court to release his client because the information also appeared to exonerate Motassadeq, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison.\n\n\"I think the Germans will have to offer him a major apology and that he will be able to stay here,\" said the attorney, Josef Graessle-Muenscher, referring to statements by the government that Motassadeq would be deported to Morocco when he completed his sentence. \"The Americans should consider what they have caused. Statements they kept secret led to a guilty verdict.\"\n\nA short man with a thick beard and a receding hairline, Mzoudi was present in court Thursday when the decision was announced. He first appeared dumbfounded, as if he did not understand what had been said. He asked his attorneys and interpreter, \"Am I a free man now?\" according to one defense attorney. \"Mr. Mzoudi, you can go home now,\" Michael Rosenthal told his now-smiling client.\n\nAfter leaving the courtroom, Mzoudi immediately fell to his knees and prayed, Rosenthal said. \"He is still shocked, and we had to explain to him it's not finished,\" Rosenthal added.\n\nThe court's decision infuriated prosecutors. Lead prosecutor Walter Hemberger also said that the unidentified witness could only be Binalshibh and that any evidence from him was probably an attempt to protect others. The federal police's fax did note that the witness had provided contradictory information in the past and that those who went to al Qaeda training camps were taught how to behave if arrested and interrogated.\n\nU.S. officials have turned over selected summaries of Binalshibh's interrogation to the Germans with the understanding that they would not be used in court, German officials said. Because the summaries themselves have not been provided to the court, just a brief communication about them, the German government has kept its side of the bargain.\n\nBoth sides in the trial have been pressing for access to the full material, however. Two weeks ago, German prosecutors asked the court for a delay before ending the evidentiary part of the trial to see if they could produce some of the transcripts. But U.S. officials said in recent interviews that they would continue to refuse such access for the court, citing national security concerns. And in letters to the court Thursday, the office of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and the Interior Ministry said the transcripts would remain secret.\n\nAn attorney for American co-plaintiffs in the case, relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, said he believed the prosecution's case was now doomed. \"We assume that the trial against Mzoudi will . . . end in an acquittal,\" said Andreas Schulz, a Berlin lawyer hired by a number of relatives to represent their interests in the trial. \"Motassadeq will probably be freed.\" Schulz said he would appeal any such decisions.\n\nA Frenchman facing terrorism charges in U.S. District Court in Alexandria is also demanding access to statements made by key al Qaeda detainees, including Binalshibh, arguing like Mzoudi and Motassadeq that the statements could exonerate him. The issue of access to the witnesses has stalled the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, who was charged in December 2001 with conspiring with al Qaeda in the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - In 1872, the U.S. government enacted a law to prevent \"sailor mongering\" - the practice of luring sailors from their ships with liquor and prostitutes. Some 131 years later, the U.S. Justice Department is using the law to prosecute the environmental organization Greenpeace for boarding a ship and unfurling a banner to protest the Bush administration.\n\nThe indictment centers on an April 2002 protest in which two Greenpeace activists climbed aboard a commercial ship several miles off the coast of Florida.\n\nThe activists believed the ship carried a shipment of mahogany illegally exported from Brazil's Amazon rainforest and once aboard they unfurled a banner that said \"President Bush, Stop Illegal Logging.\"\n\nThis kind of protest has been a signature of Greenpeace for more than three decades and the activists expected to be arrested and charged.\n\nThe individuals involved in the protest settled charges against them last year, but the Justice Department filed criminal charges against the entire organization in July 2003 under the 1872 law.\n\nBush administration lawyers say the charges are not severe enough to warrant a jury trial and a federal judge in Miami is set to hear the case. Possible penalties under the law are unclear - the law has only been used twice and the last time was in 1890.\n\nBut Greenpeace fears it could lose its tax exempt status, a potentially crippling blow to the organization's U.S. activities, and says the use of the \"sailor mongering\" law reflects a political vendetta by the Bush administration.\n\nThe administration is trying to \"muzzle a group that frequently, publicly and effectively protests the Bush administration's policies,\" said John Passacantando, executive director of Greenpeace USA.\n\nThe indictment is the first time a non governmental organization has been charged for free speech activities of its members and environmentalists are not the only ones worried about the possible implications.\n\nJulian Bond, a longtime civil rights activist and chairman of the board of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, called the case a \"government assault on time honored civil disobedience as practiced by Martin Luther King and thousand of other Americans.\"\n\n\"If John Ashcroft had done this in the 1960s, black Americans would not be voting today, eating at formerly all white lunch counters or sitting on bus fronts,\" Bond told reporters at a press briefing today.\n\nNot since the Nixon administration \"has contempt for political activists so clearly guided the heavy hand of the state,\" said Robert Musil, executive director and CEO of Physicians for Social Responsibility.\n\nThe indictment is a clear attack on the U.S. Constitution, according to Ralph Neas, president of People For the American Way Foundation, a 600,000 member civil liberties organization.\n\n\"This is a threat to all Americans, not just Greenpeace,\" said Neas. \"Permitting the selective prosecution of a group like Greenpeace merely because the government disagrees with its point of view would set a devastating precedent.\"\n\nThe right to disagree with the government is a cornerstone of American democracy, Neas said, and \"it is profoundly patriotic to engage in peaceful dissent when you think the government is wrong.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has a policy not to comment on pending cases, but its position on the specifics of the case could become clearer in the next few days.\n\nA federal judge will hear arguments Friday regarding several motions filed by Greenpeace, including one to dismiss the case and another to find the Justice Department is engaged in improper selective prosecution, which is prohibited by federal law.\n\nOther organizations have not faced similar prosecution, according to Greenpeace. It notes that a Cuban American pro democracy group held a protest in federal waters near Miami - the activists were charged, but the organization was not.\n\nThe environmental group has also filed motions to hold a jury trial if the case is not dismissed and to compel the government to turn over evidence that may support Greenpeace's claim the ship was carrying mahogany.\n\nPassacantando notes that the Justice Department revised its original indictment last month to remove language that asserted Greenpeace was mistaken in its belief that the ship carried Brazilian mahogany.\n\n\"Instead of indicting Greenpeace for blowing the whistle on illegal smuggling, our government should be intercepting the contraband and prosecuting the smugglers,\" Passacantando said. \"The law under which we are being charged is so archaic that we can only conclude that the Justice Department dredged it up to shut us down.\"\n\nIt is illegal to import mahogany into the United States that has been illegally exported under U.S. law and the international treaty known as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna.\n\nBrazil has had a moratorium on exporting mahogany since October 2001, but the demand in the U.S. market has prompted a flood of illegal exports.\n\nIn 2000, the United States received more than 70 percent of Brazil's mahogany exports and the administration has not had much success stemming the tide.\n\nGreenpeace says this is because the Bush administration has little desire to enforce the law - the organization has evidence the ship its activists boarded in April 2002 offloaded 70 tons of mahogany in South Carolina.\n\nThere is little doubt that Greenpeace has been a thorn in the side of the Bush administration - activists with the organization unfurled a banner at Bush's Texas ranch several months before he took office that read \"Bush the Toxic Texan, Don't Mess With Earth.\"\n\nThis past summer a Greenpeace vessel traveled up and down the Alaska coastline protesting the Bush forest policies and last month activists were arrested in Washington DC for protests against the administration's plans to relax a rule protecting roadless areas of national forests and allow logging in the Tongass National Forest.\n\n--------\nIraqi Protesters Oust Appointed Governor\nDemonstrators Defy U.S. Occupation With Demand for an Election\n\nAfter three days and nights of continuous protests, Witwit did just that. But the demonstrators have refused to budge.\n\nAs soon as Witwit resigned, the local representative of the U.S. occupation authority appointed a former Iraqi air force officer as acting governor. To the protesters, that was unacceptable. The new governor, they insisted, should be chosen not by an American but by Iraqis -- through an election.\n\n\"Yes, yes for elections!\" shouted the protesters, a collection of students, clerics and middle-aged professionals whose ranks swelled to more than 1,000 on Thursday. \"No, no to appointment!\"\n\nThe protesters have pledged to continue their sit-in outside the governor's office -- they have erected tents and dug latrines -- until their demand is met. Leaders of Hilla's largest labor unions have vowed to hold a general strike starting Saturday in support of elections.\n\nLocal leaders described the passionate but peaceful demonstration in this predominantly Shiite Muslim city as a preview of what U.S. occupiers will face if they follow through with a plan to select a provisional Iraqi government through regional caucuses instead of general elections. Although elections have become an increasingly popular rallying cry in Shiite-dominated central and southern Iraq, the protest here is the first indication that mainstream Shiites are willing to take to the streets to press the issue, adding a volatile new element to the country's impending political transition.\n\n\"It's been peaceful in Hilla until now, but if the coalition forces keep refusing what the people want, it will become a big problem that they will not be able to control,\" said Mohammed Kiflawi Abboud, chairman of the council that governs Hilla province. \"Everyone will oppose the Americans.\"\n\nProtest leaders said they have been energized by recent statements from Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, Iraq's most influential Shiite leader, calling for the provisional government to be elected. Sistani has rejected the Bush administration's plan to select a national assembly through caucuses in each of the country's 18 provinces, saying it does not give Iraqis enough of a role in the transition.\n\nWhile Sistani does not appear to have weighed in on the subject of Witwit's replacement, his pronouncements on the overall political transition have been interpreted in Hilla as a license to engage in civil disobedience.\n\n\"Ayatollah Sistani has called for elections,\" said Hussein Abdelrazzak Mehdi, a high school teacher and seminary student who was one of the protest organizers. \"We want to ensure his words are followed.\"\n\nSince Sistani voiced his opposition to the American transition plan, members of Iraq's U.S.-appointed Governing Council have been considering ways to amend the caucus system.\n\nOver the past two weeks, other Shiite leaders and even several influential Sunni Muslims -- a rival minority that had long ruled Iraq -- have urged the Governing Council to call for elections. But the council has been reluctant to do so, largely because of pressure from the Bush administration and because members believe caucuses are the best way to protect their own political interests. Some members even want the council, which U.S. officials are seeking to dissolve on June 30, to remain as a second legislative body in the provisional government.\n\nHoping to find a middle ground that will protect the interests of the council and the Bush administration while still appeasing Shiites, several members are advocating another round of caucuses to reconstitute some local and provincial councils. \"We recognize there are problems with some of the local councils, and we think some limited elections can address this issue,\" one council member said.\n\nBut if Hilla, a city of about 500,000 people about 60 miles south of Baghdad, is any indication, that approach will not fly. People here, from professors to roadside vendors, say elections are the only legitimate way to choose their governor and a provisional government.\n\n\"President George Bush promised us democracy\" said Kadhim Abbas, the owner of a carpet factory, who brought three dozen employees -- women in head-to-toe black veils -- to the protest. \"How can you have democracy without elections?\"\n\nAlthough they would have significant influence over the process, many members of Hilla's provincial council also said they objected to the caucuses, raising doubts about whether the Americans will be able to find willing local partners to back their transition plan.\n\nIbrahim said the council favors holding elections to select a new governor and to pick representatives for the transitional assembly. \"I can't understand why the Americans don't want elections,\" he said. \"We deserve to have them.\"\n\nThe Bush administration has resisted elections, contending that the absence of voter rolls and an electoral law would make a nationwide ballot time-consuming. Officials also argue that a hasty election would be vulnerable to violence and manipulation by religious militants and loyalists of former president Saddam Hussein.\n\nIbrahim and other members of the Hilla council insist a national database that is used to distribute monthly food rations could serve as a voter roll, enabling occupation authorities to hold a quick ballot. \"It would be very easy to hold elections,\" said Hamid Ibrahim Awadi, a lawyer and council member. \"We could do it right away.\"\n\nThe 22-member provincial council, comprising representatives from professional associations and community organizations, is only an advisory body. Power over the police and other government institutions rests with the governor, who rules at the behest of the occupation authority.\n\nA day before Witwit resigned, a commission purging Baath Party members from government ordered his dismissal. Council members said they discovered documents linking him to Hussein's intelligence service. He also had been criticized for appointing two of his brothers and several other relatives to top posts in the provincial government.\n\nHis replacement, Emad Lefteh, insisted there would be no way to hold elections right away. Sitting behind the governor's desk with aides at his side, he said the occupation authority \"should not bend to a few people protesting outside.\"\n\n\"If we have elections now, our enemies, the terrorists and the extremists, will take advantage of the situation,\" he said.\n\nAn official with the occupation authority in Hilla said Lefteh had proven himself to be an effective administrator in his previous job as mayor of Hilla. \"That's what this province needs,\" the official said.\n\nThe official ruled out holding elections. \"I'm not going to compromise on security, and we do not respond to mobs,\" the official said.\n\nAs the afternoon wore on, the protesters prayed, ate lunch out of large metal vats and brought in an interpreter. Using a megaphone, he addressed a dozen American and Polish soldiers standing guard on the roof of the governor's office.\n\n\"Coalition forces, don't be worried,\" he said in English. \"We are here in peace. All we want is democracy.\"\n\n\"That's what they promised us,\" Jabbar Zaid, a university student, said after the interpreter finished. \"All we want is what they promised.\""

      "text": "Today's wireless-sensor networks can do everything from supervising factory machinery to tracking environmental pollution to measuring the movement of buildings and bridges. Working together, distributed sensors can monitor activity along an oil pipeline or throughout a forest, keeping track of multiple variables at a time.\n\nWhile uses for wireless sensors are seemingly endless, there is one limiting factor to the technology — power. Even though improvements have brought their energy consumption down, wireless sensors' batteries still need changing periodically. Especially for networks in remote locales, replacing batteries in thousands of sensors is a staggering task.\n\nTo get around the power constraint, researchers are harnessing electricity from low-power sources in the environment, such as vibrations from swaying bridges, humming machinery and rumbling foot traffic. Such natural energy sources could do away with the need for batteries, powering wireless sensors indefinitely.\n\nNow researchers at MIT have designed a device the size of a U.S. quarter that harvests energy from low-frequency vibrations, such as those that might be felt along a pipeline or bridge. The tiny energy harvester — known technically as a microelectromechanical system, or MEMS — picks up a wider range of vibrations than current designs, and is able to generate 100 times the power of devices of similar size. The team published its results in the Aug. 23 online edition of Applied Physics Letters.\n\n\"There are wireless sensors widely available, but there is no supportive power package,\" says Sang-Gook Kim, a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT and co-author of the paper. \"I think our vibrational-energy harvesters are a solution for that.\"\n\nPutting the squeeze on\n\nTo harvest electricity from environmental vibrations, researchers have typically looked to piezoelectric materials such as quartz and other crystals. Such materials naturally accumulate electric charge in response to mechanical stress (piezo, in Greek, means to squeeze or press). In the past few years, researchers have exploited piezoelectric material, or PZT, at the microscale, engineering MEMS devices that generate small amounts of power.\n\nVarious groups have gravitated toward a common energy-harvesting design: a small microchip with layers of PZT glued to the top of a tiny cantilever beam. As the chip is exposed to vibrations, the beam moves up and down like a wobbly diving board, bending and stressing the PZT layers. The stressed material builds up an electric charge, which can be picked up by arrays of tiny electrodes.\n\nHowever, the cantilever-based approach comes with a significant limitation. The beam itself has a resonant frequency — a specific frequency at which it wobbles the most. Outside of this frequency, the beam's wobbling response drops off, along with the amount of power that can be generated.\n\n\"In the lab, you can move and shake the devices at the frequencies you want, and it works,\" says co-author Arman Hajati, who conducted the work as a PhD student at MIT. \"But in reality, the source of vibration is not constant, and you get very little power if the frequency is not what you were expecting.\"\n\nTo address the problem, some researchers have taken a \"power in numbers\" approach, simply increasing the number of cantilever beams and PZT layers occupying a chip. However, Kim and Hajati say this tactic can be wasteful, and expensive.\n\n\"In order to deploy millions of sensors, if the energy harvesting device is $10, it may be too costly,\" says Kim, who is a member of MIT's Microsystems Technology Laboratories. \"But if it is a single-layer MEMS device, then we can fabricate [the device for] less than $1.\"\n\nBridging the power divide\n\nKim and Hajati came up with a design that increases the device's frequency range, or bandwidth, while maximizing the power density, or energy generated per square centimeter of the chip. Instead of taking a cantilever-based approach, the team went a slightly different route, engineering a microchip with a small bridge-like structure that's anchored to the chip at both ends. The researchers deposited a single layer of PZT to the bridge, placing a small weight in the middle of it.\n\nThe team then put the device through a series of vibration tests, and found it was able to respond not just at one specific frequency, but also at a wide range of other low frequencies. The researchers calculated that the device was able to generate 45 microwatts of power with just a single layer of PZT — an improvement of two orders of magnitude compared to current designs.\n\n\"If the ambient vibration is always at a single frequency and does not vary, [current designs] work fine,\" says Daniel Inman, professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Michigan. \"But as soon as the frequency varies or shifts a little, the power decreases drastically. This design allows the bandwidth to be larger, meaning the problem is, in principle, solved.\" Inman adds that going forward, the MIT group will have to aim lower in the frequencies they pick up, since few vibrations in nature occur at the relatively high frequency ranges captured by the device.\n\nHajati says the team plans to do just that, optimizing the design to respond to lower frequencies and generate more power.\n\n\"Our target is at least 100 microwatts, and that's what all the electronics guys are asking us to get to,\" says Hajati, now a MEMS development engineer at FujiFilm Dimatix in Santa Clara, Calif. \"For monitoring a pipeline, if you generate 100 microwatts, you can power a network of smart sensors that can talk forever with each other, using this system.\"\n\nSource: Massachusetts Institute of Technology – 14.09Development holds promise for photodetectors and energy harvesting applications like solar cells\n\nBy applying a coating to individual silicon nanowires, researchers at Harvard and Berkeley have significantly improved the materials' efficiency and sensitivity.\nThe findings, published in the May 20, 2011, issue of Nano Letters, suggest that the coated wires hold promise for photodetectors and energy harvesting technologies like solar cells.\nDue to a large surface-to-volume ratio, nanowires typically suffer from a high surface recombination rate, meaning that photogenerated charges recombine... more\n\nNano-scale lattice developed at Boston College a promising platform for clean energy applicationsAssistant Professor of Chemistry Dunwei Wang and his clean energy lab pioneered the development of Nanonets in 2008 and have since shown them to be... more\n\nDr. Ville Kaajakari, assistant professor of electrical engineering at Louisiana Tech University, is being featured by MEMS Investor Journal, a national online industry publication, for developing a technology that harvests power from a small generator embedded in the sole of a shoe.\n\nMEMS are tiny \"smart\" devices that combine computer chips with micro-components such as sensors, gears, flow-channels, mirrors and actuators.\"This technology could benefit, for example, hikers that need emergency... more"

      "text": "Monday, June 21, 2010\n\nEd Moses makes the case, based on breakthroughs at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory:\n\nThe question, Moses said, is \"Can we build a miniature Sun on Earth?\" The recipe involves a peppercorn-size target of hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium heated to 200 million degrees Fahrenheit for a couple billionths of a second. To get that micro-blast of heat, the National Ignition Facility (NIF) uses lasers---coherent light---at a massive scale. Laser engineer Moses notes that photons are perfect for the job: \"no mass, no charge, just energy.\"\n\nMoses ran a dramatic video showing how a shot at the NIF works. 20-foot-long slugs of amplified coherent light (10 nanoseconds) travel 1,500 yards and converge simultaneously through 192 beams on the tiny target, compressing and heating it to fusion ignition, with a yield of energy 10 to 100 times of what goes into it. Successful early test shots suggest that the NIF will achieve the first ignition within the next few months, and that shot will be heard round the world.\n\nTAE asks the question no one else does: where does Ed expect to get all that tritium? Ed claims that \"1 liter of heavy water will yield the energy of 2 million gallons of gas.\"\n\nBut TAE knows from his own research into betavoltaics that suggesting that there is 1/2 liter of tritium (I'm assuming his tritium-deuterium mix is 50/50 for simplicity) on Earth borders on the absurd. Also, 2 million gallons of gas really isn't all that much. America uses 3 million gallons of gas a day, depending on who you ask.\n\nEd makes this hilariously absurd claim: \" there is no such thing as peak hydrogen.\" So suddenly we're talking about hydrogen fusion...not deuterium and tritium? This is such a misleading comment. The problem is that no one has had any luck fusing pure hydrogen - which is why the LLNL team is using deuterium and tritium in their experiments. In fact, its pretty safe for me to say \"the only being capable of sustained hydrogen fusion is God.\"\n\nNevertheless, Ed seems to think that in ten years we'll have nuclear fusion power plants chugging along at a fair clip, ushering in a new, clean era.\n\nAnd yet, I have to keep asking: \"Ed, where are you going to get all that tritium? Only 500 pounds of it have been made since 1955!\" There is such a thing as peak tritium.\n\nTAE reminds his audience that he is a huge proponent of fusion power. But the LLNL technique isn't the solution, rather it is a great method for data acquisition. A sustained nuclear fusion plant will need to either break the barrier and fuse hydrogen (protium), or we need to start mining helium-3 from the Moon, where it is fairly plentiful."

Indeed, the technology has the potential to provide an energy storage device ten times more powerful than even the latest batteries in hybrid cars -- while outliving the vehicle itself.\n\nThe new technology, developed at MIT's Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems, should improve ultracapacitors, by swapping in carbon nanotubes, thereby greatly increasing the surface area of electrodes and the ability to store energy.\n\nUltracapacitors, a souped-up version of the capacitors widely used in electronics, have been around for decades. They're well-known for being powerful, that is, able to quickly absorb and release electricity. But they can't store much energy, so their stored electricity is depleted in a matter of seconds. As a result, they've been limited to niche applications, such as providing quick bursts of power in some hybrid transit buses.\n\nNow researchers at MIT have found what they believe is a way to improve the endurance of ultracapacitors several-fold -- allowing the devices to retain the power and longevity advantages, while storing about as much energy as the batteries used in hybrids. The amount of energy ultracapacitors can hold is related to the surface area and conductivity of their electrodes. The researchers have increased surface area by \"more than an order of magnitude\" by using carbon nanotubes."

Rome, a University of Pennsylvania biology professor who spends his summers conducting research at the MBL, and three colleagues describe the mechanics of, and physics behind, the Suspended-load Backpack, a piece of gear that will one day enable field scientists, hikers, explorers, soldiers, and disaster workers to convert mechanical energy generated by walking with a heavy load on their backs into electricity.\n\nBy carrying a load weighing from 44 to 84 pounds (20 to 38 kg), Suspended-load Backpack testers were able to generate up to 7.4 Watts--more than enough electricity to simultaneously power an MP3 player, a PDA, night vision goggles (or 3 LED headlamp), a handheld GPS, a CMOS image decoder, a GSM terminal in talk mode, and Bluetooth. The electricity can be used while it is being generated, or it can be stored in a lightweight rechargeable battery for later use, greatly reducing the need to haul and use heavy replacement batteries.\n\n\"The need for electronic devices in remote areas is an increasing reality these days,\" says Rome. \"Throughout history, humans have solved many problems by inventing passive devices to enhance the movements made by their muscles, such as springy bamboo poles to carry loads and skis to move through snow,\" he says. \"The Suspended-load Backpack represents another passive device that may help solve a growing problem in the 21st century.\"\n\nThe backpack, which is currently in its working prototype stage, is based on the external frame design once popular with overnight backpackers. It works by capitalizing on the up-and-down motion of the body during walking.\n\nWhen walking, the body is like an inverted pendulum. After the foot is put down to take a step, the body vaults over it, causing the hip to move up and down about 1.6 to 2.7 inches (4 to 7 cm). The Suspended-load Backpack frame sits still on the wearer's back, and the load is mounted on a load plate that is suspended from the frame by springs. The springs allow the load to slide up and down on bushings constrained to vertical rods, thus allowing the load to move with the same vertical motion as the hip, but lagging it by a fraction of a second, producing differential movement between the frame and load. The pogo-stick-like movement of the load generates mechanical energy that drives a rack-and-pinion device that powers a geared DC motor that acts as a generator mounted on the frame. The load plate can be locked to stop the device from sliding up and down and generating electricity.\n\nTo assure that the backpack wouldn't require users to expend too much additional metabolic energy, the scientists performed a variety of tests on six male subjects, who used the backpack while walking on a treadmill.\n\nThe backpack was instrumented with force transducers and length transducers, which measured the amount of mechanical energy going into the backpack's generator. The scientists also measured the test subjects' oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production rates to gauge the metabolic cost of generating electricity with the backpack.\n\nThe scientists discovered that the Suspended-load Backpack altered the gait of the test wearers, causing them to walk more efficiently. Because of this, the testers used less metabolic energy to generate electricity than anticipated. The tests also showed that the backpack wearers could generate more electricity by either walking faster or carrying a heavier load or both.\n\nWhile Rome and his colleagues haven't yet determined the biomechanical causes of the backpack's better-than-expected efficiency, they say it confirms that the backpack is practical and that the technology can be applied to making a standard backpack that is more ergonomic.\n\n\"It seems that most everyone in the world uses a backpack to carry things, and the possibility of doing it more ergonomically and also providing electricity in remote areas may have widespread benefits, some of which we can't even anticipate today,\" says Rome.\n\nA Pennsylvania-based company called Lightning Packs LLC has been formed to further develop and refine the Suspended-load Backpack and to develop an ergonomic backpack based on the working prototype and initial findings. Lightning Packs has applied for patent protection on both inventions.\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Anyone who has watched videos of the Apollo astronauts moving across the surface of the moon has noticed the unusual loping gait they sometimes adopted and their slow, almost graceful, movements. Now a new ...\n\nAll that rubbing of your backpack straps on your shoulders may be put to good use, now that researchers have designed a novel type of energy harvesting backpack.

The acetate, which adsorbs on TiO2 , undergoes dehydrogenation (oxidation) and the deoxygenation to form ketenylidene on the gold. Credit: J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2012, 134 (33), pp 13569–13572. DOI: 10.1021/ja305911e\n\nResearchers from the University of Virginia used computer simulations and laboratory experiments to discover a reaction site on gold-titanium oxides that is responsible for high rates of catalysis relevant to biofuel and fuel cell reactions. The findings help scientists understand the principle of the catalysis and choose the right catalysts for certain reactions.\n\nIn a well-known fairy tale, Rumpelstiltskin used magic to weave straw into gold. Today, scientists are reversing that formula—using gold to turn straw (and other forms of biomass) into today's global currency: energy.\n\nThe magic involves a special nanocatalyst, in which minute particles of gold dot the surface of titanium-oxide. The forces that emerge from the combination of these two materials are strong enough to breaks the O-O bond of oxygen molecules and the C-O bond of acetic acid, a byproduct of biomass conversion that, when combined with hydrogen, forms ethanol, an important precursor for fuel.\n\nBecause of its ability to split strongly bonded molecules, the gold titanium-oxide nanocatalyst is becoming a leading candidate for industrial applications that use biomass or fuel cells to create clean energy.\n\n\"Metal nanoparticles supported on oxide surface are very popular because they have high activity towards a variety of reactions, especially oxidation reactions,\" said Wenjie Tang, a research associate in the department of chemical engineering at the University of Virginia and a member of the Neurock group there. \"People know they're active, but how they work and the real mechanism of their active sites was not quite understood.\"\n\nCombining computer simulations and laboratory experiments, Tang and others from the University of Virginia discovered a reaction site on the perimeter of the gold-titanium complex that does much of the work of catalysis.\n\n\"Previously, researchers thought it might be only the gold that was active in the reaction; they didn't think the oxide surface had any influence,\" Tang said. \"But recently we realized that the oxides play an important role in modifying the metals above them. They create this a special site at the perimeter which is really the important site for the reaction.\"\n\nThe researchers initial findings were reported in the August 2011 edition of Science. Further results of the study were published in the June 2012 edition of JACS. In August 2012, the scientists reported in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS) the first catalytic oxidation of acetic acid to ketenylidene (CCO) over a gold titanium-oxide catalyst. (Oxidation is the loss of electrons by a molecule—an important process for catalysis.) The researchers think the discovery of this intermediate product, ketenylidene, will lead to the creation of valuable hydrocarbon fuels via reactions such as Fischer-Tropsch process. Further results of these studies are forthcoming.\n\nMany analysts believe energy from oil will only grow more expensive over time. Biomass conversion has the potential to power a significant portion of the world's energy needs, however, scientists must find new ways to produce biofuels less expensively. Better catalysts are one important way to do so.\n\nCatalysts speed up chemical reactions by altering the activation energy required for a reaction to proceed. Without a catalyst, two solvents may meet without a reaction. In the presence of a catalyst, those same molecules will be utterly transformed.\n\nCatalytic reactions happen fast and the intermediate structures that form are not always apparent in the process. Computer simulations allow scientists to slow down the reactions in order to uncover and visualize the forces acting on molecules at the atomic level. The researchers used the Ranger supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center to explore aspects of the material reaction at the nanoscale that could not be investigated in the laboratory.\n\n\"Experiments can show many things, but they cannot reveal how the reactions take place,\" Tang said. \"For example, we know there should be ketenylidene formation, but we were not sure whether it was on the gold or on the titanium. We also didn't know which site is the most active for turning acetic acid into ketenylidene.\"\n\nUsing density functional theory, a quantum mechanical modeling method used in physics and chemistry to investigate the electronic structure of molecules, the researchers calculated the interactions of more than 200 atoms using Ranger. The simulations helped the group identify the presence of an intermediate chemical in the reaction and determined that it was in fact ketenylidene.\n\nThe acetic acid-to-ketenylidene path combines dehydrogenation (oxidation) and the deoxygenation of the acetate, \"which are crucial steps for biomass conversion into more valuable industrial chemicals,\" the authors wrote.\n\nFor Tang, the results proved the increasing usefulness of computer simulations to support physical experiment and to suggest new, more specific chemical reaction paths.\n\n\"I wouldn't have imagined calculating such a system five or 10 years ago,\" Tang said. \"We didn't have the computing resources.\"\n\nAccording to Jose Rodriguez from Brookhaven National Laboratory, the use of computational simulations in studies of surface catalysis is leading to new levels of understanding.\n\n\"[These are] excellent theoretical studies that help to understand the details for the mechanism of CO oxidation on Au/TiO2 surfaces,\" he said.\n\nBy generating gases from grasses and improving the capacity of fuel cells to separate hydrogen and oxygen, new catalysts are expected to alter fundamental energy-generating processes, promising cheaper and more sustainable fuels.\n\n\"Right now we're just trying to understand the principle of the catalysis,\" Tang said. \"Hopefully, this will help other people when they try to choose a catalyst for certain reactions.\" University of Utah chemists demonstrated the first conclusive link between the size of catalyst particles on a solid surface, their electronic properties and their ability to speed chemical ...\n\nUniversity of Virginia chemical engineers Robert J.

Two of the scientists are from DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Arthur J. Nozik and Maria Ghirardi.\n\nTitled \"Comparing Photosynthetic and Photovoltaic Efficiencies and Recognizing the Potential for Improvement,\" the article combines lessons learned from evolutionary photobiology and modern solar cells to make the case for a potentially huge boost in the efficiency of the solar production of biofuels.\n\nThe multi-junction tandem solar cell initially developed at NREL proved to be an important strategy to understand how to boost the efficiency of corn, grasses, algae, and other plants that use photosynthesis to produce stored solar energy.\n\nScientist Mark Hanna recently demonstrated how a multi-junction, tandem solar cell for water splitting to produce hydrogen can provide higher efficiency – more than 40 %-- by using multiple semiconductors and/or special photoactive organic molecules with different band gaps arranged in a tandem structure.\n\nThe coupling of different materials with different energy gaps means photons can be absorbed and converted to energy over a wider range of the solar spectrum.\n\n\"In photovoltaics, we know that to increase power conversion efficiency you have to have different band gaps (i.e., colours) in a tandem arrangement so they can more efficiently use different regions of the solar spectrum,\" Nozik said. \"If you had the same gap, they would compete with each other and both would absorb the same photon energies and not enhance the solar conversion efficiency.\"\n\nPhotosynthesis does use two gaps based on chlorophyll molecules to provide enough energy to drive the photosynthesis reaction. But the two gaps have the same energy value, which means they don't help each other to produce energy over a wider stretch of the spectrum of solar light and enhance conversion efficiency.\n\nSolar panel in a field\n\nThe annually averaged efficiency of photovoltaic electrolysis based on silicon semiconductors to produce fuel in the form of hydrogen is about 10 %, while a plant's annually averaged efficiency using photosynthesis to form biomass for fuel is about 1 or 2 %.\n\nPlants, following the path of evolution, are primarily interested in reproducing and repairing themselves. The efficiency at which they produce stored solar energy in biomass is secondary.\n\nStill, things can change.\n\nJust as early Native Americans manipulated skinny, non-nutritious Teosinte into fat, juicy kernel corn, today's plants can be manipulated to become much better sources of energy.\n\nFurthermore, most plants do use the full intensity of sunlight but divert some of it to protect the plant from damage. Whereas photovoltaics use the second material to gain that photoconversion edge, plants do not, Nozik noted.\n\nFlower shaped solar panel\n\nOne of NREL's roles at the DOE workshop was to help make it clear how the efficiency of photosynthesis could be improved by re- engineering the structure of plants through modern synthetic biology and genetic manipulation based on the principles of high efficiency photovoltaic cells, Nozik said.

      "text": "Sunday, July 22, 2012\n\nTo crack hydrogen molecules and free the electrons, scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory built nature-inspired molecules that get the job done. These designer molecules, or catalysts, rely on an iron center and small, dangling molecular chains with strategically placed nitrogen atoms. Known as pendant amines, these chains draw in the hydrogen molecule and position it just so. The iron center breaks apart the hydrogen into protons and electrons. The pendant amines shuttle the protons off, and the process starts all over again.\n\n\"We're not trying to precisely mimic nature, just incorporate the salient features that make natural catalysts function,\" said Dr. Morris Bullock, Director of the Center for Molecular Electrocatalysis, led by PNNL. The results were published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.\n\nWhy It Matters: Using fossil fuels to power cars and heat homes continues to raise economic, environmental, and security issues. A popular alternative is the fuel cell, which converts hydrogen, methanol, or other chemicals into water, and in the process it turns out electricity. But the catalyst of choice for the fuel cells is platinum, which is expensive and scarce. In contrast, iron is far less expensive and is the Earth's most abundant metal. Credit: PNNL\n\nScientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory built a nature-inspired catalyst with an iron center and small, dangling molecular chains with strategically placed nitrogen atoms to crack hydrogen molecules and free the electrons needed for fuel cells.\n\nMethods: The PNNL team based their design on natural hydrogenase enzymes, fast and energy-efficient molecular catalysts that can split the hydrogen molecules and put the electrons and protons back together to create hydrogen. Their active sites contain the inexpensive and abundant metals iron and/or nickel, which makes them attractive to scientists who want to develop a cheaper, easily available catalyst mimicking the structure and function of hydrogenases.\n\nDr. Tianbiao (Leo) Liu, a postdoctoral fellow at PNNL, led the catalyst design. He and his colleagues synthesized and characterized a series of iron complexes using NMR spectroscopy, electrochemical studies, and x-ray diffraction. In these complexes, the pendant amines are a critical feature. They facilitate the coupling of proton and electron transfer reactions and proton transfer between acids and bases in solution and the active iron center.\n\nLiu incorporated an amine (nitrogen-containing) pendant into a larger phosphorus-containing, six-sided ring, called a phosphine ligand, at just the right place to where it \"hangs around\" the ligand in a configuration that is structurally close enough to interact with the hydrogen.\n\n\"Previous research has established that pendant amines can play an important role in relaying protons between metal and solution, in coupling proton and electron transfers, and in activating dihydrogen,\" said Liu. \"We confirmed that both the iron center and pendant amines are crucial to hydrogen bonding and cleavage.\"\n\nAs a control experiment, the scientists also made a closely related compound without pendant amines, which didn't react nearly as fast. It confirmed that the pendant amine is required to make the cleaving happen.\n\nThey showed that the compound will break the H-H bond into two ions, with the proton (H+) landing on the nitrogen, and the hydride (H-) being transferred to the iron. Unambiguous proof came from using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. They took the iron catalyst with a one-to-one mixture of hydrogen and deuterium. Deuterium is just a tiny bit different from hydrogen; this difference makes it easy to track in the spectrometer. Both H-H and D-D bonds broke, making HD, proving that the bond had cleaved.\n\nWhat's Next: The scientists have done the hardest part by creating the first iron complexes that will cleave H2 in just the right way. That will provide most of the steps needed-but not quite.\n\n\"Catalytic oxidation of H2 releases electrons. But in the process, a bunch of protons are also made. So we added a base to take up the protons,\" said Bullock. \"The base binds to the metal of our iron catalysts, so they are not an electrocatalyst for complete oxidation of H2. That was a bit of a surprise to us, but a valuable one.\" He added, \"We have to make sure we understand the energies of all these compounds so we can match the ability of a pendant amine to accept protons with the ability of iron to accept hydride"

      "text": "Japanese firm Shimizu has a startling new concept: mini floating, carbon-neutral cities that drift across the Pacific on giant water lilies. The Green Float concept includes a number of cells that could house between 10,000 to 50,000 people.\n\nThe cells, each about 1 kilometer wide, could float freely or attach onto other cells to form larger towns, cities or even countries. At the center of each cell, a 1 kilometer high \"City in the Sky\" skyscraper would house the majority of residents, made from light alloys from the metal deriving from magnesium in sea water.\n\nGrasslands and forests would be plentiful around each pod, essentially becoming self-sufficient in terms of food with farming and livestock throughout the 'plains.'\n\nThe creative concept Shimizu has dreamed up would potentially cut carbon emissions by 40 percent, scientists claim. Each cell would convert waste back into energy using the latest green technologies, and even collect islands of floating waste to harvest more energy.\n\nOf course, the cities would have to float in waters guarded from extreme weather and tidal waves—ideally near the equator. Strong elastic membranes standing 30 feet above sea level would surround the cells to protect inhabitants from large waves. Sea walls as high as 100 feet could also be constructed, creating cities that are arguably more equipped to handle tsunamis than most coastal areas.\n\nToo outlandish? Not according to Shimizu scientists, who are actually proposing to develop the first cells by as soon as 2025. They're not only working on the technologies to make it happen, but even thinking up new ways to collect solar energy on earth by encircling the moon with a belt of solar collectors."

Potentially cheaper to make than conventional solar cells, Gratzel cells can be printed quickly. The cell's full potential hasn't yet been realized because in order to achieve efficiency levels high enough to compete with conventional solar cells, it is necessary to use volatile electrolytes which need to be carefully sealed inside the cells, an expensive and unreliable step in the manufacturing process.\n\n†\n\nHowever, in a recent development, Gratzel and Wang have made efficient solar cells that use nonvolatile electrolytes, achieving an efficiency level equivalent to conventional solar cells. Additionally, the solar cells remained stable when exposed to light and high temperatures for 1,000 hours, \"pushing the technology close to over the '10 percent hump,' which is where a thin-film technology needs to be to be economically competitive,\" says Tonio Buonassisi, a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT.\n\n†\n\nOne of the electrolytes used in the new solar cells is called ionic fluid - a fluid largely made up of ions and often composed of salts that have low melting temperatures. An ionic fluid can be used with plastic electrodes, which would allow for solar cells that are both efficient and flexible, and therefore could be incorporated into clothing, awnings, and covers for cars. The ionic fluid was mixed with a new dye which absorbs light far better than the conventional dye. Because the dye absorbs light so well, the thickness of the active material in the solar cell can be cut in half, which makes it easier for electrons to escape the solar cell and reach an external circuit, in turn increasing efficiency.\n\n†\n\nWhen the researchers tried pairing the new dye with a nonvolatile solvent-based electrolyte they reached slightly higher efficiencies. The downside is that the electrolyte is not quite as stable as an ionic liquid, and it can't be used with plastic.\n\n†\n\nThe dye-sensitized solar cells can be used for applications such as recharging cell phones, especially in countries with unreliable electricity, as well as doubling as the facade on buildings. The recent advances could make the cells more efficient and cheaper to manufacture."

Look for fusion reactors to finally be perfected by the end of the decade. RColinJohnson @NextGenLog\n\nHere is what Purdue says about it fusion research: Researchers have discovered mechanisms critical to interactions between hot plasma and surfaces facing the plasma inside a thermonuclear fusion reactor, part of work aimed at developing coatings capable of withstanding the grueling conditions inside the reactors. Fusion powers the stars and could lead to a limitless supply of clean energy. A fusion power plant would produce 10 times more energy than a conventional nuclear fission reactor, and because the deuterium fuel is contained in seawater, a fusion reactor's fuel supply would be virtually inexhaustible. Research at Purdue University focuses on the \"plasma-material interface,\" a crucial region where the inner lining of a fusion reactor comes into contact with the extreme heat of the plasma. Nuclear and materials engineers are harnessing nanotechnology to define tiny features in the coating in work aimed at creating new \"plasma-facing\" materials tolerant to radiation damage, said Jean Paul Allain, an assistant professor of nuclear engineering"

      "text": "What's a fuel cell? The folks from \"How Stuff Works\" do a good job laying things out in the video below, but in a nutshell, a fuel cell is a device designed to produce electricity through a chemical reaction arising from the combination of a fuel (hydrogen, for instance) with oxygen.\n\nEnthusiasts have long envisioned them in a wide array of mass-market applications, from generating energy at power plants to moving cars and powering homes.\n\nBut the first ones to hit the consumer market are not designed to power the car or the house. At one to four watts, they are more suitable as phone chargers — or as power sources for a high-efficiency flashlight.\n\nThe cell, built by Medis Technologies, is — at least in concept — similar to a glow-stick or a hand-warmer. The user squeezes the cell to mix two chemicals together, and the unit runs until the chemicals are exhausted — about 40 hours.\n\nIt comes with an assortment of connector tips, including those for USB ports, BlackBerrys and cellphones of various other models, MP3 players and similar devices.\n\n\"There are about 14 appliances that this will provide energy to,\" said Jose Mejia, the chief executive. The cell runs on sodium borohydride, which does not generate heat when it runs, and is not flammable or toxic. (The fuel cell that the car makers are working on runs on hydrogen, which is stored under pressure and can burn; another candidate, for portable fuel cells, is methanol, but that is flammable and toxic.)\n\nThe company hopes to soon manufacture a version big enough to run a laptop computer, and later one that could run a whole house.\n\nMr. Mejia, a veteran of the computer and telecommunications industries, apologized that the first model is not refillable, meaning its plastic is likely to end up in landfills. But the company is establishing a system to take back the units — about the size of a disposable camera — for recycling, Mr. Mejia said.\n\nIn 12 to 18 months, Medis plans to market a version of the fuel cell that will accept a replaceable fuel cartridge.\n\nThe company expects to announce a deal soon with a major retailer, Mr. Mejia said, so the cell will be sold as an electronics accessory. For the moment, however, Medis markets the fuel cell as an item for an emergency kit, providing enough juice to keep operating a cellphone or an LED flashlight for far longer than a blackout is likely to last.\n\nAnd the price? A bit high for everyday use — though that's likely to come down as the technology develops. A version of the Medis fuel cell that comes with a flashlight is $50; a smaller version with cables and a variety of tips is $35. A replacement cell, minus the cable and tips, is $25.\n\n14 Comments\n\nWhy is a fuel cell replacement for a battery considered \"green\"? What CO2 emissions is it eliminating? Perhaps it does reduce the usage of batteries which contain some heavy metals, but my sense is that fuel cells are associated with \"green\", and not much more thought went into it.\n\nThis is a great news only if we can get the companies who make items such as these to accept spent cells and recycle them. What a terrible waste of a good idea this would be if this chemical trash ends up in our landfills and our groundwater.\n\nYawn. This device has been sold for the past few years. It is similar in size and weight to a pair of regular alkaline D- cell batteries, and contains about as much energy. It also costs 10x as much as those batteries.\n\nEr, no. Sodium borohydride is neither non-toxic nor particularly safe, and certainly not when compared to methanol. It causes contact burns on skin and won't do your innards any good either. It catches fire in air. Packaged properly, it can be used to generate hydrogen safely by adding water. That alone is the advantage over methanol, which can't be easily decomposed to give free hydrogen.\n\nit's green in that it produces energy without emitting wasteful CO2. With a traditional fuel cell the only by-product is water so you get the energy yield without the pollution – not sure what about the concept is so hard to grasp.\n\nAfter reading your article, and the FAQs and tech sheets on the Medis web site, I still can't figure out whether the 40 hours of use time is actual use time (time spent charging devices), or 40 hours from the time the chemicals are activated, i.e., less than two days. If it's the latter, then a lot of the power pack's energy is bound to be wasted, since a cell phone doesn't need to be charged continuously.\n\nI have trouble believing anyone is fooled by this obvious con-job. GREEN???? This is a disposable piece of junk with less functionality the MANY external battery battery chargers which are hugely superior, and rechargeable. The Medis junk is just use-once or twice (maybe) landfill.\n\nLook how stupid: the power pack is so weak it can't power anything by itself. It can't power the weakest phone when it's 100% dead without many hours of charging and it can't power a Blackberry at all. So Medis added a external battery (another piece of toxic landfill) so the powerpack can slowwwwwly trickle charge it, and then THAT can charge your phone, maybe, but not many times. It's not clear even with its external battery it can power a Blackberry fully.\n\nIn tests by an independent engineer, the Medis junk did not live up to its pathetic claim of 20 watt-hours, and in 2 cases out of 3, it leaked. A pack of AA batteries with tips is much cheaper, works much better, does not need air (as Medis does) has a much longer shelf life, and actually charges things — and is a lot more green (probably even if not rechargeable, since they don't have the added burden of the toxic Medis li-ion battery).\n\nMedis has a very long history (since its inception in 1992) of making wild claims for products but delivering nothing or worse. It's never produced revenue from products from day #1 and it has lied many times about having cancer treatment machines, motors for pillotless planes, deals with Microsoft, the largest fuel cell order in history etc. — all lies"

      "text": "Success Story: LED Breakthroughs for Energy Efficiency\n\nShuji Nakamura and his team continue to expand the world of applications for his GaN based, high-efficiency, blue and green LEDs\n\nTHE SITUATION\n\nLighting consumes 18 percent of the electricity generated in the United States and 35 percent of electricity in commercial buildings. Moreover, 20 percent of the average household energy bill covers power electronics and appliances, with a growing proportion consumed by high-tech devices.\n\nReplacing conventional incandescent light bulbs with high-efficiency light-emitting diodes (LEDs) could save $155 billion and eliminate the need for 133 power plants. LEDs also have the benefit of a 50,000 hour lifetime and don't contain mercury, a serious downside of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs).\n\nLaser diodes, a related technology that produces a beam of light, could revolutionize technologies ranging from data storage to home entertainment and the medical field.\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\n\nTapping this potential requires high-quality red, green, and blue LEDs, which must be combined to make pure white light. To make matters more complex, the wavelength of today's laser diodes limits storage capacity. In addition, since a red laser's wavelength is much longer than a blue laser's, using the latter would quadruple storage density in comparison to existing DVD technology.\n\nFor more than three decades, Shuji Nakamura, co-director of the Solid State Lighting and Energy Center at UC Santa Barbara and an Institute faculty member, has worked to overcome these challenges. His groundbreaking research is expected to play a key role in changing society's relationship to energy consumption.\n\nTHE OBSTACLES\n\nNakamura's early research focused on developing red and infrared LEDs at a small Japanese technology company. Working on a very limited budget, Nakamura was forced to be unusually creative, even making his own furnaces to grow crystals because commercial models were far too expensive. Although Nakamura was successful in developing several cutting-edge LEDs early in his career, larger companies selling the same product were able to dominate the market.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Nakamura went to his superiors and convinced them to fund new research on the elusive blue LED. Nakamura was determined not to be beaten to the punch this time. Because so many other companies and universities were researching zinc selenide to develop the blue LED, he chose the less popular gallium nitride to make the blue LED.\n\nAfter having difficulty growing his GaN epitaxial film by using the metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method, Nakamura decided to modify his reactor. He added a second gas blower that reduced thermal convection and significantly improved the crystal quality of his GaN epitaxial film.\n\nTHE BIG IDEAS\n\nNakamura achieved a first-ever in 1993 when he created a blue LED. Although a number of other research efforts have since succeeded in creating blue and green LEDs, they produce light with low intensity and efficiency. Nakamura's key breakthrough was his discovery that by changing the crystal orientation of the GaN crystal, he could produce brilliant, high- efficiency blue and green LEDs.\n\nThese advances have finally made the pure white LEDs possible, as well as the ability to mix any color desired. Nakamura's LEDs now reach 150 lumens of light per watt consumed, compared to about 63 lumens per watt (lm/w) for a CFL and 15 lm/w for a traditional incandescent bulb. Efficiencies of 255 lm/w are theoretically possible.\n\nAs Time Magazine said in their article on Nakamura in 2007, \"The world is a brighter place because Shuji Nakamura is not easily discouraged. In 1993 he astonished the scientific community with the first successful blue light-emitting diode, or LED. The blue LED was the last step in the creation of lighting's holy grail, the brilliant white LED--an ultra-efficient successor to Thomas Edison's incandescent lightbulb, circa 1879.\"\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nThese breakthroughs have cleared the way for a number of futuristic technologies. Imagine watching a movie with friends using only your smart phone and its built-in miniature projector made from laser diodes.\n\nNakamura's advances could also bring artificial light to the 1/3 of the world's population without access to it. LEDs connected to solar batteries would require no wiring or long-distance electricity transmission to provide enough light for a child in the developing world to study after nightfall.\n\nIn 2007, Nakamura and Institute colleagues (Steven DenBaars, and James Speck) launched Soraa, a company based in Goleta, CA, to market this remarkable LED technology."

The test plant, which currently only produces\nenough electricity to power a coffee maker, is a test run of the\ntechnology and will be used to develop larger, more efficient versions.\n\nOsmotic power can be established anywhere clean freshwater runs into the\nsea. Since it is not affected by weather fluctuations like wind or solar\nenergy, it is seen as a more reliable alternative energy source.\n\nThe prototype plant, built and operated by federally-owned utility\ncompany Statkraft, uses osmosis to draw freshwater across a membrane and\ntoward the seawater side, creating pressure that drives a turbine and\nproduces electricity.\n\nThe utility hopes to improve the efficiency of the membrane from its\ncurrent 1 watt per square meter now to about 5 watts, which should make\nosmotic power costs comparable to those from other renewable sources.\n\nStatkraft estimates that osmotic power in Norway will eventually be able\nto generate 10% of the country's power needs. The company plans to begin\nbuilding commercial osmotic power plants by 2015.\n\nScientists at the Carnegie Institution have found for the first time\nthat high pressure can be used to make a unique hydrogen-storage\nmaterial. The discovery paves the way for an entirely new way to\napproach the hydrogen-storage problem.\n\nThe researchers found that the normally unreactive, noble gas xenon\ncombines with molecular hydrogen (H2) under pressure to form a\npreviously unknown solid with unusual bonding chemistry. The experiments\nare the first time these elements have been combined to form a stable\ncompound. The discovery debuts a new family of materials, which could\nboost new hydrogen technologies.\n\nXenon has some intriguing properties, including its use as an\nanaesthesia, its ability to preserve biological tissues, and its\nemployment in lighting. Xenon is a noble gas, which means that it does\nnot typically react with other elements.\n\nThe researchers imaged the compound at varying pressures using X-ray\ndiffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopy. When they looked at the\nxenon part of the structure, they realised that the interaction of xenon\nwith the surrounding hydrogen was responsible for the unusual stability\nand the continuous change in xenon-xenon distances as pressure was\nadjusted from 41,000 to 255,000 atmospheres.\n\nResearchers at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics\nhave demonstrated a prototype device that can rid hands, feet, or even\nunderarms of bacteria, including the hospital superbug MRSA. The device\nworks by creating a plasma, which produces a cocktail of chemicals in\nair that kill bacteria but are harmless to skin.\n\nPlasmas are known as the fourth state of matter, after solid, liquid,\nand gas. They are a soup of atoms that have had their electrons stripped\noff by, for example, a high voltage. Plasmas are common elsewhere in the\ncosmos, where high-energy processes produce them, and they are even\nposited as a potential source of fusion energy.\n\nBut the new research focuses on so-called cold atmospheric plasmas.\nRather than turning a whole group of atoms into plasma, a more delicate\napproach strips the electrons off just a few, sending them flying.\nCollisions with nearby, unchanged atoms slows down the electrons and\ncharged atoms or ions they leave behind.\n\nIt has been known for some time that the resulting plasma is harmful to\nbacteria, viruses, and fungi. The researchers have worked out the\nprecise details of the plasma production that effectively kills off such\nbugs without doing harm to skin, and demonstrated a number of prototype\ndevices that do the job efficiently.\n\nScientists worldwide are striving to develop thin, flexible,\nlightweight, inexpensive, environmentally friendly batteries made\nentirely from nonmetal parts. Among the most promising materials for\nthese batteries are conducting polymers. However, until now these have\nimpractical for use in batteries - for instance, their ability to hold a\ncharge often degrades over use.\n\nThe key to a new battery, developed by scientists at Uppsala University\nin Sweden, turned out to be a green algae known as Cladophora. This\nalgae makes an unusual kind of cellulose typified by a very large\nsurface area, 100 times that of the cellulose found in paper. This\nallowed researchers to dramatically increase the amount of conducting\npolymer available for use in the new device, enabling it to better\nrecharge, hold and discharge electricity.\n\nThe new battery can hold 50 to 200% more charge than similar conducting\npolymer batteries, and once better optimised, it might even be\ncompetitive with commercial lithium batteries, the researchers say. It\nalso recharges much faster than a conventional rechargeable battery. The\nnew battery also shows a dramatic boost in the ability to hold a charge\nover use.\n\nJapanese scientists are once again eyeing an off-world approach to\nalternative energy - collecting solar energy from satellites in orbit\nand beaming it down to Earth.\n\nA space-based solar-power satellite - which could gather energy without\nhaving to worry about clouds or night-time - has been a dream for\ndecades in both the US and Japan. But the costs of developing it has\nmeant that support has waxed and waned over the years. Now, however,\nJapan has a new sense of mission. In June, it released a national space\nplan calling for a programme to 'lead the world in space-based solar\npower'. And earlier this month, scientists, engineers and policy-makers\nmet at Kyoto University to lay out development plans.\n\nFew doubt that the project is technically possible. The well-understood\nprocess starts with collecting solar energy with photovoltaic cells,\ntransferring that energy to antennas that transmit microwaves, then\nreceiving those microwaves with a 'rectifying antenna' that converts\nthem to electricity.\n\nResearchers are hoping to launch a full-scale system by 2030, but costs\nneed to come down dramatically for it to be economically viable.\n\nSuperconducting wires allow electricity to flow with zero resistance, as\nlong as their temperature is below at least -123 °C. That is a major\nobstacle, but does the whole of the wire have to be that cold? The\nanswer may be no, according to researchers at the University of\nCalifornia, San Diego. They have calculated that provided some points\nalong the wire's length stay below the threshold temperature, the\nmaterial will superconduct.\n\nFor this to work, the wire's surface must be extremely clean, allowing\nelectrons to move freely and spread along the wire to create a uniform\ntemperature. A material with a critical temperature of -193 °C could\nsuperconduct at room temperature, provided some sections were kept to\n-253 °C, they found. In principle, the colder these refrigeration points\nare, the fewer you need, according to the researchers.\n\nThe researchers are reluctant to proclaim the finding as the long-sought\nsolution to room-temperature superconductors, since refrigeration points\njust 20 °C above absolute zero will be tricky to achieve. Still, the\ntheory could be tested with available technology."

      "text": "Mar 11, 2010\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- A common problem with notebook computers is that the battery delivers power for far too short a time, which only gets shorter as it gets older. If you don't take great care with your rechargeable battery at all times, its life drains away quite fast. Improved batteries that deliver significantly more energy, last longer, and are safer are thus the subject of current research. Bruno Scrosati and Jusef Hassoun at the University of Rome have now developed a highly promising approach to a new variety of lithium-ion battery, which, as the researchers report in the journal Angewandte Chemie, may fulfill these criteria.\n\nHowever, their practical application suffers from the fact that their electrodes slowly dissolve, which results in a loss of capacity. Furthermore, lithium metal can form dendritic deposits that cause short circuits. This is why commercial \"lithium\" batteries do not contain lithium metal electrodes, but a material that can absorb and then release lithium ions, which is usually graphite. This type of lithium-ion cell supplies energy by transferring lithium ions only and delivers less energy.\n\nThe Italian researchers would like to combine the advantages of both types of battery to make long-lived, storable, safe, and easily produced high-capacity batteries. Their new type of lithium-metal-free cell uses a cathode (negative electrode) made of a carbon/lithium sulfide composite. The organic electrolyte solution is replaced by a lithium-ion-containing liquid enclosed in a gel-polymer membrane. The polymer shields the liquid from the electrodes. The solution is also saturated with lithium sulfide. Both of these measures minimize the dissolution of the electrode components. For their anode (positive electrode), Scrosati and Hassoun selected nanoscopic tin particles that are enclosed in a protective carbon matrix.\n\nThe electrochemical process occurs as follows: At the cathode, lithium sulfide is split into elemental sulfur and lithium ions. This process releases electrons. The lithium ions migrate through the electrolyte membrane to the anode, where they take up electrons to become uncharged lithium atoms, which are then bound into an alloy by the tin nanoparticles. The process is reversible so that the battery can be charged again and again.

The TiO2 films were prepared using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) having different molecular weights and spin coated onto indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the dip-coated TiO2 films had uniform thickness of around 70 nm. Surface morphologies of the TiO2 films were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that the low molecular weight PEG resulted in small pits in the TiO2 film and increase contact area between TiO2 and MEH-PPV improving the device efficiency of this solar cell."

Yes! \"if nature Can do , So we Can\".\n\nA Research Team From Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) led by Dr. Daniel Nocera, Ph.D., claims to have made a Notable discovery in the world of sustainable energy by developing the first \"practical\" artificial leaf Which May Show A Solution to Increasing Energy needs.\n\nThese leaves are actually advanced solar cells that mimic photosynthesis, the process by which their real-life counterparts convert sunlight and water into energy,the Principal Source of Food.\n\nLike Ordinary Leaves , the device can turn the energy of sunlight directly into a chemical fuel that can be stored and used later as an energy source.\n\nThe leaf is a silicon solar cell coated with catalytic materials on its side that, when placed in a container of water and exposed to sunlight, splits the H2O into bubbles of oxygen and hydrogen. The hydrogen Bubbles can be stored in A Container and used as an energy source, for example to power a fuel cell.\n\n\"The device both captures the solar energy and stores it in the chemical bonds of the hydrogen and oxygen that are produced from the water,\" Steven Reece, a research scientist with Sun Catalytix and lead author of a paper describing the breakthrough!\n\nThe artificial leaf is made entirely with earth-abundant, inexpensive materials — mostly silicon, cobalt, and nickel — and it works in ordinary water. Other attempts have required more expensive catalysts such as platinum and/or extremely caustic water, noted Reece.\n\nAt Present The Main Thing Or Obstacle is The Collection And Storage of Energy In a Hydrogen Fuel Cells,which is a Bit Difficult And Expensive.Further These are Less Efficient than Traditional Solar Cells ( Artificial Leaf is 4.7 % Efficient While Solar Cells Today Have 10 Percent Efficiency).Scientists Should Answer These Problem And Find A Possible configuration to make it Cost Effective And More efficient.\n\nHope In future Scientists May improve This Technique And Make it available Commercially , to Solve The Energy needs of World.

The battery would kick into use as needed to run additional equipment and to operate the microrover's propulsion system.\n\nThe microrover could explore environments hostile to humans and impractical for bulky equipment, where refueling or battery replacement would be difficult if not impossible. In addition to land or sea exploration, the microrover could be used in space.\n\n\"The goal is to demonstrate a more efficient and reliable energy source for use in powering small robotic vehicles in environments where the option for human intervention is non-existent,\" said the project leader, space robotics scientist Dr. Gregory P. Scott, in a statement. \"Microbial fuel cells coupled with extremely low-power electronics and a low energy requirement for mobility addresses gaps in power technology applicable to all robotic systems, especially planetary robotics.\"\n\nThe Office of Naval Research has been exploring the use of microbes in fuel cells for a number of years, primarily for sensing equipment used to monitor ocean environments. In 2010, the Navy showcased a group of microbial fuel cell projects at a Pentagon Earth Day event including one that tracks the location of sea turtles feeding near seaports, in order to avoid collisions with ships or construction projects.\n\nAs research chemist Dr. Leonard Tender of the Naval Research Laboratory explained in a press statement for that earlier event:\n\n\"We work on the intersection of microbiology and electrochemistry,\" Tender said. \"The most fascinating aspect of the program is how these micro-organisms function and the mechanisms by which they take fuel, metabolize it and generate electrical current.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the new planetary rover is being designed to run on the Geobacter species discovered in 1987, when Dr. Derek Lovely of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst found it dwelling in the mud in the Potomac River near Washington D.C. It is a type of bacteria that thrives in anaerobic (oxygen-free) environments — perfect for space travel and other environments hostile to human life.\n\nAnaerobic bacteria are commonly used in wastewater treatment to break down organic material rapidly and efficiently. As they digest the nutrients in wastewater, the bacteria produce energy in the form of methane gas, so their application to other forms of energy production is a natural next step.\n\nGeobacters are of particular interest because they can transfer electrons outside of the cell and move them over relatively long distances through filaments called microbial nanowires. In other words, they can generate electricity directly from common, inexpensive feedstocks, including vinegar. The microrover project is focused on a Geobacter called G. sulfurreducens.\n\nBecause of their energy density, Geobacters have the potential to enable the production of a fuel cell with less mass but greater efficiency than the next best thing, a lithium-ion battery.\n\nHowever, the microrover concept is still in the initial research stages and the team will have to overcome some foundational obstacles inherent in current microbial fuel cell technology, which relies on bulky pumping systems.\n\nAs for the Navy's interest in space travel, that derives from its entwined mission with the U.S. Air Force, overarched by the relationship between NASA and the U.S. military. As a precursor to space travel, the Office of Naval Research broke a record for a manned, high-altitude balloon flight in the 1950's.\n\nThe microrover project was funded through a research grant from the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program, which is an incubator for \"high risk-high payoff ideas\" similar to DARPA, the military research agency that engendered the Internet among other things. NIAC was initiated during the Clinton Administration as the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts. That program was shelved toward the end of the Bush administration but was revived in its current form under President Obama."

      "text": "Breakthrough could bring tenfold increase in battery life\n\nAlthough the autonomy of mobile computing devices has improved in the last decade, the gains are mostly through advancements in microprocessor and display technologies. Batteries themselves have remained largely unchanged in recent years, but a team of engineers at Northwestern University claims to have discovered a breakthrough that could revolutionize the industry.\n\nThe researchers have developed an electrode for lithium-ion batteries that increases the capacity and recharge rate by 10 times. If accurate, the innovation could afford smartphones with an all-week battery life instead of a day, and recharge times would be measured in minutes instead of hours. Even after a year of regular use, such a battery would be five times more efficient.\n\nLithium-ion batteries are charged by a chemical reaction that causes lithium ions to move between the anode and cathode. As energy is used, lithium ions travel from the anode to the cathode through the electrolyte. This is reversed when recharging. The anode is composed of carbon-based graphene sheets and they can only handle one lithium atom per six carbon atoms.\n\nScientists have attempted to replace carbon with silicon because it is far more efficient at transferring lithium atoms, but its charging capacity degrades too quickly. Meanwhile, because the graphene sheets inside today's batteries are only one carbon atom thick and comparatively long, the recharging process is hindered. Physorg describes the process as an \"ionic traffic jam.\"\n\nThe researchers have drastically improved both qualities by sandwiching clusters of silicon between the graphene sheets. This stabilizes the silicon while allowing the graphene to transfer a larger number of lithium atoms. To improve the recharge rate, the team uses chemical oxidation to create tiny 10-20nm holes in the graphene sheets, giving the lithium ions many shorter paths to travel instead of clumping along the edges.\n\nIt's said that the group has focused on improving the anode but it should make further refinements when it begins working on the cathode. The technology is expected to reach consumers within three to five years. A full overview written by researcher Harold H. Kung has been published by Advanced Energy Materials (Volume 1, Issue 6, pages 1079-1084). That release is available through Wiley online library, though it's not free.\n\nUser Comments: 29\n\nQuote(Butch) \"This is absolutely correct. Big oil will likely buy the patent and we will never see this. I am an engineer in this field and I can tell you I have witnessed this personally on at least 3 occasions. Battery tech will not improve until we are nearly out of oil (and natural gas etc) and then it will be the the oil companies that control this tech and there is nothing to be done about it WITHOUT DRASTIC LEGISLATIVE CHANGES and that will not happen until we are are on the brink of disaster. Sorry folks, keep your chargers handy\"\n\nExactly, at 2011, it is the world economy and the power of Finantial, Service and a pletora of industries that will get hurt if Oil Companies are let behave as they've done until now.\n\nIe if whole economy sectors together with Microsoft, Intel and the rest of IT firms realize that it is their actual income that gets hurt when this technology supression gets in effect once again, they will act and find a way to stop this outrageous abuse.\n\nActually when some politics get to realize that their district budgets had been largely severed by such long standing regressive behavior, legislative action would come out.\n\nDoubt we'll see any huge improvements in batteries in 10 years either and remember similar stories to this one going back 8 years (back when the story broke of having terabytes of RAM on consumer PCs).\n\nIf those comments are correct from Butch+Guest (and probably are because I've heard the same from a friend who's a drilling engineering) about fuel companies buying those patents to limit competition, we'll see a huge improvement in 40-50 years once oil has just about run out. Then what do you know ...they'll have a monopoly again on the energy market and all of a sudden prices are up to what we're used to with crude oil plus tax, vat, etc.\n\nWhat a selfish bunch we are on planet Earth, this fuel problem affects us all everyday in everyway"

      "text": "Water Refineries? News story originally written on August 8, 2008\n\nTwo scientists have discovered a simple and inexpensive way to obtain pure oxygen from water using a small amount of electricity. This discovery may become an important new green-energy source.\n\nDaniel Nocera, a chemistry professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a graduate student named Matthew Kanan made this discovery in a chemistry lab. To produce oxygen, they added a few chemicals (cobalt and phosphate) to neutral water and then inserted a conductive-glass electrode. As soon as they applied a current, a dark film began to form on the electrode from which tiny pockets of oxygen began to appear, eventually building into a stream of bubbles.\n\nAfter analyzing the electrode, Nocera and Kanan concluded that a cobalt-phosphate mixture, possibly combined with phosphate, had deposited as a film. They believe the film is what helps break apart the water molecules to create oxygen gas. The protons (hydrogen nuclei) released from the process pick up electrons and convert back into hydrogen at a partner electrode.\n\nOxygen and hydrogen are energy-rich fuels. This new technique could be a cheap energy source for people to use when the Sun goes down. While this might not be available as a home-based energy source for about ten more years, this discovery is a major step forward.Electricity and magnetism are two very important topics in the science of physics. We use electricity to power computers and to make motors go. Magnetism makes a compass point North and keeps notes stuck"

      "text": "It is typically believed that in electrochemical systems very high power rates can only be achieved with supercapacitors, which trade high power for low energy density as they only store energy by surface adsorption reactions of charged species on an electrode material. Here we show that batteries which obtain high energy density by storing charge in the bulk of a material can also achieve ultrahigh discharge rates, comparable to those of supercapacitors…. A rate capability equivalent to full battery discharge in 10–20 s can be achieved.\n\nThe ability to charge and discharge batteries in a matter of seconds rather than hours may make possible new technological applications and induce lifestyle changes.\n\nImpressive. You can read the M.I.T. release here. One of the biggest benefits to plug in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and electric vehicles is one not discussed by the researchers. As EV World editor Bill Moore explains:\n\nBeing able to charge and discharge rapidly, especially if there is no degradation of the cell, is of value for improving energy recovery from an EV's regenerative braking system, only about 10 percent of which is typically recaptured from the vehicle's kinetic energy. It also will be useful in improving vehicle acceleration. Blended-mode plug-ins should also benefit as a result, though series hybrids like the Volt probably won't, as they require more energy-dense cells.\n\nWhere MIT's \"breakthrough\" can be of real significance is in its purported cost advantage. The developers contend that their new coating material reduces the need for other mediating compounds in the battery, and since it can be applied using current manufacturing processes, battery costs can be reduced.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the lithium chemistry MIT is working with does not suffer from overheating, as current lithium batteries can.\n\nThe best news about MIT's advance is that \"Because the material involved is not new — the researchers have simply changed the way they make it — Ceder believes the work could make it into the marketplace within two to three years.\" In that sense, this may be more of an innovation than a breakthrough, though neither term is well defined.\n\nAs for the ability to charge the entire PHEV or EV quickly, the authors note:\n\n… the rate at which very large batteries such as those planned for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles can be charged is likely to be limited by the available power: 180 kW is needed to charge a 15 kWh battery (a typical size estimated for a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle) in 5 min.\n\nThe roadmap forecasts the development will be focused on two types of batteries: an output density-oriented type intended for plug-in hybrid and hybrid cars, and an energy density-oriented type for electric cars.\n\nCurrently, energy-dense battery packs (not cells) are estimated to cost approximately US$2,016/kWh, NEDO researchers estimate. By 2020, their goal is to achieve a price of one-tenth that figure and to increase the Watt hours/kg two-and-half times, from 100Wh/kg to 250Wh/kg.\n\nThat would be a game changer indeed.\n\nAnd for folks who really want to some really far out stuff, how about a real \"breakthrough\" announcement — a magnetic spin battery:)….. –noI generally don't post these way out \"breakthrough\" announcements since so few make it to commercial fruition. But it it is indicative of how exciting and vibrant — and well funded — the advanced battery sector is.\nRelated Posts:\n\n15kwh doesn't seem like all that much to me. That's about 20 horsepower for an hour.\nBut the bigger deal is definitely the energy supply. Forget about anybody getting 180kw from a residential outlet any time in the near future. That's the same as plugging in 1800 100watt bulbs into one outlet, and would turn any extension chord into a line of melted rubber next to a red hot piece of exposed wire.\nEven charging a 15kwh battery in 5 hours will require 3kw, which is about appropriate.\n\nA small point, the gentleman who was interviewed on NPR, Gerd Ceder of MIT, said it would be four or five years before this technology could be made commercial – that everything in technology took three years and that he was hedging his bet.\n\nSo if I understand the idea of a 'spin battery,' it sounds similar to the way ferromagnetic metals can become magnets themselves for a short while when they're exposed to strong magnetic fields. But in this case, instead of holding a magnetic field, it holds an electric charge.\n\nIf these become widely used though, high voltage sources could be implemented easily. Houses have slowly climbed from 50, 60, 100 and now a standard 200A service. Couple that with 220V in the home, or even higher in more industrial settings (charging bay at work, perhaps?) and the idea of a 1 inch diameter cable that just coils out of the garage ceiling isn't so bad.\n\nNot like you would have to run 100ft of cord out the garage and into the back 9 or anything. It is certainly something that will have to be engineered properly, as with any new technology.\n\n\"Battery advances seems to be flowing as fast as electrons these days — and super fast charging batteries may hit the market in as little as 2 to 3 years.\"\n\nNot to nitpick here but this may not be the analogy you want to go for if your talking about the speed of conducting electrons in a wire. Electrons only travel about 0.5 mm per second under standard loads.\n\nGood piece though, I'm glad to see current materials being stretched further.\n\nNo one has mentioned the real benefit of this. Not just better PHEV's, but it makes the pure EV much more practical. If you can recharge an EV in 5 minutes you have a whole new ballgame. Also with a pure EV you lose all that weight and maintenance costs lugging that gasoline engine around all day. Therefore you have room for twice the battery capacity of a Volt, so you can go 80 miles and recharge in 5 minutes (you have 2 Volt-sized batteries each with a charging port).\n\nTrue, not nearly the range of a typical car (300 – 400 miles) but certainly viable.\n\nRussell you solve the energy supply by charging from battery to battery with a big cable. One battery is stationary and recharges from your 20amp circuit over several hours. But it discharges into your car in 5 minutes.\n\nService stations could have banks of batteries instead of gas pumps and giant underground tanks.\n\nDoes this make pure EV's viable? Not by itself, but it does solve that \"too long to charge\" problem. Now just need to increase the energy density by 3 to 4x and EV's start to look good.\n\nFirst, the MIT breakthrough was in power density and not energy density. So the batteries may not be useful for EVs.\n\nSecond, does it really matter if LiOns can be charged faster if there are no outlets capable of charging a car in 5 to 10 minutes or even 1 hour?\n\nConsider the battery pack in the Tesla Roadster. It's rated at 53 KWh. A standard 110 home outlet can push about 2 KW hours max. Now if you go to a 240 volt 2 phase outlet at 50 amps you can get 12 KWh. That's still going to require 2hrs and 40 minutes to charge the pack assuming a battery SOC from 20% to 80% roughly. So how do you get to something like an outlet that can produce 318 KWh to get you your charge without generating vast amounts of heat in the battery pack, possibly blowing it up? I worked in an aluminum plant were large voltages were used and they generated magnetic fields large enough to cause a spade shovel to stick to the bumper of a pick up truck. How do you generate that much voltage without generating a massive electromagnetic field that will cause your car keys and any other ferrous metals to stick to the charge paddle?\n\n[JR: I think I was clear on what the advance was. Fast-charging is not the key benefit here. The authors assert it will useful for EVs, as does the editor at EV World. It appears to me the advance may allow energy batteries to act more like power batteries.]\n\nLet's not get so excited about the spin batteries. It's scientifically exciting because they found a way to produce a voltage directly from magnetic energy. But they didn't find a way to increase the energy stored in a magnetic material. The very highest \"energy product\" permanent magnets available have an \"energy product\" of about 0.5 kJ per liter; the very best experimental ones have 1 kJ per liter. That's a little higher than usable energy stored, but let's gloss over that detail. Compare that to Li-ion which is presently 1-2 MJ per liter. So even if (big if) the research went fabulously, and it were possible to use the highest energy storage magnetic materials, and the rest of the hardware used to make it into a battery didn't weigh anything or take up space, you'd still be three orders of magnitude away from competing with Li-ion\n\nThe claim is only a novel kind of battery, not a better kind of battery. One of the authors was quoted out of context saying \"the device is potentially better than anything found so far\", presumably meaning better than any other magnetic battery, but not meaning any better than the lead acid batteries we used for electric cars 100 years ago.\n\nThat's why, Joe, it's good that you don't usually bite the hook and report these things.\n\nBut the improved Li-ion charge rate is interesting, and Joe's explanation of where and why that might be useful is right on.\n\nWe (the majority of us) don't need rapid charing for our daily lives. In fact, most could get by with a 40 mile range electric and the ability to plug in both at home and work. Expand that range to 100 miles or more and only \"traveling salesmen\" would routinely need anything more.\n\nRapid charge batteries would make it possible to drive long distances with only short stops for recharging. For example, we would need only a handful of rapid charge stations between SF and LA to get the system going.\n\nRapid charging could be done with either \"big wire\"/HVDC feed in or with banks of ultra capacitors which would be continuously charged.\n\nDirect electricity for cars is the solution. After that you can take advantages of new batter technology. Direct electric plug-in hybrids. Nice to take your electricity out of the small grid above the main roads and streets.\n\nPhoenix Motor Cars was claiming a ten minute charge capability using a 480 volt charger. The lithium-titanate battery was from AltairNano. Anybody know what happened with that?\nI know their initial shipment of batteries were somehow defective, which has delayed production plans. But I am curious if the claim is valid. Their light utility pickup, which they are planning to sell in Mexico, is supposed to have a range of about 130 miles.\n\nThe issue of needing a large power supply to get a quick charge doesn't seem like that big of a problem to me. It's on long trips that a quick charge would be needed most. Otherwise, slower charging at home should be adequate for most situations. Commercial charging stations could fill the need for longer trips. It's always seemed to me that the biggest issue that will keep people from buying electric cars is range limitation. These charging stations could fill that need. Which is what makes the PHEV attractive at least as a transition vehicle.\nEven with a PHEV you would want to charge the battery, if it can be done quickly, on a long drive. (cheaper and greener than gasoline)\n\nI'm trying to keep Joe's warning in mind — this improved Li-ion battery is only in the lab, at least 3 years from production (if ever), but . . .\n\nWhat it might do is make a series hybrid a reality. Prius hybrid synergy drive rules the roost now, but its transaxle is heavy, complex, and expensive. A Toyota engineer discusses it here: \n\nA better battery could make a simpler, more efficient, less expensive series hybrid a reality.\n\nMIT's Technology Review just ran an excellent, short interview with Toyota engineer/executive Masatami Takimoto. He describes Toyota's hybrid research and some battery considerations.\n\nWhat fascinated me was that Toyota tried several hybrid configurations before settling on its current \"Hybrid synergy drive\", and that a pure series hybrid was the runner-up. I suspect that highway cruising is when you want the most direct connection between the ICE and the wheels.\n\nThis suggests that vehicles that only cruise rarely, like mail and other delivery vehicles, and city buses, are already perfect for series hybrids. It also suggests that this new battery could tip the scales toward series hybrid for most cars"

The Fuel Cell Technologies Program is focused on encouraging advances in the field and to make hydrogen a more viable option of alternative fuel. Hydrogen fuel cells have garnered a lot of praise for their efficiency and powerful capabilities, but have largely been held back by inadequate storage technologies and costly manufacturing.\n\nThe program has two specific topics of interest: Reducing the cost of storage tanks, and discovering new materials that can be used for storage.\n\nCurrently, hydrogen storage vessels are composed of high-strength carbon fiber. The material is lightweight, but expensive. It enables the tanks to hold highly pressurized hydrogen, but the tanks are generally not durable enough to be used for anything other than a stationary fuel cell. The first aim of the program is to reduce the cost of these vessels by at least 50%.\n\nThe DOE is also looking to implement different materials in the construction of fuel tanks. A number of materials have been proposed, such as complex hydrides and surface area absorbent metals. However, none have been able to reach the performance standards for vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells.\n\nThis program has already generated quite a lot of attention from a number of development companies across the nation. The funding will prove a powerful boon as the federal government plans to make serious changes to its support of developing hydrogen as a viable"

      "text": "The US DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory, NETL, is investigating the potential of producing hydrogen from coal in order to fuel the hydrogen economy. One concept under consideration is the use of a palladium-based membrane reactor in a coal gasification facility. The CO-rich gasifier effluent would be directed to the membrane reactor inlet, where it would be combined with high pressure steam. The CO and H2O would convert to CO2 and H2 via the water-gas shift reaction (WGSR). The H2 would dissociate into atoms at the palladium surface, diffuse through the palladium film, re-associate into H2 at the opposite palladium surface, and flow into the permeate stream. This removal of hydrogen from the gas-phase reaction mixture would enhance the conversion of CO to levels that would exceed conversion under comparable conditions in a conventional reactor (Enick et al., 2000). Because hydrogen alone would permeate a defect-free, dense palladium film and thereby drive the WGSR to essentially complete conversion, the retentate effluent would be a high pressure CO2-rich stream suitable for sequestration while the permeate effluent would be a high purity, low pressure hydrogen stream."

Some researchers think so, thanks to bacteria that chow down on everything from sewage to heavy metals and give off electricity as one of their own waste products.\n\nBut as with many great ideas, the devil is in the details. OIST's Biological Systems Unit is one of the research groups now working on making waste-fueled microbial fuel cells (MFCs) cheap and efficient enough for real-world applications.\n\nOne great challenge in achieving that goal is designing sturdy, cheap electrodes for MFCs that conduct electricity well, resist corrosion, and won't poison bacteria that cling to their surfaces. To this end, the Nanoparticles by Design Unit is working with the Biological Systems Unit to build and test new types of nanoparticle-studded electrodes. The idea is to coat a core of cheap material with a very thin layer of a more expensive, biocompatible metal, then stick the resulting nanoparticles onto the surface of a carbon electrode. In addition to harnessing the properties of the expensive metal at minimal cost, this will increase the surface area of the electrode so that it can host more electricity-generating bacteria.\n\nOther researchers have found that nanoparticle-studded carbon electrodes increase the electricity output of MFCs up to 20-fold compared with plain carbon electrodes; Nanoparticles by Design Unit head Mukhles Sowwan hopes to increase this by experimenting with different sizes, compositions, and methods of pinning the nanoparticles to the electrode surface. Says Sowwan, \"I believe that this innovative multidisciplinary approach in applying cutting-edge research could lead to the development of efficient microbial fuel cells.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nEngineers at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) have identified a catalyst that provides the same level of efficiency in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) as the currently used platinum catalyst, but at ...\n\nSolar energy is one of the most promising forms of renewable energy, but the high cost of conventional solar cells has so far limited its popularity.

      "text": "Upgrading the vanadium redox battery\n\nMar 17, 2011\n\nThis artist's rendering of an upgraded vanadium redox battery shows how using both hydrochloric and sulfuric acids in the electrolyte significantly improves the battery's performance and could also improve the electric grid's reliability and help connect more wind turbines and solar panels to the grid. Credit: Pacific Northwest National Laboratory\n\n solar panels to the grid.\n\nIn a paper published by the journal Advanced Energy Materials, researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory PNNL chemist Liyu Li. \"And with just a little more work, the battery could potentially increase the use of wind, solar and other renewable power sources across the electric grid.\"\n\nUnlike traditional power, which is generated in a reliable, consistent stream of electricity by controlling how much coal is burned or water is sent through dam turbines, renewable power production depends on uncontrollable natural phenomena such as sunshine and wind. Storing electricity can help smooth out the intermittency of renewable power while also improving the reliability of the electric grid that transmits it.\nVanadium batteries can hold on to renewable power until people turn on their lights and run their dishwashers. Other benefits of vanadium batteries include high efficiency and the ability to quickly generate power when it's needed as well as sit idle for long periods of time without losing storage capacity.\n\nA vanadium battery is a type of flow battery, meaning it generates power by pumping liquid from external tanks to the battery's central stack, or a chamber where the liquids are mixed. The tanks contain electrolytes, which are liquids that conduct electricity. One tank has the positively-charged vanadium ion V5+ floating in its electrolyte. And the other tank holds an electrolyte full of a different vanadium ion, V2+. When energy is needed, pumps move the ion-saturated electrolyte from both tanks into the stack, where a chemical reaction causes the ions to change their charge, creating electricity.\n\nTo charge the battery, electricity is sent to the vanadium battery's stack. This causes another reaction that restores the original charge of vanadium ions. The electrical energy is converted into chemical energy stored in the vanadium ions. The electrolytes with their respective ions are pumped back into to their tanks, where they wait until electricity is needed and the cycle is started again.\n\nA battery's capacity to generate electricity is limited by how many ions it can pack into the electrolyte. Vanadium batteries traditionally use pure sulfuric acid for their electrolyte. But sulfuric acid can only absorb so many vanadium ions.\n\nAnother drawback is that sulfuric acid-based vanadium batteries only work between about 50 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit (10 to 40 Celsius). Below that temperature range, the ion-infused sulfuric acid crystallizes. The larger concern, however, is the battery overheating, which causes an unwanted solid to form and renders the battery useless. To regulate the temperature, air conditioners or circulating cooling water are used, which causes up to 20 percent energy loss and significantly increasing the battery's operating cost, the researchers noted.\n\nWanting to improve the battery's performance, Li and his colleagues began searching for a new electrolyte. They tried a pure hydrochloric acid electrolyte, but found it caused one of the vanadium ions to form an unwanted solid. Next, they experimented with various mixtures of both hydrochloric and sulfuric acids. PNNL scientists found the ideal balance when they mixed 6 parts hydrochloric acid with 2.5 parts sulfuric acid. They verified the electrolyte and ion molecules present in the solution with a nuclear magnetic resonance instrument and the Chinook supercomputer at EMSL, DOE's Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory at PNNL.\n\nTests showed that the new electrolyte mixture could hold 70 percent more vanadium ions, making the battery's electricity capacity 70 percent higher. The discovery means that smaller tanks can be used to generate the same amount of power as larger tanks filled with the old electrolyte.\n\nAnd the new mixture allowed the battery to work in both warmer and colder temperatures, between 23 and 122 degrees Fahrenheit (-5 to 50 Celsius), greatly reducing the need for costly cooling systems. At room temperature, a battery with the new electrolyte mixture maintained an 87 percent energy efficiency rate for 20 days, which is about the same efficiency of the old solution.\n\nThe results are promising, but more research is needed, the authors noted. The battery's stack and overall physical structure could be improved to increase power generation and decrease cost.\n\n\"Vanadium redox batteries have been around for more than 20 years, but their use has been limited by a relatively narrow temperature range,\" Li said. \"Something as simple as adjusting the batteries' electrolyte means they can be used in more places without having to divert power output to regulate heat.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nFuture batteries used by the energy grid to store power from the wind and sun must be reliable, durable and safe, but affordability is really the key to widespread deployment, according to a new report published online March ...\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- One of the biggest challenges currently facing large-scale solar energy technology is finding an effective way to store the energy, which is essential for using the electricity at night orFraunhofer researchers will be presenting a novel lithium-ion battery at Hannover Messe on April 21 - 25. It is based on a polymer electrolyte, which is – unlike the liquid electrolyte in conventional lithium-ion batteries electrolytes are NOT mixed. In every article you post about the vanadium battery, it's the same mistake. If the liquids mix, they would simply heat up a lot.\n\nThe electrolytes flow into the stack, where they are separated by a membrane which allows the ions to exchange charge via an external circuit. That's what makes the thing work. IF the external circuit isn't connected, the two liquids simply flow past the membrane, isolated in their own loops, unable to interact"

      "text": "Social Web Research\n\nThis page contains a list of user images about Make A Zinc Air Battery which are relevant to the point and besides images, you can also use the tabs in the bottom to browse Make A Zinc Air Battery news, videos, wiki information, tweets, documents and weblinks.\n\nIn operation, a mass of zinc particles forms a porous anode, which is saturated with an electrolyte. Oxygen from the air reacts at the cathode and forms hydroxyl ions which migrate into the zinc paste and form zincate (Zn(OH)2−\n4), releasing electrons to travel to the cathode. The zincate decays into zinc oxide and water returns to the electrolyte. The water and hydroxyls from the anode are recycled at the cathode, so the water is not consumed. The reactions produce a theoretical 1.65 volts, but this is reduced to 1.35–1.4 V in available cells.\n\nZinc–air batteries have some properties of fuel cells as well as batteries: the zinc is the fuel, the reaction rate can be controlled by varying the air flow, and oxidized zinc/electrolyte paste can be replaced with fresh paste.\n\nZinc-air batteries can be used to replace the discontinued 1.35 V mercury batteries (although with a significantly shorter operating life), which in the 1970s through 1980s were commonly used in photo cameras.\n\nPossible future applications of this battery include its deployment as an electric vehicle battery and as a utility-scale energy storage system.\n\nThe effect of oxygen was known early in the 19th century when wet-cell Leclanche batteries absorbed atmospheric oxygen into the carbon cathode current collector. In 1878 a porous platinized carbon air electrode was found to work as well as the manganese dioxide (MnO2) of the Leclanche cell. Commercial products began to be made on this principle in 1932 when George W. Heise and Erwin A. Schumacher of the National Carbon Company built cells,[5] treating the carbon electrodes with wax to prevent flooding. This type is still used for large zinc–air cells for navigation aids and rail transportation. However, the current capacity is low and the cells are bulky.\n\nLarge primary zinc–air cells such as the Thomas A. Edison Industries Carbonaire type were used for railway signaling, remote communication sites, and navigation buoys.These were long-duration, low-rate applications. Development in the 1970s of thin electrodes based on fuel-cell research allowed application to small button and prismatic primary cells for hearing aids, pagers, and medical devices, especially cardiac telemetry.[6]\n\nZinc-air batteries have higher capacity-to-volume (and weight) ratio than other types of battery because air from the atmosphere is one of the battery reactants. The air is not packaged with the battery, so that a cell can use more zinc in the anode than a cell that must also contain, for example, manganese dioxide. This increases capacity for a given weight. As a specific example, a zinc–air battery of 11.6 mm diameter and height 5.4 mm from one manufacturer has a capacity of 620 mAh and weight 1.9 g; various silver oxide and alkaline cells of the same size supply 150–200 mAh and weigh 2.3–2.4 g.[7]\n\nZinc-air cells have long shelf life if sealed to keep air out; even miniature button cells can be stored for up to 3 years at room temperature with little capacity loss if their seal is not removed. Industrial cells stored in a dry state have an indefinite storage life.\n\nThe operating life of a zinc–air cell is a critical function of its interaction with its environment. The electrolyte loses more water in conditions of high temperature and low humidity. Because the potassium hydroxide electrolyte is deliquescent, in very humid conditions excess water accumulates in the cell, flooding the cathode and destroying its active properties. Potassium hydroxide also reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide; carbonate formation eventually reduces electrolyte conductivity. Miniature cells have high self-discharge once opened to air; the cell's capacity is intended to be used within a few weeks.[6]\n\nBecause the cathode does not change properties during discharge, terminal voltage is quite stable until the cell approaches exhaustion.\n\nPower capacity is a function of several variables: cathode area, air availability, porosity, and the catalytic value of the cathode surface. Oxygen entry into the cell must be balanced against electrolyte water loss; cathode membranes are coated with hydrophobic material (Teflon) to limit water loss. Low humidity increases water loss; if enough water is lost the cell fails. Button cells have a limited current drain; for example an IEC PR44 cell has a capacity of 600 milliamp-hours (mAh) but a maximum current of only 22 milliamps (mA). Pulse load currents can be much higher since some oxygen remains in the cell between pulses.[6]\n\nLow temperature reduces primary cell capacity but the effect is small for low drains. A cell may deliver 80% of its capacity if discharged over 300 hours at 0 °C(32 °F), but only 20% of capacity if discharged at a 50 hour rate at that temperature. Lower temperature also reduces cell voltage.\n\nZinc–air batteries cannot be used in a sealed battery holder since some air must come in; the oxygen in 1 liter of air is required for every ampere-hour of capacity used.\n\nLarge zinc–air batteries, with capacities up to 2,000 ampere–hours per cell, are used to power navigation instruments and marker lights, oceanographic experiments, and railway signals.\n\nPrimary zinc–air cells are made in button format to about 1 Ah. Prismatic shapes for portable devices are manufactured with capacities between 5 and 30 Ah. Hybrid cells have manganese dioxide added to the cathodes to allow high peak currents. Button cells are highly effective, but it is difficult to extend the same construction to larger sizes due to air diffusion performance, heat dissipation, and leakage problems. Prismatic and cylindrical cell designs address these problems. Stacking prismatic cells requires air channels in the battery and may require a fan to force air through the stack.[6]\n\nRechargeable systems may mechanically replace the anode and electrolyte, essentially operating as a refurbishable primary cell, or may use zinc powder or other methods to replenish the reactants. Mechanically-recharged systems were investigated for military electronics uses in the 1960s because of the high energy density and easy recharging. However, primary lithium batteries offered higher discharge rates and easier handling.\n\nMechanical recharging systems have been researched for decades for use in electric vehicles. Some approaches use a large zinc–air battery to maintain charge on a high discharge–rate battery used for peak loads during acceleration. Zinc granules serve as the reactant. Vehicles exchange used electrolyte and depleted zinc for fresh reactants at a service station to recharge.\n\nThe term zinc–air fuel cell usually refers to a zinc–air battery in which zinc metal is added and zinc oxide is removed continuously. Zinc electrolyte paste or pellets are pushed into a chamber, and waste zinc oxide is pumped into a waste tank or bladder inside the fuel tank. Fresh zinc paste or pellets are taken from the fuel tank. The zinc oxide waste is pumped out at a refueling station for recycling. Alternatively, this term may refer to an electrochemical system in which zinc is a co-reactant assisting the reformation of hydrocarbons at the anode of a fuel cell.\n\nMetallic zinc could be used as an alternative fuel for vehicles, either in a zinc–air battery[9] or to generate hydrogen near the point of use. Zinc's characteristics have motivated considerable interest as an energy source for electric vehicles. Gulf General Atomic demonstrated a 20 kW vehicle battery. General Motors conducted tests in the 1970s. Neither project led to a commercial product.[10]\n\nSolid zinc cannot be moved as easily as a liquid. An alternative is to form pellets that are small enough to be pumped. Fuel cells using it would be able to quickly replace zinc-oxide with fresh zinc metal.[11] The spent material can be recycled. The zinc–air \"battery\" cell is a primary cell (non-rechargeable); recycling is required to reclaim the zinc; much more energy is required to reclaim the zinc than is usable in a vehicle.\n\nOne advantage of utilizing zinc–air batteries for vehicle propulsion is that the availability of zinc metal is 100 times greater than that of lithium, per unit of battery energy. Current yearly global zinc production is sufficient to produce enough Zinc-Air batteries to power over one billion electric vehicles, whereas current lithium production is only sufficient to produce ten million lithium-ion powered vehicles.[12] Approximately 35% of the world's supply, or 1.8 gigatons of zinc reserves are in the United States,[13] whereas the U.S. holds only 0.38% of known lithium reserves.\n\nOlder designs used mercury amalgam amounting to about 1% of the weight of a button cell, to prevent zinc corrosion. Newer types have no added mercury. Zinc is relatively low in toxicity. Mercury-free designs require no special handling when discarded or recycled.[6]\n\nIn United States waters, environmental regulations now require proper disposal of primary batteries removed from navigation aids. Formerly, discarded zinc–air primary batteries were dropped into the water around buoys, which allowed mercury in the cells to escape to the environment.[15]"

      "text": "A flow battery is a rechargeable fuel cell in which electrolyte containing one or more dissolved electroactive species flows through an electrochemical cell that reversibly converts chemical energy directly to electricity. Additional electrolyte is stored externally, generally in tanks, and is usually pumped through the cell (or cells) of the reactor, although gravity feed systems are also known.[1] Flow batteries can be rapidly \"recharged\" by replacing the electrolyte liquid (in a similar way to refilling fuel tanks for internal combustion engines) while simultaneously recovering the spent material for re-energization.\n\nContents\n\nVarious classes of flow batteries exist including the redox (reduction-oxidation) flow battery, a reversible fuel cell in which all electroactive components are dissolved in the electrolyte. If one or more electroactive components are deposited as a solid layer the system is known as a hybrid flow battery;[2] that is, the electrochemical cell contains one batteryelectrode and one fuel cellelectrode. The main difference between these two types of flow batteries is that the energy of the redox flow battery, as with other fuel cells, is fully decoupled from the power, because the energy is related to the electrolyte volume (tank size) and the power to the electrode area (reactor size). The hybrid flow battery, similar to typical batteries, is limited in energy by the size of the battery electrode (reactor size).\n\nEnergy producing electrochemical cells are generally divided into two categories. Cells that can be discharged only, with irreversible electrochemical reactions, are termed primary cells, while rechargeable cells with reversible reactions are termed secondary cells[3] (see also primary and secondary batteries). Using this historical convention, a redox flow battery is better described as a secondary fuel cell or regenerative fuel cell, with the fundamental difference between batteries and fuel cells being whether energy is stored in a solid state electrode material (batteries) or in the electrolyte (fuel cells). This difference leads to the decoupling of energy and power in a fuel cell described above.\n\nRedox flow batteries, and to a lesser extent hybrid flow batteries, have the advantages of flexible layout (due to separation of the power and energy components), long cycle life (because there are no solid-solid phase transitions), quick response times, no need for \"equalisation\" charging (the over charging of a battery to ensure all cells have an equal charge) and no harmful emissions. Some types also offer easy state-of-charge determination (through voltage dependence on charge), low maintenance and tolerance to overcharge/ overdischarge.\n\nOn the negative side, flow batteries are rather complicated in comparison with standard batteries as they may require pumps, sensors, control units and secondary containment vessels. The energy densities vary considerably but are, in general, rather low compared to portable batteries, such as the Li-ion.\n\nUPS, where the battery is used if the main power fails to provide an uninterrupted supply.\n\npower conversion - because all cells share the same electrolyte/s. Therefore, the electrolyte/s may be charged using a given number of cells and discharged with a different number. Because the voltage of the battery is proportional to the number of cells used the battery can therefore act as a very powerful DC/DC converter. In addition, if the number of cells is continuously changed (on the input and/or output side) power conversion can also be AC/DC, AC/AC, or DC/AC with the frequency limited by that of the switching gear.[11]\n\nElectric vehicles - Because flow batteries can be rapidly \"recharged\" by replacing the electrolyte, they can be used for applications where the vehicle needs to take on energy as fast as a combustion engined vehicle.\n\nStand-alone power system - An example of this is the telecomms industry for use in cellphone base stations where there is no grid power available. The battery can be used alongside a solar or a wind power to compensate for their fluctuating power levels and alongside a generator to make the most efficient use of it to save fuel.[12]"

      "text": "Bruce collaborated with researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Ecole Polytechnique Federale in Switzerland to develop a process that improves the efficiency of generating electric power using molecular structures extracted from plants. The biosolar breakthrough has the potential to make \"green\" electricity dramatically cheaper and easier.\n\n\"This system is a preferred method of sustainable energy because it is clean and it is potentially very efficient,\" said Bruce, who was named one of \"Ten Revolutionaries that May Change the World\" by Forbes magazine in 2007 for his early work, which first demonstated biosolar electricity generation. \"As opposed to conventional photovoltaic solar power systems, we are using renewable biological materials rather than toxic chemicals to generate energy. Likewise, our system will require less time, land, water and input of fossil fuels to produce energy than most biofuels.\"\n\nTheir findings are in the current issue of Nature: Scientific Reports.\n\nTo produce the energy, the scientists harnessed the power of a key component of photosynthesis known as photosystem-I (PSI) from blue-green algae. This complex was then bioengineered to specifically interact with a semi-conductor so that, when illuminated, the process of photosynthesis produced electricity. Because of the engineered properties, the system self-assembles and is much easier to re-create than his earlier work. In fact, the approach is simple enough that it can be replicated in most labs—allowing others around the world to work toward further optimization.\n\n\"Because the system is so cheap and simple, my hope is that this system will develop with additional improvements to lead to a green, sustainable energy source,\" said Bruce, noting that today's fossil fuels were once, millions of years ago, energy-rich plant matter whose growth also was supported by the sun via the process of photosynthesis.\n\nThis green solar cell is a marriage of non-biological and biological materials. It consists of small tubes made of zinc oxide—this is the non-biological material. These tiny tubes are bioengineered to attract PSI particles and quickly become coated with them—that's the biological part. Done correctly, the two materials intimately intermingle on the metal oxide interface, which when illuminated by sunlight, excites PSI to produce an electron which \"jumps\" into the zinc oxide semiconductor, producing an electric current.\n\nThe mechanism is orders of magnitude more efficient than Bruce's earlier work for producing bio-electricity thanks to the interfacing of PS-I with the large surface provided by the nanostructured conductive zinc oxide; however it still needs to improve manifold to become useful. Still, the researchers are optimistic and expect rapid progress.\n\nBruce's ability to extract the photosynthetic complexes from algae was key to the new biosolar process. His lab at UT isolated and bioengineered usable quantities of the PSI for the research.\n\nAndreas Mershin, the lead author of the paper and a research scientist at MIT, conceptualized and created the nanoscale wires and platform. He credits his design to observing the way needles on pine trees are placed to maximize exposure to sunlight.\n\nMohammad Khaja Nazeeruddin in the lab of Michael Graetzel, a professor at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale in Lausanne, Switzerland, did the complex testing needed to determine that the new mechanism actually performed as expected. Graetzel is a pioneer in energy and electron transfer reactions and their application in solar energy conversion.\n\nMichael Vaughn, once an undergraduate in Bruce's lab and now a National Science Foundation (NSF) predoctoral fellow at Arizona State University, also collaborated on the paper.\n\n\"This is a real scientific breakthrough that could become a significant part of our renewable energy strategy in the future,\" said Lee Riedinger, interim vice chancellor for research. \"This success shows that the major energy challenges facing us require clever interdisciplinary solutions, which is what we are trying to achieve in our energy science and engineering PhD program at the Bredesen Center for Interdisciplinary Research and Graduate Education of which Dr. Bruce is one of the leading faculty.\"\n\nThe Bredesen Center is a joint UT/Oak Ridge National Laboratory academic unit. Bruce is also a co-principal investigator and scientific thrust leader in TN: SCORE, the Tennessee Solar Conversion and Storage Using Outreach, Research and Education. The $20 million project is funded by the NSF and focuses on promoting research and education on solar energy problems across Tennessee. Additionally, he co-founded and is associate director of UT's Sustainable Energy Education.\n\nBruce's work is funded by the Emerging Frontiers Program at the National Science Foundation.\n\nIn a new approach, researchers from the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science have genetically modified a cyanobacterium to consume carbon dioxide and produce the liquid fuel isobutanol, which holds great potential as a gasoline alternative. The reaction is powered directly by energy from sunlight, through photosynthesis.\n\nThe recent dramatic rise in oil prices has encouraged most governments to back energy polices which do not include oil. Most countries have signed up to policies which will cut carbon emissions. To achieve both of these goals they are turning to nuclear energy.\n\nThe European Union was unable to agree to a timetable to manage climate change because they could not agree on costs and the type of acceptable alternative fuels. McCain is promising 40 new nuclear power plants by 2030, while Barack Obama has concluded that they can not achieve their climate change goals, unless they include nuclear power. The French are already committed to nuclear power.\n\nBut where is all the uranium ore going to come from to fuel these power stations?\n\nOver the past few months, you may have heard on the news or Internet how people are using plain water to power their car. It's an amazing story, especially with $5/gallon gas in the US, and $10/gallon gas in Europe, but it it true?\n\nIn fact, basic water fuel technology does work and has been around since World War II, when it was used in tanks and fighter plane engines. These simple water injection systems helped to increase gas mileage and cool engine temperatures under harsh conditions."

      "text": "Scientists from the University of Southern California have developed a new catalyst for hydrogen fuel cells. The catalyst in made from ruthenium, a rare chemical element derived from platinum. Unlike conventional platinum catalysts, ruthenium is highly resistant to electrolysis, the process through which hydrogen is produced from water. The chemical reactions occurring in fuel cells are quite volatile, putting a enormous strain on the internal components of units. These components wear out over time and need to be replaced, a costly procedure considering the massive expense associated with platinum.\n\nUsing the ruthenium catalysts, researchers have developed a fuel cell that extracts hydrogen from ammonia borane. Previous attempts at using ammonia borane as a viable hydrogen source were met with mild success but each attempt harbored a serious drawback. The process through which hydrogen is extracted from ammonia borane produces caustic chemicals which cause damage to fuel cells. These chemicals speed the rate of deterioration, making fuel cells ultimately unviable for commercial use.\n\nThe ruthenium catalysts, however, can extract hydrogen from ammonia borane, producing only a small amount of harmful chemicals in the process. This gives the fuel cells longevity, which translates into better performance overall. Though the catalyst is derived from platinum, ruthenium is less expensive than its parent element, making fuel cells that use this catalyst more affordable.\n\nResearchers have been seeking alternatives to conventional fuel cell catalysts for several years now. Ruthenium is among the most promising developments in fuel cell development, showing that hydrogen is quickly becoming a viable"

Every joule of energy in the world's oil reserves was put there by the sun, millions of years ago. Even uranium was created in the death-rattle explosion of some ancient star. We have found or developed hundreds of middle-men, from coal turbines to AAA batteries, energy carriers who power up on star energy and release it only grudgingly to human beings. This week, a team of researchers at MIT hope to start our great global austerity measure, the elimination of the middle-men, and the rise of true, sustainable solar power.\n\nThe flaw in solar power has always been efficiency. For decades, scientists struggled to capture even a sizable minority of the solar energy falling on a particular panel — the recent development of a system with 32% efficiency was heralded as a major breakthrough. At that rate, solar farms would need to be huge, truly gigantic, to collect useful amounts of energy, and their price per square foot has always been worrying. The reason for this is that solar energy is not one homogeneous force, like wind; any one collector will be able to absorb some of the energy falling on it, but will miss most of the rest as a result.\n\nErgon Energy Station in Windorah, Australia\n\nUntil now. A recent MIT study [PDF] has proposed that an \"atomically thin\" sheet of semiconducting material could be stretched by pushing a pin down onto the center. The resulting funnel shape would have a gradient of internal strain that tapers off further from the center. Prior research has shown that stretching silicon semiconductors by just 1% can increase electron flow by more than 50%, and so the researchers propose using strained semiconducting materials to \"tune\" a solar collector to a particular wavelength of light. Within the limits of the material, changing the pin pressure will adjust the shape of the funnel, and thus the edges of the absorption spectrum.\n\nThis neatly sidesteps the major problem with collection of solar energy: there's so much of it. Spread across a spectrum far larger than that visible to the human eye, energy from the sun comes in a variety of sizes and power levels. MIT's new model says that by creating a gradient of strain between the semiconducting molecules, they will also create a gradient of absorptive ability, a physical property called the bandgap. Plants use a variety of different pigments to trap a wide variety of light, but are ultimately best with red; even using multiple absorbers can only get you so far. High-bandgap materials can accommodate higher-energy light but exclude the weaker wavelengths that make up most of our potential photons, while low-bandgap materials let us collect many photons, each with little energy. What we need is a cell that can absorb all along that spectrum.\n\nA solar funnel, as proposed by MIT, could catch many different wavelengths of light all along its surface — and unlike modern organic cells, which rely on diffusion to bring excited units to the collector, this one would direct every captured photon quickly down toward the collector. That's ultimately half the point of their work, to make not just the absorption but the collection phases efficient enough for mass use.\n\nCombined with existing techniques to increase solar efficiency, like farms and panel stacks, this study hopes to lay the foundation for a viable solar future. In the past, solar power has been about clean energy production, about saving the environment and ourselves. As our energy needs continue to increase, however, we may find that we're turning to solar simply so we can keep the lights on. Sun funnels are a lot more approachable than star-encompassing Dyson spheres, after all.\n\nAt the other end of the energy conundrum:\n\"\"One of the most significant events in this recasting was the realization in the early 1980s that\nthe average American consumed as many natural resources as 1000 average inhabitants of India. It was also realized that the average American produced as much waste (including the all important carbon footprint) as 2500 Indians! even today, the ratios are still\napproximately 1:300 (US compared to India) and 1:500 compared to China.\"\"\nCan the American Dream lifestyle be so modifies as to require only the energy available form Solar, Wind, Wave, Tidal, Geothermal, bio-Diesel, and Thorium ? Can the American's EROI be crafted better? Will the Chinese or Asians be first with a 'system\" that is environmentally constructive, Ecologically safe, and allows for larger happy populations with acceptable EROI's? Can America make the required changes fast enough to even accomodate the Chinese advances, Thorium reactors, already exploded \"Population Bombs\" and survive by their 1950′s American Dream standards? When (no longer \"if\") Boeing, Lockheed, Airbus styled planes are manufactured by Chinese workers, will the American unions still have leverage to demand a 1990′s lifestyle for their workers? Will Capitalists move even these jobs to cheaper Asian situations?\nAppreciate the Solar advantages, But:"

      "text": "The Power of Pee: Researchers Develop Urine-Powered Fuel Cells\n\nHuman waste will never be looked at the same way again. Researchers from the Bristol Robotics Laboratory at the University of Bristol, England, recently reported in The Journal of Physical Chemistry that they've developed a fuel cell that uses urine to generate electricity.\n\nThe urine-tricity project consists of microbial fuel cells (MFC) that use bacteria to make urea, a chemical in urine, generate electricity. Wastewater treatment plants regularly use bacteria to break down waste, but the difference is that those processes are energy intensive, whereas Bristol's approach actually generates energy, explains Dr. Ioannis Ieropoulos, a lead researcher at Bristol.\n\nThe amount of energy produced is minimal. One cell produces a current of 0.25mA, about enough to power a hearing aid. Though one cell's output is miniscule, the team is working on making them smaller and stacking many of them together. At that point, power generation becomes a real possibility.\n\nSince urine is produced everywhere, and a lot of it too — humans alone are estimated to produce 6.4 trillion liters a year — this idea has a strong local flavor. The ability to produce energy locally could give this technology an edge against other renewable energies such as solar and wind that are only cost-effective in certain areas.\n\nThe team is initially targeting micro-generation for the home. That poses the big question of whether people are willing to separate their urine from their fecal matter. Toilets exist that can do the trick, it's just a matter of getting people to convert. Another possibility is keeping the regular toilet and installing a urinal. A welcome addition to any bathroom for guys, but who knows, ladies may learn to go a different way too.\n\nUrine contains organic compounds such as nitrogen and phosphorus that when released into the environment in large amounts can pollute rivers in much the same way fertilizer does. Wastewater treatment plants put much effort into filtering these compounds. MFCs can capture those nutrients to reuse as fertilizer, yet another benefit of this emerging technology.\n\nIt's urine-tricity's many benefits that excited the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to fund this project through their Grand Challenges Explorations program, an initiative aimed at facilitating unorthodox ideas capable of solving persistent health and development challenges. As a local source of power, urine-tricity can have a substantial impact on the developing world.\n\nThis project is not without its challenges. Aside from the societal shift in bathroom habits, there's always the all-important challenge of being economical. It doesn't matter how efficiently the technology works, if it isn't cost-effective, it isn't going to make it.\n\nThis technology is nothing new. Dr. Ieropoulos has been working with MFC technology for a decade now to power energetically autonomous robots called EcoBots. Older versions of the EcoBot have been powered by sugar, dead insects and food waste. These years of experience will no doubt lend legitimacy to a project that's one among many in the competitive renewable energy field.\n\nIn the '70s, John Lennon sang \"Power to the People.\" Michael Franti updated it in the '90s to \"Power to the Peaceful.\" As fossil fuels become totally uncool in the '10s, maybe we'll now be singing a different tune altogether: \"Power to the Pee-ple.\""

According to project leaders Drs Manickam Minakshi and Danielle Meyrick, the battery \"has excellent potential for large-scale use, including storing energy from wind turbines and solar farms for later feeding into local electricity grids, as well as use in industry\"\n\nAs we look to transition to renewable energy sources such as solar energy and wind power we are faced with a number of problems. Currently wind turbines and solar panels are dependent on weather conditions; wind turbines don't operate on a still day, while solar panels can't be used at night or during cloudy weather. It can leave the electricity demand unbalanced with the energy supply generated by renewables.

If the work scales up to produce longer fibers as well as the team thinks it could, these solar energy absorbing threads could be woven into clothing in the future. So if you've ever wanted a jacket that can pull in energy through the fibers it's made of and use it charge your phone while you take a stroll in the park, take heart — you might be getting it sooner than expected.\n\nA paper describing the research, published online today in the journal Advanced Materials, builds on earlier work the team did creating hair-thin fibers with integrated electronic components. Rather than building fiber optic that can use power, though, the team is now working on crafting fiber optic threads that can produce it.\n\nInstead of attempting to turn a solar cell into a fiber, the team came at the problem from the other side, working to turn a silicon fiber into a solar cell. Using the same high-pressure chemistry techniques they developed in their earlier work, they placed tiny particles of solar cell materials layer by layer into the pores of the thin silicon cable. The result this time is a thin fiber that can absorb solar radiation turn into into electricity. Says lead author John Badding:\n\n.\n\nThe team says they've made meters long strands of the fiber, and is hopeful that the technique they're using could produce fibers up to 10 meters in length without problems. The hope is that this early work will one day translate into foldable, windable fibers that could power or charge electrical devices on the go by harvesting the solar radiation around them — an application the military has expressed no small degree of interest in.\n\nThey're not the only ones. I, for one, am sick of walking around in clothing that doesn't actively power my growing legion of personal electronics. Like a savage. I'm ready for the future today, and the future is a pair of solar powered pants.\n\nWould the actual conversion take place on the fabric itself? I am not a scientist, but if it did, wouldn't regular exposure to electric fields (albeit likely low level) be in the \"not a good idea\" category? This is assuming the cloth it is being made into is used for human clothing, versus, say, a backpack. Anyone?\n\nMellowhead\n\nThe VERY low currents produced by this technology would not produce a very strong EM field. Likely, less strong (at the average distance a piece of clothing would be from the body) than the earth's magnetic field. People often forget how much natural radiation humans are exposed to every day, including from our sun, more localized radiation such as cell phone towers and FM radio, the wiring in your own house and the power grid outside, as well as higher energy cosmic radiation."

This allows a current to flow when the cell is placed in sunlight\n\nBut the efficiency of dye-sensitised solar cells designed for outdoor conditions is currently about 6%. That's light years from the 42.8% efficiency reached by some silicon solar cells and well below the 15% standard for many silicon designs.\n\nSee-through cell\n\nMichael Grätzel of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland - who co-invented dye sensitised solar cells in 1991 - had thought it may be possible to double the efficiency of his low-cost cells simply by designing one that collects light from both sides simultaneously.\n\nNow Grätzel's team, working with Seigo Ito of the University of Hyogo, Japan, has done just that. Their new dye-sensitised solar cell is almost as efficient at converting light into energy when it strikes the rear side as when it strikes the front.\n\nTo achieve the trick, Grätzel's team first replaced the opaque back panel with a second sheet of glass, making the entire device transparent.\n\nThe new panel is also coated with tin oxide and acts as the second electrode, donating electrons back to the electrolyte to complete the circuit. But because it is transparent, it lets light into the system from the rear.\n\nLight fantastic\n\nGrätzel's team experimented with varying the thickness of the dye-filled layer. They found that if that layer was around 15 micrometers thick, the solar cell converted 6% of the light arriving through its front into electricity and a further 5.5% of the light arriving through the rear.\n\n\"There is always an albedo effect [as light bounces off surfaces] and on a cloudy day, collecting light from both sides will buy you almost double the normal efficiency,\" says Grätzel.\n\n\"Other electrolytes have reached 10% or even higher,\" he says. Using those electrolytes in the new two-sided solar cell could help to reach efficiencies of 15 to 20%, which is better than the performance of silicon wafer solar cells under similar conditions, says Grätzel.\n\nEven before Grätzel's team announced their new cell design, dye-sensitised solar cells were beginning to attract interest from industry. Earlier this year Sony announced it had developed cells with an energy conversion efficiency of 10%, a level considered necessary for commercial use.\n\nBut those efficiency ratings are misleading according to Robert Hertzberg, chairman and co-founder of G24 Innovations, a company based in Cardiff in the UK that manufactures dye-sensitised solar products. \"This technology allows you to capture power in low light, even rainy conditions,\" he says. \"Silicon cells only allow you to capture power during a short window [when light is intense].\" That means the cells give a better performance over the whole day even if they are less efficient under ideal conditionsTwo Side Really. . . . .\n\nWed Oct 29 10:04:43 GMT 2008 by David Smart\n\nIt seems more sensible to work on technology I believe was discussed in New Scientist a couple of months ago in which the addition of coatings to glass allowed the selective internal reflection of specific wavelengths (presumably shorter blue higher energy end). This gathered light is transmitted out the ends of the glass pane onto more efficient silicon based solar cells in the frame of the window. This allows huge areas of light to be gathered from windows of large building, while they remain transparent but with the requirement for only small amount of solar cells.\n\nAt present we seem to be wasting huge amounts of time inventing an increasing number of technologies that will never be practical or marketable. The issues are cost and area of land required to produce energy requirement. If you are only going to get 4 percent double sided or not, it would be better to plant a field of willow and coppice it sustainably for burning locally in a small power plant.\n\nVery Good, But. . .\n\nWed Oct 29 10:13:45 GMT 2008 by Tom Keller\n\nWith most of these findings, we hear about them, and then....nothing.\n\nWe sort of need them in stores if they are going to do any difference, and at prices that makes it possible to get the investment back in say 5 years or so, as with the small windpower mills currently on sale.\n\nBesides, I read about the guys from mit had made some solar cells that where quite brilliant, but they had a life expectance of around 3 months, so not that usefull if you need to change the windows every 3 months or so to get solarpower.\n\nBut if they can make this work, I have an idea they can use for free, make it into soft plastic fibres that can be weaved into cloth, that way we can buy curtains that produce solarpower, covers for the car that charges the battery while keeping the car clean, backpacks and jackets that charge your phone and mp3player and so on.\n\nWho cares how much efficiency they have, if they can charge your electrical car with 1 or 2 miles of free driving in a day it will be a hit, most people dont have that far to go to work anyway.\n\nJust make them, and make them cheap, then a lot more uses will come.\n\nBut first, get them out of the lab and into the market, thats what we are waiting for.\n\nPerhaps we need some investment that isnt looking for 30 or more percent payback the first few years, after all it worked for the windmills, they are big bussiness today, but it took over 10 years of research and development with almost no payback to get them there."

Less than a millimetre thick and weighing in below 1 gram, the battery supplies 1.5V of power. The scientists used silk-screen printing, the same technology used to print T-shirts, to print out this amazing battery.

Electricity is produced through the chemical reaction between the two.\n\nWhile a single battery only supplies 1.5V of power, the researchers tested multiple batteries in series to achieve 3V, 4.5V and 6V of power supply. While higher power supply capacity might not be an issue, the battery does have one limitation; it can only be used to power gadgets that have a limited lifespan as it cannot be recharged.\n\nTalking about their invention, the boffins said, \"The battery is best suited to applications which have a limited life span or a limited power requirement such as greeting cards.

      "text": "(PhysOrg.com) -- In. Although high energy transfer efficiency is just one component of the development of a useful artificial LHS, the achievement could lead to clean solar-fuel technology that turns sunlight into chemical fuel.\n\nThe researchers, led by Shinsuke Takagi from the Tokyo Metropolitan University and PRESTO of the Japan Science and Technology Agency, have published their study on their work toward an artificial LHS in a recent issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society.\n\n\"In order to realize an artificial light-harvesting system, almost 100% efficiency is necessary,\" Takagi told PhysOrg.com. \"Since light-harvesting systems consist of many steps of energy transfer, the total energy transfer efficiency becomes low if the energy transfer efficiency of each step is 90%. For example, if there are five energy transfer steps, the total energy transfer is 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 = 0.59. In this way, an efficient energy transfer reaction plays an important role in realizing efficient sunlight collection for an artificial light-harvesting system.\"\n\nAs the researchers explain in their study, a natural LHS (like those in purple bacteria or plant leaves) is composed of regularly arranged molecules that efficiently collect sunlight and carry the excitation energy to the system's reaction center. An artificial LHS (or \"artificial leaf\") attempts to do the same thing by using functional dye molecules.\n\nBuilding on the results of previous research, the scientists chose to use two types of porphyrin dye molecules for this purpose, which they arranged on a clay surface. The molecules' tendency to aggregate or segregate on the clay surface made it challenging for the researchers to arrange the molecules in a regular pattern like their natural counterparts.\n\n\"A molecular arrangement with an appropriate intermolecular distance is important to achieve nearly 100% energy transfer efficiency,\" Takagi said. \"If the intermolecular distance is too near, other reactions such as electron transfer and/or photochemical reactions would occur. If the intermolecular distance is too far, deactivation of excited dye surpasses the energy transfer reaction.\"\n\nIn order to achieve the appropriate intermolecular distance, the scientists developed a novel preparation technique based on matching the distances between the charged sites in the porphyrin molecules and the distances between negatively charged (anionic) sites on the clay surface. This effect, which the researchers call the \"Size-Matching Rule,\" helped to suppress the major factors that contributed to the porphyrin molecules' tendency to aggregate or segregate, and fixed the molecules in an appropriate uniform intermolecular distance. As Takagi explained, this strategy is significantly different than other attempts at achieving molecular patterns.\n\n\"The methodology is unique,\" he said. \"In the case of usual self-assembly systems, the arrangement is realized by guest-guest interactions. In our system, host-guest interactions play a crucial role for realizing the special arrangement of dyes. Thus, by changing the host material, it is possible to control the molecular arrangement of dyes on the clay surface.\"\n\nAs the researchers demonstrated, the regular arrangement of the molecules leads to an excited energy transfer efficiency of up to 100%. The results indicate that porphyrin dye molecules and clay host materials look like promising candidates for an artificial LHS.\n\n\"At the present, our system includes only two dyes,\" Takagi said. \"As the next step, the combination of several dyes to adsorb all sunlight is necessary. One of the characteristic points of our system is that it is easy to use several dyes at once. Thus, our system is a promising candidate for a real light-harvesting system that can use all sunlight. We believe that even photochemical reaction parts can be combined on the same clay surface. If this system is realized and is combined with a photochemical reaction center, this system can be called an 'inorganic leaf.'\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Our attempts to use solar energy continue to be very ineffective; the true masters of this craft are photosynthetic plants, algae, and bacteria.

      "text": "Nanofibrous membranes help to get potable water\n\n05/04/2012\n\nPotable water is currently among one of the commodity which we essentially need. There are many placed industrially polluted water sources or places where is lack of fresh drinking water. Therefore is it necessary to deal with alternative technologies to obtain drinking water. One of them is desalination. Seawater desalination is energy intensive (and thus expensive) process. Nowadays, there is a space for renewable energy sources, which gives us energy from the sun, wind and earth (solar, wind and geothermal energy).\n\nSo why not try it out to get potable water from geothermal water? Scientists from the University Malaysia Sabah are engaged in this idea currently. They decided to get potable water from geothermal water desalination using nanofibrous membranes. Their results have been presented at the International Conference on Chemical, Biological and Environmental Sciences (ICCEBS'2012) in Penang, Malaysia recently.\n\nGeothermal water is obtained from deep wells in most cases, and its energy is used for electricity production or heating. The major disadvantage is the strong mineralization (by sodium, calcium, copper, iron, sulfates, chlorides, etc.), which causes technological elements fouling. This water must be desalinated to be potable according to the applicable standards recommended by WHO.\n\nSource of groundwater is located in Sabah, Malaysia. This geothermal water has a temperature around 60 °C, which should be enough for desalination without the large energy invested amount. At the same time, they tried to develop an alternative material for the membrane distillation - nanofibrous membrane.\n\nAt present, the conventional technologies (reverse osmosis and multistage flash distillation) are used in seawater desalination. The main disadvantage of these technologies is the final price. Membrane distillation is economically feasible and environmentally acceptable alternative and is becoming a new trend in the field of desalination. The principle of membrane distillation is based on the different volatility of each individual substance and driving force of this process is the vapor pressure difference. Water movement through the membrane is due to vapor pressure imbalances (according to corresponding temperature differences) between the membrane parts. The water evaporation occurs at the input (retention) side of the membrane, in which some components are dissolved in the membrane, diffuse through the membrane and evaporate at the permeate side. Water vapor moves through the membrane until it reaches the low water vapor concentration at the pore outlet (permeate part), where condense and can be collected as pure water.\n\nThe greatest demands are to the membrane and its characteristics (hydrophobicity, durability, low thermal conductivity, high efficiency and high mass flux). The membrane must be thin, because the permeate flux is indirectly proportional to the membrane thickness. Hydrophobic nature prevents the liquid water penetration through the membrane pores, but allows water vapor passage. Nanofibrous membrane of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has been tested. Water flux was higher in comparison with conventional PVDF membrane (11.16 kg/m2.hr at differences in temperatures from 22 to 82 ° C). Nanofibers offer attractive characteristics - highsurface area, porosity, open interconnected pore structure and a low membrane thickness. A few disadvantages also exist - low membrane resistance and low LEP (the minimum pressure required to pure water to wet dry membrane pores), which leads to fluids penetration into and through the membrane pores. However, the filtration efficiency reached 90.7 to 99.9% and the porosity of the nanofibrous membrane was higher than 70%.\n\nNanofibrous membranes offer great potential for geothermal water desalination, but it is necessary to optimize the technology to adapt nanofibers properties. The result will be an excellent material with high efficiency and high flux, available for developing countries. And there is one the most important thing - more attainable drinking water."

      "text": "Are Dye-Sensitized Cells The Future Of Solar?\n\nResearchers in Finland are claiming a form of solar cells that can be applied to surfaces as a coat of paint could herald the future of solar energy.\n\nResearchers at the University of Turku predict that dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are set to become a ubiquitous source of energy. Research into such cells began in the 1990s. Now these Finn scientists say that the DCSs, which are inexpensive to produce compared to the complex and expensive clean-room manufacturing processes associated with current silicon-based solar panels, could help make solar power more accessible by driving down costs.\n\nimage via Dyesol\n\nSolar energy developers have been looking for new ways to make photovoltaic cells (PV) for some years, mainly because of the high volumes of silicon needed to produce these first generation of solar energy capture devices. Research has ushered in second generation of solar cells made from multi-crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, cadmium-telluride, and copper-indium-gallium-selenide.\n\nThe DSCs belong to the third generation. They are made from titanium oxide, a naturally occurring oxide. Used in various applications, such as pigments, the compound has also been applied as a photocatalyst and is widely used in semiconductors.\n\nIn the DSCs the oxide appears in the form of a white pigment. The pigment absorbs energy from the suns rays, which sucks electrons from dye molecules into a layer beneath the top coating. This movement of electrons creates a flow which produces an electrical current.\n\nAs well as their low cost, the DSCs have an extra advantage as a method of solar capture, which is that they can be applied to unconventional surfaces. Professor Michael Grätzel, who received the 2012 Albert Einstein World Award of Science for his work in developing the technology, has invented a method by which DSCs can be applied to surfaces as a coating of colored paint.\n\nThe cells can be attached in the form of a spray or a paste to multiple surfaces, and could theoretically even be sprayed on to transport such as cars, trains, and buses.\n\nWriting in the International Journal of Technology, Policy and Management this month, Jongyun Moon and his colleagues Aulis Tuominen and Arho Suominen at the University of Turku said that DSCs were still deficient in their ability to convert solar radiation into energy in comparison to more mature technologies. However, even with the low energy conversion rates DSCs are still being widely considered mainly, as Moon said, because of the low manufacturing cost associated with their production.\n\nWriting in the paper Moon said: \"It is, however unclear when DSCs could produce energy cost efficiently. As such, analysis on to what extent DSC technology could substitute for existing, more mature technologies is a challenging forecast"

      "text": "List of 10 emerging technologies with life- and globe-changing impacts\n\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) holds a number of meetings around the world and has many working committees/councils. The Global Agenda Council on Emerging Technologies is tasked to examine trends and possible impacts that various emerging technologies and to discuss strategies for dealing with the impacts on our collective future.\n\nThe Global Agenda Council has just released a list of the trends expected to have major impacts in the near future (the rest of 2012). The The3. Green Revolution 2.0 – technologies for increased food and biomass Artificial fertilizers are one of the main achievements of modern chemistry, enabling unprecedented increases in crop production yield. Yet, the growing global demand for healthy and nutritious food is threatening to outstrip energy, water and land resources. By integrating advances across the biological and physical sciences, the new green revolution holds the promise of further increasing crop production yields, minimizing environmental impact, reducing energy and water dependence, and decreasing the carbon footprint.\n\n4. Nanoscale design of materials The increasing demand on natural resources requires unprecedented gains in efficiency. Nanostructured materials with tailored properties, designed and engineered at the molecular scale, are already showing novel and unique features that will usher in the next clean energy revolution, reduce our dependence on depleting natural resources, and increase atom-efficiency manufacturing and processing.\n\n5. Systems biology and computational modelling/simulation of chemical and biological systems For improved healthcare and bio-based manufacturing, it is essential to understand how biology and chemistry work together. Systems biology and computational modelling and simulation are playing increasingly important roles in designing therapeutics, materials and processes that are highly efficient in achieving their design goals, while minimally impacting on human health and the environment.\n\n6. Utilization of carbon dioxide as a resource Carbon is at the heart of all life on earth. Yet, managing carbon dioxide releases is one of the greatest social, political and economic challenges of our time. An emerging innovative approach to carbon dioxide management involves transforming it from a liability to a resource. Novel catalysts, based on nanostructured materials, can potentially transform carbon dioxide to high value hydrocarbons and other carbon-containing molecules, which could be used as new building blocks for the chemical industry as cleaner and more sustainable alternatives to petrochemicals.\n\n7. Wireless power Society is deeply reliant on electrically powered devices. Yet, a significant limitation in their continued development and utility is the need to be attached to the electricity grid by wire – either permanently or through frequent battery recharging. Emerging approaches to wireless power transmission will free electrical devices from having to be physically plugged in, and are poised to have as significant an impact on personal electronics as Wi-Fi had on Internet use.\n\n8. High energy density power systems Better batteries are essential if the next generation of clean energy technologies are to be realized. A number of emerging technologies are coming together to lay the foundation for advanced electrical energy storage and use, including the development of nanostructured electrodes, solid electrolysis and rapid-power delivery from novel supercapacitors based on carbon-based nanomaterials. These technologies will provide the energy density and power needed to supercharge the next generation of clean energy technologies.\n\n9. Personalized medicine, nutrition and disease prevention As the global population exceeds 7 billion people – all hoping for a long and healthy life – conventional approaches to ensuring good health are becoming less and less tenable, spurred on by growing demands, dwindling resources and increasing costs. Advances in areas such as genomics, proteomics and metabolomics are now opening up the possibility of tailoring medicine, nutrition and disease prevention to the individual. Together with emerging technologies like synthetic biology and nanotechnology, they are laying the foundation for a revolution in healthcare and well-being that will be less resource intensive and more targeted to individual needs.\n\n10. Enhanced education technology New approaches are needed to meet the challenge of educating a growing young population and providing the skills that are essential to the knowledge economy. This is especially the case in today's rapidly evolving and hyperconnected globalized society. Personalized IT-based approaches to education are emerging that allow learner-centred education, critical thinking development and creativity. Rapid developments in social media, open courseware and ubiquitous access to the Internet are facilitating outside classroom and continuous education.\n\nMembers of the Global Agenda Council had this to say about the list (from the Feb. 15, 2012 news release from Cientifica),\n\nMany of the technology trends are currently below the radar of most policy makers. Council member Tim Harper [CEO, Cientifica] emphasized that \"Technology is a very powerful tool for change. If the Arab Spring demonstrated that many governments are still unsure how to respond to mature and simple to grasp technologies such as Facebook and Twitter, then they run the risk of being absolutely powerless in the face of science-based technological change.\"\n\nCouncil Chair Professor Sang Yup Lee at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) explained that \"Accelerating progress in science and technology has stimulated a new age of discovery, and many of the technologies identified by the council are critical to building a sustainable and resilient future.\" Regarding job creation through emerging technologies, Council Vice-Chair Javier Garcia Martinez said, \"There are no generally applicable shortcuts in the path that goes from emerging technologies to new industries and job creation. This path includes sufficient and sustained funding leaving enough incentive to the founders and real focus on scale, reliability, and safety.\" The report also cautions that without new understanding, tools and capabilities, ranging from public policy to investment models, their safe and successful development is far from guaranteed. Among the trends are advances in informatics, biotechnology, medicine, materials, education, and resource usage.\n\nInformatics for adding value to information and handling \"big data\" for \"data to decision\" is highlighted, and has been the focus of idea generation during this year's Davos forum. In particular, the intelligent technologies for creating valuable information out of noisy data need to be developed.\n\nIn the biological domain, synthetic biology and metabolic engineering are expected to become increasingly important in manufacturing new drugs and producing chemicals and materials from renewable resources. Systems biology and computational modelling and simulation of chemical and biological systems are playing increasingly important roles in helping design therapeutics, materials and processes that are highly efficient in achieving their design goals, while minimally impacting on human health, resources, and the environment. Innovative technologies for a second green revolution that provide security in food supply for growing population and biomass for biorefineries are also selected.\n\nNanomaterials designed and engineered at the molecular scale are expected to continue to provide novel solutions to energy, water, and other resource-based challenges. Also listed are breakthrough technologies that potentially turn carbon dioxide from a global liability to a valuable resource.\n\nThe list also includes wireless power, high energy-density power systems, personalized medicine and nutrition, and enhanced education technologies.\n\nDirector of World Economic Forum Andrew Hagan said, \"We believe that these emerging technologies to be announced annually by the council will provide a chance for all stakeholders to link technology trends to the global megatrends and solutions to the mega-challenges. The challenge will not just be the new ideas but leaving the old ones behind.\""

      "text": "Substantial improvement in essential cheap solar cell process\n\nMar 20, 2008 of solar cell, which is similar to Grätzel cells. Huijser will receive her PhD on this subject from TU Delft on Tuesday 25 March.\n\nThe use of solar cells is increasing very slowly. One of the reasons is that the most commonly used type, made from silicon, is quite expensive to manufacture. That is why there has been a great deal of research into alternative solar cells over the past few years.\n\nIn searching for solutions, scientists are inspired by nature. Plants are able to transport absorbed solar energy over long distances, typically about 15-20 nanometres, to a location in which it is converted into chemical energy. This is because the chlorophyll molecules in their leaves are arranged in the best possible sequence. During her PhD, Annemarie Huijser attempted a partial recreation in solar cells of this process as found in plants.\n\nShe focused on what are known as dye-sensitised solar cells. These comprise a semiconductor, such as titanium dioxide, covered with a layer of dye. The dye absorbs energy from sunlight, which creates what are known as excitons. These energy parcels then need to move towards to the semiconductor. Once there, they generate electric power.\n\nLego\n\nHuijser: \"You can compare dye molecules to Lego bricks. I vary the way the bricks are stacked and observe how this influences the exciton transport through the solar cells. Excitons need to move as freely as possible through the solar cells in order to generate electricity efficiently.\"\n\nBy studying the best sequence of dye molecules, Huijser succeeded in increasing the average distance which the excitons move in the solar cell by twenty times up to a distance of approximately 20 nanometres, comparable to systems found in nature. This substantially increases the efficiency of the cells.\n\nIn order to make this new type of solar cell commercially viable, Huijser estimates that the mobility of the excitons needs to increase further by a factor of three. She believes that this is certainly possible. 'Once that has been achieved, there is nothing to stop this type of solar cell being developed further.'\n\nGrätzel cells\n\nThe solar cells used by Huijser are closely related to the more widely known Grätzel cells. In the case of Grätzel cells, however, the dye and semiconductor are very close to each other, they are almost blended. As a result, the excitons do not need to move that far. One disadvantage of this type of cell, however, is the complicated method of charge transport. For this reason, Huijser chose to adopt a different approach and use this simple dual-layer system of dye and semiconductor."

      "text": "A team of scientists at the University of Cambridge has found a production method that could lead to cheaper LEDs within a few years.\n\nLED lights are a technology that most EcoGeeks are hoping to see in widespread distribution. LED lights can be even more efficient than compact fluorescent lights, and they don't contain mercury like CFLs do. LEDs also have a much longer lifespan, and can operate for 10 times longer than fluorescents and 100 times longer than incandescents. They're just still a little expensive, up to $100 / bulb.\n\nOne problem with producing LEDs is that the substrate typically used for LEDs is sapphire, rather than silicon, which can be used for many other semiconductors. Many LEDs are made from gallium nitride which is grown into crystals at a temperature of around 1000 C (1832 degrees F). Unlike other electronic components, which can be fabricated on a silicon base, gallium nitride shrinks faster than silicon when it cools, which leads to cracking and failure. Sapphire has a rate of shrinkage and cooling that closely matches the LED compounds, which makes it a suitable substrate.\n\nThe University of Cambridge team's development is a method to make LEDs incorporating aluminum gallium nitride, which shrinks much more slowly as it cools, and allows the production of LEDs on silicon wafers like other components. \"A 15-centimetre silicon wafer costs just $15 and can accommodate 150,000 LEDs making the cost per unit tiny.\"\n\nWith the commercialization of this process, inexpensive LEDs may become available, and a superior alternative for lighting can help save billions of kilowatt hours of electrical demand.\n\nWoo The only complaint I have of this news is the \"within a few years\" part (as apposed to months, or even weeks). Hopefully this cheaper technique will still be usable in future even-more efficient LEDs, although I don't think it'll have any impact on OLED prices (which I though would end up overtaking conventional LEDs in both efficiency and price, but that doesn't seem to have happend yet).\n\n+0\n\n:3 Yay! written by Gab,\nJanuary 31, 2009\n\nI'm excited that LED lights will be cheaper. At least we know that in a couple of years we will have more efficient lights.\n\n+0\n\nEnergy Efficiency Engineer written by Tim,\nJanuary 31, 2009\n\nIs it just me or does no one care about the efficacy (Lumens per watt) of these lights? No where in this article is there mention of the efficiency of the lights in terms of Output per Watt!\n\nI get that LEDs are sexy, you can change the color temperature with easy, they last many times longer than flourescents, and don't have funky ballast issues with dimmers but lets not get carried away -- flourescents are still a big key in reducing our energy use.\n\n+1\n\nLumens Per Watt Solved written by Tattooedgeek,\nFebruary 01, 2009\n\nBecause of the improved cost efficiency they will be able to increase the the number of LEDs in a bulb. Doubling the LEDs in a bulb would effectively double the wattage, lumens, etc. solving the low output issue. We are left with a more energy efficient bulb that last ten times longer than CFLs, no environmental worries, comparable lumen's, and comparable price. LEDs win hands down.\n\n+0\n\n@tim written by Clinch,\nFebruary 01, 2009\n\nI think they're just normal avalible (or soon to be avalible) LEDs, but just much cheaper, so will have the efficiency of whatevery the current top LED bulbs have (the NewScientist article say three times more efficient than CFLs, but then that's still relitive depending on how good the best CLFs are).\n\nSecurity application and offices. Bye bye incans and flouro. I am very excited about LED advances. We are already planning to use them in our new business.\n\n+0\n\nGood news if reliability and lighting is written by Robin Green,\nFebruary 03, 2009\n\nThis is good news, I hope it helps make LEDs more viable, but there are still issues with reliability and quality of the light from LEDs that need to be resolved before LEDs really take off.\n\nMany of the bulbs on the market today (some available for substantially less than the price quoted in the post) have quality problems and are prone to failure far sooner than the 35,000 to 200,000 hour touted lifetime. Also remember that LEDs dim over time, so while a light may last 100,000 hours, it's not going to give full light output for those 100,000 hours. And since the light emitted by LED bulbs is quite weak even when they're new (with typical claims of 'equivalent to a 50 watt incandescent' often grossly exaggerated), you'll be starting with something dim, and watching it get dimmer with age.\n\nI'm happy to wait - for this new production method to be commercialized, and for the quality and light problems of current LEDs to be solved.\n\n+0\n\nLEDs cheaper already? written by Joan K,\nFebruary 11, 2009\n\nI replaced my Christmas lights with LEDs over the last 3 years by purchasing in post Chrismas sales. Each year the LEDs were cheaper. I recently bought a string of patio lights with solar charger at Target for $9--not on sale but very reasonable already.\n\nWe have CFLs but would like to replace all of those with LEDs when they are finished--probably in 4 years.\n\n+0\n\nre: Geat News written by Steve Bergman,\nFebruary 11, 2009\n\nWith even cheaper LEDs, chances are good that the technology can gain an even better foothold in the market,\n\nWith \"even\" cheaper LEDs? You mean, like even less than $80 for a 50W equivalent that shines more like a flashlight than a real light bulb?\n\nEven better foothold in the market? You mean even better than the nothing they have right now?\n\nLed's are moving quite fast. There are some great led chips being manufactured but there aren't many products being produced with them and they are still quite expensive.Led Downlights that are less than 6W are a waste of time and the quality that i've seen is shocking. There are some local designers/manufacturers that look promising and the prices are slowly falling."

      "text": "AIKEN, S.C. (October 12, 2009) – Last week, the U.S. Department of Energy announced $87 million in funding to support solar energy technologies (see attached PDF). Of local interest, a Savannah River National Laboratory project, led by Dr. Elise B. Fox in collaboration with SRNL researchers Ann Visser, Nick Bridges, and Josh Gray, was selected for one of these awards. Solar energy is separated into two distinct branches: photovoltaics and solar concentrators. This work was selected to support the development of concentrating solar power (CSP). CSP technology captures the energy of the sun through thermal heat collection and transfer. They operate by concentrating solar radiation onto a receiver tube, which is filled with a heat transfer fluid. The heat transfer fluid absorbs the radiant heat, which is used to create steam at the power turbines. The operational efficiency is limited by the heat transfer fluid's properties.\n\nSRNL, in collaboration with its partners the University of Notre Dame and the University of South Carolina, will focus on the evaluation of nanoparticle enhanced ionic liquids, or NEILs, as heat transfer fluids for the advancement of solar thermal energy. Ionic liquids are low temperature organic molten salts. This work will lead to the development of high temperature heat transfer fluids which will increase the energy and cost efficiency of concentrating solar power plants through increased operation temperatures. If successful, this could result in a 10% - 40% improvement in thermal conductivity.\n\nAbout this project, Dr. Fox says, \"The investigation of NEILs incorporates the use of green chemistry and the rapidly growing field of nanotechnology to develop new materials to support solar energy. Current CSP technology is limited due to the temperature limitation of the current heat transfer fluids. These new materials will help increase the temperature at which CSP can work, which increases the process efficiency.\"\n\nThe Laboratory award is part of the $117.6 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding allocated for specific activities within DOE's Solar Energy Technologies Program nationwide, announced in May 2009."

If their work pans out, thin films woven with a thyme derivative that can kill E. coli could line bags of fresh spinach. As shoppers demand safer food, they're also demanding healthier food made with ingredients they can pronounce. \"We're working on consumer-friendly antimicrobials, so people will read the package label and not freak out,\" said Mark Daeschel, a professor of food science at OSU, who teamed up with the food scientist Yanyun Zhao to engineer an\nedible film made from a fiber found in crab and shrimp shells.\n\nEnvision an economical and simple wastewater treatment system that provides both clean water and generates electricity for people in countries with limited access to both.\nSuch a system is possible thanks to revolutionary research by OSU biological and ecological engineering professor Hong Liu and her colleagues. Liu's team specializes in microbial fuel cells (MFCs), devices that convert biodegradable materials, such as pollutants in wastewater, into electricity using bacteria. As the bacteria consume the pollutants, they shed excess electrons, which flow through a circuit and generate electricity. In the process, pollutants are broken down, resulting in clean water.\n\nKaichang Li, the Oregon State University professor who invented a non-toxic\nadhesive for production of wood composite panels, has been recognized\nwith a 2007 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award.\n\nChanging a baby's diaper is one of the least inspiring activities imaginable. However, when Hong Liu changes her 1-year-old son, Joshua, she finds herself imagining a cleaner, brighter future, in which biological waste becomes a source of electricity for houses and hydrogen for cars. Rinsing out a diaper (and flushing gallons of water to a distant treatment plant) or tossing out a disposable (and shipping it to a landfill), Liu thinks about a different kind of waste, about the inefficient use of resources. \"I think about all this wastefulness,\" she says. \"It is my hope that we can make use of biological waste, collect energy from it, and not send it to some central place for disposal.\"\nFor Liu, extracting energy from wastewater is no pipe dream. She is developing a microbial fuel cell as a way of harnessing electricity from wastewater.\n\nOSU wood science professor Kaichang Li combined an exotic form of an amino acid - used by mussels to\nstick to rocks - with soy flour to make a new, high-strength adhesive.\nThe new glue helps in manufacturing natural-looking plywood without\ncancer-causing chemicals such as formaldehyde.\n\nWhat do you get when you cross an egg white with a crabshell? You get a thin film that prevents food from spoiling and can be eaten along with the food that it wraps. No joke. It can even be fortified with vitamins and minerals so the food and the film together make a more nutritious fare.\nThis super packaging is the latest technology from OSU's Department of Food Science and Technology. The film combines two key ingredients: a fiber from shellfish (chitosan) and a protein from egg whites (lysozyme). Its discovery combines the ingenuity of two OSU researchers: Yanyun Zhao, a food technologist and specialist in value-added products, and Mark Daeschel, a microbiologist and specialist in food safety.\n\nMany of researcher Lia Danelishvili's American counterparts only know her native Georgia as a country because the recent conflict with Russia made news here. For the rest, the mention of Georgia conjures up the American state of Georgia, a place she has never been. On Monday, Danelishvili presented OSU with a Georgian flag to hang along with the others displayed in the Memorial Union concourse. The flag will be the 128th national emblem placed there."

Michael Kasser Professor of Chemical Engineering. By contrast, the process Gleason's team uses decomposes organic vapors over wires heated to 300 C, but the silicon itself never goes above 20 C room temperature. Heating those wires requires much less power than illuminating an ordinary light bulb, so the energy costs of the process are quite low.\n\nConventional silicon-nitride passivation \"is one of the more expensive parts, and one of the more finicky parts, in the processing\" of silicon for solar cells and other uses, says Buonassisi, an associate professor of mechanical engineering, \"so replacing part of silicon nitride's functionality with a simplified, robust organic layer has the potential to be a big win.\"\n\nEssential process\n\nPassivation is essential: Without it, silicon's surface is oxidized as soon as it's exposed to air, impeding its performance as a solar cell. \"It would oxidize within minutes,\" Yang says.

New Scientisthas an article today called \"Work light twice as hard to make cheap solar cells,\" that mentions how far solar has come:\n\nIn 1961, semiconductor pioneers William Shockley and Hans Queisser showed that [several] factors limited single solar cells to converting no more than 31 per cent of incident solar energy to electrical energy. But around a decade ago Martin Green of the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, challenged that orthodoxy. He suggested the third generation of solar cells could break the 31 per cent barrier.\n\nTheir research shows that light ricocheting around inside the polymer film of a solar cell behaves differently when the film is ultra thin. A film that's nanoscale-thin and has been roughed up a bit can absorb more than 10 times the energy predicted by conventional theory.\n\nAnother new solar technology published this week—buckyballs. From the press release:And existing solar cell technology is getting smarter. One of the problems with solar power is that cloud cover can make the intake inconsistent. But new technology will allow solar panels to track cloud movement. Researchers at UC Merced received a grant to make this technology a reality. From the New York Times:\n\nThe grant, announced earlier this year, will be used to develop a network of sensors to collect data on solar irradiance and to track cloud cover, water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, all of which can affect the amount of sunlight reaching solar cells.\n\nEven small scale wind power made the news this week. A small, ancient town in Italy has four wind turbines—enough to power their village and sell off the surplus to fund community rebuilding projects.\n\nFrom the small to the huge: a space-based solar sail, that combines wind and solar, from Discovery News:\n\nUsing a massive 8,400-kilometer-wide (5,220-mile-wide) solar sail to harvest the power in solar wind, the team hopes their concept could generate 1 billion billion gigawatts of power, far more power than humanity needs -- if they can get that power back to Earth."

It can generate electricity from sunlight, artificial light and low light. \"The system helps mitigate electrical 'road-blocks,' which restrict the flow of electrons with regions of high resistance, by creating a kind of low-resistance 'highway' for electron transport,\" says John Conklin, president and CEO of New Energy Technologies, Inc. What's more, a fully optimized conductive system will be able to prevent resistive losses and improve reliability by providing a stable network of connections among each of the interconnected solar cells on the see-through glass.\n\nThe ability to transport electricity on glass windows while remaining see-through could represent a significant advancement for building-integrated photovoltaics—or BIPV—on a large commercial scale. According to the company's information, their conductive grid is virtually invisible when viewing objects through the electricity-generating glass. The invisible wiring system allows for more efficient collection and transport of electrons, both important for improving circuit current and overall efficiency.\n\nNew Energy is currently working on optimizing the visible light transmission—or VLT—of SolarWindow. The goal is to mimic the aesthetic look of popular clear to light window tints and films, which typically allow 40 - 80% of the visible light through the windows. However, SolarWindow prototypes are not yet installed in the field for performance testing. The team's current priorities include \"the development of additional patent protection, improved manufacturability, increased power production, advanced power output modeling and attracting management-level talent able to help advance our breakthrough technology from the research-bench to commercial market,\" Conklin says.\n\nBecause New Energy's electricity-generating coatings and SolarWindow are subject to patent filings, the company is not disclosing the structure or names of the polymer's used other than that the \"electricity-generating liquid coatings can be sprayed onto glass or applied using other inexpensive methods without high-temperature or pressure\" and that \"the technology is related to Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) Cell technology, according to Conklin.\n\nNew Energy reports that at a recent demonstration event at NREL, SolarWindow technology outperformed conventional commercial solar and thin-films by as much as 10-fold under low-intensity irradiance. Conklin says, \"These data were obtained from Laboratory performance measurements for prototypes to evaluate low light conditions, and electrical voltage and current performance.\" The technology is at the early development stages, and although Conklin wasn't willing to speculate on electrical power information yet, he did say, \"Common opaque solar cells are being mass produced with over 20% efficiencies, with 3-11% common on many gadgets. Efficiencies of any new solar tech would be expected to increase over time.\""

In this way people can 'see' the energy produced by the table as seen in this video:</p>\n<p><!--[embed youtube Tw7JcOHNZlp><strong>How much energy is produced by the Moss Table?</strong><br/>\nCurrently the table can produce about 520 Joules (J) of energy per day. A typical laptop requires about 25J per second, so in a day the table would produce enough energy to power a laptop for just 20 seconds!</p>\n<p><strong>How does the Moss Table work?</strong><br/>\nPhotosynthesis is a process by which plants and algae convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into organic compounds using energy from sunlight. The plants use these organic compounds (like carbohydrates, proteins and lipids) to grow. When the moss photosynthesises it releases some of these organic compounds into the soil, which contains bacteria. The bacteria break down these organic compounds, which they need to survive, liberating by-products that include electrons. These electrons are captured by conductive fibres inside the Moss Table and put to use. In this way the devices harness energy which would otherwise be wasted. This is achieved using an array of 112 'moss pots', which are bio-electrochemical devices. This means that they convert chemical energy into electrical energy using biological material. Each one generates a potential of about 0.4-0.6 volts (V) and a current of 5-10 microamps (µA).</p>\n<p>Authorship of the table to Designers <a href=\" Driver</a> and <a href=\" Peralta</a>, together with scientist <a href=\" Bombelli</a>, all of them from <a href=\" University</a>.</p>\n<p>You can see related BPV designs on <a href=\" Peleteiro Eden, human errorBio-architectural constructions out of moss and seeds<p><a href=\" Kudla's</a> project based on the formation of a living and growing biological material via its collaboration with an engineering mechanism.</p><p>This system uses a computer controlled four-axis positioning table to \"print\" intricate bio-architectural constructions out of moss and seeds.

At least it was for student-teacher duo, Niruttam Kumar Singh and Harvansh Yadav from the village Gangagarh in district Bulandshaher of Uttar Pradesh, India.Gangagarh gets power for barely five hours every day making people's life miserable. Students can't study, farms can't be irrigated and women face difficulties in doing their chores and gadgets like radio and television don't work. Three years ago the teacher Harvansh Yadav and the student Niruttam Kumar decided to do something about it. They knew that cow dung produces bio-gas and bio-gas, electricity.They took cow-dung in a plastic container and placed two discharged old batteries in it.They charged the cow-dung with salt water. The positive and negative charges thus produced were collected in the batteries. The batteries, interconnected in series, successfully produced electric current. The duo was thrilled.The people of village Gangagarh, at first curious and skeptical were soon convinced. They became happy when they saw that with this simple innovation they could light bulbs, listen to the radio and even charge mobile phones. Each unit of this innovation produces 1.5 volts of electricity. The cow-dung can last for about 45 days after which it needs to be changed. If more efficiency is required, one can use sulphuric acid in place of the salt-water.However, the invention of these two rural scientists is not complete because cow-dung stinks and they prefer to get electricity without a fowl smell. They are trying to improve the design. May be by using cow-urine. About 250 households in Gangagarh and several more in neighbouring villages of Kamonah, Jinamai and Rasoolgarh have started using this device and the Gujarat University is planning to use it to put a mobile phone charging unit in its campus."

Taking forward the research, a team of scientists at the University of East Anglia has found that marine bacteria called Shewanella Oneidensis, have proteins that can produce an electric current by simply touching the mineral surface.\n\nWhile producing hydrogen by simply using solar energy and water seem to be the holy grail of clean energy, actually the process isn't as simple as the one you might have tried out in your chemistry lab. Producing large quantities of hydrogen, while making use of minimum amount of electricity uses catalysts, which are usually, made using expensive and rare-earth metals, driving up the cost of hydrogen hence produced. As a solution, two chemistry professors from the University of Calgary have created a new method of water-splitting catalysts using abundant metals.\n\nVirginia-based energy company, Dominion has teamed up with FuelCell Energy to develop the largest fuel cell power plant in North America. The environmentally friendly power plant will be built in Connecticut and will use a clean process to transform natural gas into electricity. Once operational, the plant will produce 14.9MW of clean power, enough to provide electricity to 15,000 urban homes.\n\nWhile there is no dearth of engineers who are planning to build some of the fastest and the most energy efficient trains in the world, a team of researchers from University of Birmingham in UK are working to develop a hydrogen fuel cell powered train that is entirely zero emission. Though, the first iteration developed won't win any awards on the design or the amenities onboard, it could definitely serve as a stepping stone for a greener future of public transportation.\n\nWhile cleaning up our lawns on a sunny weekend, we often forget that conventional lawnmowers that are powered by gasoline engines produce not just noise, but a variety of greenhouse gases that pollute the environment. Moreover, gas-powered lawnmowers aren't easy to start and their maintenance cost is also very high. Industrial designer Otto Polefko has come up with a concept lawnmower that solves all the above mentioned problems.\n\nWhile the world is constantly on the hunt for clean and emission-free energy, hydrogen seems to be the perfect fuel. However, even after being the most abundant element in the universe, hydrogen doesn't exist in its pure form on our planet. Most of it is found either in water or other chemicals, requiring a kind of extractor before we can use it to generate power. Conventionally extraction procedures highly depend on fossil fuels, which reduce the eco friendly credentials of hydrogen.\n\nOne thing common with all energy generating techniques, be it renewable or conventional, is that once the source of energy or fuel runs out the reaction stops and hence the power generation also ends. We know that the basic laws governing these reactions won't allow the system to produce energy without fuel, however a new research by a team of material scientists at Harvard University have proved that energy can continue to flow even if the fuel runs out.\n\nGas powered vehicles are pollution-intensive, electric cars are slow and take hours to recharge, so one possible eco friendly solution for driving in the future is hydrogen fuel cells. However, like all upcoming technologies, hydrogen fuel cells too are marred with drawbacks such as high cost and lack of refueling infrastructure.\n\nAfter operating its data centers and HQ with a 650KW solar array and a 500KW Bloom Energy's fuel cell installation, eBay has escalated its green efforts by partnering once again with Bloom Energy to develop the largest fuel cell powered data center in the US. The new 6MW renewable data center will make it the country's largest fuel cell installation."

      "text": "Scientists from Stanford University in the US have worked out how to build a lithium-sulphur battery that doesn't require a lithium metal electrode. That, they say, will make it free from the \"serious safety issues\" that have been holding the technology back.\n\nLithium-sulphur is seen as a strong contender for the next generation of rechargeable batteries because it can support an energy density far in excess of lithium-ion technology. The upshot: batteries can be made smaller and still support a higher capacity than li-ion equivalents. They're also made from cheaper and less toxic materials.\n\nOne downside of lithium-sulphur battery design has been the construction of the battery negative electrode. Cathode designs have used lithium metal to help ensure the electrode has sufficient charge capacity. But lithium metal has a tendency to form tree-like crystal structures which can penetrate the the polymer material used to separate the battery's cathode from the positive electrode.\n\nIf that happens, the battery short-circuits and that can have literally explosive results.\n\nThe Stanford team builds on earlier work in the creation of \"mesoporous carbon\" electrodes. These are made from tiny, porous carbon rods into which liquid sulphur can be made to flow by capillary action. This key discovery ensures a very good electrical contact between carbon and sulfur, essential to make a workable lithium-sulfur battery design.\n\nHowever, instead of the troublesome lithium metal, the boffins used lithium sulphide - Li2S - which doesn't promote the formation of battery breaking crystals.\n\nThe scientists said they had achieved a discharge specific energy of 630Wh/kg, 80 per cent higher than a typical lithium-ion battery can manage.\n\nBut problems remain. The biggest hurdle is the low charge-recharge cycle count: after five discharge and recharge cycles, the Stanford battery's capacity has fallen by two-thirds. After between 40 and 50 cycles, the battery stops holding any charge at all. ®\n\nWill it work in other countries?\n\nHowever, the IUPAC name is Sulfur\n\nWhich just goes to show that our transatlantic cousins have more influence over such matters than they should.

For any other facing windows the efficiency would drop radically to under 1%. This is going to be limited to large office buildings where a clear view is not a priority. For most homeowners, with all of their Southern facing windows converted, the power generated might run the refrigerator.\n\n\"Princeton researchers have found a simple and economical way to nearly triple the efficiency of organic solar cells.....\n\"The researchers, led by electrical engineer Stephen Chou, were able to increase the efficiency of the solar cells 175 percent by using a nanostructured \"sandwich\" of metal and plastic that collects and traps light....\n\"Chou...said the research team used nanotechnology to overcome two primary challenges that cause solar cells to lose energy: light reflecting from the cell, and the inability to fully capture light that enters the cell.\""

Graphene is an atom-thick sheet of carbon. The researchers grew the graphene films on copper and nickel foils by quickly heating them in a furnace in the presence of controlled amounts of argon, hydrogen and methane gases. The team has been able to create these films in less than 30 minutes.\n\nThe research is significant because the researchers created these graphene sheets by quickly heating and cooling the copper and nickel substrates at atmospheric pressures, meaning that scientists no longer need a vacuum to create few-layer-thick graphene films and can save energy, time and cost, Singh said.\n\nThe researchers used these graphene films to create the negative electrode of a lithium-ion cell and then studied the charge and discharge characteristics of this rechargeable battery. They found the graphene films grown on copper did not cycle the lithium ions and the battery capacity was negligible. But graphene grown on nickel showed improved performance because it was able to store and release lithium ions more efficiently.\n\nIn a second research project, the researchers created tungsten disulfide nanosheets that were approximately 10 layers thick. Starting with bulk tungsten disulfide powder -- which is a type of dry lubricant used in the automotive industry -- the team was able to separate atomic layer thick sheets of tungsten disulfide in a strong acid solution. This simple method made it possible to produce sheets in large quantities. Much like graphene, tungsten disulfide also has a layered atomic structure, but the individual layers are three atoms thick.\n\nThe researchers found that these acid-treated tungsten disulfide sheets could also store and release lithium ions but in a different way. The lithium is stored through a conversion reaction in which tungsten disulfide dissociates to form tungsten and lithium sulfide as the cell is discharged. Unlike graphene, this reaction involves the transfer of at least two electrons per tungsten atom. This is important because researchers have long disregarded such compounds as battery anodes because of the difficulty associated with adding lithium to these materials, Singh said. It is only recently that the conversion reaction-based battery anodes have gained popularity.\n\nBoth projects are important because they can help scientists create nanomaterials in a cost-effective way. While many studies have focused on making graphene using low-pressure chemical processes, little research has been tried using rapid heating and cooling at atmospheric pressures, Singh said. Similarly, large quantities of single-layer and multiple-layer thick sheets of tungsten disulfide are needed for other"

The other \"selling\" factor mentioned by Sadoway is non-linear addition or subtraction of power does not need any regulation -- essentially there is no catastrophic modes in the system.

      "text": "In the never ending search to squeeze energy savings out of old technology, in this case the internal combustion engine, researchers working with Takunori Taira at the Japanese National Institute of Natural Sciences have developed what appears to be a production capable laser sparkplug. Let's unpack the last four words: Sparkplug – those are the ceramic gizmos in vehicle engines that ignite the fuel (the 'internal combustion'); they're critical to the timing of the engine and the efficiency of burning the fuel. Laser sparkplug – conventional sparkplugs make their spark with electricity, a sudden flash that ignites the fuel; a laser sparkplug uses the heat of focused laser light to make the ignition. Production capable – laser sparkplugs are not a new idea, but the difficulty has always been making a version that is reliable, durable, and inexpensive.\n\nFirst, here are the good points for laser sparkplugs:\n\n- They have no electrodes to corrode (the usual reason conventional sparkplugs fail).\n- Lasers can focus the light within the piston cylinder (not at the top like conventional plugs) for more even ignition.\n- Laser sparkplugs are faster, causing ignition within nanoseconds compared to milliseconds for standard plugs.\n- By a combination of the above and the ability to use more precise timing, laser sparkplugs could make the burning of fuels in piston-driven engines more efficient (with estimates in the 10-15% range).\n\nThe difficulties with laser sparkplugs, however, are substantial. The most difficult to overcome has been size. Lasers with enough energy to fire standard fuels (gasoline) were big, difficult to manufacture and unstable. The research team addressed this problem by constructing a laser device from ceramic powders. The ceramic device can withstand the heat of the engine, while providing a 'tunable' laser. Technically this was accomplished by building the laser with two yttrium-aluminum-gallium (YAG) segments, one doped with neodymium, the other with chromium. Note the use of the relatively obscure elements. The bonded segments form a laser 9 millimeters wide and 11 millimeters long (e.g. about a half-inch).\n\nBecause the laser sparkplug has relatively low power, it must cycle its beam very quickly to build up ignition temperature. The way around this was to cycle the beam in 800 picosecond pulses, and to use dual beams (with a three beam version in the works).\n\nIf you think this sounds a might complicated, you could be right. The crucial test, as ever, will be to make a version that is reliable, durable, and inexpensive – that is, can it be manufactured at a commercial scale. For the laser sparkplug this is still an open question, however, the research team is working with a major sparkplug manufacturer (unnamed) and a member company of the Toyota Group. This is called industry buy-in, and it speaks well for the prospects of the laser sparkplug. The question may be: Can commercial viability of a laser sparkplug be achieved before alternative energy engines (as in hybrid or electric) replace internal combustion engines?\n\nOne Comment\n\nOther people's , and its patent for plasma ignition does not know. Consider that the solution of ignition is better plasma or laser??\n\nThe FireStorm Plasma iPlug is a new entry in the formerly mundane area of Spark Plugs. All Spark Plugs produce \"sparks\" to ignite the Air Fuel Mixture in the combustion Chambers. FireStorm is different, it produces \"PLASMA\". By doing that, it eliminates the Catalytic Converter and EGR Systems and can still pass future emission requirements in California.\n\nFurther testing after that clip was shot in Detroit proved a 70% savings in fuel all while affording a 125 More Horsepower.\nIt is a Paradigm Shift in Air Fuel Ratio as this plug operates at 30 to 1 Air to Fuel Ratio. All current IC engines operate at 14.7 to 1 and require a Cat and EGR.\n\nFireStorm can even crack water right in the Combustion_Chamber thereby eliminating so-called HHO Generators. Can I hear fill your car up at the side of your house with the garden hose? YES!!!!"

      "text": "Carbon Nanotubes\nBy stretching a carbon nanotube between two electrodes and adding some biotech wizardry, researchers have created a transistor that turns the body's chemical energy into electricity. St Stev via Flickr\n\nResearchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab have taken a big step toward bridging the gap between mind and machine. Using ATP – adenosine triphosphate, the molecular medium of energy exchange present in nearly all living cells – the team has created a novel transistor that could allow electronic devices that can be hooked directly into the nervous system.\n\nThe transistor, which creator Aleksandr Noy calls the first integrated bioelectronic system, consists of a carbon nanotube stretched between two electrodes that is wrapped in an insulator at both ends but exposed in the middle. The transistor is then wrapped in a lipid bi-layer akin to those that surround the cells that make up our bodies. When the team applied voltage to the electrodes and poured a solution full of ATP and potassium and sodium ions over the transistor, current flowed from electrode to electrode.\n\nTags\n\nThe magic is in the lipid bi-layer, which contains an ATP-sensitive protein that serves as a kind of ion pump when ATP is present. The lipid hydrolyses ATP molecules, with each occurence causing three sodium ions to move one way through the lipid and two potassium ions to move the other way, netting one charge across the bi-layer to the nanotube.\n\nThis means the higher the ATP concentration, the stronger the current flows through the transistor. When the ATP concentration is reduced, ions move back through the membrane and the current is reduced. It all adds up to a way to use biological chemical energy to create electricity from the movement of ions in the body.\n\nAs for applications, the researchers think they've just scratched the surface when it comes to creating integrated bioelectric systems in which machines and living beings communicate in a more seamless way. It could lead to electronics that live permanently within the body without needing batteries or outside power supplies to operate. More importantly, it could lead to the Holy Grail of prosthetic research: mechanical devices that can be wired seamlessly to our brains.\n\nFinally! I've been saying for years that to make bioelectronics a feasible industry, they need to be able to run on ATP (running on the same power as the body means as long as the person's alive, so is the electronic device; no recharging required). And they've finally figured out how to do it!\n\nAs a biomedical engineering major, you can't possibly understand how excited I am for this tech.\n\nUnfortunately, there's a drawback to reading PopSci. The things presented here are cutting-edge, so new that they've just been invented in the labs. That means it'll still be another 15 to 20 years minimum before anything exciting listed in PopSci actually becomes consumer-grade.\n\nWow, this, coupled with some of the amazing new prosthetics they've been building lately could finally mean fully functional replacements for amputees or even the sensory impaired. Not only that, the new ones could eventually become even more powerful (both in terms of strength and functionality) than our original limbs.\n\nProsthetics would be cool, but I'm seeing this as a permanent/mobile power supply for the future of computing. Imagine not having to carry around a portable laptop or be tethered to a powerful desktop. Instead, just press an embedded sensor on the back of your hand to turn on your neural-linked hardware and literally work on the go. We keep seeing all of these great articles about memristors and quantum computers so it's only a matter of time before we have plausibly small hardware that can be comfortably, safely and conveniently implanted or attached. Now we need to get rid of physical computer monitors and jack into our own visual pathways to either interpose or superimpose what we need to see while still being aware of our surroundings on some level. Or maybe not. We already turn into slack-jawed zombies watching TV or our computer screens so the visual link could even offer different viewing modes ranging from transparent overlaid graphics all the way to opaque 360 degree virtual reality.\n\n@ HazMatt\nGood point. Or we could just wait for the Borg to do all this for us.\n\ni think that if this did move in a ghost in the shellish way that i would both love and willingly sacrifice my body to this tech. also it reminds me a little of serial experiments lain accessing the wired without a device(at least not as they are now defined.XD\nbut on the other end this would have great implications in medical technologys and if there was a way for this to be used in conjuncture with \nthen i feal that it would be possible to create true biological replacements for body parts.\nin closing i would like to say i would love to be one of the first to go in for a full body replacement if it did go in a ghost in the shell way XP\n\n\"And what if someone hacks your body and makes you do criminal acts like in ghost in shell. \"\n\nThen that would be unfortunate. But you have to note that there are things they got wrong in that show. Firewalls and protection are there, but they can be surpassed. A little to easily if you ask me. So I think the protections we'll have in the future will be more advanced than anything they had in that show. But even if the possibility of being hacked remains in some way, I would consider it a risk well worth the cost.\n\nReally its an easy decision for me. On the one hand you could have a cybernetic body that would be practically ageless, and could have other capabilities beyond that of a normal body. The other choice is remain with the body I have now, which is more fragile, and ages. Like I said the choice is easy, for me at least.\n\nHave you seen hackers now they can hack a new devises or software in week or two like the ipad which was hacked in 24 hours of release or close to that in the future do you want give all you money away join a gang or blow up a plane and this should only be used in medical problems.\n\nits a great step forward. The possibilities are endless. Applications for prostetics being the most promising. Hazardous conditions work can be changed forever, with mind controlled drones. How much faster can a programer work, with a direct brain interface, with wireless capapbility. On the flip side of things Of course its hard enough to get people off there cell phones, and work, or even drive competently. Better yet, put the damn thing away and have a normal conversation. With out the damn things being able to be implanted in there"

      "text": "Hydrogen transportation: stepping on the gas\n\nThe challenge\n\nRising petrol prices has reinvigorated the alternative energy debate. Biofuels such as ethanol are one option, but another alternative being promoted is hydrogen.\n\nUntil now, hydrogen's use as an energy source has been minimal, because fossil fuels have been so readily available and hydrogen generation has been comparatively expensive and inefficient.\n\nWhile the idea of fuelling your car with hydrogen might sound like science fiction, researchers say concepts such as the hydrogen economy are real possibilities.\n\nA CSIRO solution\n\nAs part of the Energy Transformed Flagship research program, CSIRO has developed a device the size of a small, domestic microwave oven to extract enough hydrogen per day, from water, to power a family car for up to 150 km, just using:\n\nhouse-hold electricity\n\na solar panel\n\na small wind turbine.\n\nThis could be a far cheaper alternative to building new hydrogen service stations and be more readily usable in a range of applications, including transport.\n\nProject leader, Dr Sukhvinder Badwal, said that although several commercial systems exist, they are not very efficient. Drawbacks of current systems include:\n\nhigh capital costs\n\nlifetime performance\n\nthe inability to handle intermittent and varying loads.\n\nHow it works\n\nElectrolysis of water produces hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen electrochemically recombines with oxygen in a fuel cell to generate power, and water is the only by-product.\n\n\"The hydrogen produced is of such high purity that it can be used directly in a fuel cell... without further purification.\"\n\nDr Sukhvinder Badwal\n\nProject Leader\n\nDr Badwal said, 'The hydrogen produced is of such high purity that it can be used directly in a fuel cell or anywhere else without further purification.'\n\n'The electrolyser responds instantaneously to applied load and is capable of accepting large load variations, making it easy to use this technology with solar or wind power. The hydrogen generated can be stored for long periods and be converted to electricity when needed.'\n\n'Hydrogen cannot, at this stage, compete economically with fossil fuels, but increasing oil prices could create a different scenario', Dr Badwal said.\n\n'By 2010, Australia could be importing 60 per cent of its crude oil. Our abundant sustainable energy sources are major drivers for a shift to the hydrogen economy.'\n\nThe project is still in the research and development stage, but, with full-scale commercialisation in sight, CSIRO is seeking a commercial partner."

      "text": "Archive for December, 2009Microscopic solar cells with the potential to bring solar power to places where no solar cell has gone before are being developed at the Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM. The tiny cells are one-tenth the thickness of traditional solar cells and can potentially be attached to flexible backings that could be mounted onto any odd-shaped object such as buildings, clothing, or even camping tents, thus bringing solar power to anyplace where the Sun shines.\n\nThe tiny cells, described as \"glitter-sized,\" are made from crystalline silicon and are expected to eventually be cheaper to make and more efficient than present photovoltaic collectors, according to a news release. They can be made in present manufacturing facilities, using far less silicon than traditional solar cells and with less waste. The cells, pictured above, measure from 0.25 to 1 mm in size (1/100 to 1/25 inch).\n\nAccording to Sandia field engineer Vipin Gupta larger installations on the roofs of houses and warehouses \"could have intelligent controls, inverters and even storage built in at the chip level.\"\n\nThinner than the thickness of a human hair, the chips perform as well as conventional cells that are ten times thicker. They use 100 times less silicon to generate the same amount of electricity, the researchers say. Because the cells are so small they are less sensitive to overhead obstructions that can cause conventional panels to turn off entirely when part of the surface is blocked from the Sun.\n\nAccording to lead investigator Greg Nielson, the \"glitter-sized\" cells could allow campers, hunters and military personnel in the field to recharge cell phones, cameras and other electronic gear just by walking around in the Sun while wearing special clothing. Other potential uses are in satellites and remote sensing installations.\n\nSolar concentrators, arrays of microscopic lenses to focus the sunlight, can be placed over the tiny cells to increase the efficiency by increasing the number of photons striking the cells. The concentrators should be cheaper to make and more efficient, again because of the small size of the cells.\n\nBecause of the large number of cells in an array, high-voltage output can be generated directly, reducing costs and taking advantage of lower losses due to electrical resistance in wiring at higher voltages.\n\nSandia Laboratories is operated by Lockheed-Martin Company for the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration.\n\nBelow are pictured three of the Sandia research team members holding micro solar arrays; from left: Murat Okandan, Greg Nielson, Jose Luis Cruz-Campa.\n\nAs applications and databases grow ever larger and more complex, computers demand more and more memory. Hard drives are reaching the limits of how much data they can hold — but a solution may be coming soon. It's all to do with the idea of 'stacking' memory chips to increase density, much as a can of Pringles can hold as much as a large bag of edible chips.\n\nAccording to a report from Arizona State University, Tempe, a team led by Dr. Michael Kozicki has developed just such a way to \"stack\" memory layers on a single chip to make high-density memory modules.\n\n\"This could lead to hard drive data storage on a chip,\" Kozicki said, \"which enables portable systems that are smaller, more rugged and able to go longer between battery charges.\"\n\nImagine the capacity of a full-sized hard drive on a tiny chip that could reside in a cell phone or other portable device. Not only may that be possible, but Kozicki says the stacked memory chips are simple and can be made using present technology and materials.\n\nKozicki is a professor of electrical engineering and director of ASU's Center for Applied Nanoionics, devoted to studying nano-scale electronics. Graduate student Sarath C. Puthen Thermadam also worked on the project.\n\nMemory cells could not previously be stacked because the individual cells could not be isolated.\n\n\"Before, if you joined several memory cells together you wouldn't be able to access one without accessing all of the others because they were all wired together,\" Kozicki explained. \"What we did was put in an access, or islolation device, that electrically splits all of them into individual cells.\"\n\nEach memory cell has a built-in diode to isolate the layer, which will \"allow us to put in as many layers as we can squeeze in there,\" Kozicki said.\n\nEach layer adds significantly more memory to the chip. For example, a chip with eight layers of memory would have nearly eight times as much capacity in the same area as a conventional single-layered chip.\n\n\"Stackable memory is thought to be the only way of reaching the densities necessary for the type of solid state memory that can compete with hard drives on cost as well as information capacity,\" he said. \"It turns out to be a ridiculously simple idea, but it works. It works better than the complicated ideas work.\"\n\nMoore's Law, which stipulates that computer power will double approximately every 18 months, seems to be in effect for some time to come.\n\nA news release from Earth Policy Institute this morning features a peek at the subject of global stability as reported in Lester Brown's new book Plan B 4.0. This is a critical issue because nations that are failing create difficulty for any response to climate change and resource depletion.\n\nI was intrigued by the list Brown presents, a ranking of the Top 20 failing states in the world as of 2008 (the 2009 list is out now, and is essentially unchanged). The table is from Foreign Policy magazine, based on statistics developed by the Fund for Peace in cooperation with the magazine. Together they each year measure the instability index of the world's nations, that is, the chances they are failing or have already failed. These are the worst-cases:\n\nThe rankings are based on 1-10 scores in 12 critical areas, with 10 being the worst. Thus, a completely failed state will score 120 points. (It's hard to imagine such a place; it would probably consist of radioactive slag.) It's no surprise to see that Somalia is No. 1 with 114.7 points. Zimbabwe is less than a point behind, followed by Sudan, Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nIt's interesting to examine some of the other failed or failing states on this list. Extremely notable, to me at least, is that coming in Nos. 6 and 7 are nations familiar to most Americans … Iraq (108.6) and Afghanistan (108.2). These scores represent 90% of \"perfect,\" and yet we must scratch our head in puzzlement at the fact that our nation and many of its allies have spent the better part of a decade in the mission of creating successful democratic societies in those very places.\n\nNow I am all in favor of peaceful democratic societies, but it's generally been proven that nearly-failed states are not usually places where they are found. Does it make sense to attempt to plant the seeds of Western civilization in such infertile soil?\n\nIraq was formerly ruled by a ruthless dictator, \"peace\" being maintained under the iron-shod boot of tyranny. As Western troops depart, will that unhappy nation continue to move in the direction of \"peaceful, Western-style democracy,\" or will it break down into bloody rivalry between Shia, Sunni and Kurdish factions? As a very nearly failed state, the latter scenario seems a more likely outcome than the emergence of a Jeffersonian Golden Age.\n\nAnd in Afghanistan, things are even worse. That benighted place has never really been a nation at all, but a ragtag collection of fiefdoms ruled over by warlords and funded by the opium trade. Even today, after years of military operations against them, the Taliban control wide areas of the region. Now that the U.S. has set its departure date for 2011, what hope is there for this failed state to suddenly thrive and grow into a peaceful member of the world's democratic nations? To demonstrate my guess about the odds of that happening, try this experiment: Place one large snowball in a microwave oven; set the controls to \"high\" and the timer for ten minutes; and hit \"cook\". Later as you mop up the floor, you'll have a good analogy of what will likely be the future in Afghanistan, a place that has been impossible to rule since the days of Alexander the Great. Namely, a huge mess.\n\nThe place is absolutely unready to take responsibility for its own governance and security. The U.S. Marines have been assigned the task of training native Afghan soldiers, and according to a recent report from The Guardian, it's a near fruitless exercise, dealing with illiterate, lazy, hash-smoking peasants who are completely ill-suited to function as modern-day soldiers.\n\nSo the outlook is dim for Afghanistan, No. 7 on the list of Top 20 Failed States. But what can we learn from some of the others?\n\nWell, there's Pakistan right there at No. 10. The world's sixth most populous nation, Pakistan is a nuclear power. How do you feel knowing that a nation that ranks 104.1 on an instability scale of 120 has nuclear bombs and missiles? Imagine how India feels, having to live right next door.\n\nPakistan isn't the only unstable nation with a large population to make the list. Bangladesh, with a score of 98.1 is the seventh most populous nation, and right behind it is Nigeria, the eighth largest by population and a score of 99.8.\n\nBut that's not all, for the Top 20 also includes North Korea, another nuclear power. Talk about instability!\n\nNow, from the Fund for Peace website, here is a graphic to give you the \"big picture\" about world instability. You might be surprised and even dismayed, may even feel chills go up and down your spine. The nations colored in red are the most seriously failed or failing. There are presently 38 of them including Iran, another dangerous and potential nuclear power with a score of 90.0.\n\nYes, the red is where the most trouble is, but notice how much of the world is covered in orange, indicating a \"warning\" stage. And as far as those nations shown in green and judged \"sustainable,\" meaning safe, there are only 13 of them, not including the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Japan and many other advanced nations. As you can see, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, along with Ireland and five Scandinavian countries including Iceland are the main \"safe\" places, along with Switzerland, Holland, Austria and Luxembourg.\n\nIn case you're wondering, here are the scores for some of the \"yellow\" countries: Germany 36.2; France 35.3; United States 34.0; United Kingdom 30.5; Japan 31.2. And the \"safest\" place of all: Norway 18.3.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the further you get from the \"center\" as indicated by this map, the safer. Central Africa, the Middle East and a few nations along the fringe of Asia are worst off, surrounded by a sea of orange. It is only when you get far away from these areas that the colors fade to yellow, and finally to green.\n\nAnd all of these nations, with perhaps only a rare exception or two, are presently meeting in Copenhagen to discuss a global plan to cooperate in mitigating CO2 emissions, no doubt the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced. What could go wrong?\n\nA $50 million federal grant has been awarded to Sapphire Energy of San Diego, CA, for a revolutionary bio-fuels plant to be built in New Mexico. The announcement was made by Energy Secretary Steven Chu, whose department issued the grant under the economic recovery program. At the same time Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced the USDA would further back the program with loan guarantees up to $54.5 million.\n\nThe company is pioneering what it calls \"green crude oil,\" created from renewable algae. The \"green crude\" will be used to make biodiesel and jet fuel. The company has already demonstrated the concept with research facilities at Las Cruces, NM and Portales, NM. The process has been demonstrated with several airliner test flights powered by fuel made by the company, and experiments are underway to prove the ability of algae-oil to be used to make gasoline.\n\nThe project will demonstrate an integrated process in which algae will be grown in ponds, then processed to remove water and extract oils. In a second stage the oils will be processed to produce fuels. Algae, pictured at left, not only grows fast (think kudzu here), but naturally contains a high percentage of oils.\n\nAccording to Sapphire CEO the project will create as many as 750 direct and indirect jobs in New Mexico during construction, and 30-40 full-time positions after the plant is opened. Construction is expected to begin next year.\n\nSapphire claims that the new energy model, which uses water, carbon dioxide and sunlight to grow the algae, will be carbon neutral and produce fuels identical to those made from fossil fuels. It does not require large inputs of water and energy, nor does it rely on agricultural crops as is the case with some other alternative fuel processes such as those used to produce ethanol from corn and biodiesel from soybeans.\n\nAlgae offers one of the best sources for bio-fuels, since it can be grown relatively cheaply in ponds or tanks in areas with lots of sunlight, even deserts as in southern New Mexico. Corn for ethanol, on the other hand, is a farm crop requiring many inputs of land, labor, chemicals and seeds. Using farm crops to replace oil is unsustainable, uneconomical, and just plain foolish.\n\nThis is not the only such program in the works. On July 15, 2009, I reported (here) a major investment by oil giant ExxonMobil in an algae energy joint venture with Synthetic Genomics, a company founded by geneticist Craig Venter. ExxonMobil was reported to be putting $600 million into the plan. BP and other companies are also jumping on the algae bandwagon, making this one of the hottest areas in alternative fuel development.\n\nAll is not roses in the risky business of alternative energy. On May 13, 2009 it was announced that GreenFuel Technologies was closing down, a victim of the credit crunch. I posted an extensive report on this company's algae fuel program on October 20, 2006 (here). GreenFuel was a joint venture between Harvard and MIT, and invested millions before falling victim to the economic troubles.\n\nAccording to an article in the British newspaper The Telegraph today (read it here), a small group of global warming deniers met in Denmark to discuss their many alternative theories about why climate change is not the fault of human beings. It's amusing to read some excerpts from the report, but first you need to know that, according to Telegraph writer Louise Gray, the group in question consisted of \"more than 50 scientists, businessmen and lobby groups.\"\n\n\"Businessmen\"? \"Lobby groups\"? Umm, well, OK, but when real scientists meet they don't include these categories among their ranks. Now on to some quotes:\n\nThe meeting was organised by Danish group Climate Sense and the lobby group Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT).\n\nCraig Rucker, Executive Director of CFACT, admitted the organisation have taken funding from Exxon Mobil in the past but pointed out that many environmental groups are also receiving funding from major corporations.\n\nUm, OK again. If Greenpeace or Save the Whales R Us and so forth receive corporate funding, then it's perfectly all right for these climate deniers to take money from the leading supporter of anti-global warming propaganda. It's only fair. (Warning: sarcasm and/or irony may exist.)\n\nThe lead scientist quoted in the article made the case that warming is simply a result of Good Old Sol, the Sun, just doing his thing, and that rising CO2 levels haven't anything to do with it. This Danish physicist, Henrik Svensmark, states that the present warming is similar to that experienced during the so-called Medieval Warming Period. Well, here's a temperature chart for the last 2000 years, from several reconstructions based on ice cores, tree rings and other evidence.\n\nWell, it doesn't look like Dr. Svensmark is quite correct, does it? Compared with the MWP, today's steady increase is considerably different, and it brought us right up out of the Little Ice Age starting around 1800 when the Industrial Revolution was first gaining momentum. (There are some experts who believe the LIA was the beginning of a new real Ice Age, and that human caused global warming reversed the cooling trend.\n\nHere's a closer look, from a graph just released a few days ago and containing three different results from actual measurements made around the world since 1850:\n\nIt is interesting to see that there was a fairly level line until about the time of WWI. After that it climbed until about 1940, dropped due to the devastation of industry during WWII, and around 1950 started to rise fairly steadily. That was the same time that the burst of industrial growth really took off. Coincidence? Dr. Svensmark seems to think so, but I suspect most of the thousands of climate scientists who were not among the \"more than 50″ scientists, businessmen and lobbyists in attendance at the alternative meeting in Denmark would question his conclusions.\n\nAlso reported at the meeting of deniers:\n\nA geologist from Australia said that ice cap melting is due to geothermal heating rather than from warmer global surface temperatures. Um, might tell that to the Arctic specialists who have observed many times the average warming in the far north. No geothermal events there, it's an ocean. And in Greenland, the melting starts on top and warm water cascades to the bottom through crevasses. Is it reasonable to think that there are all kinds of sub-Arctic and sub-Antarctic volcanoes beginning to smolder and melt the ice, and if so, why now? The ice sheets are ancient, perhaps tens of millions of years old.\n\nAnother Australian said that \"carbon dioxide from volcanoes rather than humans is driving warming as part of a natural process.\" Interesting that the eruption of Mount Pinatubo nearly 20 years ago caused a prolonged cooling, which can be seen in the graph above. According to Wikipedia, as a result of the Pinatubo blast: \"Global temperatures dropped by about 0.5 °C (0.9 °F).\" Numerous recent eruptions have also caused short-term cooling, but these events are superimposed on the continuing upward trend.\n\nThen this outburst of vented spleen:\n\nGraham Capper of Climate Sense said manmade global warming was a myth and scientists who said otherwise were lying.\n\n\"There are people who know they are lying and do it simply for money and others who think they are doing good,\" he said. \"But they not good scientists.\"\n\nDoing it for money? What, not Exxon Mobil, so who else is buying off scientists? And, if they not good scientists, why they not good? This is nothing more than frothing-at-the-mouth madness, coming from the mouth of, well whoever this guy is.\n\nFinally, the infamous Lord Monckton, described by Wikipedia as \"a British politician, business consultant, policy adviser, writer, columnist, inventor and hereditary peer,\" made the case against global warming by reference to public opinion. He was quoted as follows:\n\n\"As anybody knows who follows the opinion polls in Britain and Australia and the US, in the last few weeks and months there has been a rapid collapse in the global warming chimera so while we still have our freedom, let us speak out.\"\n\nHow like a politician, etc. to rely on opinion polls among the general public to decide scientific questions. Lord Monckton is not a scientist himself, so one wonders whether he attended the conference as a businessman or as a lobbyist. Perhaps a bit of each.\n\nAlthough it is amusing to watch the antics of the climate change deniers, it is really quite serious because their misdirection, made-up facts and propaganda has even more seriously confused the general public. And, as noted above, the opinions of the generally ignorant public are given great weight by such as politicians, decision makers and journalists who depend on them for votes, donations, audience ratings or other support.\n\nFor more commentary on this general subject, read my essay \"Science, Propaganda & Climate Change,\" published here on October 4, 2009."

He described one gram of MOFs as being about the size of four sugar tablets.\n\nWhen flattened, each gram of these improved crystals could spread over 5,000 square meters, Yaghi said.\n\n\"If I take a gram of MOF-200 and unravel it, it will cover many football fields, and that is the space you have for gases to assemble,\" Yaghi said. \"It's like magic. Forty tons of MOFs is equal to the entire surface area of California.\"\n\nIn an email exchange with Reuters, Kim said he saw many uses for these crystals.\n\n\"They can be used for the short-term storage of CO2 (carbon dioxide) or fuel gas storage. I think it is practically possible,\" said Kim, adding that hydrogen could also be stored.\n\nMOFs can be made from low-cost ingredients, such as zinc oxide, a common ingredient in sunscreen, and terephthalate, which is found in plastic soda bottles"

The mainstream scientific community believes that with the available scientific knowledge cold fusion is not achievable at this time. Those who believe and claim that they have achieved a breakthrough are usually scorned.\n\nThe scientific journals that the proponents published were largely ignored by the mainstream. This prompted them to create their own scientific community and have their own publication for their own circle to study and evaluate.\n\nFocardi stated that a nickel powder and a secret ingredient that would catalyze the reaction in order to attain cold fusion at room temperature have made his E-Cat home device a valid energy system. He performed his first experiment using this E-Cat at Bondeno warehouse. In the first part of his experiment, he submerged his prototype in a bucket full of water and placed it on a drum. While submerged in the bucket full of water, the reactor has changed its shape for many times heated the water in the bucket. Since the prototype heated the water where it was submerged, they moved his prototype in another version with running water. The energy was fascinating but it was also difficult to control and was able to sustain its heat the whole night without an external heat support. Although it had some changes, they have seen that the powder contained in the nucleus of the E-Cat hasn't changed."

Experimental and model-based assessment of these emissions forms the basis of a comprehensive assessment of economic, ecological and environmental consequences, for both present and future energy supply systems.\n\nCurrent Scientific HighlightCurrent news from ENE\n\nLithium-ion batteries are high performance energy storage devices used in many commercial electronic appliances. Certainly, they can store a large amount of energy in a relatively small volume. They have also previously been widely believed to exhibit no memory effect. That's how experts call a deviation in the working voltage of the battery, caused by incomplete charging or discharging, that can lead to only part of the stored energy being available and an inability to determine the charge level of the battery reliably. Scientists at the Paul Scherrer Institute PSI, together with colleagues from the Toyota Research Laboratories in Japan have now however discovered that a widely-used type of lithium-ion battery has a memory effect. This discovery is of particularly high relevance for advances towards using lithium-ion batteries in the electric vehicle market.

Such a panel could vastly improve the daylight cooling of buildings, cars and other structures by radiating sunlight back into the chilly vacuum of space.\n\nUsing a highly sensitive method of measurement, physicists have managed to localize defects in amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cells. Now, for the first time ever, using computer simulations, the scientists were able to determine the defects' exact locations and assign them to certain structures within the interface between the amorphous and crystalline phases.\n.\n\nScientists have shown that a single nanowire can concentrate the sunlight up to 15 times of the normal sun light intensity. The results are surprising and the potential for developing a new type of highly efficient solar cells is great.\n\nMore and more electricity is being generated from intermittent sources of power, such as solar and wind energy. Powerful electric energy storage devices are necessary to level out corresponding irregularities in the power supply. Scientists have recently made an important breakthrough with the development of a redox flow battery that reaches stack power up to 25 kW, with a cell size of 0.5 square meters. This is eight times larger than the previous A4-sized systems.\n\nEnergy is getting more and more expensive, and experts are predicting record electricity and heating prices.

The goal dates back to Melvin Calvin (1911–97), who developed our understanding of the biological carbon cycle, and who appreciated the need to establish a stable cycle for human use of energy. An artificial photosynthetic system could provide us with a sustainable form of energy for the future. This grand challenge requires chemists to solve many deep and long-standing problems. For instance, we need to understand multi-electron and multi-step catalytic events more deeply, so that we can design better catalysts for oxygen generation from water and for the reduction of carbon dioxide to fuel. We need to learn how to assemble precise multi-component nanoscale light-absorbing and charge-separation systems and to integrate these with catalysts. These systems need to be grown from abundant materials, by processes that can be scaled to vast areas, by inexpensive means."

      "text": "Self-Charging Power Cell Stores What it Generates\n\nFor most energy systems currently in use, the energy is generated in by one device and stored by another, like a solar cell and a battery. While this approach has worked well for a very long time, requiring two separate systems can increase the size and complexity of devices. Now researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have created a hybrid energy device that generates and stores electrical energy on its own.\n\nBatteries store energy by creating ions at the electrodes. At the anode the ions are negatively charged, while the cathode has positively charged ions. This charge differential makes the electrons want to flow from the anode to the cathode, as soon as there is an electrical connection. (There is also a salt bridge that connects the solutions the anode and cathode are in, to maintain equilibrium between the solutions.) In the hybrid cell the researchers made, a piezoelectric membrane creates an electric field which drives lithium ions toward the anode, to create the differential and chemically store the energy. Piezoelectric materials connect electrical and mechanical forces, so physically deforming the membrane, by stepping on it for example, will charge the cell.\n\nCurrently the hybrid cells the researchers built have a storage capacity of just 0.036 millamp-hours, which is not very much, but it can be, the researchers theorize, five times more efficient than modern methods of converting mechanical energy to chemical energy that require two devices. The researchers believe they can increase the efficiency even more though by replacing the steel shell currently used with something that absorbs less mechanical energy."

      "text": "Out of sight, but not out of power\n\nAlternative energy will have a brighter future if researchers, like Karin Hinzer, can enable solar energy technology to see more sunlight.\n\nWhen we talk about solar energy, most of us naturally think of the sunlight we can see. But a great deal of sunlight is simply invisible to us, striking the earth as electromagnetic energy at ultraviolet or infrared wavelengths. Engineers can see a broader spectrum that will improve the output of the panels we currently use to capture this energy and convert it into electricity.\n\nKarin Hinzer, associate professor at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, has been studying this prospect for more than a decade. She aban¬doned life as a physicist in the late 1990s to begin working with lasers for Nortel Networks. Hinzer eventually came to the University of Ottawa in 2007 as holder of the Canada Research Chair in Photonic Nanostructures and Integrated Devices. There, she established the SUNLab, one of the country's leading solar technology research facilities.\n\nAlong the way she has become a key member of the Photovoltaic Innovation Network, a nation-wide collaboration between industry, government and the research community created to make progress in solar power systems. While these systems have become commercially available and widely installed, Hinzer maintains that the technology remains far from realizing its full potential.\n\n\"The traditional panels that you buy are a single p-n junction,\" she explains, referring to the circuit commonly used in the semiconductor devices that drive modern electronics. \"Light comes into the semiconductor and gets absorbed. The thing is, only part of the solar spectrum gets absorbed.\"\n\nThis limitation explains why solar panels currently on the market have an efficiency of about 20%, which means that only this percentage of the energy arriving at the panel is converted into useable electricity. Hinzer's work focuses on developing a much more complex design for these panels aimed at raising their level of efficiency to as much as 40%.\n\nArrays of mirrors and lenses are installed within the panel, concentrating the amount of sunlight until it can reach up to 1,000 times the intensity of the original sunbeam. Rather than falling on a single semi¬conductor, energy from the light hits a device with three semiconducting layers. The top consists of a gallium-indium-phosphide compound to absorb ultraviolet radiation, the middle is a gallium-arsenide compound responding to the visible spectrum and the bottom is a germanium compound that is sensitive to infrared light.\n\nThe underlying principle is simple: each layer samples a different part of the spectrum, thereby increasing the total amount of electricity that is generated. However, constructing such an intricate semiconductor package—which will allow parts of the solar spectrum light to pass through its various layers—is far from simple. Hinzer and her colleagues are tackling the task with an extraordinary type of semi¬conductors called quantum dots.\n\nThese nanoscale-size crystals demonstrate the same semiconducting properties as the material from which they are \"grown.\" Moreover, those properties can now be applied to films thin enough to allow light to pass through. Depending on the material that is chosen and how its crystal structure is created, each dot can be tuned for sensitivity to specific wavelengths of light.\n\nAchieving just the right mixture of elements has been a major challenge for investigators since a quantum dot contains as few as 1,000 atoms. Nevertheless, progress is being made, and Hinzer is optimistic that this approach will continue yielding the desired improvements in efficiency.\n\nIncorporating this type of technology in low-cost concentrating systems effectively makes the system technology look very similar to traditional flat panel systems and has already earned Hinzer a Canadian Energy Innovation Award from the Ontario Centres of Excellence, an honour she shared last fall with Toronto-based company Morgan Solar Inc. The firm now markets this next generation of solar panels under the name \"Sun Simba,\" anticipating it will find widespread use in Ontario and elsewhere.\n\nThe SUNLab touts itself as Canada's only university research centre investigating the Sun Simba design. At the same time, this facility also protects the patentable intellectual property it creates as well as attracts new industry partners in other collaborative projects. Together, these activities lay the foundation for new products and businesses that could return some royalties to the University. But for Hinzer, the lab's greatest accomplishment is the talent that it nurtures.\n\n\"The best knowledge transfer to industry occurs when trained students and researchers leave the SUNLab to join emerging companies or well-established ones that are expanding in a new field,\" she says. \"These individuals bring with them advanced knowledge on theory, processes, fabrication, testing, supply chain and prospective clients. Some of them will even go on to form their own companies, often complementing an existing industry or increasing the strength of a specific sector.\"\n\nWould you like to comment on the above story, or about Research Perspectives in general?

      "text": "If UCLA researchers are correct, a new supercharger could transform both the way we power our electronics and recycle their old sources of energy. Bringing together the quick-charging qualities of a capacitor and the energy-holding capacities of a battery, graphene supercapacitors could replace the often toxic batteries we currently use to power our electronics.\n\nBatteries and capacitors are relatively similar devices, functionally speaking. Standard batteries consist of two chemicals that react with each other, separated by a barrier, and have a circuit between them; capacitors are composed of two oppositely charged metal plates, separated by an insulator, with a circuit between them. When electrons flow through the circuits of batteries and capacitors alike they provide electricity. Although capacitors can be charged very quickly, they don't hold nearly as much energy as batteries.\n\nGraphene supercapacitors would solve the energy holding problem of capacitors. Graphene conducts electricity better than any other common substance, and the one-atom thick material has more going for it than capacity: it's also thinner, lighter, and can be turned into cheaper energy-holding devices than batteries. Because it's carbon-based, it's also biodegradable. Considering the care we need to take when disposing of batteries that are often made of toxic metals, how much would it rock to be able to compost our disposable charge holders instead?\n\nExtremely flexible and stronger than steel, graphene has been notoriously difficult to work with, as the Focus Forward video describes. The researchers who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 for their work with graphene created the substance by carefully peeling graphite with scotch tape--not a method that's easy or quick to replicate. However, researchers at UCLA claim they have found a better method to craft the substance in a delightfully MacGyver-like way: by using a consumer-grade DVD drive. After pouring graphite oxide onto CDs, popping the CDs into the drive and using the drive's laser to beam light on the material, the graphite oxide deoxygenates and becomes graphene. Miles ahead of scotch tape, this DVD drive method produces the essentially two-dimensional material easily and quickly. Imagine what could be done with a machine designed to create sheets of graphene on a larger scale.\n\nGraphene supercapacitors have immense potential to revolutionize the efficiency and environmental-friendliness of our electronics. Especially after listening to the researchers discuss graphene's potential, it's difficult not to be excited for the future of this technology. Graphene supercapacitors could charge electronic devices, but further research will determine just how much these supercapacitors can charge (are electric car charging stations really a possibility?), and if and when they'll be available for consumers. In any case, here's hoping the technology can take off.\n\nFEB 21\n\nIs there anything that lasers can't do? The latest breakthrough comes from a team of researchers at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) who have developed a method for cooling semiconductor material (cadmium sulfide) with lasers. In an article published in Nature, NTU reserachers report on cooling a semiconductor from 20 degrees C (68 degrees F) to -20 degrees C (-4 degrees F) as an initial proof of concept.\n\nHeat is an unwanted side effect of most energy-using devices. In many cases, ranging from portable electronics to medical magnetic resonance imagery equipment to scientific research equipment, the need for keeping the equipment cooled is vital to continued function. At present, equipment such as MRI systems require liquid helium for cooling, but with laser cooling, the system could be made smaller and would not require the extensive cooling hardware that is currently needed.\n\nCooling gasses with lasers is a known technology, but cooling a solid has not been done previously, although the theory behind it is decades old. \"Our initial results published in Nature, have shown that it is possible to laser-cool a semiconductor to liquid nitrogen temperature, so we are aiming to reach an even lower temperature, such as that of liquid helium,\" said Prof Xiong Qihua, a member of the NTU team.\n\nOther cooling technologies for computers have been proposed which could lead to significant energy savings. But if laser cooling eventually became widely used for other applications, it would make this even more beneficial. Laser cooled equipment could be more energy efficient, and portable electronic equipment with this technology would also potentially prolong battery life.\n\nIn addition to the energy benefits, wide-scale development and application of this technology would also drastically reduce the amount of refrigerants needed in industry and technology. Many of the chemicals used in refrigeration equipment are harmful to the Earth's ozone layer or have a significant global warming potential (and many are both). Reducing the need for these chemicals would be an added benefit laser cooling might someday offer.\n\nIn collaboration with the International Energy Agency, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) recently launched a new database that brings together environmental monitoring and worldwide ocean energy development efforts. Called Tethys, the database will show the interrelationship between processes in nature and ocean power technology, and will function as a resource to help keep environmental responsibility at the forefront of ocean-based energy production projects.\n\nNamed after the Greek titaness of the ocean, Tethys will help industry regulators and energy project developers alike identify possible environmental effects of the efforts to gain sustainable, clean energy from the world's oceans. Tethys offers real-world data that accounts for the interconnectedness of oceanic ecosystems and technology, and offers insight on the interactions between energy-producing machines, marine wildlife, and the physical processes of the ocean. Having all of this data compiled together-- from tidal current turbines projects to published studies on offshore wind farms and marine mammals--will allow for a safer expansion of ocean power. According to the DOE's announcement, the database also has an accompanying report that highlights research on ways to monitor ocean energy projects and possible environmental effects.\n\nThe world's oceans offer immense potential for alternative energy development. As with any alternative energy resource, however, ocean power developers must taken into account any negative environmental impacts from the technology in order for ocean power to be a truly renewable source of energy. As a living document, Thethys will constantly increase our global understanding of the ocean as new projects and new research data arise. In order to expand Tethys's usefulness for current and future ocean power projects, the DOE encourages researchers to submit their studies to the database.\n\nYou can view an interactive map of Tethys here, and check out the technological developments in and environmental research on oceans around the world.\n\nWhile the solicitation for these new projects is currently in draft form, the DOE seeks public comment on the draft before beginning to accept applications for groundbreaking new motor vehicle technologies. Members of the public may review the draft of the solicitation on vehicle performance and fuel economy and offer thoughts on how to improve the solicitation before the final version is released. As the draft currently stands, project proposals can focus on any of five areas in which motor vehicles can become more energy efficient: advanced lightweighting and propulsion materials, advanced battery development, power electronics, advanced HVAC systems, and fuels and lubricants.\n\nThe DOE will accept comments on the draft until Friday February, 15. Those interested in commenting can find more information here, and comments on the Funding Opportunity Announcement may be submitted to the Energy Department at their designated email address. Inventors should wait until the final draft is published as an amendment to the current draft before submitting their research proposals.\n\nThe American Wind Energy Association announced that 2012 marked the wind energy industry's strongest year ever. This past year wind energy accounted for over 40 percent of new generating capacity in the United States, surpassing all other energy-producing industries in new capacity, including those dependent on fossil fuels. The wind-powered generators currently installed will reduce US carbon emissions by 1.8 percent, preventing 95.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year.\n\nAlthough faced with government policy-related challenges, including the threat of the Production Tax Credit expiration (extended at the last minute by the \"fiscal cliff package,\" the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012) the wind energy industry has much to celebrate. Rob Gramlich, AWEA Interim CEO, expressed his excitement over the industry's triumphs, stating, \"It is a real testament to American innovation and hard work that for the first time ever a renewable energy source was number one in new capacity. We are thrilled to mark this major milestone in the nation's progress toward a cleaner energy system.\"\n\nIncluding projects from 32 states and Puerto Rico, the wind energy industry installed turbines capable of generating over 13,000 MW in 2012. (2010 holds the previous record for new wind power at 10,000 MW.) Texas and California top the list of states with new capacity installations, providing 1,826 MW and 1,656 MW respectively. The collective wind power in the US reached a whopping 60,000 MW (60 gigawatts) in January, enough power to provide electricity to every home in Colorado, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, and Ohio combined - the equivalent of powering nearly 15 million homes.\n\n\"Despite a considerable amount of policy uncertainty, the US wind power sector proved to be remarkably resilient in 2012, reaching a record level of installations while global wind investment fell 13%,\" US Director of The Climate Group, Amy Davidsen said. \"But for the sector to continue... to grow, we must provide a more stable investment climate through clear, long-term policy signals.\"\n\n'Urban' SUVs (decidedly intended for city rather than off-road use) were a trend we noticed at this year's Detroit Auto Show. Several manufacturers have vehicles that could be identified as part of this segment, and it could be indicative of a new trend if these vehicles are well received by consumers.\n\nThe trend toward smaller cars that are better suited to a more city-dwelling lifestyle appears to be increasing. Small vehicles like the Fiat 500, smart, Chevy Spark, Honda Fit, Scion iQ, and others are being sold to a market for which small, nimble vehicles are desirable. While small SUV may seem to be an oxymoron like 'jumbo shrimp,' the move toward smaller, lighter vehicles helps with overall fuel economy and efficiency.\n\nNot all 'urban' SUVs will be hybrids. Honda has not announced much in the way of definite information about the Urban SUV (although it is scheduled for a 2014 North American debut), but some of the discussion about its features would indicate that it will be conventionally fueled, rather than a hybrid. But the trend toward smaller, more efficient and appropriately-scaled conventional vehicles can have as great an imapct on improving overall fleet efficiency as the flashier hybrids and EVs. It's a trend we will continue to keep an eye on.\n\nWhat if human waste, what's left after our bodies extract energy-producing nutrients from our food and drink, could itself be transformed into energy? Four African teenagers went beyond asking this question: they created a generator powered by human urine. The machine, built by 14-year-olds Duro-Aina Adebola, Akindele Abiola, Faleke Oluwatoyin, and 15-year-old Bello Eniola,was presented in Lagos, Nigeria at the fourth annual Maker Faire Africa this November. The pan-African Maker Faire features and supports inventions that work to address problems like the worldwide need for energy production.\n\nAccording to the Maker Faire Africa website, the machine turns 1 liter of urine into 6 hours of electricity and works like this: urine goes into an electrolytic cell, which extracts the hydrogen from the pee (specifically from the urea, one of the main compounds of urine). This hydrogen is purified in a water filter, and then pushed into a gas cylinder. There, the gas cylinder pushes the hydrogen into a liquid borax cylinder, where moisture is removed from the hydrogen gas. Finally, the purified hydrogen gas is pushed into the generator to power it.\n\nAs with all new inventions in alternative energy, this generator isn't a panacea for our global energy problems. NBC's John Roach offers a \"reality check\" concerning the pee-powered generator, pointing out that the Maker Faire Africa website does not list the wattage produced, so we don't know just how much the generator could power. While Roach's article tempers excitement about the pee generator, it does point to where this technology could be used effectively: wastewater treatment facilities where the pee already flows, ready to be put to use.\n\nPerhaps machines like these could eventually become features of wastewater treatment facilities. Such a resourceful new invention that turns waste into electricity could turn wastewater treatment facilities into places where wastewater is not only treated, but where pee turns into power.\n\nThe environmental focus from the past few years of car design and marketing has largely evaporated in this year's North American International Auto Show (NAIAS). Even more than last year's show, green cars are comparatively few and far between in the displays at Detroit.\n\nThis is not to say that green technology is absent from this year's show. While the cutaway vehicles that showed how hybrids work are mostly gone, the hybrids and other green vehicles are still a part of many manufacturers' lineups. For a visitor who has seen several of these shows, the increase in fuel efficiency requirements is apparent with more cars that get over 30 MPG, but it is disappointing to find that there are also still many cars with performance under 20 MPG.\n\nSome automakers that have previously had notably green cars as part of their mix in previous years have nothing highlighted in this year's show, including Volvo and Audi. And the technological angle has taken a backseat, overall, to presenting cars as part of a lifestyle. The theme park aspect of last year's show is also far less of a presence, with only a few interactive ride-style displays.\n\nFor other builders, green cars have become significantly mainstream. The Chevrolet Volt, Nissan LEAF, Toyota Prius and other green cars are simply integrated into the overall manufacturers' displays, and prominent 'eco' badging and side decal identification of green cars is largely absent. The emphasis is no longer on these cars as special offerings that are somehow significantly different from the rest of the line. They now sit as just another car in the manufacturers' range of offerings.\n\nDespite this general trend, there are some interesting new concepts being unveiled this year, as well as green technology arising in some unexpected places. We'll have more specific reports on some of these forthcoming.\n\nAnd, for the most overused graphic of the year, we'll nominate the car driving on a computer-generated ribbon that then dives and twists like a roller-coaster. Only partway through the first day of the show, and we've already seen this too many times.\n\nRecently, there have been a couple of extreme climate effects noted. Record high temperatures have made the news on two continents in the northern and southern hemispheres.\n\nIn the United States, to the surprise of no one who experienced it, 2012 was the hottest year on record by more than a degree, with hundreds of new temperature records set throughout the year. The average national temperature was a full degree higher than the previous record. A degree of temperature may not seem like much, but when talking about an average over a year, that's a huge spike. \"Normally, records are broken by a tenth of a degree or so.\"\n\nAnd, in Australia, recent temperatures have gotten so hot that the Bureau of Meteorology has had to add new colors to those it uses on its interactive weather forecasting chart. Until now, the temperature maps have gone up to 50 degrees C (122 F), but that hasn't been enough for recent high temperatures. Now, the new scale extends to 54 C (129 F)."

That's why the new device will gather the Sun's energy even at night time, when there's no visible light.\n\nProjects are being made to use the nanoantennas in cooling down entire buildings, by capturing the infrared light, which is associated with any heated object, converted to another form of energy or wave, and there we could have the buildings cooled for free, with the power of heat!\n\nThe scientists don't yet have the technical possibilities to acquire the energy that these devices produce, because their operating frequency is too high for what our technology can do. The converters between this form of energy and electricity would have to be 1000 times smaller than what we have. Anyway, someday it will be possible to do thatVery interesting article. Has anyone considered biological converters for the nano-antennae? Electro-mechanical converters 1000 times smaller than what we have at present sems a bit impossible, but plants can do this conversion using photo-synthesis. The question is how to marry the nano-antennas to the biological converters, but I am sure it can be done."

      "text": "Scientists from the Universities of Manchester and Cambridge have\ndevised a way of using graphene, the thinnest material in the world, to\ncapture and convert more light than previously, paving the way for\nadvances in high-speed internet and other optical communications. The\nteam found that by combining graphene with metallic nanostructures,\nthere was a 20-fold enhancement in the amount of light the graphene\ncould harvest and convert into electrical power.\n\nPrevious research has shown that electrical power can be generated by\nputting two closely-spaced metallic wires on top of graphene and shining\nlight on the whole structure, effectively making a simple solar cell.\nDue to the particularly high mobility and velocity of the electrons in\ngraphene, such graphene cell devices can be incredibly fast - tens or\npotentially hundreds of times faster than communication rates in the\nfastest internet cables currently in use.\n\nThe main stumbling block to practical applications has so far been the\ncell devices' low efficiency. The problem is that graphene absorbs\nlittle light - only around 3% - with the rest going through without\ncontributing to the electrical power.\n\nThe team solved this problem by combining graphene with tiny metallic\nstructures known as plasmonic nanostructures, which are specially\narranged on top of graphene. By using the plasmonic enhancement, the\nlight-harvesting performance of graphene was boosted by 20 times without\nsacrificing any of its speed, they wrote in their study.\n\nForget hydrogen: ammonia could be the answer to developing an\nemissions-free fuel for cars. Ammonia produces just nitrogen and water\nvapour when burned and, unlike hydrogen, it is relatively easy to store\nin liquid form. That means transporting ammonia will not require costly\nnew infrastructure, according to researchers at Texas Tech University.\n\nThe team are developing a system to produce ammonia that can be\ninstalled in filling stations. It first produces hydrogen from water\nusing electrolysis, then combines it with nitrogen from the air to\nproduce ammonia. To achieve this, the researchers have adapted the\nHaber-Bosch process used to make ammonia industrially. Their version\nworks on a small scale and can make ammonia fairly cheaply.\n\nApiston rapidly compresses hydrogen and nitrogen, heating the gases to\n400 °C. The mixture is fed into a chamber containing an iron oxide\ncatalyst, which sparks a reaction that further heats the gases and\ngenerates ammonia. In a third chamber, the mixture decompresses and\ncools down to room temperature. As it does so, it pushes against another\npiston, from which mechanical energy is recovered and fed back to the\ncompressor, significantly cutting the process's power consumption.\nFinally, a heat pump cools the mixture down to around -75 °C, liquefying\nthe ammonia for collection.\n\nA cheap holographic microscope capable of detecting bacteria has been\ndeveloped by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles\n(UCLA). The handheld device uses a laser instead of lenses to identify\nbugs in water, food or blood, and costs less than USD 100 to build.\nImages can be uploaded to remote computers for further analysis.\nScientists hope the technology will improve healthcare in areas that\nlack sophisticated diagnostic equipment.\n\nThe device has two modes of operation: a 'transmission' mode which can\nanalyse liquids such as blood and water, and a 'reflection' mode which\nproduces holographic images of denser surfaces. In reflection mode, the\nmicroscope uses holography to create a 3D image of the sample being\nstudied. A key advantage of the design is that it employs cheap\nelectrical components instead of heavy and expensive lenses. Instead,\nthe microscope uses digital photo sensors, which can cost less than USD\n15 each to produce. The researchers claim that the microscope can help\nto monitor outbreaks of difficult-to-detect bacteria such as E. coli.\n\nThe device captures raw data, but its simple design means that\nprocessing needs to be done on an external device with more computing\npower. A user in the field can forward the image data to their mobile\nphone, a laptop PC, or even upload it to an internet server. The team\nbelieve the microscope could prove invaluable for medics working in\ndeveloping countries.\n\nA potentially cheaper and faster method for diagnosing tuberculosis (TB)\nhas been developed by researchers at the University of Basel,\nSwitzerland, who hope to test it in Tanzania.\n\nThe lack of a cheap, quick and accurate test makes it hard to control\nthe TB epidemic, which claims millions of lives every year in developing\ncountries. Culture-based methods are the gold standard for TB tests in\nthe developing world, but these can take nearly 60 days to give a\nresult. Molecular tests, such as GeneXpert, unlike culture-based\nmethods, are fast, accurate and can detect drug-resistant strains. But\nthe high costs and need for laboratories make access an issue for\ndeveloping countries.\n\nThe new method uses a microcalorimeter to detect heat produced by\nMycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes TB, on a growth\nmedium. The study showed that detection takes 4-5 days but more\nsensitive microcalorimeters could detect tuberculosis in 24 hours.\n\nThe team are working with the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute\nto test the method at the Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania. They\nhope1 the test will be ready for use within two years although it might\ntake longer for the World Health Organization to endorse it.\n\nScientists hope to harness coral's natural defence against the sun's\nharmful ultraviolet rays to make a sunscreen pill for humans. The King's\nCollege London team visited Australia's Great Barrier Reef to uncover\nthe genetic and biochemical processes behind coral's innate gift. By\nstudying a few samples of the endangered Acropora coral they believe\nthey can synthetically replicate in the lab the key compounds\nresponsible. Tests on human skin could begin soon.\n\nThe team plan to test a lotion containing the same compounds as those\nfound in coral. To do this, they will copy the genetic code the coral\nuses to make the compounds and put it into bacteria in the lab that can\nrapidly replicate to produce large quantities of it.\n\nScientists have known for some time that coral and some algae can\nprotect themselves from the harsh UV rays in tropical climates by\nproducing their own sunscreens but, until now, they didn't know how. The\nwork could ultimately mean that people might be able to get inbuilt sun\nprotection for their skin and eyes by taking a tablet containing the\ncompounds. But for now, the team are focusing their efforts on a lotion.\n\nAnother long-term goal of the study is to look at whether the processes\ncould also be used for developing sustainable agriculture in the Third\nWorld. The natural sunscreen compounds found in coral could be used to\nproduce UV-tolerant crop plants capable of withstanding harsh tropical\nUV light.\n\nAutomated flight systems and auto-pilot features on commercial aircraft\nare causing 'automation addiction' among today's airline pilots and\nweakening their response time to mechanical failures and emergencies,\naccording to a new study by safety officials. This dangerous trend has\ncost the lives of hundreds of passengers in some 51 'loss of control'\naccidents over the past five years, the report found.\n\nThe technology behind the auto-pilot on commercial aircrafts only\nrequires pilots to do approximately three minutes of flying - during\ntake-off and landing - which has contributed heavily to the number of\n'loss of control' accidents. The new study by the Federal Aviation\nAdministration (FAA) found that in two thirds of such accidents, pilots\nhad trouble manually flying the plane, or made mistakes with automated\nflight controls. The FAA study says that pilots often 'abdicate too much\nresponsibility to automated systems'.\n\nAirlines and regulators discourage or even prohibit pilots from turning\noff the autopilot and flying planes themselves, according to the FAA\ncommittee. The situation is even worse on commuter flights, where pilots\nonly manually operate the plane for 80 seconds out of a typical two-hour\nflight. The FAA's report recommends that pilots take control of the\nairplane more often in order to keep their skills sharp - so they are\nprepared to react when the computers cannot.\n\nResearchers from the University of Geneva used lasers to create water\ndroplets in the air, in a development which could eventually lead to\nman-made weather systems. Although the technique, known as\nlaser-assisted water condensation, does not work in dry air scientists\nwere able to generate the droplets in very humid conditions over the\nRhône river in Switzerland.\n\nThe drops created - just thousandths of a millimetre across - were not\nheavy enough to fall as rain but the experts hope that by making them\nhundreds of times larger they will be able to create or prevent rainfall\nin the right conditions.\n\nThe method works by firing laser beams into the air, creating nitric\nacid particles which draw water molecules together and stop them from\nevaporating. If the process is repeated in air currents that are blowing\ntowards mountains, the researchers hope the air will cool enough that\nthe droplets grow large enough to fall as rain.\n\nAfrican innovators and inventors who design products with the potential\nto drive the continent's economic transformation may benefit from a new\nawards scheme.\n\nThe Innovation Prize for Africa, worth USD 100,000, will be given for\nthe first time in February 2012 to the best innovators in three areas:\nICT, green technologies, and health and food security. The runner-up\nwill receive USD 50,000. The prize was announced last month by the UN\nEconomic Commission for Africa (UNECA) and the African Innovation\nFoundation (AIF) based in Switzerland.\n\nThe aim of the prize is to support sustainable development by tapping\ninto the ingenuity of Africans to solve their own challenges. A\ntechnical advisory committee will set different thematic areas for the\nprize each year. The closing date for the first prize is 30 September.\n\nThe AIF hopes the prize will lead to increased commercialisation of\nresearch and development, the adoption of emerging technologies, and\naccelerated growth of the private sector in Africa.\n\nWorried about loose-tongued friends sharing your private details with\nthe world? Culling the least discreet members of your social network\nwill help you feel more secure, but it's not a perfect solution. What if\nyour best friend is an offender?\n\nPritam Gundecha at Arizona State University in Tempe has a technique for\nworking out which friends are most likely to leak private information so\nyou can remove them, if you choose. Gundecha examined the relative\nimportance of data 2 million Facebook users elect to share with the\nworld and calculated the privacy risks friends pose to each other.\n\nFor example, around 80% of users are happy to disclose their gender, but\nless than 1% share their home address. That suggests people publicising\ntheir address aren't particularly privacy-conscious and you might want\nto avoid them. Using these statistics, the researchers gave each user a\nvulnerability score and worked out which friends will cause your\nvulnerability score to go down should you unfriend them.\n\nIt turns out that unfriending the least discreet friend increases your\nsecurity by an average of more than 5% - worth it for a casual\nacquaintance, but perhaps not so easy if your best buddy is a\nblabbermouth. 'There are some friends you cannot remove, irrespective of\ntheir vulnerability,' admits Gundecha. While the existing technique\ndoesn't take this kind of social importance into account, he is now\nworking on a version that does."

      "text": "Scientists at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California announced last week that they've developed the initial technology for a battery with a lifespan of nearly 100-times that of a conventional lithium ion battery.\n\nUsing a nanoparticle of copper, copper hexacyanoferrate, the scientists developed a battery electrode that survived 40,000 cycles of charging and discharging, compared to 400 cycles for a lithium-ion electrode. Even after 40,000 charges, the battery still managed to retain 80-percent of its original charge capacity, according to Stanford.\n\nThe researchers believe their technology will provide an enormous boost to the wind and solar energy sectors, allowing far larger quantities of excess clean energy to be generated and stored for later usage than can be attained today.\n\n\"That is a breakthrough performance - a battery that will keep running for tens of thousands of cycles and never fail,\" said Yi Cui, an associate professor at Stanford who worked on the project with colleague Robert Huggins and graduate student Colin Wessells, in a release from the university.\n\nThe three authored a paper on their finding that was recently published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nThe team settled on copper hexacyanoferrate crystals because they contain an \"open framework,\" that is, large enough gaps to accomodate the flow of ions in and out without damaging the electrode. Common lithium ion batteries eventually fail after many cycles to damage to the electrode structure, which expands and contracts as lithium ions flow in and out.\n\nHowever, as the researchers themselves pointed out, they are missing one key ingredient before they can even begin building their long-living battery: An anode.\n\nEvery galvanic battery contains an electrolyte and two electrodes: a cathode and an anode.\n\nAlthough commonly represented by a positive and negative symbol, respectively, a battery's two electrodes are actually technically distinguished by their relationship to the directional flow of the battery's current. The current always flows from the cathode out of the battery and from outside, into the battery, through the anode.\n\nThe Stanford team created the electrode using copper hexacyanoferratte, but is still searching for the proper material for the anode, although they say they have several candidates in mind.\n\nOn the plus side (no pun intended), the team notes that another component of the battery, the electrolyte, is made up of an inexpensive water-based compound, compared to lithium-ion batteries, which typically rely on organic electrolytes or molten salts as electrolytes, which are more expensive and make up the majority of the cost of li-ion batteries, according to a separate analysis published recently by Carnegie Melon University.\n\nWe've reached out to Stanford for more on the team's breakthrough and will update when we receive a response."

All you need is an electrolyzer, which separates water into its two components, hydrogen and oxygen, then feeds them into a fuel cell. Electrolyzers, however, require catalysts to get the process rolling. While hydrogen production catalysts aren't much of a problem, the platinum catalysts used for oxygen production are expensive, don't last very long, and the creation of them incorporates toxic chemicals. This Monday, however, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) announced the development of a new oxygen production catalyst that is 200 times more efficient than platinum. The nickel-borate-based catalyst has been licensed to Sun Catalytix, which is hoping to be producing safe, super-efficient electrolyzers within two years.

Generally, lead sentences and paragraphs also need to be short and concise (which are not always the same thing), ergo the lead sentence we chose.\n\nReading the title of this article and the first paragraph has left me at a loss for words.\n\nIs the author commissioned by Apple to write the article? Or is it just that all journalism students are weaned on the idea that Apple provides the only technology on planet earth? There appears to be no valid reason to relate this technology to a specific manufacturer.\n\nPerhaps a more appropriate title should have been \"Wearable Fabric Could Power Your Mobile Devices\"\n\nand the first paragraph should read:\n\n\"A lightweight, flexible thermoelectric fabric called Power Felt could generate enough electricity from body heat to power a small electronic device, like an MP3 Player, or Mobile Phone.\"\n\nHaving played some with generating power from bismuth telluride modules, I have to wonder what they think \"high efficiency\" is. To me it's dismal, and the fabric will fare no better. You need high delta-T, established by high heat flux, to get any useful output. A well-heat-sinked 20W Peltier module on my stove was hard pressed to power its own cold-side muffin fan, whose draw is something like an active iPhone (tens of mA). At a much higher delta-T than a human body would produce against any tolerable ambient. You can't have high heat flux at the skin, and comfort both. Defeats the whole purpose and function of clothing.\n\nThe energy harvesting space is the new home for snake oil. Yeah, the energy you collect (over a period of hours) can power your portable device (for a period of seconds to minutes). Those bits of info never seem to escape the editing process when marketing runs the show.\n\nI don't have all the details, but there are quite a lot in the journal article I linked to in my article:\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, it's a for-pay article, although the university's PR office sent me the original, which of course I can't share. In any case, thermoelectric fabrics and materials are different from some of the other schemes I've seen, they appear to be more efficient, and this one seems to be a much more efficient energy-harvesting method. Plus, because it's wearable, it's supposed to be continuous.\n\nI re-read this article, Ann, and now I am wondering how long this material could power an iPhone. That seems like it would take a pretty fair amount of current compared to the tiny sums I've seen in energy harvesting.\n\n@Chas - I was wondering the same thing. What happens when you are not wearing anything to be powered. On top of that, with some concerns about the unknown effects of power lines and such, I wonder what the acceptance will be about having your body wrapped in a generator. Not saying I agree with those concerns, but if the questions are out there....\n\nGood question, TJ. Since the lead author on the journal article, Corey Hewitt, mentions several different uses that are exercise and sports related, he may have already thought of that. I suspect this would be much less of a problem if it's used in a jacket liner material.\n\nThe material works in the lab. I'm interested in use in the real world. Put the jacket on, head outside.\n\nHow will PowerFelt perform when the wearer perspires? When it rains?\n\nEarphone wearers who exercise frequently complain when their stereo headsets stop working because of perspiration. One would expect similar problems with anything electrical in nature in close proximity to the human body.\n\nWalt is correct. Energy is generated from a temperature differential, for example, as the story says, \"between the temperature of a jacket liner next to the body and that of a jacket exterior exposed to cold air.\" In that case, the generation of electricity would not cool down the wearer of the jacket. This is explained in more detail in the journal article. I don't recall seeing anything about static electricity, and I don't see why that would occur with this material. If it did, I suspect the material would likely make use of it.\n\nKevin, thanks for your comments. As the story points out, current high-efficiency TE fabrics like bismuth telluride are very expensive, and this particular fabric is aimed at high-volume low-power consumer apps, or medical apps like wound wraps, which those more expensive materials don't or can't address.

Therefore, devices based on this approach can be oriented in any direction without the need to worry about gravity.'\n\nThe results of the Duke University experiments were published online in the journal Applied Physical"

Colin Johnson\n\nHere is what the Journal of the American Chemical Society says about living fuel cells: The world's first \"electrified snail\" has joined the menagerie of cockroaches, rats, rabbits and other animals previously implanted with biofuel cells that generate electricity — perhaps for future spy cameras, eavesdropping microphones and other electronics — from natural sugar in their bodies. Scientists are describing how their new biofuel cell worked for months in a free-living snail in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.\n\nIn the report, Evgeny Katz and colleagues point out that many previous studies have involved \"potentially implantable\" biofuel cells. So far, however, none has produced an implanted biofuel cell in a small live animal that could generate electricity for an extended period of time without harming the animal.\n\nTo turn a living snail into a power source, the researchers made two small holes in its shell and inserted high-tech electrodes made from compressed carbon nanotubes. They coated the highly conductive material with enzymes, which foster chemical reactions in animals' bodies. Using a different enzyme on each electrode, one pulling electrons from glucose and another using those electrons to turn oxygen molecules into water, they induced an electric current. Importantly, the long-lasting enzymes could generate electricity again and again after the scientists fed and rested what they termed the \"electrified\" snail, which lived freely for several months with the implanted fuel cell"

      "text": "What if generating solar energy at home required little more than mixing some grass clippings with inexpensive chemicals? That's exactly what MIT researcher Andreas Mershinhas found to be the case. The scientist says creating a solar cell could be as easy as mixing any green organic material (grass clippings, agricultural waste) with a bag of custom chemicals and painting the mixture on a roof. Once the efficiency of Mershin's system is improved, this type of solar technology could make cheap energy available in rural places and developing countries where people don't have access to affordable energy. Read on to see a video of Mershin's findings\n\nHere at Inhabitat, we've been following biophotovoltaics — devices that generate energy from photosynthesis — and although the possibilities are limitless, most of the existing technology is very expensive and a long way from reaching the market. In a study published in Scientific Reports, Mershin and his fellow researchers have come up with a process to \"hijack\" the PS-I molecules that are responsible for photosynthesis. As Mershin explains in this video, in order to get these molecules to work for us, we must extract the protein that's at the center of photosynthesis and stabilize it so that it continues to live and operate in a solar panel.\n\nMershin and his team developed an intricate nanostructure of titanium dioxide supported by nanowires, which carry a flow of current. The system is able to convert just 0.1 percent of sun energy to electricity — over four orders of magnitude better than previous biophotovoltaic systems — but that percentage will need to be improved upon further before the technology can be useful. The breakthrough \"carries the promise of inexpensive and environmentally friendlysolar power,\" according to the study, and Mershin hopes that within a few years someone in a remote village will be able to take some grass clippings, mix them with some chemicals, and paint them on the roof to produce power."

The release of hydrogen was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Image credit: Nature, doi:10.1038/nature08969.\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- A new catalyst has been developed to generate hydrogen from water cheaply, but the research was originally intended to make molecules that behaved like magnets. Hydrogen is a clean power source currently produced from natural gas, with carbon dioxide as a by-product. Producing hydrogen from water produces oxygen as a by-product instead.\n\nConventional catalysts capable of splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen are generally too expensive or too weak to work on water effectively enough to produce hydrogen for an inexpensive fuel, but new research has developed a molybdenum catalyst that is robust and cheap enough to do the job, but still requires too much energy to be immediately useful. It does open up new possibilities for scientists to follow in the search for the perfect water-splitting catalyst.\n\nOne conventional means of splitting water into H2 and O2 is to use a platinum catalyst but the metal is far too expensive for the process to be commercially viable. Other methods use microbial enzymes called hydrogenases containing proteins using nickel and iron, but these methods are either too bulky, slow, or too inefficient to be successful on a commercial basis.\n\nThe new study by scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, aimed at combining metal atoms with organic molecular groups (called PY5) to produce molecules with the properties of bulk magnets. The researchers, led by Jeffrey Long, found that one of their molecules, a molybdenum-oxo complex, was capable of transferring electrons. This is a major requirement of water-splitting systems, so they tested its ability to split water to generate hydrogen gas and found it was highly successful.\n\nThe molybdenum compound was so successful it could work on seawater or pure water without additives. The compound is stable due to five bonds holding the molybdenum in place. Long said the molecule is stable for long periods in aqueous solutions, and they saw no degradation in catalytic activity over their three-day experiment. The molecule remains stable even when impurities, such as those found in seawater, are present. This would further reduce the cost since no organic acids or solvents are needed.\n\nThe compound's stability makes it more durable than the nickel and iron compounds used previously, but it is slower than the natural hydrogenases and needs a higher electric voltage to operate. The group is now experimenting with different metals and \"tweaking\" the PY5 groups to see if they can improve the speed and efficiency and reduce the energy requirements. They are also looking at the possibility of coupling the system to solar-generated electricity to make it even more viable.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nScientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Institute for Molecular Science in Japan are trying to mimic part of the complex natural process of photosynthesis with ...\n\nEmory University chemists have developed the most potent homogeneous catalyst known for water oxidation, considered a crucial component for generating clean hydrogen fuel using only water and sunlight.

Without having to mine nasty dirty molybdenum?\n\nBuild 100 1GW Fission plants and use either electrolysis or steam flashing to produce your \"cheap\" hydrogen. This route also allows you to recharge those battery powered cars and desalinate seawater for those idiots in Los Angeles.\n\nahh -- that would not desalinate water at all. water is H2O and you are effectively stripping the H2 away to ge the hydrogen. Desalination strips ocean water of the ions or salts in the water -- either by reverse osmosis where water goes through a membrane and the salts stay on the other side -- or using heat to flash steam the water gather the gas and let it recondense to fresh water.\n\nEither desalination method still dumps concentraded salt water back into the ocean in a localized area. which may potentially be harmful.\n\nNo, this article is talking about stripping the H2 from the H2O which produces more O2 , O3 as a byproduct. O3 is harder to produce as it normally need electricity to excite the eletrons to produce the triple bond. but O2 is normal oxygen.\n\nHow is this a catalyst at all? If the oxygen replaces the iodine in the molecule, wouldn't it just be a chemical reaction? Don't catalysts just facilitate reactions while remaining unchanged themselves?\n\nShootist: what about mining \"nasty dirty\" uranium? or manufacturing plutonium? or storing the waste from 100 nuclear power plants. I support nuclear power, but don't pretend it isn't without it's cons as well.\n\nCould you please explain your molybdenum mining comment? I don't understand what its use would be in the production of hydrogen. I only know it's used in a lot of steel alloys and as a transportable parent isotope for a medical radio isotope (technetium-99) But then again, I'm by no means an engineer.\n\nAdding solar to just about anything decreases, nor increases viability. It is expensive relative to other energy resources and as it is not available all of the time to make use of the hydrogen producing equipment economically you would have to add expensive storage. Throwing in solar is just a way of getting more funds by pressing the 'right' buttons.\n\nIt is a catalyst if you add in a reductant (either sacrificial or a water oxidation catalyst). Once you add a reductant, electrons are transferred to the Mo-O species, forming water, and regenerating the catalyst.\n\nYou can't have a catalyst for an oxidation or reduction reaction without having another catalyst or a sacrifical species for the corresponding reduction or oxidation reaction, respectively.\n\nThe iodine complex is the one they made, and adding water creates the Mo-O species and H2. Giving this species a reductant turns the \"O\" in the species on the right into water, and regenerates the active Mo-H2O complex that can produce hydrogen.\n\nAlso, the whole \"solar\" thing is about an easy way to regenerate the catalyst, by making molecular photodiodes or using solar to run the reaction. Otherwise, all these \"H2\" production catalysts are stupid.\n\nProtip: if you don't understand something, ask a question instead of insulting others and showing everyone how much an idiot you are"

It's basically a phenomenon that creates magnetic currents that behave much in the same way that electric currents work, except with out all the heat that electric currents generate.\n\nIn the computer world, advancements have already been made toward magnetic RAM, which is said to be much faster than conventional RAM and uses far less power (like 90% less power). Now scientists in Japan have extended the same principle towards batteries. Such a battery, when used in, say, a laptop, would produce no heat and would consume far less power.\n\nThe new breakthrough has been coined the \"Seebeck effect\" in honor of Thomas Johan Seebeck, who discovered thermoelectricity back in the 1800s.

An effective utilization requires however that the material supplies a high voltage and has good electrical, but low thermal conductivity.\n\n\"The new knowledge explains exactly why some thermoelectric materials can have the desired low thermal conductivity without degrading the electrical properties. This can be crucial for the conversion of wasted heat, for example, from vehicle exhaust emissions. Leading car manufacturers are now working to develop this possibility and the first models are close to production. The technology is expected to give the cars considerably improved fuel economy,\" explains Bo B. Iversen, Professor at iNANO at the University of Århus.\n\nThe new knowledge can also contribute to the development of new cooling methods, so that one avoids the most common, but very environmentally damaging greenhouse gas (R-134a). All of which is a gain for the environment.\n\nIn the Nature Materials article the researchers have studied one of the most promising thermoelectric materials in the group of clathrates, which create crystals full of 'nano-cages'.\n\n\"By placing a heavy atom in each nano-cage, we can reduce the crystals' ability to conduct heat. Until now we thought that it was the heavy atoms random movements in the cages that were the cause of the poor thermal conductivity, but this has been shown to not be true,\" explains Asger B. Abrahamsen, senior scientist at Risø-DTU.\n\nThe researchers have used the technique of neutron scattering, which gives them opportunity to look into the material and see the atoms' movements.\n\n\"Our data shows that, it is rather the atoms' shared pattern of movement that determines the properties of these thermoelectric materials. A discovery that will be significant for the design of new materials that utilize energy even better,\" explains Kim Lefmann, associate professor at the Nano-Science Center, the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen crystal structure of a 'nano-cage'.

Image: Nature Chemistry, doi:10.1038/nchem.1201\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- A research group based out of the University of Michigan, and led by Vincent Pecoraro has successfully created a computer designed artificial enzyme that can serve as a catalyst for converting water and carbon dioxide into bicarbonate. In their paper published in Nature Chemistry, the team explains how their metalloprotein (a protein that contains a metal cofactor) mimics carbonic anhydrase and could conceivably lead to a means for removing some of the carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere that many now believe is contributing to global warming.\n\nThough the artificial enzyme is still many orders of magnitude less efficient than nature's way of doing things, it is far more efficient than any other artificial process to date, a milestone that gives researchers hope that they will one day equal nature's abilities.\n\nThe mimic, as the team refers to it, is made up of a three-stranded \"coiled coil\" protein that binds two metals: the active site is zinc, sitting inside the hydrophobic center, while the other site is made up of mercury metals that help to keep the whole works stabilized when introduced to a high pH environment.\n\nThe team says that their metalloprotein isn't necessarily an end product, but more of a way to prove that there likely does exist a path to creating artificial enzymes that can be every bit as efficient as those that occur in nature. The whole point being that if artificial ones can be created, they could be mass produced to exact specifications and used in large scale ways, such as sequestering carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and turning it to a harmless substance that would fall to the ground as bicarbonate.\n\nThe next step in the research is to copy the so-called \"'second sphere\" part of natural enzymes that is missing from the artificial mimic. Its role is to stabilize the differing states during transition and to aid in transferring protons.\n\nIt's because the mimic was able to beat current efficiency models without the second sphere that the researchers are so optimistic about further improvements to their artificial enzyme. Figuring out how to add that second sphere may help the team gain a 100 to 500 fold increase in efficiency of their metalloprotein, which would make it nearly as efficient as Mother Nature, a feat that might yet lead to not only a tool to help combat global warming, but to all manner of applications in the medical field.\n\nMore information: Hydrolytic catalysis and structural stabilization in a designed metalloprotein, Nature Chemistry (2011) doi:10.1038/nchem.1201\n\nAbstract Metal ions are an important part of many natural proteins, providing structural, catalytic and electron transfer functions. Reproducing these functions in a designed protein is the ultimate challenge to our understanding of them. Here, we present an artificial metallohydrolase, which has been shown by X-ray crystallography to contain two different metal ions—a Zn(II) ion, which is important for catalytic activity, and a Hg(II) ion, which provides structural stability. This metallohydrolase displays catalytic activity that compares well with several characteristic reactions of natural enzymes. It catalyses p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) hydrolysis with an efficiency only ~100-fold less than that of human carbonic anhydrase (CA)II and at least 550-fold better than comparable synthetic complexes. Similarly, CO2 hydration occurs with an efficiency within ~500-fold of CAII. Although histidine residues in the absence of Zn(II) exhibit pNPA hydrolysis, miniscule apopeptide activity is observed for CO2 hydration. The kinetic and structural analysis of this first de novo designed hydrolytic metalloenzyme reveals necessary design features for future metalloenzymes containing one or more metals.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Colorado State University researchers have discovered an enzyme that is critical to the survival and replication of the bacterial pathogen that causes tuberculosis.

Did you know that another good way is using fuel cells? A fuel cell is a device that converts the energy in chemicals to electricity and it creates no pollution! In this science fair project, learn how a fuel cell works. You'll get double the benefits by doing this science fair project—learn about science and learn how to help the environment at the same time.\n\nObjective\n\nIn this science project, you will learn how a fuel cell works and compare its efficiency to that of an internal combustion engine.\n\nCredits\n\nMichelle Maranowski, PhD, Science Buddies\n\nShare your story with Science Buddies!\n\nIntroduction\n\nA fuel cell is an electrochemical device that converts the energy in chemicals into electricity. A battery is also an electrochemical device that converts chemical energy into electricity, but there is a limited supply of chemicals in a battery, so eventually the chemicals are all consumed and the battery no longer supplies electricity. In a fuel cell, however, the chemicals can be replenished, so the fuel cell can continue to produce electricity.\n\nIn a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) the fuel used is hydrogen and the byproduct of the PEMFC is clean water. The standard method of creating electricity is by burning fossil fuels which can be harmful to our environment. A big advantage of fuel cells is that they do not create pollution. In addition, the fuel cell has no moving parts so it doesn't break down like an internal combustion engine can. This means that there could be fewer breakdowns for a car that uses a fuel cell, compared to a car with a standard internal combustion engine.\n\nThe fuel cell was first demonstrated by William Grove in 1839. The first thing that Grove did was to pass a current through water and separate water into its components: hydrogen and oxygen. This process is called electrolysis. He then wondered if electrolysis could be reversed. The answer was yes. When the hydrogen and oxygen recombined, an electric current was produced. While William Grove invented an interesting device, the fuel cell remained a lab curiosity for many years due to the expense of making one, as well as other complexities. Finally, in the 1930s, Francis Thomas Bacon developed an alkali electrolyte fuel cell, which was eventually used in NASA's Apollo missions.\n\nThe fuel cell is made up of five parts: the anode, a catalyst layer, an electrolyte layer, another catalyst layer, and finally, the cathode. Fuel, such as hydrogen gas in the case of a PEMFC, enters the system at the anode. The hydrogen gas then reacts with the catalyst layer, ionizes, and is separated into hydrogen ions and electrons, as shown here:\n\n2H2 →\n4H+ + 4e-\n\nIn the dissolution reaction above, two hydrogen molecules are ionized into four positively charged hydrogen ions and four negatively charged electrons. As described above, this reaction is called electrolysis. The electrons move externally out of the PEMFC into the cathode. This is because the electrolyte, the layer sandwiched between the anode and the cathode, allows only positive H+ ions to pass through. The electrons that move out of the fuel cell (electricity) are used to power loads such as lights or motors. At the same time, oxygen gas comes into the fuel cell at the cathode. The oxygen, electrons, and hydrogen ions react at the cathode catalyst and create water, as shown in the reaction below:\n\nO2 + 4e- + 4H+\n→ 2H2O\n\nFigure 1.\nThis is a schematic of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The two catalyst layers are between the anode and the electrolyte, and the electrolyte and the cathode.\n(U.S. Department of Energy, 2007.)\n\nThe second reaction shown above is typical of a PEMFC using hydrogen gas as the fuel. There are several different types of fuel cells, each with advantages and disadvantages. Some of the advantages of the PEMFC are that they start up rapidly and are compact and lightweight. One major disadvantage is that the electrolyte is required to be saturated with water for optimal operation.\n\nFuel cells are used in many industries, including consumer electronics, telecommunications, and transportation. Several cities have buses that are powered by fuel cells instead of by internal combustion engines, which are powered by gasoline.\n\nFigure 2.\nThis is a zero-emission bus. (U.S. Department of Energy, 2007.)\n\nIn this science fair project you will accomplish two things. You will help the environment and learn about this area of science by investigating the efficiency of the PEMFC.

Basic help can be found in the\nElectronics Primer. However, if you do not have experience in putting together\nelectrical circuits you may find it helpful to have someone who can answer questions\nand help you troubleshoot if your project is not working. A science teacher or parent\nmay be a good resource. If you need to find another mentor, try asking a local electrician,\nelectrical engineer, or person whose hobbies involve building things like model\nairplanes, trains, or cars. You may also need to work your way up to this project\nby starting with an electronics project that has a lower level of difficulty.\n\nFuel Cell Setup\n\nOpen the fuel cell kit and make sure that you have all of the pieces described in the operating instructions manual. Read through the manual to confirm that you have all of the pieces and to understand how your fuel cell operates.\n\nIncluded in the kit will be an \"RFC,\" which stands for reversible fuel cell. This means that the cell can be used to electrolyze water and as a fuel cell that creates power.\n\nThe top of the fuel cell has a sticker that shows which side is the hydrogen side and which is the oxygen side. The bottom of the fuel cell has a plastic stand that allows the fuel cell to sit upright.\n\nThe first step is to hydrate the electrolyte material. Take the syringe and suck water into it by placing the tip of the syringe into the distilled water and pulling the plunger. Suck about 4 milliliters (mL) into the syringe.\n\nTake the protective tubing off of the cell. Take an extra piece of short tubing (included in the kit) and push it onto the bottom inlet on the hydrogen side of the fuel cell. The fuel cell is labeled on top with a sticker for convenience.\n\nNow push the syringe onto the tubing and slowly inject the distilled water into the fuel cell. After 2-3 seconds you will see water coming out from the top inlet.\n\nTake the short tubing off of the bottom inlet on the hydrogen side and connect it to the bottom inlet of the oxygen side. Repeat steps 4 and 6.\n\nTo obtain the best operation of the fuel cell, the electrolyte needs to be hydrated, but the fuel cell should not be full of water. Remove excess water from the cell. Use the empty syringe to push and pull the excess water from the fuel cell. You can also tap the fuel cell gently.\n\nOnce the excess water has been removed from the fuel cell, plug the top inlets on both the hydrogen side and the oxygen side. Construct plugs using the short pieces of tubing, along with the included clips. Open one of the clips and then slide the tubing through the clip almost all the way to the end. Close the clip. This squeezes the end of the tubing shut. Plugging the top inlets prevents the electrolyzed gases from escaping. See Figure 3. Once this is completed, the unit is ready for electrolysis.\n\nFigure 3. Shown are the short tubing and clips for constructing the plugs.\n\nElectrolysis\n\nThe first step to using this unit as a fuel cell is to electrolyze water. This creates the fuel. Caution: Hydrogen is flammable, so keep the fuel cell and hydrogen storage tank away from sparks.\n\nConnect the hydrogen and oxygen storage tanks exactly as described in the operating instructions manual. Fill both outer cylinders with distilled water up to the \"0\" mark.\n\nConnect the long tubing piece to the inlet of the inner cylinder. Make sure that the little notch on the bottom of the inner cylinder of the tank is not blocked by the rim of the outer cylinder of the tank. Also confirm that the inner cylinder is seated tightly inside of the outer cylinder. Write down the water level in your lab notebook in a data table.\n\nConnect the hydrogen storage tank, via the tubing, to the bottom inlet on the hydrogen side and the oxygen storage tank to the bottom inlet of the oxygen side. Make sure that the tubing is tightly sealed on both inlets.\n\nInsert the 3 AA batteries into the empty battery pack. Make sure to connect the batteries in the correct polarity. There is a diagram on the inside of the pack that you can follow.\n\nNow get the timer, digital multimeter, and resistor ready for measurement. Be sure to put on your safety goggles. If you are using more than one resistor, then twist all of the metal leads on one end of the resistors together and the leads on the other end of the resistors together. See Figure 5 for how the resistors should look. Take your multimeter and measure the value of the resistor or combination of resistors. Read the multimeter instruction manual to learn how to measure resistance. Note the resistance down in your lab notebook.\n\nTake the black alligator cable and clip one end to the black wire from the battery pack. Clip the other end to the black connection of the fuel cell. Clip the red cable to the red wire from the battery pack and the other end of the alligator cable to the resistor. Use the third alligator cable to clip to the other end of the resistor. Finally, clip the other end of the third alligator cable to the red connection of the fuel cell. The resistor is in series with the battery pack and will allow you to measure the current being supplied to the fuel cell. See Figure 4 for a diagram of the circuit.\n\nAs soon as you clip the red alligator cable to the red connection of the fuel cell, the distilled water will start to electrolyze into hydrogen and oxygen. Prior to doing this, make sure that the timer is ready. Have your helper be responsible for the timer. Clip the cable onto the fuel cell and start timing the electrolysis. Figure 5 shows the fuel cell in electrolysis mode.\n\nYou will see evidence of electrolysis when the level of the distilled water in the inner cylinder decreases. Hydrogen gas is pushing the water out. You can see the amount of hydrogen created by reading the change in water level from step 2. Note this down in your lab notebook.\n\nUsing the multimeter, determine the voltage drop across the fuel cell. This is the input voltage. Measure across the fuel cell's red and black terminals. Read the document Using a Multimeter in the Science Buddies Science Fair Project Guide to learn how to use a digital multimeter to measure voltage. Record the data in your lab notebook. Having your helper help keep track of the time, take a measurement 10 seconds after electrolysis starts. Then take three additional voltage measurements; one after 30 seconds, one after 1 minute and then after 1.5 minutes. Record the data in your lab notebook. Average the voltage measurements to obtain the average input voltage.\n\nUsing the multimeter, determine the current that is being supplied to the fuel cell. This is the input current. Measure the voltage drop across the resistor. Record the data in your lab notebook. Measure the voltage drop across the resistor each time that you measure the input voltage to the fuel cell. Once you know the voltage drop across the resistor and the value of the resistor you can use Ohm's law to calculate the input current. Simply divide the voltage drop across the resistor (in volts) by the value of the resistor (in ohms). The units of measure for current is amperes. Record the data in your lab notebook. Average the current measurements to obtain the average input current.\n\nTime the electrolysis until the hydrogen tank is full. You will know that you have filled the hydrogen tank when all of the water in the inner cylinder has been displaced and you see the water bubbling. Stop the timer and record the time in your lab notebook. Continue electrolyzing oxygen. Once you see the oxygen tank bubbling, wait for an additional 15 seconds. This will clear out any additional water in the fuel cell. The fuel cell operates at its best when there is no extra water in the fuel cell. Disconnect the battery pack from the fuel cell.\n\nCalculate the energy to electrolyze hydrogen. Energy is the amount of power expended in an amount of time. Electrical power is defined in Equation 1 and Energy is defined in Equation 2. Equation 3 is derived by substituting 'power' in Equation 2 with the definition of 'power' from Equation 1.\n\nUsing equation 3, calculate the energy necessary to electrolyze water into hydrogen and oxygen and record the value in your lab notebook. Please notice that in equation 3 you are calculating the input energy using the average current. The accurate way to calculate the input energy is to first integrate the current over the time it took to electrolyze, and then multiply that by the average voltage However, for the purpose of this science fair project, you can estimate the integral by averaging the current.\n\nt is the time taken in seconds to electrolyze a full storage tank of hydrogen.\n\nFigure 4. This is a diagram of the circuit for this project.\n\nFigure 5. (a) This is the battery connection for electrolysis mode. (b) Several resistors connected together to make a smaller resistance.\n\nCreating Energy\n\nConnect a load to the fuel cell. Included in the kit is a small motor. This will be the load.\n\nGet the timer and digital multimeter ready.\n\nConnect the motor in the same way as the battery pack. Connect the motor to the fuel cell in the correct way, as follows. Take the black alligator cable and clip one end to the black wire from the motor. Clip the other end to the black connector on the fuel cell. Take the red alligator cable and clip one end to the red wire of the motor. Clip the other end to the resistor. Take the third cable and clip it to the other end of the resistor. Finally, clip the free end of the third cable to the red connector on the fuel cell. Immediately start timing the fuel cell mode. The resistor is in series with the motor and will allow you to measure the current the fuel cell is supplying to the motor.\n\nAs soon as the connection is made from the fuel cell to the motor, the post on the motor will start rotating. It will make a whirring sound. To make the motor action more visible you can attach a propeller or blade onto the motor's post.\n\nFigure 6. This is the fuel cell supplying voltage to the motor.\n\nAs the reaction of the fuel cell continues, the hydrogen in the storage tank is being consumed. You will see water re-entering the inner cylinder.\n\nUsing the multimeter, measure the voltage being supplied by the fuel cell to the motor, after the motor settles down. Have your helper help you keep track of the time. Measure the voltage across the fuel cell terminals. Take three additional measurements after 2 minutes, after 5 minutes, and after 8 minutes, then average the voltage data. This is the output voltage. Record the data in your lab notebook.\n\nUsing the multimeter, measure the current being supplied by the fuel cell to the motor right after you take the voltage measurement. Measure the voltage across the measurement resistor. Use Ohm's law to calculate the current. Take three additional measurements—after 2 minutes, after 5 minutes, and after 8 minutes—then average the current data. This is the output current. Record the data in your lab notebook.\n\nStop the timer as soon as the motor stops running. You will know when the motor stops running when you stop hearing the whirring sound. Record the time in your lab notebook.\n\nUse Equation 4 to calculate the output energy.\n\nEquation 4:\n\nOutput Energy\n\n=\n\n(Average Current Supplied by FC) × (Average Voltage Supplied by FC) × (Running Time of Motor)\n\nE\n\n=\n\n(I)(V)(t)\n\nE is the output energy in joules (J).\n\nI is the average current supplied by the fuel cell, in amperes (A).\n\nV is the average voltage supplied by the fuel cell, in volts (V).\n\nt is the time the motor runs in seconds.\n\nWith the input energy and the output energy, calculate the efficiency of the fuel cell for every trial with Equation 5. Record this number in your lab notebook.\n\nEquation 5:\n\nEfficiency =\n\nOutput Energy Input Energy\n\nRepeat this experiment at least two more times, starting from \"Fuel Cell Startup\" through \"Creating Energy.\" Prior to every trial, gently take the inner cylinder out of the outer cylinder for both the hydrogen and oxygen storage tanks. Disconnect the storage tanks from the fuel cell. Unplug the top inlets on the fuel cell. Gently shake the fuel cell to remove any excess water. Take a short length of tubing and attach it to the bottom inlet of the hydrogen side. Use the syringe to blow air into the fuel cell. This will move any excess gases out of the fuel cell. Stagnant gases in the fuel cell will affect efficiency. Repeat on the oxygen side.\n\nPlot the efficiency of the fuel cell. Compare it to the efficiency of a standard internal combustion engine. Label the x-axis Trial and the y-axis Efficiency.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nShare your story with Science Buddies!\n\nVariations\n\nHow does temperature affect the efficiency of the fuel cell? After electrolyzing water, try placing the fuel cell in the butter compartment of your refrigerator for 30 minutes and then repeating the \"Creating Energy\" steps of the project. Never freeze the fuel cell. Freezing the fuel cell will damage it. Try placing the fuel cell on a warm window sill or using a hair dryer to heat up the fuel cell.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\nIf you are having trouble with this project, please read the FAQ below. You may find the answer to your question.\n\nQ: I can't find a low enough resistor to do this project. How can I make one from 1-Ohm resistors?\n\nA:\nThere are two basic ways to connect resistors; in series or in parallel. A series connection of resistors is shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Resistors connected in a series configuration.\n\nIn the series configuration, the total resistance is a sum of the individual resistances. If R1, R2, and R3 are each equal to 1 Ohm, then the total resistance, Rt, is 3 Ohms.\n\nEquation 1.\n\n[Please enable JavaScript to view equation]\n\nAnother way to connect resistors is to connect them in a parallel configuration, as shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Resistors connected in a parallel configuration.\n\nIn the parallel configuration, the total resistance is calculated as shown in Equation 2.\n\nEquation 2.\n\n[Please enable JavaScript to view equation]\n\nIf R1, R2, and R3 are each 1 Ohm, the resistance of the configuration, Rt, is 1/3 Ohms\n\n.\n\nTo do this project, you need a resistor with a value less than ½ Ohms. If you can't find a resistor of\nthis value, then simply put together 3 1-Ohm resistors in parallel.Fuel Cell Engineer\n\nMost of the world's energy comes from fossil fuels. However, the amount of fossil fuels is finite, and many people are concerned about where our energy will come from in the future. We can turn to alternative, renewable sources of fuel, such as our sun (solar energy) and the winds (wind energy). But what happens when the sun doesn't shine or the winds don't blow? Would we be stuck? Well, that is where the fuel cell comes in. A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that generates electricity through a reaction between a fuel, like hydrogen, and an oxidant, like oxygen. This reaction produces few greenhouse gas emissions other than water or water vapor. The job of the fuel cell engineer is to design new fuel cell technology that improves the reliability, functionality, and efficiency of the fuel cell.

Hydrogen fuel cells, one of the most powerful and efficient forms of alternative energy, are notorious for their vast expense. Solar panels have been hampered by bouts with inefficiency, as their energy supply is cut off when not facing the sun. These problems have kept sustainable fuel from becoming mainstream, but researchers at Rice University are looking for solutions.\n\nNanotechnology may be the key to solving the problems with alternative energy. Researchers at the Rice University have successfully contained an entire lithium ion energy storage system into a nanowire. Professor Pulickel Ajayan led researchers in this endeavor and believes that they have compacted the system as much as is possible. The storage device could have major implications on the future of alternative fuel and nanoelectronics.\n\nThe system can serve a two-fold purpose: The storage and creation of electricity. In its most basic form, the nanowire battery is a type of fuel cell, generating electricity through a series of chemical reactions. The system is still new and requires quite a bit of fine tuning, but Ajayan is confident that it can be used as a template for future efforts at making alternative fuel more viable.\n\nAjayan's research is documented in the American Chemical Society journal Nano Letters"

      "text": "Doping for solar cells\n\nMon, 10/10/2011 - 07:45\n\nOrganic solar cells are made of organic molecules that can be used to convert light energy into electricity. By exploiting sunlight, they represent one of the most promising technological approaches to meeting the rising demand for energy from environmentally benign sources. However, organic solar cells suffer from one major drawback – they are much less efficient than conventional semiconductor cells made from inorganic materials.\n\nA research team at LMU Munich, led by Dr. Enrico Da Como and Professor Jochen Feldmann, Director of the Photonics and Optoelectronics Group at LMU, has now come up with a strategy for improving the electrical properties of organic semiconductors. Organic solar cells basically consist of two components, a polymer, which transfers an electron when it absorbs a quantum of light, and a so-called fullerene, which accepts the electron.\n\nThis charge-transfer event constitutes the essential first step in the generation of electricity from light, which requires the separation of negatively charged electrons from positively charged holes. Da Como and Feldmann, who are also members of the Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM), a Cluster of Excellence at LMU, have now taken a closer look at this elementary reaction, and gained new insights into the dynamics of the underlying physical processes: \"In order to improve the efficiency of organic solar cells, we need to understand and optimize the process of charge transfer at the interface between polymer and fullerene,\" Da Como explains.\n\nThis process involves the generation of an intermediate state, called an excited complex, in which the charges are facing each other at the interface between neighboring molecules. At this stage, charge recombination may occur, which results in a loss of energy and thus reduces the efficiency of the solar cell. The researchers used a unique combination of spectroscopic methods to monitor recombination, and found a way to inhibit it and so enhance charge separation. \"We have been able to show that the incorporation of low concentrations of an additional molecule into the polymer – an approach that is known as doping – inhibits the formation of excited complexes and so increases the rate of charge separation,\" says Da Como.\n\nThis represents an entirely new concept in the physics of charge transfer in organic semiconductors, and could open a new route to increasing the efficiency of organic solar cells. The team is now investigating prototypes to test whether the concept is workable in practice, and to determine how the doping process affects the morphology and conductivity of organic solar cells.\n\nThe project was financially supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) in the context of Priority Program 1355 (Elementary Processes in Organic Photovoltaics).

      "text": "Stationary Fuel Cells: The Next Generation of Electrical Power\n\nMarch 2011\n\nNew thinking about the generation of power at lower cost and less environmental impact is leading to strong interest in high-temperature fuel cells as the next generation of electrical power. This would mean a profound change in how power would be generated in the decades to come.\n\nStationary fuel cells are now emerging as a true alternative to combustion heat engines for the production of electrical power and the co-generation of a thermal product.\n\nThis is happening at a time of great change in the thinking about the generation of power with new products at the point of use offering the promise of reliability, power quality, lower operating costs, remarkably higher system efficiency, and the production and utilization of direct current. These stationary fuel cells take advantage of heat that would otherwise be wasted and also run very quietly and emit virtually no pollutants.\n\nSome of these that operate at relatively high temperatures—between 600°C and 1,000°C—hold promise for stationary industrial and residential power generation applications and for many military applications. With support from the U.S. Department of Energy, two such high-temperature technologies are moving from concept to commercialization: molten carbonate fuel cells and solid oxide fuel cells. Both operate at about 50% fuel-to-electrical efficiency.\n\nThese allow for fuel flexibility and, in addition, the high temperature provides high-quality cogeneration of a thermal product and an ultimate overall efficiency exceeding 80%. When integrated with a gas turbine, the waste heat can effectively be converted to electricity with the potential in the future of achieving fuel-to-electrical efficiencies exceeding 70%.\n\nThe technology for one type of high-temperature fuel cell, molten carbonate has been evolving over the past 30 years. A leading U.S. manufacturer, FuelCell Energy, pioneered a direct fuel cell 250-kW product developed in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy. FuelCell Energy delivered its first commercial unit in 2003, and units are now operating at more than 50 facilities worldwide. In the first few years, the cost of the FuelCell unit declined from approximately $8,000/kW in 2004 to $4,800/kW in 2006.\n\nThis stack of 20 solid oxide fuel cells is being used to study a hybrid combined heat and power system. Such hybrids are up to 80 percent efficient.\n\nSolid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) also operate at high temperatures, from 700°C to 1,000°C, depending on the design and application. There is ongoing research worldwide to establish operating conditions and material sets that could enable both ease of manufacturing and relatively low-cost mass production. For example, SOFCs with high power densities operating at lower temperatures—700°C instead of 1,000°C —have been developed and operated. The lower operating temperature may enable lower costs.\n\nA solid oxide fuel cell system has been commercialized as of this writing, but there are a number of companies working to establish systems, including Acumentrics, General Electric, IonAmerica, Rolls-Royce, and Siemens Power Corp.\n\nAlone, high-temperature fuel cells show tremendous promise. Through hybridization, high-temperature fuel cells may even achieve even greater efficiency. Hybridization occurs by combining a high-temperature fuel cell with a traditional heat engine such as a gas turbine. The resulting system performs at far higher efficiency than either system alone. Combined with an inherent low level of pollutant emission, hybrid configurations are likely to make up a major percentage of the next-generation advanced power generation systems for a wide range of applications.\n\nThese efforts will likely be worthwhile given the escalating costs of fossil fuel. Because of the huge potential, some states have taken aggressive steps to be the manufacturing and employment base for fuel cell technology. California has established the Stationary Fuel Cell Collaborative, with a core group composed of state, federal, and non-government agencies to encourage a coordinated strategy. Industry is engaged through an advisory panel. Several years ago, the state of Ohio committed $103 million to establish a manufacturing and employment base for fuel cell technology.\n\nAll of this activity affirms the strong interest in high-temperature fuel cells as the next generation of electricity and thermal product. Many believe high-temperature fuel cell technology will become an integral strategy for central power production of electricity and transportation fuels and a hybrid configuration is expected to provide hoteling or propulsive power for ships, locomotives, long-distance trucks, and civil aircraft.\nIn all their potential applications—residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional, in distributed generation or in central power plants—high-temperature fuel cells indeed portend a profound change in the manner by which power will be generated in the decades to come.\n\n[Adapted from \"Beginning the Transformation,\" by Mark Williams and Scott Samuelsen for Mechanical Engineering, May 2006.]"

      "text": "Renewable Energy and Nanotechnology\n\nWith the era of peak oil upon us – and growing concerns about the impact of climate change - there are ongoing debates in Ireland and elsewhere about future energy, with various alternative energies proposed from renewable to wind, to hydroelectric power and wave. Nuclear energy has also re-emerged as an option. But other, newer technologies are also being talked about, and indeed are well into research and development stages, in the areas of biotechnology and nanotechnology. For more background on energy planning and debates in Ireland, please see the 'Ireland's Energy Challenges' document.\n\nA proposed \"bionano\" solution at DCU\n\nOne of the bioengineered solutions offered by Dublin City University is a project funded by QUESTOR in Belfast exploring bioelectricity production from wastewater in Microbial Fuel Cells , being investigated and developed by one of our biotechnology researchers at DCU, Dr. Enrico Marsili. There are two 'green' technological processes derived from this idea: 1) wastewater treatment and 2) the use of microbial cells as miniature 'batteries' to produce energy. With increased populations, synergetic exercises like this are increasingly common – in this case how do we treat wastewater as well as creating a new type of energy production?\n\nClean water demands increase the consumption of fossil fuel-based energy reserves as well as global greenhouse gas emissions. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) operation accounts for 1.5% of the electricity consumption and 5% of greenhouse gas emissions. Energy recovery technologies are proposed to reduce cost and energy consumption of WWTPs. MFCs convert the chemical energy of wastewater directly into electrical energy, through microbial catalysts. MFCs are very simple bioreactors, essentially vats that harnesses energy from biological processes. In one example, a \"biofilm\" is created from an organism called Shewanella oneidensis. It has been seen that these organisms are good at transferring electrons across metals. Bionanoscientists have been able to create special \"nanowires\" as extended \"arms\" on these organisms, making them more electrochemically active.\n\nHowever, there are some issues raised specifically about these microbial fuel cell (MFC) technologies, questions that could be described as both scientific and socio-political.\n\nWe need to gather as much knowledge on these issues as possible. Questions that we now open for wider discussion online are:\n\nSpecifically, how do bio/nano innovations compare, in MW output, to 1)wind 2) wave and 3) nuclear? How can microbial fuel cells (MFCs) be made more efficient? What is expected of an MFC as a practical output for Irish homes?\n\nCan an MFC solution be used in the short term to address municipal wastewater and energy needs in the greater Dublin area? What protocol can be implemented that allows community and local council influence on such a process?\n\nHow would a wind or wave strategy for Europe work , combined with bio-nano solutions?\n\nMore generally, how 'natural' are bio- or nanotechnological innovations? How important is it for a 'green Ireland' to use 'natural resources' in partnership with our European neighbours?\n\ndebate ended – 2 comments:\n\nEnrico Marsili wrote:\n\nHello,\nI am one of the DCU researcher involved in energy recovery from wastewater.\n\nEnergy recovery from WW cannot be compared in terms of output to \"conventional\" renewable\nenergies such as solar and wind. MFCs can produce at best 100 W/m3 of reactor volume.\nMFCs cannot be compared to fission-derived energy, whose energy output is far superior to\nwind and solar technology. The main interest in MFCs raise from the fact they can generate electricity while degrading WW, thus achieving a double result and lowering the cost for conventional WW\ntreatment. MFC efficiency is already quite high, about 80% or more or the energy contained in WW can be harvested. However, the cost per unit of power produced need to be reduced, for example by\nusing more energetic substrate (primary wastewater or effluent of anaerobic digestion processes).\n\nMFC could be used at home in a fairly short time (5 yrs). The technology is already available, but\ntypical home produce very diluted wastewater that may result in too little energy recovery.\nSurely, MFCs can be implemented in addition to standard sewage treatment in rural homes. The\neconomic of the process requires further study. Further, the MFCs require expert operation\nand decision, above the average consumer experience.\n\n23. March 2012 – 19:27 Uhr -\n\nCurrent debate\n\nWhat are your views on the potential for bioelectricity production from waste water using microbial fuel cells? Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) are literally the use of microbes as fuel 'batteries', through 'bio-nanotechnology' processes."

Hereby, they have uncovered a mechanism for the production of the gas which has hardly been examined before; usually, researchers are interested in light-driven hydrogen synthesis. \"Hydrogen could help us out of the energy crisis\", says Prof. Dr. Thomas Happe, head of the working group Photobiotechnology. \"If you want to make green algae produce more hydrogen, it is important to understand all the production pathways.\"\n\nGreen algae produce hydrogen under stress - even in the dark\n\nSingle-celled green algae of the type Chlamydomonas are microscopically small organisms: ten of them fit side by side on a human hair. In some ways, microalgae are not so very different from higher plants, such as trees. For example, they also perform photosynthesis. Unlike land plants, they can use light energy for the production of molecular hydrogen (H2). \"However, Chlamydomonas and co only form hydrogen under stress\", says Thomas Happe. \"The disposal of the energy-rich gas serves as a kind of overflow valve so that excess light energy does not damage the sensitive photosynthetic apparatus.\" Chlamydomonas can also produce hydrogen in the dark. Although this fact has been known for decades, H2 synthesis in the absence of light has barely been studied because much less of the gas is produced in the dark than in the light. Moreover, it is complicated to isolate large quantities of the key enzyme of the dark-reaction, the so-called pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase. The RUB researchers nevertheless tackled the project.\n\nHydrogen production in the dark mimicked in vitro\n\nHappe's team reconstructed the core of the dark hydrogen production in vitro, thus demonstrating the underlying mechanism.

(Photo courtesy of Oregon State University)\nTheThe findings have just been published in Energy and Environmental Science, a professional journal, in work funded by the National Science Foundation.\n\n\"If this technology works on a commercial scale the way we believe it will, the treatment of wastewater could be a huge energy producer, not a huge energy cost,\" said Hong Liu, an associate professor in the OSU Department of Biological and Ecological Engineering. \"This could have an impact around the world, save a great deal of money, provide better water treatment and promote energy sustainability.\"\n\nExperts estimate that about 3 percent of the electrical energy consumed in the United States and other developed countries is used to treat wastewater, and a majority of that electricity is produced by fossil fuels that contribute to global warming.\n\nBut the biodegradable characteristics of wastewater, if tapped to their full potential, could theoretically provide many times the energy that is now being used to process them, with no additional greenhouse emissions.\n\nOSU researchers reported several years ago on the promise of this technology, but at that time the systems in use produced far less electrical power. With new concepts – reduced anode-cathode spacing, evolved microbes and new separator materials – the technology can now produce more than two kilowatts per cubic meter of liquid reactor volume. This amount of power density far exceeds anything else done with microbial fuel cells.\n\nThe system also works better than an alternative approach to creating electricity from wastewater, based on anaerobic digestion that produces methane. It treats the wastewater more effectively, and doesn't have any of the environmental drawbacks of that technology, such as production of unwanted hydrogen sulfide or possible release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.\n\nThe OSU system has now been proven at a substantial scale in the laboratory, Liu said, and the next step would be a pilot study. Funding is now being sought for such a test. A good candidate, she said, might initially be a food processing plant, which is a contained system that produces a steady supply of certain types of wastewater that would provide significant amounts of electricity.\n\nContinued research should also find even more optimal use of necessary microbes, reduced material costs and improved function of the technology at commercial scales, OSU scientists said.\n\nOnce advances are made to reduce high initial costs, researchers estimate that the capital construction costs of this new technology should be comparable to that of the activated sludge systems now in widespread use today – and even less expensive when future sales of excess electricity are factored in.\n\nThis technology cleans sewage by a very different approach than the aerobic bacteria used in the past. Bacteria oxidize the organic matter and, in the process, produce electrons that run from the anode to the cathode within the fuel cell, creating an electrical current. Almost any type of organic waste material can be used to produce electricity – not only wastewater, but also grass straw, animal waste, and byproducts from such operations as the wine, beer or dairy industries.\n\nThe approach may also have special value in developing nations, where access to electricity is limited and sewage treatment at remote sites is difficult or impossible as a result.\n\nThe ability of microbes to produce electricity has been known for decades, but only recently have technological advances made their production of electricity high enough to be of commercial use.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nEngineers at Oregon State University have made a significant advance toward producing electricity from sewage, by the use of new coatings on the anodes of microbial electrochemical cells that increased the electricity production the June 2004 issue of Mechanical Engineering, a publication of ASME, the magazine reports on a fuel cell that cleans domestic wastewater while producing electrical energy.\nThis new type of microbial fuel cell, which ...\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Yanbiao Liu and his colleagues from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, have succeeded in building a device capable of both cleaning wastewater and producing electricity from it. Using light as ...\n\nScientists today described a new and more efficient version of an innovative device the size of a home washing machine that uses bacteria growing in municipal sewage to make electricity and clean up the sewage at the sameWhat about it? Radioactivity is a physics effect - not a chemistry effect. Bacteria can't affect the half life of radioactive material.\n\nWhat bacteria can do is e.g. show an ability to concentrate certain atom types (much like your liver tends to concentrate toxic stuff like mercury). This doesn't render the radioactive material any less radioactive, but it may allow it to be more easily extracted afterwards.\n\nThere are bacteria that do live off of radioactivity created by radioactive material  But that doesn't mean they 'eat' radioactivity - rather they use this source of radiation and not the source of radioactivity most other plants use (the sun).\n\nThe entrepreneur in me wakes up - so you have a large block of apartments (flats) - and each time someone uses the bathroom - they get a 5 cent credit towards their rent. The apartment complex has a small power plant - that in conjunction with solar panels on the roof - generates enough power run the complex. They save money because they don't have to pay a sewer fee to the local city, and they sell bags of compost to a local nursery store - sounds like win/win/win.\n\nthat in conjunction with solar panels on the roof - generates enough power run the complex.\n\nNot sure the wastewater of one appartment would render THAT much electricity. 5 cents per use is most certainly a pretty bad deal for you. (and also pretty sure that the roof area of a block of flats won't generate enough electricity with PV to make a big dent in your electricity bill - much less power the complex in a stand-alone fashion. Unless you already have built zero-energy-appartments )\n\n..and you'll have to pay the sewer fee anyhow since the stuff doesn't go away. Occasionally you'll have to flush the remainder - including the bacteria that lived and died.\n\nFor such local use these microreactors are probably not worth the investment (yet)\n\nand also pretty sure that the roof area of a block of flats won't generate enough electricity with PV to make a big dent in your electricity bill - much less power the complex in a stand-alone fashion.\n\nThat would depend on the density of the apartments. Here in the U.S. many apartments are pretty spread out - and just 2 or 3 levels - so solar panels would have enough area. In a larger block - you are probably right - and often the roofs are used for other purposes such as sitting areas - or satellite dishes. But it would help - and probably in the future we will be increasing the efficiency of all or our buildings - so they can be run on a much smaller set of panels. We have some zero energy homes here now - that use a very small set of panels - I think just 2KW - but are super insulated - and use super high efficiency appliances"

Researchers from various institutions have been working to address these issues and many have been met with mixed results. Those that have conducted experiments in the field of nanotechnology suggest that the technology could hold the key to solving the issues inhibiting the progress of hydrogen fuel.\n\nNanotechnology may be able to address the various issues keeping hydrogen progress at bay\n\nWork to establish a comprehensive hydrogen infrastructure is currently underway throughout the world. This infrastructure is meant to support the emergence of hydrogen-powered transportation and provide a fueling structure for the industrial use of hydrogen-based equipment. One of the key problems with a comprehensive infrastructure is figuring out how to produce hydrogen gas efficiently. Currently, hydrogen production is an energy intensive process, whose energy needs can only be satisfied through the burning of fossil-fuels. Researchers from the Northeastern University and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, have been working with titanium dioxide nanotubes, which have photocatalytic properties.\n\nTitanium dioxide is capable of producing hydrogen gas through exposure to the sun\n\nResearchers have found that the titanium dioxide nanotubes can be used to produce hydrogen gas when they are exposed to sunlight. The key ingredient for this process is water. When the nanutubes are submerged in water and exposed to solar radiation, hydrogen gas is produced, which can then be used by fuel cells to produce electricity. The structure of these nanotubes could also serve as a basis for the storage of hydrogen in a solid state. Magnesium nanoparticles have emerged as one of the more popular materials for hydrogen storage due to their porous structure.\n\nSolutions provided by nanotechnology could make hydrogen a favored source of energy\n\nIf the problems with hydrogen production and storage can be resolved, hydrogen fuel may become one of the world's leading sources of energy. Fuel cells have already proven themselves to be powerful energy systems capable of competing with traditional forms of power. Until that time, however, hydrogen may continue to struggle to attain the support it needs to thrive"

Professor Haldar's research focus is to support energy and environmental technology deployment through accelerated commercialization by leveraging partnerships between industry, government and university. The research thrust areas within Haldar's E2TAC group encompass the following areas:\n\nAdvanced Photovoltaics\nUntil now, solar cells that convert sunlight to electric power, has been dominated by solid state junction devices, often made of silicon wafers. This is now being challenged by the development of a new generation of solar cells, based on thin film materials, nanocrystalline materials and conducting polymeric films. These offer the prospects of cheaper materials, higher efficiency and flexible features. This has opened up new opportunities in solar cell research and development.\n\nAdvanced Fuel Cells Fuel cells generate power electrochemcically when hydrogen rich fuel is passed over an anode and air over a cathode that are separated by an electrolyte. By-products are heat, water and carbon dioxide. The next generation fuel cell that will provide wider and deeper penetration into a full range of market applications will require targeted costs to fall and performance to improve by order of magnitude over existing levels. Long term materials development, integration of design, speed of manufacturing and materials selection are critical in meeting the goals.\n\nNext Generation Superconductors\nHigh temperature superconductors based on YBCO has significant commercial opportunity since operation at temperatures above liquid nitrogen are now possible. HTS conductor can save up to 20 % of electrical output that is currently lost in transmission due to resistance. It also has applications in motors, generators, transformers and fault current limiters. However, the critical current and current density must be increased, while cost needs to be reduced before YBCO will be a cost-effective replacement for conventional materials. E2TAC is focused on improving superconductors.\n\nAdvanced Power Electronics The main goal of power electronics is always to provide power conversion with the maximum efficiency possible. Power electronics is used for inverters and other applications, such as pulsed high-power applications, switches and amplifiers. It has been well known for some time that power semiconductor device performance can be enhanced at low temperatures, especially in the range of 77 K to 200 K, where extraordinary efficiency and power densities can be realized. One added key advantage of moving to low temperatures is to provide device reliability, since intrinsic device aging process is slowed at lower temperatures. Cryogenic operation will enable much higher pulse-power levels, higher output currents, increased safe operating area, improved thermal management, as well as increased reliability and lifetime. Cryo-cooled MOSFETs power amplifiers have lower conduction and switching losses, higher efficiencies, and can be operated at higher frequencies.\n\nResearch and Business Experience:\n\nResearch, development and deployment of technical solutions and improving performance by accelerating the insertion of nanotechnology into energy and environmental applications in areas including fuel cells, hydrogen economy, power semiconductors, photovoltaics, thermoelectric materials, supercapacitors and superconductors.\n\nHelped create and manage several innovative initiatives, consortia, centers, technology transfer programs and contracts by collaborating with over 50 universities, industry and government organizations.\n\nServed as chair of a national organization, the Clean Energy Alliance established, by the U.S. DOE's NREL, to bring together leading business organizations dedicated to providing financial and business support services tailored to the needs of the clean energy community.\n\nResponsible for developing and maintaining relationships with several industrial partners, DARPA, NASA, DOE, NSF, ONR, other federal and New York State Agencies. Received several awards exceeding $30 M to build one of the largest university-based clean energy development centers in New York State. Managed programs with over 60 staff members, students and scientists.\n\nSelected Achievements:\n\nEstablished New Energy New York (NENY), a consortium with 45+ clean energy companies including solar and fuel cell companies such as Daystar, General Electric, Plug Power, Delphi, General Motors and MTI Microfuel cells. NENY and E2TAC are at the forefront of business acceleration, technology development, education and outreach activities in several areas of nanotechnology, renewable energy and energy efficiency (solar cells, fuel cells, ultracapacitors, power electronics and thermoelectric devices).\n\nPartnered with industry and trade organizations to publish an 'energy clusters report' and 'commercialization roadmaps' for Solar Photovoltaic and the Hydrogen Economy in New York State to recommend policy, attract investments and introduce incentives for deployment.\n\nEstablished a new subsidiary of Intermagnetics (as a spin-off) to focus on the development and commercialization of high temperature superconductor materials and integrated devices that are designed to improve the capacity, reliability and efficiency of electric power transmission and distribution.\n\nCreated strategy and business plan for fast growing subsidiary for spin-off from parent company. Responsible for road show to strategic investors and partners to implement commercialization pathway. Initiated IP portfolio strategy and negotiated exclusive licenses from Los Alamos National Laboratory, Bell Labs and others.\n\nPublished over 175 articles in peer reviewed and conference publications with significant technical accomplishments that include: demonstration of 13x improvement in on-resistance for high-performance integrated power modules to be used in a cryogenic inverter; preparation of new nanostructured platinum electrodes by a nanotemplating based electro-deposition process to be used as catalysts in electrodes for proton exchange membrane fuel cells; and demonstration if a novel integration of aligned nanostructures including carbon nanotubes and metallic nanorods in to photovoltaic devices."

      "text": "In what Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers say is a revolutionary leap that could transform solar power from a marginal, boutique alternative into a mainstream energy source, the researchers report they have discovered a way to store energy for use when the sun doesn't shine, thereby overcoming a major barrier to large-scale solar power.\n\nMIT reminded that until now, solar power has been a daytime-only energy source, because storing extra solar energy for later use is prohibitively expensive and grossly inefficient, but its researchers have come upon a simple, inexpensive, highly efficient process for storing solar energy that requires nothing but abundant, non-toxic natural materials, inspired by the photosynthesis performed by plants.\n\n\"This is the nirvana of what we've been talking about for years. Solar power has always been a limited, far-off solution. Now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon,\" noted MIT's Daniel Nocera, (pictured left) the Henry Dreyfus Professor of Energy at MIT and senior author of a paper describing the work in the July 31 issue of Science, in a statement.\n\nNocera and Matthew Kanan, a postdoctoral fellow in Nocera's lab developed a process that will allow the sun's energy to be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gases, which later may be recombined inside a fuel cell, creating carbon-free electricity to power houses or electric cars, day or night.\n\nThe key component in the process is a catalyst -- cobalt metal, phosphate and an electrode, placed in water -- that produces oxygen gas from water, while another catalyst produces hydrogen gas. When electricity -- whether from a photovoltaic cell, a wind turbine or any other source -- runs through the electrode, the cobalt and phosphate form a thin film on the electrode, and oxygen gas is produced, the researchers explained.\n\nCombined with another catalyst, such as platinum, that can produce hydrogen gas from water, the system can duplicate the water splitting reaction that occurs during photosynthesis.\n\nThe new catalyst works at room temperature, in neutral pH water, and is easy to set up, Nocera said. \"That's why I know this is going to work. It's so easy to implement,\" he said.\n\nNocera also said that sunlight has the greatest potential of any power source to solve the world's energy problems, since in one hour, enough sunlight strikes the Earth to provide the entire planet's energy needs for one year.\n\n\"This is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind. The importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem,\" added James Barber, a leader in the study of photosynthesis, the Ernst Chain Professor of Biochemistry at Imperial College London, and who called the discovery a \"giant leap\" toward generating clean, carbon-free energy on a massive scale.\n\nWhile this is a good start, the currently available electrolyzers that split water with electricity and are often used industrially, are not suited for artificial photosynthesis because they are very expensive and require a highly basic (non-benign) environment that has little to do with the conditions under which photosynthesis operates, Nocera said.\n\nAs such, more engineering work needs to be done to integrate the new scientific discovery into existing photovoltaic systems, but Nocera is confident that such systems will become a reality.\n\n\"This is just the beginning. The scientific community is really going to run with this,\" he added.\n\nNocera hopes that within 10 years homeowners will be able to power their homes in daylight through photovoltaic cells, while using excess solar energy to produce hydrogen and oxygen to power their own household fuel cell. Electricity-by-wire from a central source could be a thing of the past.\n\nThe project is part of the MIT Energy Initiative, a program designed to help transform the global energy system to meet the needs of the future and to help build a bridge to that future by improving today's energy systems."

To make the most of such different conditions you need specially tailored solar cells, according to UK firm Quantasol.\n\nSo the company has come up with a new solar cell design that can be tuned to the light at a particular latitude, and in the process broken a 21-year-old efficiency record for one type of solar cell.\n\nSemiconductor materials such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) are more efficient at converting light to electricity than the cheaper silicon cells most common today. First used in space, GaAs solar cells are beginning to find uses on Earth too.\n\nBut the uniform light conditions in space aren't matched on the ground. The atmosphere acts as a filter, so the light reaching Earth varies from place to place and with changing atmospheric conditions.\n\nTuned in\n\nQuantasol has now created GaAs solar cells that can be tuned to the prevailing light conditions of a particular place, to get the most out of the cells wherever they are.\n\nTo do that, the firm added indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) in layers just a few nanometres, called quantum wells. Like the GaAs that makes up the rest of the cell, they can absorb light to produce electric current. But they do so at very specific frequencies.\n\nThe wells can be tuned to absorb light at the frequencies that are most common in a particular place but aren't absorbed well by GaAs. Over time this strategy should extract more energy than an off-the-shelf solar cell.\n\nWorld record\n\nAfter the quantum wells have been tuned, the GaAs solar cell absorbs more of the incoming light than previous devices. The peak efficiency of the new cell is 28.3 per cent when exposed to light 500 times as strong as normal sunlight, a figure that has been confirmed by the Fraunhofer Institute of Solar Energy in Germany.\n\nThat may only be one-tenth of a percentage point higher than the previous world-record holder, but it's the first advance in 21 years.\n\nCommercial silicon solar cells are much cheaper than GaAs, but have an efficiency of just 10 to 12 per cent and are also bulkier. The Quantasol device can cope with much brighter light without becoming overloaded, making it possible to use a very small solar cell to absorb light collected by a system of cheap lenses and mirrors.\n\nBut more important than the peak efficiency is that the new cells can generate more electrical energy over the course of days and weeks, says Kevin Arthur, Quantasol CEO.\n\n\"The commercial market doesn't just want high efficiency, they want the device to be optimised to the environment,\" he says. \"In the past we measured performance in dollars per watt. Now it's cents per kilowatt-hour that's more3 Square Meters A Practical Minimum\n\nI wouldn't anticipate that those quantum wells will be around very long when the device is exposed to 500x ambient noon sunlight.\n\nThese devices will need to be cooled of course, and you have optical losses on the lense surfaces, so optimistcally 20% efficiency in practical terms. Maybe 15%.\n\nStill, 20% efficiency corresponds to roughly 300 watts per square meter. Say 1KW for every three square meters. So it would require 9 or so square meters of these devices to power my home with it's current energy consumption.\n\nMoving to a natural gas flash water heater would reduce that to about 6 square meters.\n\nMore efficient standby power for the electrical devices in this home would reduce the requirement to about 4.6 square meters\n\nBetter insulation on the refrigerator, and I'm down to 4 square meters.\n\nOLED lighting, and I'm down to 3.5 square meters.\n\nA Low power PC and OLED monitor, and I'm down to 3 square meters.\n\nAt that point, it starts to get hard to reduce the number of panels further.\n\n3 Square Meters A Practical Minimum\n\nThu Jul 02 10:07:36 BST 2009 by Mike\n\nI would use solar-thermal panels to heat my water, which would reduce the area required by a good amount. This combined with 10 sq meters of solar panels, a wind turbine (site permitting), a Li-Ion battery storage system, good insulation and efficient applicances would be the basis of an (almost) self sufficient system. My house uses an average of 600W through the day, but this can jump to over 8KW, if I put the kettle on at the same time as say, the electric oven and other cooking appliances.\n\nThe idea being that the solar cells/wind turbine produce much more electricity than the house requires during the day, which is stored in the Li-ion batteries. At night, the batteries / wind turbine supply the power. If the load exceeds the capacity of the system, (say a 8KW peak for a few minutes) power is then drawn from the grid.\n\n3 Square Meters A Practical Minimum\n\nThu Jul 02 16:52:43 BST 2009 by Vendicar Decarian\n\nYour total electrical energy consumption is around 30% higher than mine at the moment. And with a little effort I can reduce mine by around 10%. 20% easily with lighting that is in the works, and when that arrives, I'll convert to a flash water heater. (Gas), that will reduce consumption by another 25%.\n\nAt that point PV generation begins to become more practical.\n\nFor me, the next thing is to prep the house for passive solar heating.\n\nWInd generation is not practical in my area.

In contrast to being discarded like a primary battery, slowly recharged like a secondary battery, or rebuilt like a \"mechanically recharged\" battery, a zinc/air fuel cell can be conveniently refueled in minutes or seconds.\n\nZinc \"fuel,\" in the form of pellets about 1 mm in diameter, is consumed and releases electrons to drive a load (the anodic part of the electrochemical process). Oxygen from ambient air accepts electrons from the load (the cathodic part). The overall chemical reaction produces zinc oxide (ZnO), a non-toxic white powder. When all or part of the zinc has been consumed, removing the reaction product and adding fresh zinc pellets and electrolyte refuels the cell. The ZnO product is reprocessed into zinc pellets and oxygen in a separate recycling unit using electrolysis.\n\nThe technology is expected to displace lead-acid batteries where higher specific energy or very rapid recharges are valuable, and internal combustion engines where zero emissions, quiet operation, or lower maintenance costs are important"

      "text": "Harvesting Ambient Energy from Surrounding Sources\n\nFrank Schmidt of EnOcean looks at methods of harvesting energy for the surrounding environment and the new developments that are taking place.\n\nEnergy harvesting is a technology that has made huge progress in recent years and this is attributable to the major benefits available to installers, architects, contractors, developers and property owners alike.\n\nSince self-powered wireless devices eliminate the need for a power source, maintenance requirements such as battery replacement become a thing of the past. Also, as they communicate via radio frequency signals, they are freed from the cost and complexity of conventional wiring.\n\nThe last few years have witnessed the commercial delivery of these benefits and now, after three generations of evolution, energy harvesting is enabling entirely new, energy-saving application possibilities in building and industrial automation.\n\nSophisticated scavenging\n\nThe first requirement for designing self-powered wireless products was the ability to scavenge energy from the surrounding environment. Energy harvesting has been around for centuries: after all, windmills, tide mills and water turbines have been extracting raw energy from the environment to generate power since ancient times. The second requirement was to use this energy for efficient communication between different devices. Again, likely solutions have been assumed for some time, with low power radio systems such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.\n\nBringing these two needs together was the challenge that researchers in Siemens laboratories took up in the late 1990s, when they turned their attention to scavenging tiny amounts of energy to power wireless systems. It was apparent from the start that existing technologies were not efficient enough to make them work reliably. What was needed was to bring three key elements together: effective energy transducers, sophisticated electronics and software.\n\nHaving successfully identified the opportunity and potential solutions, in 2001 a new company - EnOcean - was established out of Siemens in order to exploit the new technology. EnOcean's wireless technology harvests the required power from the energy resources in the surroundings: motion, light or differences in temperature. The amount of energy obtained in this way is enough to transmit a wireless signal and turn on a light, for instance.\n\nThese radio telegrams, just one millisecond in duration, use an optimum data rate of 125 kilobits per second. To eliminate transmission errors, each telegram is typically repeated twice in the space of 30 milliseconds. Furthermore, data packets are transmitted at random intervals, so the probability of collision is extremely small. Using the 868MHz and 315MHz frequency bands, this technology can be used just about anywhere in the world.\n\nWireless transmission distances can reach approximately 300m in the open and up to 30m inside buildings. A refinement with new self-powered wireless modules is their individually attributed 32-bit identification number, which provides over 4billion unique IDs, to exclude any possibility of overlap with other wireless devices. Power conversion and radio transmission are complemented by sophisticated electronics and, most importantly, by intelligent software stacks that make it simple and straightforward to integrate the technology across a large variety of user applications.\n\nIn 2003, EnOcean commercialised its first generation of energy harvesting radio sensors based on piezoelectric powered modules. The second generation in 2007, which consolidated energy transducers, electronics and software, added the option of a new, more efficient means of mechanical power conversion - this time using miniature magnetic coils instead of piezoelectric devices.\n\nEarly acceptance in buildings\n\nExamples abound in the sector that recognised the advantages earliest - building automation. Building automation optimises energy savings and reduces operating costs by lowering total cost of ownership. Essential to the success of building automation projects, self-powered wireless technology gives architects, contractors and property owners the freedom to install all the sensors they need, of whatever type, wherever they like. Installation time is minimised and overall system costs are significantly reduced owing to device placement flexibility.\n\nWith conventional battery-powered sensors, the cost of monitoring, replacing and recycling batteries increases as more units are installed. Energy autonomous, battery-less sensors remove these headaches. The same advantages also apply to industrial plant installations. Having no batteries means zero maintenance and the wireless technology creates new possibilities to locate sensors in previously inaccessible areas or remote storage vessels.\n\nNew advances increase adoption\n\nNow, with the third generation of EnOcean wireless modules, there are even more compelling reasons why the building and industrial industries are adopting devices incorporating energy harvesting technology.\n\nFor OEMs developing new products, the fact that all sensor electronics are now integrated on a single chip brings more frugal power consumption, better performance and lower manufacturing costs. Furthermore, EnOcean's software now provides straightforward building blocks to make it simpler to design new products for automated mass production and bring them quickly to market.\n\nEnergy converters have also been developed further. For instance, the new electro-dynamic energy converter can generate more electrical power than ever from a single press of a switch; improved solar cells can garner light energy in dim indoor as well as outdoor installations; and the thermal energy harvester has been upgraded to power wireless sensor nodes from temperature differences of only a few degrees Celsius.\n\nAdditional new energy sources are setting the scene for a broad expansion of opportunities. Scavenging energy from small temperature fluctuations is one such area. EnOcean envisages rapid growth in the use of thermal gradient energy harvesters, especially in industrial plants where heat dissipation from machinery provides significant temperature differences.\n\nFor example, a sensor powered by thermal gradients can be optimally sited for condition monitoring purposes - such as cool-chain monitoring in cold stores and mobile refrigeration units. They are ideal for status monitoring in aircraft, too, and even small temperature differences between day and night time can be used to power a sensor.\n\nInnovative applications\n\nAnother key area for energy harvesting technology is the possibility to link industrial, building and home automation networks with other infrastructures, such a cellular phone networks, Wi-Fi or home entertainment networks. The result is a world where you are able to switch lights on and off via a mobile phone, check your security systems over the internet, adjust heating, ventilation and air conditioning via wireless LAN and monitor plant machinery from anywhere in the world.\n\nEnergy harvesting wireless networks of interoperable switching devices and sensors are integral to the advancement of this connected world and will continue to turn innovative opportunities into reality far into the future.\n\nFrank Schmidt is CTO and Founder of EnOcean. As Chief Technology Officer he is responsible for the overall technical orientation, patent related activities as well as the relationship management with educational, research and scientific organizations. Before Frank is a Physicist and studied at the Technical University of Chemnitz, Germany.\n\nEnOcean GmbH has pioneered and patented many new self-powered wireless technology ideas. Headquartered in Oberhaching near Munich, the company manufactures and markets maintenance-free wireless sensor solutions for use in buildings and industrial installations. EnOcean solutions are based on miniaturized energy converters, ultra-low-power electronic circuitry and reliable wireless. Combining these elements enables EnOcean and its product partners to offer sensor systems that are fundamental for energy-efficient buildings and innovative industry. Today wireless modules from EnOcean are chosen worldwide by more than 100 manufacturers to enable their system ideas for buildings and industry. Wireless components are already in use in over 100,000 buildings. EnOcean GmbH was founded in 2001 as a spin-off from Siemens AG. The company currently employs over 50 people in Germany and the USA."

      "text": "Archive for the 'Professional Tips' Category\n\nIs it possible to imagine people powering their cellular phone or music/video device while jogging on a sunny day?\n\nA University of Southern California team has produced flexible transparent carbon atom films that may have great potential for a brand new variety of solar cells.\n\nIn a paper recently published by the journal ACS Nano, researchers stated that organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells have been proposed as a technique to achieve low priced energy due to their ease of manufacture, light weight, and compatibility with flexible substrates.\n\nThe new work shows that graphene, an extremely conductive and highly transparent kind of carbon made up of atoms-thick sheets of carbon atoms, has high possibility to fill this role.\n\nWhile graphene's existence has been known for many years, it has only been studied extensively since 2004 because of the impracticality of manufacturing it in high quality and in quantity.\n\nThe University of southern California team has produced graphene/polymer sheets ranging in sizes about 150 square centimeters that in turn can be used to create dense arrays of flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells.\n\nThese organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices convert solar radiation to electricity, although not as efficiently as silicon cells.\n\nThe energy provided by sunlight on a sunny day is about 1,000 watts per meter square, for every 1,000 watts of sunlight that hits a square meter part of the standard silicon solar cell, 14 watts of electricity will be generated, Organic solar cells are less efficient; their conversion rate for that same 1,000 watts of sunlight in the graphene-based solar cell would be only 1.3 watts.\n\nBut what graphene organic photovoltaic (OPV) lack in efficiency, can potentially be compensated by its lower price and, greater physical flexibility.\n\nResearchers think it may eventually be possible to cover with inexpensive solar cell layers extensive areas like newspapers, magazines or power generating clothing.\n\nIn the meanwhile Prof. Ruoff and his colleagues of the mechanical engineering department at the University of Texas at Austin, are studying the basic science in the development of graphene-based ultracapacitors for usage in electronics and various fields.\n\nProf. Ruoff says batteries are relatively slow, they can store energy but take time to charge up, and then they distribute energy slowly, over time.\n\nUltracapacitors can be charged very quickly, within seconds, and discharge in a short time, but, today, they can't store very much electrical energy.\n\nThe development of stable and less costly ultracapacitors is seen as a key step in using wind or solar-generated power, particularly if researchers can find solutions to enable capacitors to store energy longer, that is not yet possible.\n\nEven with their current storage capacity, the graphene devices could provide quick energy when needed in certain situations on the green way.\n\nThey could be used, for example, to absorb heat generated in braking an automobile or train, and store it for a short time, and then use it for the electrical needs of the vehicle (i.e. starting the auto or acceleration)\n\nAbout the writer - Sophia H. Walker writes for the solar battery charger blog, her personal hobby site related to tips to help individuals save electricity using solar powered energy for small accessories.\n\nInterested in stepping-up your black & white game?\n\nBlack and white photography can sometimes be way better un revealing the whole composition and photographers vision than colored.\n\nHere are five tips to get you going in the right direction.\n\nPRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE\n\nAn experienced black & white photographer can see the world without color. Or probably in two only colors and their derivatives. They've trained their mind to pick up contrast and tone while blocking the distraction of colors.\n\nThis isn't a skill that you can pick up in a short amount of time; it's something that comes naturally in time.\n\nI can't say that I'm gifted enough to have monochrome vision, but I have been able to notice certain scenes and subjects that would lend themselves to black & white.\n\nOne way to help train your brain is to make a conscious effort — in other words, practice.\n\nPractice makes perfect, as you know. So don't be lazy, try to practice as much as you can. Nothing comes just right away.\n\nFOCUS ON CONTRAST\n\nBlack & white photography is about the black, the white, and all the tones in between. The human eye is built to pick up two things: light intensity and color. When you remove the color, your eyes become more sensitive to the light intensity. We naturally pick out areas of contrast — it's how we distinguish one thing from another. As a black & white photographer, your main objective is to make your point with shades of gray. Use contrast to show your onlookers what's important and what's not. Seek out scenes that naturally show signs of high contrast, and your black & white photos will be more compelling right from the start.\n\nFOCUS ON TEXTURE\n\nTexture is really just a form of contrast, but it is perceived quite differently. If you think about it, texture is the regular or irregular pattern of shadows and highlights at various intensities. Black & white photos really lend themselves to texture because color generally add another layer of complexity, thus masking most subtle textures. Look for areas of interesting texture that can be photographed by zeroing in on specific surfaces and examining them for signs of patterned contrast.\n\nThe choices you make in post-processing can really make a difference in the texture too.\n\nCAPTURE IN COLOR\n\nThis is mainly aimed at digital photographers… If your camera gives you the option of shooting in color or black & white, NEVER shoot in black & white. The camera is really capturing color, then converting to black & white. Photo editing software can do a much better job at the conversion, and you'll have more flexibility on the output of the final image. It's really amazing how different a photo can look solely based on the post-processing, so it's best not to limit yourself before the photo even makes it out of the camera.\n\nThe one exception to this rule is if you wanted to use the black & white capture to give you a preview of what the scene might look like as a monochrome image. It may help you identify good black & white scenes more immediately, but once you find your shot switch back over to color capture and shoot it again.\n\nUSE COLOR FILTERS\n\nBlack & white film photographers make use of color filters to change the captured tones in their photographs. Ever see those monochrome images with dark skies and puffy white clouds? That's not natural; it requires the use of color filtering to produce the desired effect.\n\nUsing an actual color filter with a digital camera is perfectly acceptable and it has its merits, but it's not completely necessary. Software like Photoshop has the ability to apply non-destructive color filters. It also has the ability to produce the same results as a color filter during the black & white conversion.\n\nWhen to Shoot\n\nMany digital photographers actually prefer to shoot images for Black and White in low contrast situations. So an dark or overcast day can be a great time to shoot out door shots.\n\nIronically these are the days that those who shoot only in color sit at home complaining about the 'poor light'. So next time you find yourself with a dark and gloomy day - shoot some black and white shots.\n\nComposition\n\nMost of the general tips on how to compose or frame a good shot apply just as well to black and white photography as they do when shooting in color - however the main obvious difference is that you're unable to use color to lead the eye into or around your shot. This means you need to train yourself to look at shapes, tones and textures in your frame as points of interest. Pay particularly attention to shadows and highlights which will become a feature of your shot.\n\nSo if you're interested in pursuing a little black & white photography, really think about these things — before, during, and after you shoot. Anybody can produce black & white photos, but it takes a little more thought and skill to produce good black & whites.\n\nHolding a camera steady is one of the main rules in photography. If you hold your cam properly, you will not get blurred images, which is often the result of hand shaking; you can shoot moving objects and create composition you planned.\n\nAs I've already mentioned blurred photos are often the result of shaking hands, especially if you shoot in low-light conditions (read more about Low Light Photography), when a camera is set at a low shutter speed. But even in daytime when there is enough light, you can end up with blurred images if your camera is not firmly fixed. Images that look sharp or relatively sharp on the LCD display, can turn into completely washed out photos on the computer monitor or in prints.\n\nThat is why the first task of any aspiring photographer is to learn holding a camera properly. Point-and-shoot digital cameras are small and light, that is why the problem of shaking hands arises usually because a photographer does not know how to hold a camera for optimal results.\n\nHOW TO PREVENT SHAKING-HAND EFFECT\n\n1. If you use an optical viewfinder and keep your camera in a proper way (look the pictures below), you can easily follow moving objects, for example children playing sport games and get sharp images.\n\nHold your camera with Holding a camera with two hands. Keep your one hand will NOT give arms tight to your body necessary steadiness.\n\n2. If you use an LCD monitor, your camera is in a less stable position, that is why in this case it is especially important to firmly hold a camera and keep your arms close to your body to provide stability. You can also try to stretch out your arms and your camera will be in a more stable position compared to half-bent arms. Hold a camera firmly when you press the shutter button.\n\nPress your arms tight When you hold a camera Do not press the shutter to your body to provide with one hand, a camera button too hard, otherwise stability to your camera. will shake more. the image will be blurred out."

      "text": "THE LONG RUN: University of Pennsylvania and University of Michigan researchers suggest an approach to power usage where a processor could run at, for example, 16 times its sustainable rate for about half a second and then throttle back so that the processor can cool down, until the next time a surge is needed. Image: Image courtesy of technotr, via iStockphoto.com\n\nThe demands placed on smart phones by marathon sessions of texting, streaming video and surfing the Web require that they have blazing-fast processors while, at the same time, be able to disburse the heat these processors generate. A team of engineers is proposing something of a counterintuitive model to designing smart phones in the future—one that has processors alternately powering up and then cooling down, more like sprinters than long-distance runners.\n\nHeat dissipation has become a major limitation to the computational power of processors used in smart phones, where there is no room for a fan or other type of cooling system. Only a fraction of the transistors on a smart phone's processor can safely operate at a time. The transistors that are shut down are known as \"dark silicon.\" According to the researchers, more transistors will only lead to more dark silicon because improvements in the processors' ability to dissipate heat are lagging.\n\nMany interactive applications on smart phones depend on short bursts of computational demand punctuated by long idle periods waiting for user input. Computational sprinting would activate otherwise powered-down processor cores (dark silicon) for subsecond bursts of intense parallel computation in response to such sporadic user activity. To handle the heat pulse from sprinting, the researchers propose encasing the processor in a phase-change material—something like candle wax—that would absorb heat by melting during the sprint, then slowly dissipate it by hardening while the device is at rest.\n\nMost of the heat generated by mobile phones comes from the processor, as opposed to the battery, says Thomas Wenisch, a study author and an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan. \"All of the power drawn by the processor turns into heat,\" he says. \"Only a fraction drawn from the battery is lost as heat within the battery due to battery inefficiency (internal resistance in the battery).\"\n\nNext up for the researchers is constructing a prototype, focusing on the thermal and material issues, says Milo Martin, another study author and an associate professor in the department of computer and information sciences at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Engineering and Applied Science. \"We are also looking at additional applications, mostly in the mobile space but also in other domains, such as servers,\" he adds.\n\nThe researchers also plan to investigate what impact sprinting would have on application design. \"This would dictate how programmers should exploit sprints and then deal with the fact that the phone might need to rest, and its impact on end-user satisfaction,\" Martin says.\n\n10 Comments\n\nAs I understand, powering down processors even for very short intervals would require persistent processor memory circuitry to maintain task state information. A small issue for these scientists, I'm sure!\n\nIt is possible to save critical cpu state information (program counter, interrupts etc.) in circuitry that is not powered down. Also, powering a core down does not neccessarily mean cutting it's power supply. In CMOS-design, the consumed power is for the biggest part due to loading parasitic capacitances of transistors and vias. Such loading can be cancelled by simply halting the core's clock. In this mode, neither DRAM, nor SRAM is lost. Remaining leakage currents are a minor issue on low voltage cpus in smartphones. Btw: very interesting article.\n\nThere is no 'non-critical' state information contained in any processor memory - all CPU registers and processor cache memory would have to be sustained by, as I understand, continuously refreshing its data. If this were to be achieved by electrically isolating its circuitry either on or off the processor chip I think their would be enormous performance penalties.\n\nBy non-critical state information, i referred to most registers, stack and heap. All of those are saved and restored on function call, return and interrupts thousands of times per second. This information is mapped to general adress-space, which can be transferred between different cache levels, ram and non volatile memory (a feature heavily used under most operating systems).\n\nThus, a straightforward implementation of a power-down event could either be triggered by the operating system, which has the advantage that it can suspend and withdraw all threads from that particular core as preparation, making any hardware \"state saving\" unnecessary, or by introducing a dedicated interrupt vector that does the same job. If all cpus are to be halted, the whole system can utilize acpi-conform power management, which already implements this feature (aka standby). by introducing a new power state, the acpi system could perform most the overhead.\n\ncpu registers are in many cases implemeted as SRAM or latches, wich require no refreshing. refreshing is an issue with DRAM, you are right jtdwyer, however it has already been solved for all power states (see \"suspend to ram\"). Moreover fast caches have to be realized as SRAM, which suffers no loss as long as enaugh voltage is applied. Thus, when the clock is halted, DRAM is not sustained, however SRAM is. that makes this naive technique feasible (in fact, very low clock frequencies are sometimes used in microcontrollers to decrease power consumption and in many systems, there is no lower limit to it).\n\nelectrically isolating an area on chip to prevent heat dissipation is not as hard, as it may sound. A single, strong driving transistor in the local power lines can do the job. this is, again, often employed in microcontrollers to cut power consumtion in peripherical systems (SPI/I2C/ADC - modules). This design suffers no performance issues, as it is no real electrical insulation, and has no overhead for signal lines (consider level changes, impedance matching etc).\n\n\"Static random-access memory (SRAM) is a type of semiconductor memory where the word static indicates that, unlike dynamic RAM (DRAM), it does not need to be periodically refreshed, as SRAM uses bistable latching circuitry to store each bit. SRAM exhibits data remanence,[1] but is still volatile in the conventional sense that data is eventually lost when the memory is not powered.\"\n\nYou're correct that SRAM does not require continuous refresh, but it is volatile.\n\nThe article's statement: \"Only a fraction of the transistors on a smart phone's processor can safely operate at a time. The transistors that are shut down are known as \"dark silicon.\"\" appears to be premature if not incorrect, as the \"dark silicon\" link leads to an article that discusses it as yet another proposal to meet foreseen power management requirements in 2020...\n\nYou'correct that registers are saved on module entry, but their values and the values of any processor storage is continuously modified as modules execute. What to happens to your applications when you remove the battery on your smart phone?\n\nI'm not knowledgeable of the power management implemented in PDAs and phones, but my impression is that when my laptop 'goes to sleep', it must be copying data in volatile memory to persistent storage (disk) for later restoration.\n\nFinally, scanning through the referenced research report, I see that it's based on a simulation model of the power usage characteristics of a multi-core processor chip in which the number of active cores would be dynamically varied. I'm not prepared to study the paper in detail, I strongly suspect that many \"software\" issues have not been fully identified, much less resolved.\n\nBy the way, from a system software perspective, the dynamic activation & deactivation of multiple 'core' processors within a chip is directly analogous to the process used for years in multi-processor mainframe systems to dynamically deactivate individual processors for service or for error recovery, allowing the system to continue normal, if somewhat degraded, operation.\n\nIndirectly, this is also analogous to some modern V-8 automobile engines that can be dynamically reconfigured as a 6 or 4 cylinder engine, reducing fuel requirements (albeit also reducing efficiency).\n\nAs these examples illustrate, this general concept is not groundbreaking and has been previously used in successful applications.\n\nI think that developing asynchronous microprocessors would be a better way to deal with reducing the power usage while keeping up performance. Asynchronous microprocessors were abandoned a while ago, if I remember correctly, as the circuitry was way too complicated compared to the current clock driven micro's we have today. But if you look at each instruction that the micro is performing and look at the actual circuits that are activated in the uP to perform these functions you will find that the wait states are mostly too long. This is required as the fasted cycle has to be as slow and the slowest function. But with today's technology we could switch over to asynchronous circuits where the function of each logic element includes a 'ready to run' signal and a 'execution complete' signal. The microprocessor then goes as fast as it can and when there is nothing left in the pipeline to execute it just sits and waits for the next operation, in a low powered state. This kind of architecture could consume about 70% less energy than the conventional synchronous circuits used in today's uP core.\n\nMore simply, I think that multicore chips are a straightforward strategy to add capacity for a given processor architecture. As chip circuit density increased, eventually enough real estate opened up to fit multiple chips, increasing the parallel capacity available to multiprocessor operating systems. Otherwise, the additional circuit capacity could only be used to increase processor cache, extend the architecture with new functions or specialized coprocessors"

The example that illustrates this is the first all-electric, battery-powered locomotive in the U.S. called Norfolk Southern Railway No. 999. It runs on one thousand lead-acid batteries, all of which should be fully charged in order to keep the locomotive in motion.\n\nA team from Penn State led by Christopher Rahn, professor of mechanical engineering, has discovered a way to solve the problem by developing experimental batteries that are rechargeable, cheap and simple.\n\nConsidering that sulfation is the main cause for damage of lead-acid batteries, the team decided to look into ways to reverse the process and by using limited number of sensors, electronics and supporting software, to rejuvenate the battery.\n\nTogether with research assistants Ying Shi and Christopher Ferone, Rahn exposed a lead-acid battery to conditions found in electric locomotives, and identified the main aging mechanisms of the power sources. Using electroimpedance spectroscopy, the team managed to identify sulfation and establish a charging algorithm.\n\nThe results of the study were published in the Journal of Power Sources. The scientists reported that this algorithm could control battery charging, reduce sulfation and stop charging before other forms of degradation take place.\n\nIn their study, the team compares the new battery with an old one, and reported that they were able to not only increase cell capacity by 41 percent and the overall battery capacity by 30 percent, but also they were able to desulfate it.\n\nIn addition, the researchers identified other processes that are responsible for capacity reduction. These include positive electrode corrosion, irreversible hard sulfation, positive electrode softening, electrolyte stratification and internal short-circulating and mechanical damage.\n\nThe aim of the team now is to find a model that can replace electroimpedance spectroscopy and allow them to charge a battery to the point just before sulfation. They hope that by developing this, they will be able to completely prevent the process from happening"

      "text": "Snails: Eat, Kill, use as a battery?\n\nThe view of many is that snails are either something to eat, something you accidentally squash underfoot, or a pest to keep at bay by pouring lines of salt in front of your garden flowers. However, a team of researchers at Ben-Gurion University, Israel, envision a potentially different future for your garden pest.\n\nHow about using a gastropod as a source of fuel?\n\nThe study, 'Implanted Biofuel Cell Operating in a Living Snail' has been published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. As grim as it may sound, and as Chemistry World pointed out, by using the kind of technology suggested in the film The Matrix, the researchers managed to implant a biofuel cell into a living land snail in order to generate electricity.\n\nEach cell is made from carbon nanotude 'paper', modified with enzymes that produce sugar. As the snail fed or relaxed, some of the glucose generated found its way into the fuel cell — therefore generating an electrical output.\n\nThe 'electric' snail was able to continually renew these glucose levels consumed by biocatalytic electrodes, and maintain this kind of energy generation for long periods of time.\n\nBy using such a small organism, the maximum power output achieved from the biofuel cells was only 7.45µW, so even for a low-consumption device it would take a substantial amount of snails to power.\n\n — where electricity is generated by the 'host' itself rather than an external source.\n\nImplantable biofuel cells have been suggested as a means to sustainably power devices operating in living organisms, but there are few examples currently available, especially in the cases of abiotic and enzyme-based biofuel cells operating in animals.\n\nThe team reports that the snail with the implanted biofuel cell was able to continue living naturally without detrimental effects caused by the implant, and the success of this experiment shows there may be a way to power electrical devices through a 'host' in the future\n\nSnails as batteries\n\nSo does this mean that in the future we could have a basment full of snails, rather than a roof full of solar panels. The thought of living of the lives of other creatures makes humans sound like leaches, although in monitary terms I suppose there are already plenty out there.\n\nIt does sound a little like the Matrix\n\nMy first thought, even before I read the article was that it sounded like the way the machines harvested energy in The Matrix. But after reading the piece, and realizing we all generate electricity to live, the idea of using our own built-in power to run our own \"accessories\" is a breakthrough. It would be great to see electronic implants not requiring invasive surgery to simply change out a battery.\n\nLet's 'Matrix' a bit more on that\n\nIt says in the article \"...some of the glucose generated found its way into the fuel cell ??? therefore generating an electrical output.\" So, if I understand this right, then this is an invention that could help diabetics. Place some of that nanostuff in a diabetic's nose and he/she can power their iPod by eating candy. Great!\n\nCould we do that with politicians?\n\nIf people werent so tetchy about artificial genomes,\n\nthis kind of research wouldnt be so contentious.\n\nI mean breeding snails to use as a power source, quoted as being too small to be of any real use... Whats the point? The money and thought would be better aimed at growing a biological battery based on lower life redesigned to do the job, and also less likely to upset the fanatics and animal-lovers - The research is going ahead anyway, as is artificially sequenced life.\n\nThe technology to print nanostructures to grow the cells in is here, now, why are they still poking wires into animals?\n\nRe-Read\n\nOK people, to keep you from having to read it over again, here's your answer taken from the article: \" ??? where electricity is generated by the ???host??? itself rather than an external source.\"\n\nThanks, I got that.\n\nI'm not taken in by the matrix thing either, I did say battery. My point was that if they are going to do any research into using living tissue to generate electricity - be it for powering a city or a medical device - it'd best be based on artificially designed cells for ethical as well as technical reasons, biocompatibility and efficiency being two that spring to mind. I have no problem with sticking electrodes into people (they can ***** if it sparks) but animal research is getting old rather fast"

      "text": "Researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory have developed a new fuel cell catalyst that is much different from its conventional counterparts. In a fuel cell, catalysts are used to generate chemical conversions and produce hydrogen gas. These catalysts are typically made of a significant amount of platinum, making them expensive enough to be unviable for widespread commercial use. Scientists at Brookhaven believe that their latest development could change all of that.\n\nThe catalyst they have created is capable of generating hydrogen gas. It can also take hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide and convert them into a liquid state. This process is achieved without use of excessive amount of energy or heat production, making it safe and efficient. Once converted into a liquid state, hydrogen and carbon dioxide can be stored easily enough. Furthermore, this conversion process does not produce harmful byproducts, which means fuel cells using this new catalyst will remain zero-emissions energy systems.\n\nBrookhaven scientists note that this is not the first catalyst to be able to power this sort of conversion, but it is the first to be able to do so at room temperature. Researchers note that this catalyst is somewhat less expensive than conventional models. Couple that with the ability to convert gases into liquids, fuel cells using the catalyst could become a very powerful type of energy system capable of creating and storing their own fuel source"

      "text": "Thermoelectric nanoparticles: an example of one of the nanoscale thermoelectric materials synthesised by Cranfield University\n\nOn the battlefield, excess weight can be a life-threatening burden. Nanotechnology and smart fabrics are helping the Armed Forces to reduce equipment weight and improve operational efficiency, says Will Stirling.\n\nA soldier typically-equipped for battle can lug around 70kg of equipment, according to the Ministry of Defence. Much of this is taken up by heavy battery packs used to charge the radio, night vision goggles, satnav and so on. Such bulk weighs the solider down, increases fatigue, reduces motor efficiency and simply creates a bigger target for the enemy.\n\nIt's small wonder then that the British Armed Forces are looking to technology to lighten the load.\nNanotechnology can potentially provide the answers. There are three principle methods for generating electricity at the nanoscale; converting energy from the body (kinetic), the sun (solar) and transferring heat from a fire when cooking (thermal).\n\nLuckily for the soldier, all three can potentially be applied to military equipment, says Professor Rob Dorey of Cranfield University, who holds the chair in nanomaterials at the postgraduate-only university.\n\"A thermoelectric device is able to convert heat to electricity, so you can generate power from an engine or body heat, solar heating, or even from a fire,\" says Prof Dorey. \"The nice thing about this technology is that a temperature difference is required, so it will work in both hot and cold environments.\"\n\nA soldier could start cranking a dynamo at the end of a long yomp, but that's not practicable, he says. \"The key to successful energy harvesting is that the presence of the harvester is not noticed and that it is not a conscious decision to use it.\"\n\nHow it works\nThermoelectric devices generate a tiny electrical charge by conducting electrons or protons, creating a difference in the concentration of 'charge carriers' at opposite ends of a material (see diagram).\n\nThe electrical current produced by this concentration gradient is very small, but multiply it enough times and the thermoelectric (TE) device can produce meaningful amounts of energy. Conceivably, TE devices embedded inside backpacks and ancillary equipment which experience temperature changes can generate small, continuous charges that are stored in a slimline battery for deployment at camp.\n\nThis could be coupled to piezo-electric harvesters, which scavenge kinetic energy. Piezoelectricity is the charge that accumulates in certain solid materials in response to applied mechanical stress; therefore, ideal for a physical combat environment. Finally, Prof Dorey likens the solar thermoelectric device to a much smaller version of a gadget familiar to some mobile phone owners, the 'Solar Thief'. This is a fold-out plastic device using photovoltaic panels and 'joule thieves' to convert solar energy to charge, primarily, mobile phones.\n\nLike the Solar Thief, most nano-energy harvesting came to the defence sector from civilian applications.\n\nEuropean Thermodynamics Ltd in Leicestershire is working with Cranfield University to develop more practical applications of TE devices and piezo-harvesters. European Thermodynamics (ETL) specialises in designing and making thermal management devices – mainly for \"keeping cool\", says the company's Mark Robins. \"Our core business in the past has been in telecommunications, where our devices are used to keep battery arrays at certain optimum temperatures. We've not tapped defence yet, but we have our eye on these applications.\"\n\nInterestingly, most TE applications are engineered to convert electrical energy from heat. But ETL took flipped this principle, to extract heat energy for cooling. Another everyday use of this technique is mini-refrigerator for office desktops.\n\nSmart ink bridges the materials gap\nCranfield is now working with ETL and other organisations on special ink. \"Nano-thermoelectric ink can allow integration of thermoelectrics with a range of objects,\" says Dorey. \"The beauty is that the particles are only 30nm. Because they're so tiny it allows us to process materials at very low temperatures and for integrating the material with polymers, ceramics and metals, which can be hard to blend.\"\n\nThis material compatibility allows a wider range of applications. For example, experts at defence group BAE Systems are exploring the use of nanotechnology to investigate corrosion on aluminium airframes.\n\nWhat about combat apparel? \"It will be five to 10 years before TE devices can be incorporated properly into clothing,\" says Dorey.\nEven so, a British company has taken a different route to solving the same challenge of reducing battlefield weight. Intelligent Textiles has patented several techniques for weaving complex conductive fabrics. The military application is brilliantly simple; remove cables and battery mass by weaving these items into the integral clothing fabric.\n\n\"One of the problems with conventional cables is that breakages can be catastrophic,\" Asha Thompson, director of Intelligent Textiles, told the BBC in April. \"Here we build-in redundancy, so that if the fabric gets cut, damaged or torn, we still have a way of re-routing the data.\"\n\nThe company has received £234,000 from the Centre for Defence Enterprise, a gateway for funding in science and engineering where the invention has a defence application. The CDE also wants to find solutions for reducing the physical and the \"cognitive\" burden placed on soldiers"

      "text": "Scientists use X-ray imaging to observe running batteries in action\n\nJul 18, 2012\nBut lithium-sulfur technology has a major drawback: After a few dozen cycles of charging and discharging, the battery stops working.\n\n\"The cycle life of lithium-sulfur batteries is very short,\" said Johanna Nelson, a postdoctoral scholar at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory at Stanford University. \"Typically, after a few tens of cycles the battery will die, so it isn't viable for electric vehicles, which require many thousands of cycles over a 10- or 20-year lifetime.\"\n\nA typical lithium-sulfur battery consists of two electrodes – a lithium metal anode and a sulfur-carbon cathode – surrounded by a conductive fluid, or electrolyte. Several studies have attributed the battery's short cycle life to chemical reactions that deplete the cathode of sulfur.\n\nBut a recent study by Nelson and her colleagues is raising doubts about the validity of previous experiments. Using high-power X-ray imaging of an actual working battery, the Stanford-SLAC team discovered that sulfur particles in the cathode largely remain intact during discharge. Their results, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS), could help scientists find new ways to develop commercially viable lithium-sulfur batteries for electric vehicles.\n\n\"Based on previous experiments, we expected sulfur particles to completely disappear from the cathode when the battery discharges,\" said Nelson, the lead author of the JACS study. \"Instead, we saw only negligible changes in the size of the particles, the exact opposite of what earlier studies found.\"\n\nThis video is not supported by your browser at this time -- Credit: Mark Shwartz/Precourt Institute for Energy, Stanford\n\nNelson and her co-workers conducted their experiments at SLAC using two powerful imaging techniques: X-ray diffraction and transmission X-ray microscopy. The X-ray microscope enabled the researchers to take nanosize snapshots of individual sulfur particles before, during and after discharge – the first real-time imaging of a lithium-sulfur battery in operation.\n\n\"The standard way to do high-resolution imaging is with electron microscopes after the battery has partially discharged,\" Nelson said. \"But electrons don't penetrate metal and plastic very well. With SLAC's X-ray microscope, we can actually see changes that are happening while the battery is running.\"\n\nPesky polysulfides\n\nIn lithium-sulfur batteries, an electric current is generated when lithium ions in the anode react with sulfur particles at the cathode during discharge. The byproducts of this chemical reaction are compounds known as lithium polysulfides.\n\nProblems can arise when the polysulfides leak into the electrolyte and permanently bond with the lithium metal anode. \"When that happens, all of the sulfur material in the polysulfides is lost,\" Nelson said. \"It will never recycle. You don't want to lose active sulfur material every time the battery discharges. You want a battery that can be cycled multiple times.\"\n\nPrevious experiments also showed the formation of dilithium sulfide (Li2S) crystals during the discharge phase. \"Crystalline Li2S and polysulfides can form a thin film that prevents the conduction of electrons and lithium ions,\" Nelson said. \"The film acts as an insulating layer that can cause the battery to die.\"\n\nSeveral studies using electron microscopes produced images of electrodes coated with polysulfides and crystalline Li2S, and cathodes depleted of sulfur. Those images led researchers to conclude that much of the sulfur had been chemically transformed into Li2S-polysulfide sheets that prevented the battery from operating.\n\nFlawed findings\n\nBut according to Nelson and her colleagues, some of the previous studies were flawed. \"The approach they were using was mistaken,\" Nelson said. \"Typically, they would cycle the battery, disassemble it, wash away the electrolyte and then analyze it with X-ray diffraction or an electron microscope. But when you do that, you also wash away all of the polysulfides that are loosely trapped on the cathode. So when you image the cathode, you don't see any sulfur species at all.\"\n\nThe Stanford-SLAC team took a different approach. Researchers used the transmission X-ray microscope at SLAC to take multiple images of tiny sulfur particles every five minutes while the battery discharged. Each particle was a fraction of the size of a grain of sand. The results were clear: Every particle retained its basic shape and size throughout the discharge cycle.\n\n\"We expected the sulfur to completely disappear and form polysulfides in the electrolyte,\" Nelson said. \"Instead we found that, for the most part, the particles stayed where they were and lost very little mass. They did form polysulfides, but most of those were trapped near the carbon-sulfur cathode. We didn't have to disassemble the battery or even stop it, because we could image the sulfur content while the device was operating.\"\n\nX-ray diffraction yielded an additional surprise. \"Based on previous experiments, we expected that crystalline Li2S would form at the end of the discharge cycle,\" she said. \"But we did a very deep discharge and never saw any Li2S in its crystalline state.\"\n\nFuture research\n\nThe Stanford-SLAC study could open new avenues of research that could improve the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries, said co-author Michael Toney, head of the Materials Sciences Division at SLAC's Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource.\n\n\"Our study demonstrates the importance of using high-power X-ray technologies to study batteries while they are operating,\" Toney said. \"From an engineering standpoint, it's valuable to know that relying on standard electron microscopy to test the fidelity of materials may give you deceptive results.\"\n\nSeveral research labs are looking for new ways to trap polysulfides on the cathode. A variety of techniques have shown promise, including novel electrolytes and carbon nanotubes coated with sulfur.\n\nBut the polysulfide problem might not be as daunting as previous studies suggest.\n\n\"We found that very few of the polysulfides went into the electrolyte,\" Nelson said. \"The carbon-sulfur cathode actually trapped them better than expected. But even a small amount of polysulfides will cause the battery to fail within 10 cycles. If scientists want to improve the cycle life of the battery, they need to prevent virtually all of the polysulfides from leaking into the electrolyte. If they really want to know what's going on inside the battery, they can't just use standard analysis. They need a technology that tells the whole story.\"\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- By wrapping tiny sulfur particles in graphene sheets, researchers from Stanford University have synthesized a promising cathode material for rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries that could A common problem with notebook computers is that the battery delivers power for far too short a time, which only gets shorter as it gets older.

Sirkar, who holds more than 20 patents in the field of membrane separation, said that using his technology, engineers will be able to recover water from brines with the highest salt concentrations. The Bureau of Reclamation in the Department of Interior is funding the project.\n\n\"Our process will work especially well with brines holding salt concentrations above 5.5 percent,\" Sirkar said. Currently, 5.5 percent is the highest percentage of salt in brine that can be treated using reverse osmosis.\n\n\"We especially like our new process because we can fuel it with low grade, inexpensive waste heat,\" Sirkar said. \"Cheap heat costs less, but can heat brine efficiently.\"\n\nThe science behind Sirkar's membrane distillation process is simple. The inexpensive fuel heats the water forcing it to evaporate from the salt solution. The cleansed vapor then travels through nano-sized pore in the membrane to wind up condensed in the cold water on the membrane's other side.\n\n\"The basic principles of membrane separation have been known for a long time,\" said Sirkar. \"Intestines in animals and humans are semi-permeable membranes. Early experiments to study the process of separation were performed by chemists using samples of animal membranes.\"\n\nToday, membrane separation processes depend on the design of the membrane and the membrane module. The size of the pores is often key to determining which molecular components in either a liquid or gas form will pass through the membrane. Typically molecules flow from a region of high to low concentration. Pressure or concentration differences on both sides of the membrane cause the actual separation to occur. As pore size decreases, the membrane's efficie"

      "text": "New process for storing and generating hydrogen to run fuel cell cars\n\nFuel cell cars have come one step closer to practicality with researchers from Indiana's Purdue University announcing a new process for the generation and storage of hydrogen. The process is called hydrothermolysis, and is a combination of hydrolysis and thermolysis – the two prevalent methods of hydrogen generation that some scientists consider impractical for use in automobiles. The new process utilizes powdered ammonia borane, a chemical that has one of the highest hydrogen yields of any solid substance.\n\nAmmonia borane contains 19.6 percent hydrogen by weight, which means that when combined with water, a little of it can go a long way. To release that hydrogen using hydrolysis, a separate catalyst would need to be added, while in the case of thermolysis, the material would need to be heated to over 170C (330F). Hydrothermolysis, on the other hand, does the job without needing a catalyst, and at a temperature close to the regular running temperature of fuel cells.\n\nWhat's more, the cells' waste heat can be used to operate the hydrogen generation reactor, and that reactor must only maintain a pressure of 200psi, as opposed to the 5,000psi needed by current compressed hydrogen gas systems.\n\nThe researchers determined that a temperature of 85C (185F) and a concentration of 77 percent ammonia borane was ideal for maximum hydrogen yields. Under the best possible conditions, released hydrogen accounted for about 14 percent of the combined weight of the ammonia borane and water used in the process. This is reportedly much higher than hydrogen yields from other systems.\n\n\"This is important because the U.S. Department of Energy has set a 2015 target of 5.5 weight percent hydrogen for hydrogen storage systems, meaning available hydrogen should be at least 5.5 percent of a system's total weight,\" said Prof. Arvind Varma, head of Purdue's School of Chemical Engineering. \"If you're only yielding, say, 7 percent hydrogen from the material, you're not going to make this 5.5 percent requirement once you consider the combined weight of the entire system, which includes the reactor, tubing, the ammonia borane, water, valves and other required equipment.\"\n\nThe team is now looking at scaling up the size of their reactor, with the intention of being able to power a vehicle for 350 miles without refueling. That said, they believe that hydrothermolysis could additionally be used to recharge the batteries of small electronic devices - perhaps giving the HYDROFILL system a run for its money? They are also looking into ways of recycling the waste products back into ammonia borane.\n\nThe research was recently published in the AIChE Journal, published by the American Chemical Societycan anyone tell me where i can find more information about ammonia borane?\n\nbio-power jeff 23rd June, 2010 @ 05:43 am PDT\n\nGreat, turn every car into an active factory.\n\nThat is not complicated or expensive......\n\n-Dennis\n\n\n\nPrometheusGoneWild.com 23rd June, 2010 @ 06:40 am PDT\n\nI wonder how many will remember that George W.

Their discovery points the way toward more efficient solar cells.\n\nCredit: The University of Texas at Austin\n\nZhu and his colleagues report their results in this week's Science.\n\nThe scientists have discovered a method to capture the higher energy sunlight that is lost as heat in conventional solar cells.\n\nThe maximum efficiency of the silicon solar cell in use today is about 31 percent. That's because much of the energy from sunlight hitting a solar cell is too high to be turned into usable electricity. That energy, in the form of so-called \"hot electrons,\" is lost as heat.\n\nIf the higher energy sunlight, or more specifically the hot electrons, could be captured, solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency could be increased theoretically to as high as 66 percent.\n\n\"There are a few steps needed to create what I call this 'ultimate solar cell,'\" says Zhu, professor of chemistry and director of the Center for Materials Chemistry. \"First, the cooling rate of hot electrons needs to be slowed down. Second, we need to be able to grab those hot electrons and use them quickly before they lose all of their energy.\"\n\nZhu says that semiconductor nanocrystals, or quantum dots, are promising for these purposes.\n\nAs for the first problem, a number of research groups have suggested that cooling of hot electrons can be slowed down in semiconductor nanocrystals. In a 2008 paper in Science, a research group from the University of Chicago showed this to be true unambiguously for colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals.\n\nZhu's team has now figured out the next critical step: how to take those electrons out.\n\nThey discovered that hot electrons can be transferred from photo-excited lead selenide nanocrystals to an electron conductor made of widely used titanium dioxide.\n\n\"If we take the hot electrons out, we can do work with them,\" says Zhu. \"The demonstration of this hot electron transfer establishes that a highly efficient hot carrier solar cell is not just a theoretical concept, but an experimental possibility.\"\n\nThe researchers used quantum dots made of lead selenide, but Zhu says that their methods will work for quantum dots made of other materials, too.\n\nHe cautions that this is just one scientific step, and that more science and a lot of engineering need to be done before the world sees a 66 percent efficient solar cell.\n\nIn particular, there's a third piece of the science puzzle that Zhu is working on: connecting to an electrical conducting wire.\n\n\"If we take out electrons from the solar cell that are this fast, or hot, we also lose energy in the wire as heat,\" says Zhu. \"Our next goal is to adjust the chemistry at the interface to the conducting wire so that we can minimize this additional energy loss. We want to capture most of the energy of sunlight. That's the ultimate solar cell.\n\n\"Fossil fuels come at a great environmental cost,\" says Zhu. \"There is no reason that we cannot be using solar energy 100 percent within 50 years.\"\n\nFunding for this research was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy.

Additionally, during natural disasters, it can be difficult for stricken areas to have access to the power they need. One company, The Essential Element, hopes to provide what is needed with the help of Hydra, a portable device that is designed to purify water while powering a fuel cell that can be used to power communications devices and even offer fuel for a camp stove.\n\nIEEE Spectrum reports on what can be done with the 2.88 kilowatts of power generated by Hydra's solar panel array:\n\nAccording to Strizki, that is enough to do the following: power a 900-watt pump that draws water to and through the unit's self-cleaning filtration device, top off a bank of lead-acid gel batteries capable of storing 900 ampere-hours, and run an electrolyzer that splits enough water to fill a 0.37-cubic-meter propane tank with hydrogen pressurized to 140 000 kilograms per square meter.\n\nHydra is meant to be self-maintaining, and it is also designed to be packed away. That way, once a need in an area has been fulfilled, the solar panels can be folded down, and the whole device can be carted away without leaving an environmental impact. The device is also meant to be \"smart\": When the water filtration system senses that it is becoming ineffective, it begins back-flushing. Another advantage is that it comes with photovoltaic mats that can be plugged in for additional power.\n\nIf Hydra works as well as promised, it could be a real help in areas struck by catastrophe, as well as in other areas where power and clean water are in short supply.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nThe hose took brownish water from the scummy Schuylkill River in Philadelphia to a strange apparatus on the bank -- a trailer with a solar panel, a hydrogen tank, and other odd parts with flashing digital readouts.As water and fuel remained scarce in the weeks following the earthquake in Haiti earlier this year, one resource that relief teams could have used to help prevent dehydration literally surrounds the Caribbean ...\n\nResearchers at Missouri University of Science and Technology are developing a portable, hydrogen-generating power system to power everything from laptops to communications gear for soldiers in the battlefield.\n\nScientists are reporting a major advance in technology for water photooxidation �using sunlight to produce clean-burning hydrogen fuel from ordinary water.

Following removal, the metals could sell for use in electronics parts.\n\n\"Just like any batteries, eventually the fuel goes bad, and you have to treat it,\" said Nathalie Wall, assistant professor and project member.\n\nIn burning the fuel, other elements are produced, some of which are highly desirable precious metals that can be used in electronics, Wall said.\n\nAssociate professor Aurora Clark leads the project. Clark, a computational chemist, aims to create a software program in the next three years to identify molecules that effectively remove palladium, rhodium, ruthenium and even silver, platinum and gold from spent fuel.\n\nA single ton of spent nuclear fuel can contain hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of these precious metals, Clark said.\n\nWall will work with Paul Benny, an associate professor, to create solutions that mimic spent nuclear fuel for the program. Working with actual spent nuclear fuel would be too dangerous at this point, Wall said.\n\nNonetheless, the solution will contain the precious metals the professors hope to extract from spent nuclear fuel.\n\nClark said she sees the project extending beyond its three-year funding span. At that point, she plans to actually start getting the software out to the nuclear fuel industry.\n\nShe said though there is a greater push for renewable energy use, the transition to cleaner sources will take a while.

Certain biological systems living in low light environments have unique protein structures for photosynthesis that use quantum dynamics to convert 100% of absorbed light into electrical charge, displaying astonishing efficiency that could lead to new understanding of renewable solar energy, suggests research published today in the journal Nature Physics.\n\nThe research resolves an important mystery in the newly-emerging field of quantum biology – the origins and longevity of the quantum, wave-like properties that transport energy during the early stages of photosynthesis, phenomena unexpectedly observed in molecular complexes extracted from a variety of plants, algae and bacteria.\n\nIn photosynthesis, light photons absorbed by pigments such as chlorophyll create excited molecular states, excitons, that carry energy as quantum waves through networks of pigments held in place by protein structures – or pigment-protein complexes (PPCs) – to each PPC's reaction centre, where the exciton's energy is used to release electrons needed for photosynthetic chemistry. Preventing the trapping or dissipation of excitons during this journey is a key problem in both nature and man-made solar cells.\n\nResearch from Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory studying light-harvesting proteins in Green Sulpher Bacteria – which can survive at depths of over 2,000 metres below the surface of the ocean – has found a mechanism in PPCs that helps protect energy from dissipating while travelling through the structure by actually reversing the flow of part of the escaped energy – by reenergising it back to exciton level through molecular vibrations.\n\nThese PPCs, in this case the bacteria's Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex, ensure that every photon absorbed makes it to the structure's reaction centre – crucial for an organism's survival in the planet's most inhospitable environments, where little light penetrates.\n\n\"Once the detailed structure of the protein vibrations was included in our simulations, we found that the energy of the excitons does not just continually decrease as they are funnelled towards their final position – something you might expect in the complex thermal conditions found in biological systems,\" said Dr Alex Chin, from Cambridge's Winton Programme for the Physics of Sustainability, who conducted the research with Prof. Martin Plenio, Prof. Susana Huelga, Dr Felipe Caycedo-Soler and Robert Rosenbach from the Institute of Theoretical Physics at Universität Ulm in Germany and Dr Javier Prior from the University of Cartagena.\n\n\"In fact, our research suggests that these natural PPCs can achieve 'hot and fast' energy transfer – energy flows that prevent complete cooling to the temperature of their surroundings – which has been proposed as a way of improving solar cell efficiency beyond limits currently imposed by thermodynamics.\"\n\nThe researchers contend that the exceptional light-harvesting capacity of these protein systems is down to intricate processes of energy transport that fall outside 'classical' physics, depending strongly on tropes of quantum physics – primarily that of 'quantum coherence'.\n\nQuantum coherence in photosynthesis involves energy, in the form of the particle-like excitons, moving through the molecular structure using multiple channels simultaneously. This quantum coherence is usually very fragile and quickly destroyed by random fluctuations of surrounding proteins – so the observation of long-lasting coherence in PPCs came as a complete surprise to many researchers.\n\n\"Quantum coherence appears to increase the speed of energy flow across molecules and preventing it from getting stuck in local traps or defects,\" said Chin, adding that \"Our results provide a microscopic basis for understanding how the coherence, central to these theories, is maintained in PPCs. The resulting insights provide several promising clues as to what efficiency advantages quantum coherence might provide to these systems\".\n\n\"Some of the key issues in current solar cell technologies appear to have been elegantly and rigorously solved by the molecular architecture of these PPCs – namely the rapid, lossless transfer of excitons to reaction centres.\"\n\nAs Chin points also out, stabilising 'quantum coherence', particularly at ambient temperatures – something the researchers have begun to explore – is an important goal for future quantum-based technologies, from advanced solar cells to quantum computers and nanotechnology.\n\n\"This new understanding of how to maintain coherence in excitons, and even regenerate it through molecular vibrations, provides a fascinating glimpse into the intricate design solutions – seemingly including quantum engineering – that nature has produced through evolution, and which could provide the inspiration for new types of room temperature quantum devices.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nRecently, academic debate has been swirling around the existence of unusual quantum mechanical effects in the most ubiquitous of phenomena, including photosynthesis, the process by which organisms convert light into chemical Researchers working together from the University of Chicago and Washington University in St. Louis, have found more evidence that suggests quantum effects are at play as plants use energy from the sun to ...\n\nThe future of clean green solar power may well hinge on scientists being able to unravel the mysteries of photosynthesis, the process by which green plants convert sunlight into electrochemical energy. To ...\n\nPhotosynthesis is one of nature's finest miracles. Through the photosynthetic process, green plants absorb sunlight in their leaves and convert the photonic energy into chemical energy that is stored as sugars\"Here we show that the non-trivial spectral structures of protein fluctuations can generate non-equilibrium processes that lead to the spontaneous creation and sustenance of electronic coherence, even at physiological temperatures.\" explain"

A team of researchers has just announced a new paint-on battery design. The technique could change the way batteries are produced and eliminate restrictions on the surfaces used for energy storage.\n\nThe paint-on battery, like all lithium ion batteries, consists of five layers: a positive current collector, a cathode that attracts positively charged ions, an ion-conducting separator, an anode to attract negative ions, and a negative current collector. For each layer, the challenge was to find a way to mix the electrically conductive material with various polymers to create a paint that could be sprayed onto surfaces.\n\nNeelam Singh, a member of the team of materials scientists and chemists from Rice University in Houston and Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium and lead author of the paper, says, \"It was really exciting to find out. Can we really paint a battery on various surfaces and convert any object into a storage device?\"\n\nSingh says her team's work is filling a need in the socially critical field of energy storage for new battery designs. \"We find that the focus of research is now shifting towards integration of batteries,\" she says. That is, people are trying to design batteries that can be built into a variety of different objects. Several teams are working to make thin and flexible batteries as well as batteries that can be incorporated into textiles. Solar energy is one of the applications that researchers are particularly interested in. Solar panels can require large surface areas, and the Rice team's design is an efficient way to collect and store energy in this realm."

As alternative energy gains more attention, the issue of storage is becoming a more important subject. Researchers all over the world have begun to tackle the issues that relate to storage and while many have found success through various methods, efficient storage still remains a problem. A new report from Frost & Sullivan, a research and consulting firm, suggests that hydrogen may be the key to solving the problem of energy storage.\n\nReport suggests that the inherent properties of hydrogen make it a viable energy storage mechanism\n\nThere are currently four options that have emerged as effective energy storage methods. Hydrogen is the least efficient among these options but may be the most effective. The report notes that hydrogen has automatic controls built into it, allowing it to respond to changes in environment quickly. This inherent feature of hydrogen enabled the rapid storage and release of energy. It also means that hydrogen has the potential to correct problems in energy storage systems as it has a response time of less than one minute.\n\nHydrogen boasts of various uses apart from energy production\n\nHydrogen has been growing in popularity recently, mostly because of the increased popularity of hydrogen fuel cells. Fuel cells have taken the auto industry by storm, where they are being used to power new vehicles. Fuel cells produce hydrogen gas through a process known as electrolysis. After its production, the gas is often used to generate electricity, but this is not the only use of hydrogen. The gas can also be used in utility-scale storage of energy.\n\nIf the issue of efficient energy storage can be resolved, alternative energy is expected to experience rapid acceleration in terms of application and development. The hydrogen market could experience growth as a result of heightened attention for its uses in storage as well. Until efficient storage is accomplished, however, the growth of alternative energy is expected to be sluggish"

The carbon nanotubes heat up as they absorb light, and the heat differential between the environment and inside the actuator causes the LCE to shrink.\n\nThis causes the entire assembly to bow in the direction of the strongest sunlight. As the sun moves across the sky, the actuators will cool and re-expand, and new ones will shrink, re-positioning the panel over the 180 degrees of sky that the sun covers in the course of the day.\n\nThis video is not supported by your browser at this time.\n\nArtificial heliotropism in action.\n\n\"The idea is that wherever the sun goes, it will follow,\" says Jiang.\n\nIn Jiang's tests, the system improved the efficiency of solar panels by 10 percent, an enormous increase considering material improvements in the solar panels themselves only net increases of a few percent on average. And a passive system means there are no motors and circuits to eat into increased energy harvest.\n\n\"The whole point of solar tracking is to increase the electricity output of the system,\" says Jiang.\n\nThe materials driving Jiang's design have only been available in the past few years, so for now, he and his team are researching ways to refine them for use driving larger solar panels, where the net energy gain from his system will be the greatest.\n\nBut eventually, Jiang hopes to see huge industrial solar farms where fields of photovoltaic solar panels shift effortlessly along with the sunflowers that inspired him.Using minute graphite particles 1000 times smaller than the width of a human hair, mechanical engineers at Arizona State University hope to boost the efficiency -- and profitability -- of solar power plants. also wonder what happens when there are clouds passing over the sun? My reasoning goes that when there is cloud coverage, all cells will cool down, turning the panel to night position. Then when clouds pass by, the panel will reorient towards the sun, missing some energy while reorienting. GPS oriented panels always keep the right direction despite the cloud coverage.\n\nWhat mechanism(s)re-orient both Flowers and Panels back to the position of the rising Sun?\n\nThe same one. When the sun (or a panel with this meachnism) goes down the heat on both sides even out (making the flower/panel go into a 'neutral' position, which is optimalley right between east and west facing). When the sun risies one side gets heated more and the flower/panel starts turnnig towards the sun.\n\nI also wonder what happens when there are clouds passing over the sun?\n\nNot much since infrared still penetrates somewhat. It's the relative difference of energy that determines the direction - and that relative difference is the same with or without clouds. then again: Panels output is severly decreased when clouds pass - so: meh.\n\nI think this is a pretty nifty idea as there's nothing to break down/sevice (and some joker can't come along and spoof the GPS signal - which would actually be a neat April-Fools gag)\n\nCan someone explain to me why GPS would be necessary here? A tracking solar panel needs just one thing, a clock/calendar, to know where to point. And I'm not buying the notion that a lot of energy is required to swing a solar array 15 degrees an hour"

Now, plant leaves are tackling global warming in another way — by serving as models for a technology that produces clean, renewable power. UC Berkeley researcher Michel Maharbiz, has worked with other scientists to develop an alternative energy system based on transpiration, a natural process where trees pull water from roots to tops, with liquid eventually evaporating off of the leaves. The system relies on artificial glass leaves to generate a steady stream of energy and is yet another example of biomimicry at work.\n\nThe synthetic leaves are essentially energy scavengers, deriving power from the evaporation-driven flow of water. Leaves are crafted from glass wafers containing a series of tiny, water-filled channels. Fluid flows through the channels until it reaches the edge of the leaf, where it then evaporates. The actual power production takes place in the leaf's central stem walls, which are lined with metal plates connected to a circuit. The charged metal plates separated by a layer of water essentially create a capacitor. Water flowing through the leaf is periodically interrupted by small air bubbles–because air and water each have different electrical properties, every time an air bubble passes through the plates, an electric current is generated. This electricity can then be harvested and used to power devices, homes or other energy-sucking items.\n\nThough the electricity produced is a relatively small amount when compared to power produced by fuel cells and batteries, Maharbiz asserts that the glass leaves are actually quite effective for this type of energy-scavenging system. Researchers are currently working on modifications to optimize the amount of power the leaves can produce.\n\nEventually, leaves could be implemented into whole artificial trees. Maharbiz envisions the trees acting as a complementary tech to solar, where sunlight could power panels and help drive transpiration in trees. With any luck, solar panels and artificial, power-producing trees will soon be as common to the American home as white, picket fences."

If the new diode proves successful when incorporated into a finished battery, it could help power such hard-to-service, long-life systems as climate monitoring equipment and satellites. Such batteries will be robust -- tolerant to shock and functional from minus 100 c to 150 c -- and may never have to be changed for the lifetime of the device.\n\nThe battery's long life is tied to the enduring nature of its fuel, tritium, a hydrogen isotope that releases electrons in a process called beta decay.

Similar to a $10,000 electrolyzer, Nocera's company Sun Catalytix's has developed a device that acts very similarly but will sell for only $40.\n\nThe device begins, like the electrolyzer, with a catalyst dipped in water, and instead of the first jolt generating from the electricity form a wall socket, it sparks from a small solar panel. Once the electricity travels through the catalyst, the water splits into hydrogen and oxygen. This device continues to work throughout the night despite the absence of sunlight due to the daily creation of hydrogen and oxygen gases that flow through the fuel cell and continue to generate power.\n\nThe device is completely eco-friendly as its only emission is pure water. Also, its efficiency allows it to be used anywhere with a water source. \"Literally, we can just walk out to the Charles River, I can walk out to wastewater, I can walk to water in a gully with human waste, put my catalyst in it and it starts working,\" he says. \"So it's perfectly stable in dirty water streams, which is important to me for the poor.\"\n\nTo keep the device affordable, the solar panels are a lower grade design, but will more than exceed the electricity needs of developing nations. It also uses a cobalt elemental catalyst, which is easy to find, and as the cobalt atoms flake off the catalyst, a small burst of solar power transfers them back into a reactive state and keeps the device running.\n\nThis device is a hopeful solution to solving some of our energy needs, and is a step towards developing technology for the masses to ensure universal human needs, while having a zero-carbon impact on the environment. Nocera hopes that within two years the device will be refined to make it more reliable, affordable, and easier to use and out in the world market.\n\nI think this is a great news.

If Dan has indeed created an electrolyzer that will sell for $40 as opposed to $1,000 surely there must be some kind of catch?\nI see that he says that it is similar so we aren't to expect the same levels of quality but a difference of $960...something doesn't quite add up there.\nIf everything is above board then this is brilliant but for me, things like this do 'spark' doubts."

      "text": "Paraffin encapsulated in beach sand material as a new way to store heat from the sun\n\nMar 13, 2013\n\nCombining a mixture of sand and paraffin wax produces a more sustainable material for storing heat from the sun for use at night. Credit: American Chemical Society\nBenxia Li and colleagues explain the need for better materials that can store and release heat. These so-called \"phase-change\" materials\" (PCMs) are essential, for instance, for storing heat from the sun for use in providing energy at night or during cloudy periods. PCMs absorb, store and release heat when changing \"phases\" from a solid to a liquid and vice versa. They have applications that range from expanding use of solar energy to heat-regulating greenhouses to clothing that keeps soldiers or campers warm on cold nights outdoors. Existing PCMs have disadvantages, such as the tendency to leak or catch fire, and Li's team set out to find a better material.\n\nThey describe a new approach to using paraffin as a PCM. Made from petroleum, paraffin is a waxy material that absorbs heat, melts into a liquid and releases heat as it solidifies. It involves encapsulating paraffin into tiny spheres of silicon dioxide, the stuff of beach sand. The microencapsulated paraffin has several advantages, including a large surface area that can transfer heat, less reactivity with the environment and less likelihood of leaking as it changes phases. Li's team reports successful tests of the material for 30 melting-solidifying cycles with no leaks at a temperature of 158 degrees Fahrenheit. \"The high heat storage capability and good thermal stability of the composite enable it to be a potential material to store thermal energy in practical applications,\" the report concluded.\n\nAbstract In this work, a novel microencapsulated phase change composite of paraffin@SiO2 was prepared by in situ emulsion interfacial hydrolysis and polycondensation of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). The as-prepared paraffin@SiO2 composite was determined by Fourier transformation infrared spectroscope (FT-IR), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electronic microscope (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. The results showed that the paraffin@SiO2 composite is composed of quasi-spherical particles with diameters of 200–500 nm. The paraffin is encapsulated in a SiO2 shell, and there is no chemical reaction between them. The DSC results indicate that the melting temperature and latent heat of the composite are 56.5 °C and 45.5 J/g, respectively. The encapsulation ratio of paraffin was calculated to be 31.7% from the results of the DSC measurements, slightly lower than the loading content (32.5%) of paraffin in the microencapsulated composite from the TGA measurements. The as-prepared paraffin@SiO2 composite could maintain its phase transition perfectly after 30 melting–freezing cycles, and no leakage of paraffin was observed at 70 °C for 20 min. Moreover, the high heat storage capability and good thermal stability of the composite enable it to be a potential material to store thermal energy in practical applications.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nA cheap material that can store heat energy collected from the sun during the day that can be released slowly over night has been developed by researchers in the India.

      "text": "Harnessing the Power of Lightning\n\nOne of my favorite things to do (when it happens) is sit out\non the porch during a thunderstorm at night. It is a magnificent spectacle to\nwatch the flashes of lightning light up the sky; much cooler than a fireworks\ndisplay.\n\n(<--Credit:\nXweather.org)\n\nBut beyond its visual beauty, lightning is a massive form of\nenergy: millions of volts discharged within a very brief period (milliseconds).\nAt, It kills an average of 55 people a year and injures hundreds more, except\nfor some old guy in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button:\n\n\"Did I ever tell ya I\nwas struck by lightning seven times? Once when I was in the fields just tending\nto my cows... once when I was sitting in my truck just minding my own\nbusiness…\" (Credit: FreeRepublic.org -->)\n\nSuch concentrated energy (over 1 gigajoule) begs to question\nwhether we could harness it into a usable form. Could we use lightning to power\nour lights, refrigerators, and time-travelling cars (1.21 Gigawatts!?!)?\n\n(Credit: Wiremod)\n\nElectricity from lightning has been discussed on CR4 in the past,\nand it is certainly an intriguing idea. But as a practical energy solution, it\nis little more than that due to a number of factors.\n\nCapture\n\nIn order to harness energy from lightning effectively, it\nmust first be captured. But predicting and attracting a lightning strike is no\neasy task. Even with the most ideally placed metal rods, lightning will more\noften strike randomly. The range of lightning formation can be more than three\nmiles from the actual thunderstorm. What's more, storms are almost always\nmoving, so any capture device would probably have to be portable.\n\nStorage\n\nSo assuming we can find a way to effectively and predictably\ncapture lightning - how then do we store it? This is probably the most daunting\nof tasks. The temperature spike from a lightning strike is massive - peak temperatures\nreach near 55000°F (30000 K). These temperatures will effectively vaporize\nany metals that would make up the semiconductors used to collect and handle the\ncharge, unless they were made unreasonably thick. Stepping down the power to a\nmanageable form would also be incredibly difficult and incredibly inefficient. Taking a concentrated, nearly instantaneous surge and storing/distributing it\nover a long time would require extremely large capacitors and batteries.\nConsidering the gross output of lightning is not very high on a gross scale (accounting\nfor the frequency of strikes in a year in a given area), there would be no\npayback for this type of technology. And unless something incredible happens in\nthe world of energy storage research, I doubt the devices would be very\nportable either.\n\n(Credit: Britannica\nkids -->)\n\nOther Difficulties\n\nOnce the storage is dealt with, there's also the shockwave\nto consider. These waves come as a result of the rapid expansion of air from\nthe extreme heat of the lightning channel, and are the origin of the sound\nwaves (thunder) we hear during a storm. Any capture technology would have to be\ndurable enough to withstand the force of repeated shock waves, which are more\nthan enough to knock a grown man off his feet.\n\nA number of unique ideas could potentially provide solutions\nfor some of these difficulties. Ideas to improve the predictability and\nconsistency of lightning strikes would include methods to further induce charge\nto an already highly charged cloud; similar to the idea of seeding clouds to\nencourage rain. Shooting high intensity lasers (which form plasma) into the\natmosphere could also be used to precisely channel lightning to a storage\ndevice. Other proposals such as charge collection farms would aim to capture\nand utilize the charges from clouds before they form lightning.\n\nOn the surface, lightning seems like a very attractive source\nof energy - it's highly concentrated, natural, renewable, and in some regions\n(e.g. Florida) it is readily available. The reality of electricity from\nlightning, however, is not currently very feasible or safe with current\ntechnology. Perhaps in the future technology will open the doors to more\npossibilities surrounding this incredible natural phenomenon. For now, though,\nI'll just enjoy watching it from my porch.\n\nRe: Harnessing the Power of Lightning\n\n07/16/2012 1:47 PM\n\nI lived near Tampa for a number of years and often traveled on engineering-related business. I always enjoyed flying back into Tampa in the late afternoon or evening when the local pop-up thunderstorms were in the area. The inter- and intra- cloud lightning was always fascinating to watch as the plane flew by (at a safe distance). The lightning also revealed a surprising amount of structure within the clouds, like a 3-D full-color x-ray of the clouds' interiors. Almost none of this was visible from the ground.\n\n__________________\n\"...any library is a good library that does not contain a volume by Jane Austen. Even if it contains no other book.\" - Mark Twain\n\nRe: Harnessing the Power of Lightning\n\n\"In 1993, a research facility was constructed...under the funding and direction of the Electrical Power Research Institute (EPRI) at the Camp Blanding Florida Army National Guard Base...From 1993 to 1998, lightning was artificially initiated (triggered) via the rocket-and-wire technique over 150 times as part of the experiments...\"\n\nThere were actually several reports from this facility (once available for download from the EPRI web site, but I'm not sure if they are still freely available. Anyway, getting lightning to strike when and where you want it can be done (assuming you start with a good thunderstorm in the area). As a number of photos in some of the reports illustrate, it is what you do with the lightning after you catch it that is the real issue here. These are not experiments that one would want to try in the back yard...\n\nRe: Harnessing the Power of Lightning\n\n07/17/2012 12:17 AM\n\nThe cloud and earth(ground)form a capacitor. Due to a charged cloud the ground will get charged and before lightning strikes if we can charge some device like capacitor or battery utilising that charge it would be useful.\n\nRe: Harnessing the Power of Lightning\n\nI noted in your comment that you used the word \"semi-conductor\" Semi-conductors most definitely could not handle temperatures as found in a lightning strike. But \"super-conductors\" could.\n\nWe would have to discover high temperature, i.e., room temperature superconductors. Lay these out in a grid pattern, even along highways and roads, to avoid habitations. In cities the collection nodes could be mounted on buildings.\n\nAt strategic points, i.e., near cities and power distribution centers, place superconducting coils, to store and distribute the electricity.\n\nLightning strikes are recorded as many as one thousand per day. Picture the equivalent in power plants and you have a good idea of the amount of energy we could harness. We might then be on our way to achieving what Dr. Michio Kaku called a \"Class One\" civilization.\n\nJust my opinion, Dragon\n\n__________________\nIgnorance is the beginning of knowledge. Heresy is the beginning of wisdom. The ignorant heretic is the wisest of all.\n\nRe: Harnessing the Power of Lightning\n\n07/17/2012 2:00 AM\n\nThere's a commercial outfit that is trying to harvest energy from the sky right now. I don't think they are trying to actually grab the lightning strike itself, but siphon the charge from the area near the storm, which would be far more controllable. Also, I understand that the charge difference between the ground and the \"sky\" is almost always nonzero so that charge harvesting can happen nearly continously. The trickle becomes a river when a storm approaches.\n\nI'm too lazy to do the Google search to give the link...it's kinda late in my section of the universe.\n\nRe: Harnessing the Power of Lightning\n\n07/17/2012 10:22 AM\n\nThat's the problem with the Joule as a unit- it's so small, it seems like you have a lot more energy because the numbers get so big.

      "text": "Compact High-Energy Fuel Cells to Be Released in 2013\n\nThe idea of using hydrogen fuel cells for small or compact devices certainly isn't new. In fact, there are already a few compact electrolyzers out there, as well as non-hydrogen based fuel cells (SOFC for example) that can be used to provide extra power to your gadgets.\n\nBut the idea of an ultra-portable, energy-dense, hydrogen-based fuel cell is something that is yet to be made mainstream in commercial electronics. Would we have to wait that long before it finally becomes available? Not very long, because there is already an actual commercial version that may soon arrive in 2013.\n\nRohm Semiconductor, Aqua Fairy and Kyoto University are the developers of a compact hydrogen fuel cell that fits the same classification as the one mentioned earlier. The secret, according to this source, is that the fuel cell does not store hydrogen as traditional fuel cells do. Instead, it actually creates hydrogen on the spot before it uses it to produce energy. This is supposed to be achieved through a chemical reaction between calcium hydride and water. With hydrogen not needing to be stored directly, the inherent disadvantage of storage posed by fuel cells becomes nil, and can now be used safely without the risk of losing or igniting the hydrogen.\n\nThe size of the battery can be as thin and as small as your standard USB stick (even thinner), yet still provide enough energy to rival the energy density of currently developed Lithium-ion batteries. A high-energy hydrogen fuel cell unit that is as thin as 3 cubic centimeters could have enough power to generate 5 watt-hours of electricity. This theoretically means that it can provide more than enough juice to fully charge any standard smartphone.\n\nFor now, they plan on distributing the fuel cells as a modular energy provision unit. It would provide back-up power to all different kinds of systems that might need a source of power that could be tapped without losing charge as it is stored. The small scale fuel cells would be used with a special cartridge cover or USB card case in order to connect the gadget for charging. The larger fuel cells will be used as backup power for home systems and remote installations, replacing your heavy standard generator and lead-acid battery with a much lighter power package set. Also, other fuel cell designs will be used on special installations and sensors such as seismometers.\n\nThey already have \"demonstration models\" for most of the fuel cell sizes that they plan to distribute. The current focus of their project currently, is collecting information on how people would react to the idea of the new technology and to create a proper economic strategy to introduce it to market.\n\nOne of the key reasons why their compact hydrogen fuel cells look so attractive is that fuel cells, unlike batteries, never lose charge over time. As it was presented, the compact fuel cell can last for two decades as long as it is kept properly. Unlike any other kind of battery that simply would diminish its total charge capacity over time, these new batteries can last much longer and thus provide one more bonus over conventional batteries"

It treats the wastewater more effectively, and doesn't have any of the environmental drawbacks of that technology, such as production of unwanted hydrogen sulfide or possible release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, the researchers believe.\n\nThe OSU system has now been proven at a substantial scale in the laboratory, Liu said, and the next step would be a pilot study. A good candidate, she said, might initially be a food processing plant, which is a contained system that produces a steady supply of certain types of wastewater that would provide significant amounts of electricity.\n\nOnce advances are made to reduce high initial costs, researchers estimate that the capital construction costs of this new technology should be comparable to that of the activated sludge systems now in widespread use today — and even less expensive when future sales of excess electricity are factored in OSU researchers reported several years ago on the promise of this technology, but at that time the systems in use produced far less electrical power.

Many aspects of typography translate only awkwardly to HTML.\nPlease use the page image\nas the authoritative form to ensure accuracy.\n\nCatalysis Looks to the Future\n\nSOLID-STATE HIGH-TEMPERATURE FUEL CELLS\n\nAn anonymous wit once paraphrased the three laws of thermodynamics thus: First, you can never win, you can only break even. Second, you can never break even. Third, you can't get out of the game. The second law limits the efficiency of a fossil-fuel-fired power plant—only a fraction (typically less than 40%) of the chemical energy released by burning the fuel is converted to electricity. The balance is dissipated in various unavoidable ways—as friction between moving parts, as waste heat up smokestacks and cooling towers, and so forth. Fuel cells, however, translate chemical energy directly into electrical energy without any mechanical or thermal intermediaries. Fuel cells can have efficiencies as high as 90%, depending on their applications. With such high efficiencies, power plants based on fuel cell technology would consume much less fossil fuel and emit proportionally fewer pollutants than would conventional power plants.\n\nAll fuels burn by reacting with oxygen to release energy, and the key to a fuel cell's efficiency lies in using catalysts to control that reaction. There are a number of different types of fuel cells. One promising variety is the high-temperature, solid-state fuel cell (Figure 3.3), which is essentially a barrier made of ceramic, typically zirconium oxide doped with traces of yttrium oxide, whose structure conducts oxygen ions (negatively charged oxygen atoms). On one side of the barrier—the fuel cell's negative terminal—the fuel, typically a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas created by gasifying coal or steam-refining natural gas, reacts catalytically with oxygen ions to liberate water, carbon dioxide, and electrons. The electrons go out over the wire as an electric current. On the other side of the barrier—the positive terminal—the electrons returning through the wire are catalytically added to molecules of oxygen from the atmosphere to create more oxygen ions that diffuse through the barrier and perpetuate the cycle. The yttria-doped zirconia fuel cell typically operates at around 1000° C.\n\nSo what are we waiting for? Why aren't power plants based on fuel cells? Unfortunately, several technological hurdles must be overcome before this catalytic technology can be a commercial success. A worldwide effort has been under way for more than two decades to clear these hurdles, which include devising ways to keep the catalyst from breaking down at such high temperatures, avoiding cracks and leaks in the ceramic structure, and designing a ceramic that conducts enough oxygen ions through a sufficiently small volume to make the size of the equipment economical. Some current efforts are focused on so-called cross-flow monolithic designs in which a solid ceramic block is laced with sets of fuel channels perpendicular to, and alternating with, sets of air channels. This design provides a high interior surface area upon which reactions can occur and thus occupies a very compact volume per unit of energy generated."

The Grätzel cell was cheap to produce, but it had a major problem, it leaked and so was not commercially viable.\n\nNow, scientists at Northwestern University have developed a new stable version that does not leak, has no toxic parts but is still cost-effective.\n\nUntil now, the Grätzel cell contained a dye-sensitive electrolyte that was created from an organic liquid that was liable to seep and corrode the solar cell.\n\nThe chemist used a new electrolyte material that begins as a liquid but finishes as a solid, making the solar cell inherently stable. The new thin CsSnI3 compound consists of tin, cesium and iodine.\n\nProfessor Kanatzidis explains, \"The Grätzel cell is like having the concept for the light bulb but not having the tungsten wire or carbon material. We created a robust novel material that makes the Grätzel cell concept work better. Our material is solid, not liquid, so it should not leak or corrode.\"\n\nAmong the researcher team was postdoctoral Fellow In Chung and graduate student Byunghong Lee who helped develop the new solar cells and make performance gains of around 1% a month.\n\nThe full research paper: All-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells with high efficiency, about the improved and long-lasting solar cell were published in the Nature journal. Its main authors are Professor Kanatzidis, the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry from the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, and Professor Chang, who specialises in materials science and engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science. Jiaqing He, from Northwestern, is the other author.\n\nProfessor Chang says the solar cell could be developed to be better performing and more efficient than it is now. It currently has a high of 10.2%, which compared with a 12% maximum performance of the original Grätzel cell. Today's silicon solar cells can convert around 20% of sunlight.\n\nThe new solar cell uses nanoparticle titanium dioxide n-type and CsSnI3 p-type semiconductors with a single layer dye molecule forming the junction between them.\n\nProfessor Chang says, \"We have millions and millions of nanoparticles, which gives us a huge effective surface area, and we coat all the particles with light-absorbing dye.\"\n\nA single solar cell is half a centimetre by half a centimetre and around 10 microns thick. The dye-coated nanoparticles are packed in and Kanatzidis' liquid flows around them. In a similar way to the way paint reacts, the solvent evaporates and a solid mass is left. The dye that absorbs the sun and converts photon into electricity is between the two semiconductors.\n\nThe nanoparticles are around 20 nanometers in diameter, which boosts the surface area and allows enough space between the particles for the liquid to flow through and set.\n\nProfessor Chang says this is just the start of developing the technology and there are many other applications in solar cell technology that could be improved. The next stage is to build a large array (row) of the solar cells.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy, The National Science Foundation and the Initiative backed the research for Energy and Sustainability at Northwestern"

This step is just one part of a series of reactions to split water and make hydrogen gas, but the researchers say the result shows they can learn from nature how to control those reactions to make highly active synthetic catalysts for energy storage, such as in fuel cells. In addition, the natural protein, an enzyme, uses inexpensive, abundant metals in its design, which the team copied. Currently, these materials – called catalysts, because they spur reactions along – rely on expensive metals such as platinum.\n\n\"This nickel-based catalyst is really very fast,\" said coauthor Morris Bullock, Director of the Center for Molecular Electrocatalysis at PNNL. \"It's about a hundred times faster than the previous molecular catalyst record holder. And from nature, we knew it could be done with abundant and inexpensive nickel or iron.\""

Take heart: scientists are perfecting a new method for transmitting electrical energy from a base station using a technique that resembles a wireless Internet connection. Researchers say that a specially designed device should be able to draw power from a strong magnetic field permeating a room.\n\nThe effect, which has not yet been demonstrated, would take advantage of the stationary magnetic field that surrounds a charged loop of metal. This so-called near-field can be powerful--it is what makes an electric motor turn. And in principle its oscillations can induce an electric current in another nearby loop, because dynamic magnetic fields create electric fields and vice versa. The second loop could act as a battery or recharger, but it would normally receive only a slight current because the near field fades rapidly over distance.\n\nThe key to boosting the induced current is resonance, says photonics researcher Marin Soljacic of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Soljacic and his colleagues propose introducing a short gap in a metal loop and attaching two small disks at each end. When electrified, such an object has a natural, or resonant, frequency that results from current flowing back and forth along the loop from one disk to the other.\n\nIf two loops have the same frequency, one should be able to receive energy from the other through the magnetic near field--much like two identical tuning forks brought into close proximity, the group reasoned. From a few meters away, the rate of energy transferred in this way might reach tens of watts, or enough to power a laptop, according to simulations Soljacic presented November 14 at a meeting of the American Institute of Physics. \"The results are strongly encouraging but the real test of the thing will be experiments, which we are working on now.\" Soljacic says.\n\n\"It's a great idea. I think a lot of people will be very surprised by it,\" says photonics expert John Pendry of Imperial College London. It could be very useful, he says, in specialized applications such as space exploration, say to power a rover within a few meters of a power supply. He questions whether people would accept it in their homes, though, given concerns over the effect of power lines and cell phones on the body. \"I think they'll have a problem convincing people it's okay"

Results are particularly relevant to increasing the efficiency of a cost-effective class of solar cells and have potential broad application to nanotechnology and clean energy science.\n\nDye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) rely on deposition of a thin film of photosensitive dye on a conductive substrate such as a porous layer of titanium oxide (TiO2) nanoparticles.\n\nWhile DSSCs represent a simple and cost-effective alternative to conventional (p-n junction) solar cells, issues with efficiency have been a stumbling block to widespread implementation.\n\nEuropean researchers supported by EU-funding of the Nanosol project sought to conduct a detailed analysis of the photobehaviour of three novel metal-free organic dyes.\n\nSpecifically, they studied the dyes in solution and on 9 different morphologies of titanium-doped mesoporous (with pores of diameter 2–50 nanometres) materials in the absence and presence of TiO2 nanoparticles.\n\nStudies of the free dyes in solution demonstrated the importance of the state of the charge transfer complex (the distribution of charge over molecules at the donor-acceptor interface) in the dye's photobehaviour and the role of the solvent in efficiency.\n\nFurther studies of dyes in the presence of conventionally used TiO2 nanoparticles illustrated important electron dynamics on the femtosecond (quadrillionth of a second) scale providing insight into efficient charge separation and solar cell performance.\n\nTitanium nanotubes with one-dimensional (1D) structure were also studied and compared with TiO2 nanoparticles, demonstrating similar electron dynamics.\n\nFinally, titanium-doped silica mesoporous sieves, another 1D class of materials, were evaluated. Although promising electron dynamics were observed in the material itself, the resulting solar cells performed poorly due to less efficient dye loading and limited electron transport.\n\nNanosol researchers effectively characterised the interaction of titanium-based materials with an important class of organic dyes relevant to DSSCs with a focus on solar cell efficiency.\n\nResults should prove useful in future design of more efficient DSSCs and thus encourage their widespread implementation.

But so far, they are somewhat difficult to attain. For example, there is still some debate regarding the efficiency of solar panels, when considering cost vs. savings.\n\nThe future, however, is looking radiant for solar cells. We told you a while ago that researchers at Oregon State University managed to print solar cells using inkjet printing. Now researchers at MIT have taken it further by printing the solar cells on other soft materials, such as cloth and even thin PET (basically plastic bottles). To create an array of photovoltaic cells on the paper, five layers of material need to be deposited onto the same sheet of paper in successive passes, using a mask made of paper to form the patterns of cells on the surface. This takes place in a vacuum chamber, and is similar to the process used to make the silvery lining in a bag of chips\n\nWhile the efficiency of this new technology is still quite low (about 1 per cent), the team is looking to advance their technique and hopefully get it closer to 12 per cent, which is the efficiency of standard solar cells. For the moment though, having proved that we don't have to use expensive, cumbersome and heavy materials to create solar cells, they have made a huge step forward. Let's wish them the best of luck and wait for the next big step, which is bound to come rather sooner that later."

      "text": "Solar Cells with LEDs Provide Inexpensive Lighting\n\nNov 09, 2009 by Lisa Zyga\n\nScientists have developed plastic solar cells integrated with batteries and LEDs that could offer affordable lighting in developing areas.\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Of the 1.5 billion people in developing countries who do not have electricity, many rely on kerosene lamps for light after the sun goes down. But now, researchers from Denmark have designed an LED lamp that runs on solar cells, which costs less than one-quarter of the annual cost of using kerosene lighting. The solar-LED lamps are expected to last at least a year, making them an affordable alternative to kerosene.\n\nFrederik Krebs and other scientists at the Ris? National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy in Denmark have developed an inexpensive way to integrate solar cells, LEDs, and ultrathin lithium batteries to create a lamp that can produce reading-quality light. The lamp's polymer solar cells and circuitry are printed onto large flexible plastic films, and then the LEDs, flat batteries, and diodes are mounted using silver epoxy. After being encapsulated in a second sheet of film, the sheets are rolled up and snapped together at the corners with metal fasteners.\n\nThe devices are very inefficient by today's standards, capturing just 1-2% of the energy that hits them. Still, they're cheap enough to be practical in some off-grid villages. In rural areas of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, the average household spends $40-$80 per year for kerosene lamps. Even the cheapest solar-LED lighting devices on the market today cost about a year's worth of kerosene, which would not be very advantageous. But the total cost of the Denmark scientists' solar-LED lamps is only about $27, and they think they can manufacture an improved version for about $10. They estimate that using cheaper labor in China could reduce the cost again by as much as 50%.\n\nLast summer, the scientists field-tested 196 prototypes with the help of children who attended a Danish-run summer school in Zambia. The results showed that some of the lamps had problems due to excessive flexing and light quality degrading after 10 to 20 minutes, which the scientists are fixing by repositioning the solar cells and adding circuitry to deliver power to the LEDs at a constant current. The researchers plan to test improved versions of the lamps in Mali and Malawi.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nSolar energy has the potential to improve the living conditions of poor rural households in India as well as contribute to the country's future energy security, according to Professor Govindasamy Agoramoorthy from Tajen University,(PhysOrg.com) -- Although you can buy solar charging devices for rechargeable batteries, it would be even more convenient if batteries had built-in solar cells.

Also, unless these things are handed out by NGO's the price to the consumer will be ca. twice the manufacturing cost.

      "text": "It's electric: Cows show promise as powerplants\n\nAug 31, 2005\n\nA new study suggests that some of the microorganisms found in cow waste may provide a reliable source of electricity.\n\nResults showed that the microbes in about a half a liter of rumen fluid – fermented, liquefied feed extracted from the rumen, the largest chamber of a cow's stomach – produced about 600 millivolts of electricity. That's about half the voltage needed to run one rechargeable AA-sized battery, said Ann Christy, a study co-author and an associate professor of food, agricultural and biological engineering at Ohio State University.\n\nWhile rumen fluid itself won't be used as an energy source, some of the microorganisms found in the fluid are also found in cow dung, which may prove to be a good source for generating electricity. In fact, in a related experiment, the researchers used cow manure directly to create energy for a fuel cell.\n\nUsing cow dung as an energy source isn't a new idea – some farmers already use the methane released by livestock waste to power machinery and lights. But converting methane into electricity requires costly equipment – one California farmer reportedly spent $280,000 to convert his operation to a methane digester system.\n\n\"Methane still needs to undergo combustion, which creates issues with energy efficiency,\" said Hamid Rismani-Yazdi, the study's lead author and a graduate student in food, agricultural and biological engineering at Ohio State.\n\nThe research showed how electricity can be created as the microorganisms in rumen fluid break down cellulose – a complex carbohydrate that is the primary component of the roughage that cows eat. That breakdown releases electrons.\n\nThis study represents the first time that scientists have used cellulose to help charge a fuel cell.\n\nThe researchers presented their findings on August 31 in Washington, D.C., at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society. Christy and Rismani-Yazdi conducted the work with Ohio State colleagues Olli Tuovinen, a professor of microbiology, and Burk Dehority, a professor of animal sciences.\n\nThe researchers extracted rumen fluid from a living cow. The rumen is essentially a fermentation vat crawling with microorganisms where much of the food that a cow eats is temporarily held and is continuously churned until it can be completely digested. This liquid mass is what scientists call rumen fluid.\n\nThe researchers collected the fluid through a cannula, a surgically implanted tube that leads directly from the cow's hide into its rumen. The cow used in the study ate a normal diet.\n\nThe researchers filled each of two sterilized glass chambers with strained rumen fluid to create the microbial fuel cell. Each chamber was about a foot high and about 6 inches in diameter.\n\nThe chambers were separated by a special material that allowed protons to move from the negative (anode) chamber into the positive (cathode) chamber. This movement of protons, along with the movement of electrons across the resistor and wire that connects the two electrodes, creates electrical current.\n\nThe anode chamber was filled with rumen fluid and cellulose, which served as a food source for the microorganisms. Cellulose is plentiful on most farms, as harvesting usually leaves behind plenty of it in the form of crop residue in the fields.\n\nThe other chamber, the cathode, was filled with potassium ferricyanide, a chemical that acts as an oxidizing agent to round out the electrical circuit.\n\nTwo small pieces of plain graphite served as the fuel cell's electrodes (an electrode draws and emits electrical charge.) A piece of graphite was placed in each chamber. The researchers used a meter to measure the output of the fuel cell.\n\nThat output reached a consistent maximum of 0.58 volts. After about four days, the voltage fell to around 0.2 volts, at which time the researchers added fresh cellulose to bring the voltage back up to a higher level.\n\n\"While that's a very small amount of voltage, the results show that it is possible to create electricity from cow waste,\" Christy said.\n\n\"Putting a couple of these fuel cells together should generate enough power to run a rechargeable double-A battery,\" Rismani-Yazdi said.\n\nIn related work done in Christy's lab, she and Rismani-Yazdi, along with a number of undergraduate students, used actual cow manure to power a microbial fuel cell. These individual cells produced between 300 and 400 millivolts.\n\n\"The students put a few of these cells together and were able to fuel their rechargeable batteries over and over again,\" Christy said.\n\nIn that work, the researchers didn't need to use cellulose to feed microbes, as some plant material passes undigested through a cow.\n\n\"We've run some of these trials well over 30 days without a decrease in the voltage output,\" Christy said. \"Both studies suggest that cow waste is a promising fuel source. It's cheap and plentiful, and it may someday be a useful source of sustainable energy in developing parts of the world.\"\n\nWhile the source of energy for the fuel cell used in these studies is somewhat unique, microbial fuel cells aren't a new idea; other scientists have produced electricity from a handful of specific microbes and also from effluent from municipal wastewater.\n\n\"Although it's too early to tell if this kind of fuel cell can produce significantly more electricity, the fact that the rumen fluid worked in our study means that there are additional electricity-producing microbes that we have yet to identify,\" Christy said.\n\n\"The hope is that one day livestock farmers could use their farm's livestock waste lagoon as a huge fuel cell and generate enough power for their operation,\" Rismani-Yazdi said.\n\nThis work was supported in part by the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center in Wooster.\n\nRelevant PhysicsForums posts\n\nRelated Stories\n\nHeifers being prepared for breeding don't have to eat like pigs, stuffing themselves at all-you-can-eat feed bunks with unlimited refills, according to scientists at a Montana State University experiment station. ...\n\nCows eat grass -- this has been observed for eons.

But in many parts of the world, people can only dream of bills like these. Clean drinking water and electricity are unavailable. These people live too remotely for companies to recoup the cost of providing such amenities; thus, no one is willing to tackle the problem.\n\nIf all goes well, an idea that originates with electrical engineer Jerry Woodall will soon change this. The Purdue University professor invented an aluminum alloy that can make contaminated water potable and generate electricity in the process. According to Woodall, his idea is unique: No competing technology can extract both drinking water and electricity from any type of water using an element as common and inexpensive as aluminum.\n\nThough Woodall patented the principle underlying his technique in 1968, he didn't try to come up with a practical application for it until a few years ago, when he became motivated by the increasing demand for sustainable green energy. The result is a mixture of aluminum, gallium, indium and tin that weighs just 110 pounds (50 kilograms), including a reactor and a fuel cell. The lightweight design makes the device easy to transport, so people from Africa to Haiti can use it as long as a water source is available.\n\nThe electricity and water are produced when the alloy comes in contact with water, catalyzing a spontaneous chemical reaction that separates the hydrogen and oxygen molecules from one another. Feeding the hydrogen molecules into a fuel cell produces electricity, with steam as a by-product. The steam is collected, and any bacteria present are destroyed by the heat, making the condensed water potable.\n\nThe only waste product is harmless aluminum hydroxide, which, according to Woodall, could be used to smelt a new alloy without releasing CO2. He is looking for a commercial partner to build a prototype and bring the product to market."

Their report appears in the journal ACS Nano.\n\nYang Yang, Rui Zhu, Paul S. Weiss and colleagues explain that there has been intense world-wide interest in so-called polymer solar cells (PSCs), which are made from plastic-like materials. PSCs are lightweight and flexible and can be produced in high volume at low cost. That interest extends to producing transparent PSCs. However, previous versions of transparent PSCs have had many disadvantages, which the team set out to correct.\n\nThey describe a new kind of PSC that produces energy by absorbing mainly infrared light, not visible light, making the cells 66 percent transparent to the human eye. They made the device from a photoactive plastic that converts infrared light into an electrical current. Another breakthrough is the transparent conductor made of a mixture of silver nanowire and titanium dioxide nanoparticles, which was able to replace the opaque metal electrode used in the past. This composite electrode also allowed the solar cell to be fabricated economically by solution processing. The authors suggest the panels could be used in smart windows or portable electronics."

That is the real step here. We haven't solved all the practical problems and it's not a solution, but it does demonstrate this critical reaction can be sustained and cycled,\" Discovery News quoted Bruce as saying.\n\nScientists are pushing to develop a lithium air battery because they use air as the cathode and lithium metal as the anode. Oxygen is both cheap and light. It doesn't require the battery to be built with heavy casing to contain the electrodes. In existing batteries, lithium ions move from the cathode to the anode through an electrolyte, or a chemical solution. When you use the battery, the process is reversed and the flow of ions produce an electric current.\n\nIn a lithium-air battery, oxygen enters the cathode and combines with lithium ions to produce lithium peroxide, which accumulates as the battery is discharged.\n\nThe Scottish team was able to produce this chemical reaction over and over again without decomposition, Bruce said, using a thin film of porous gold as an electrode.\n\nBruce said that his experiment is one of many that have to be successful before this Holy Grail of advanced battery technology is built.\n\n\"It's still a long way off.

Led by Rensselaer Professor Nikhil Koratkar, the study sought to explain how the flow of water over surfaces coated with the nanomaterial graphene could generate small amounts of electricity. Using a small sheet of the graphene coating, seen above as a dark blue patch connected to gold contacts, the research team demonstrated the creation of 85 nanowatts of power.\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have developed a new method to harvest energy from flowing water. This discovery aims to hasten the creation of self-powered microsensors for more accurate and cost-efficient oil exploration.\n\nLed by Rensselaer Professor Nikhil Koratkar, the researchers investigated how the flow of water over surfaces coated with the nanomaterial graphene could generate small amounts of electricity. The research team demonstrated the creation of 85 nanowatts of power from a sheet of graphene measuring .03 millimeters by .015 millimeters.\n\nThis amount of energy should be sufficient to power tiny sensors that are introduced into water or other fluids and pumped down into a potential oil well, Koratkar said. As the injected water moves through naturally occurring cracks and crevices deep in the earth, the devices detect the presence of hydrocarbons and can help uncover hidden pockets of oil and natural gas. As long as water is flowing over the graphene-coated devices, they should be able to provide a reliable source of power. This power is necessary for the sensors to relay collected data and information back to the surface.\n\n\"It's impossible to power these microsensors with conventional batteries, as the sensors are just too small. So we created a graphene coating that allows us to capture energy from the movement of water over the sensors,\" said Koratkar, professor in the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace, and Nuclear Engineering and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering in the Rensselaer School of Engineering. \"While a similar effect has been observed for carbon nanotubes, this is the first such study with graphene. The energy-harvesting capability of graphene was at least an order of magnitude superior to nanotubes. Moreover, the advantage of the flexible graphene sheets is that they can be wrapped around almost any geometry or shape.\"\n\nDetails of the study, titled \"Harvesting Energy from Water Flow over Graphene,\" were published online today by the journal Nano Letters. The study also will appear in a future print edition of the journal different velocities.\n\nAlong with physically demonstrating the ability to generate 85 nanowatts of power from a small fragment of graphene, the researchers used molecular dynamics simulations to better understand the physics of this phenomenon. They discovered that chloride ions present in the water stick to the surface of graphene. As water flows over the graphene, the friction force between the water flow and the layer of adsorbed chloride ions causes the ions to drift along the flow direction. The motion of these ions drags the free charges present in graphene along the flow direction — creating an internal current.\n\nThis means the graphene coating requires ions to be present in water to function properly. Therefore, oil exploration companies would need to add chemicals to the water that is injected into the well. Koratkar said this is an easy, inexpensive solution.\n\nFor the study, Koratkar's team also tested the energy harvested from water flowing over a film of carbon nanotubes. However, the energy generation and performance was far inferior to those attained using graphene, he said.\n\nLooking at potential future applications of this new technology, Koratkar said he could envision self-powered microrobots or microsubmarines. Another possibility is harvesting power from a graphene coating on the underside of a boat.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nResearchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed a new method for using water to tune the band gap of the nanomaterial graphene, opening the door to new graphene-based transistors and nanoelectronics.\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Three new studies from researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute illustrate why graphene should be the nanomaterial of choice to strengthen composite materials used in everything from ...\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Arizona and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have increased the toughness of ceramic composites by using graphene reinforcements that enable new fracture resistanceAntialias, are you privy to the difference in friction of this particular graphene application and the standard painted bottom of boat hulls?

But if you don't want to violate the first law of thermodynamics then that energy has to come from somewhere - which means an interaction with the surrounding water in which the device picks up kinetic energy and transforms it into another type of energy. Every bit energy you draw has to come from that interaction (which means slowing your boat down in the process because you slow down the water and thereby the speed of your boat relative to the water - and that is basically what friction does)\n\nWhat the barnacle-resistant paint does is reduce friction (by eliminating barancles) and thereby allows the boat to go faster.\n\nBut if you don't want to violate the first law of thermodynamics then that energy has to come from somewhere - which means an interaction with the surrounding water in which the device picks up kinetic energy and transforms it into another type of energy.

      "text": "A guiding light for new directions in energy production\n\nSep 11, 2011\n\nThe science of light and liquids has been intimately entwined since Léon Foucault discovered the speed of light in 1862, when he observed that light travels more slowly in water than in air. This physical harmony between the two materials is now being harnessed to collect and drive light to where it can be the most useful. October's issue of Nature Photonics focuses on optofluidics, the study of microfluidics—the microscopic delivery of fluids through extremely small channels or tubes—combined with optics. In a review written by Demetri Psaltis, Dean of EPFL's School of Engineering, he and his co-authors argue that optofluidics is poised to take on one of this century's most important challenges: energy.\n\n\"By directing the light and concentrating where it can be most efficiently used, we could greatly increase the efficiency of already existing energy producing systems, such as biofuel reactors and solar cells, as well as innovate entirely new forms of energy production\" explains Psaltis. \"EPFL is the world leader in optofluidics, our institution is in a position to develop truly efficient and disruptive energy sources.\"\n\nSunlight is already used for energy production besides conventional solar panels. For example, it is used to convert water and carbon dioxide into methane in large industrial biofuel plants. Prisms and mirrors are commonly employed to direct and concentrate sunlight to heat water on the roofs of homes and apartment buildings. These techniques already employ the same principles found in optofluidics—control and manipulation of light and liquid transfer—but often without the precision offered by nano and micro technology.\n\nThis video is not supported by your browser at this time.\n\nDean of Engineering at EPFL, Demetri Psaltis explains how the relatively new domain of optofluidics could help solve the current energy challenge. Credit: EPFL MediaCom\n\nA futuristic example: Optofluidic solar lighting system\n\nHow can we better exploit the light that hits the outside of a building? Imagine sunlight channelled into the building An optofluidic solar lighting system could capture sunlight from a roof using a light concentrating system that follows the sun's path by changing the angle of the water's refraction, and then distribute the sunlight throughout the building through light pipes or fibre optic cables to the ceilings of office spaces, indoor solar panels, or even microfluidic air filters. Using sunlight to drive a microfluidic air filter or aliment an indoor solar panel—which would be protected from the elements and last longer—is a novel way to use solar energy to supplement non-renewable resources.\n\nIn such a system, it would be essential to deviate from the secondary devices such as air filtrage and solar panels to maintain a comfortable constant light source for ceiling lighting—the flickering of the light source due to a cloud passing over would be intolerable. In order to modulate these different channels to maintain a constant light source, a system using electrowetting could deviate light from one channel into another both easily and inexpensively. A droplet of water sits on the outer surface of light tube. A small current excites the ions in the water, pushing them to the edge of the droplet and expanding it just enough for it to touch the surface of another tube. This expanded droplet then creates a light bridge between the two parallel light tubes, effectively moderating the amount of light streaming through either one.\n\nUp-scaling for industrial use\n\n\"The main challenge optofluidics faces in the energy field is to maintain the precision of nano and micro light and fluid manipulation while creating industrial sized installations large enough to satisfy the population's energy demand,\" explains David Erickson, professor at Cornell University and visiting professor at EPFL. \"Much like a super computer is built out of small elements, up-scaling optofluidic technology would follow a similar model—the integration of many liquid chips to create a super-reactor.\"\n\nSince most reactions in liquid channels happen at the point of contact between the liquid and the catalyst-lined tubes, the efficiency of a system depends on how much surface area is available for reactions to take place. Scaling down the size of the channels to the micro and nano level allows for thousands more channels in the same available space, greatly increasing the overall surface area and leading to a radical reduction of the size needed (and ultimately the cost) for catalytic and other chemical reactions. Adding a light source as a catalyst to the directed flow of individual molecules in nanotubes allows for extreme control and high efficiency.\n\nTheir review in Nature Phontonics lays out several possibilities for up-scaling optofluidics, such as using optical fibers to transport sunlight into large indoor biofuel reactors with mass-produced nanotubes. They point out that the use of smaller spaces could increase power density and reduce operating costs; optofluidics offers flexibility when concentrating and directing sunlight for solar collection and photovoltaic panels; and by increasing surface area, the domain promises to reduce the use of surface catalysts—the most expensive element in many reactors.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nUsing minute graphite particles 1000 times smaller than the width of a human hair, mechanical engineers at Arizona State University hope to boost the efficiency -- and profitability -- of solar power plants.Hydrogen solar greatly increases the efficiency of creating hydrogen from solar panels by using nanotechnology\nBritish company Hydrogen Solar has doubled the performance of its technology, which converts light and water directly ...\n\nThe concept of delaying global warming by adding particles into the upper atmosphere to cool the climate could unintentionally reduce peak electricity generated by large solar power plants by as much as one-fifth that"

Ford has supplied one of its most advanced batteries to a team of electrical, mechanical and chemical engineers. In collaboration with Ford and General Electric, (GE) the team is beginning a project that will monitor the thermal and mechanical stresses on battery cells and develop a battery management scheme to reduce those stresses and prolong battery life.\n\nThe complete battery pack in its steel case.\n\nThe project kicked off with the dissection of the battery pack, giving the team insights into today's cutting-edge vehicle batteries from the \"crash-worthy\" steel casing to the cells. \"It was a really fun day,\" said professor of chemical engineering Charles Monroe.\n\nThursday, February 28, 2013\n\nKevin Mayra wipes down the last pane in the window.

But by undertaking it, Alex Flick, an engineer in the department of nuclear engineering and radiological sciences (NERS), could get the university's second hot cell up and running again.\n\nThe hot cell will help the Radiation Materials Science group, led by Gary Was, professor of NERS, to gain insights on the aging of components that have spent decades in nuclear power reactors. Most of the reactors in the US are approaching or surpassing 40 years of service, and many are set to operate for another 20 years. With no new reactor construction since 1977, US reliance on fossil fuels will have to rise steeply if these reactors shut down before new ones can take their places. To keep them running safely and efficiently, nuclear engineers need be smart about making repairs – and that means figuring out what components will break and when.\n\nA dollop of hair gel might not look like much, but Michigan Engineering researchers have found that it's a labyrinth of chambers and domes, constructed by the particles inside. These structures allow the gel to hold its shape and determine how much pressure it can withstand before it starts to flow.\n\nWhile manufacturers currently use trial and error to develop gels with a particular degree of solidity, this discovery could provide a way to design gels for particular applications.\n\nFriday, August 10, 2012\n\nAaron Shinkle, a graduate student in the group of professor Charles Monroe, prepares a liquid battery test cell. Photos by Joseph Xu, College of Engineering Communications.\n\nSo-called flow batteries could be the answer to storing solar, wind, and other renewable energy on the scale that power companies need, but it will take engineers and scientists to get them to that level.\n\nBut if homeowners want to get the most out of those solar panels, they had better install a means to store the energy they harvest. And that's just the small version of the problem – as renewable energy sources integrate with the grid on a large scale, batteries fit for power stations are a crucial piece of the puzzle.\n\nWith current lithium-ion technology, batteries the size of semi-truck trailers can hold 500 kilowatt hours (kWh) – or enough to power about fifteen US houses for a day. Unfortunately, they degrade somewhat with each recharge and survive for only about a thousand recharges. In order to develop batteries that can hold as much energy as lithium-ion designs and also last for many years, Monroe's team has joined forces with that of Levi Thompson, a fellow professor of chemical engineering.\n\nWednesday, June 20, 2012\n\nA mod on the underwater plasma jet experiment turned up some unexpected chemistry.\n\nPhoto by James Rotz, Michigan Engineering\n\nIt grew invisibly in the darkened laboratory, lit only by the thimbleful of plasma that glowed purple in a beaker of water. Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences (NERS) graduate student Ben Yee had turned out the lights, shaded the windows, turned off the computer monitors so that the detector would only pick up the light from the plasma. After half an hour of taking data, he turned off the plasma and turned on the lights to find that a mysterious blue jelly had taken up residence in the bottom of the beaker.\n\nIt sounds like an alternate beginning for the 1950s horror flick The Blob, but Yee isn't worried. \"I haven't heard of any unusual deaths or missing persons in the past few days,\" he said. Lifting a beaker from another trial of the experiment, he studied the algae-like green jelly at the bottom. \"It seems peaceful. Family-friendly,\" he added. So, Flubber's lazy cousin?\n\nBut there's only so much Reed and his colleagues in the field can do right now.

So Reed is working to get a more accurate picture of American drivers and passengers.\n\nRight now, he's studying older drivers. He has found that they tend to fare worse than younger people in crashes of the same severity. A lot of factors are likely to blame, Reed acknowledges, but he's zooming in on a couple that might be easier to affect—seatbelt fit and driver posture. His team is also measuring body shape with a special 3D scanner. Reed says there's never been a systematic study like this.

      "text": "Transparent Photoelectric Cells Made for Windows\n\nDespite the interest in renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, the state of modern technology limits them to producing less power than other, less-clean energy sources. However solar panels and wind turbine are significantly easier to install in odd, public areas than larger power plants. Many researchers are working on developing solar power paint and windows to take advantage of this fact, because while those solutions may not be as efficient as full-size power plants, they can be installed and used without interfering with people or the environment.\n\nResearchers at the University of California, Los Angeles have recently developed a solar panel along these lines as it is 70% transparent. The key for this polymer solar cell is that it reacts only weakly with visible light and strongly with infrared light. Infrared light carries less energy than visible, but this sacrifice for transparency will greatly help the design in the end, thanks to the variety of potential uses.\n\nAnother major bonus for this design is that it is polymer based and made in solution. This allows it to be mass produced cheaply, which is important for this technology to enter commercial products. Though the 4% efficiency is not particularly great, these other factors give this design great potential, and that efficiency can only increase as the UCLA researchers and others continue their work."

However, due to their properties of flexibility and variety of colours and shapes, the future of these cells lies in new market niches such as decoration or use in coloured windows that not only allow light through but use this light to generate electricity.\n\nOn the other hand, apart from the rapid amortisation of energy production costs -estimated in one year's use-, there is also the low cost of the materials. \"Organic materials are usually cheaper,\" affirms the researcher, despite which the search continues for an alternative organic dye to the one currently used, derived from ruthenium.\n\n\"The paradox lies in the fact that if one uses these cells because their competitive edge is that they are cheaper and more readily available, and then one uses a dye based on a precious metal, what is the advantage?\" points out Elena Guillén.\n\nOn the other hand, the researchers are aware that it is a relatively new technology -this type of cell was invented in 1991- that still need to be greatly developed. Furthermore, the maximum efficiency obtained in laboratory is only 11%, which is competitive but it drops when extrapolated to an industrial scale.\n\nThe main technological challenge is currently the problem of cell degradation. \"If you use an organic dye, it can be degraded by the action of sunlight, with the consequent reduction in useful life compared to silicon cells. On the other hand,\" the researcher highlights, \"our group is working on one of the key aspect for improving cell stability - elimination of the need to use liquids that can present problems with evaporation, etc. and for which, as already mentioned, our focus is on the use of ionic salts.\""

However, the capacity has remained roughly the same overall, and a breakthrough in the field has been long sought. Experts at the University of St Andrews, working together with colleagues from Strathclyde and Newcastle, have managed only recently to devise a new type of battery that could potentially represent the technological breakthrough the industry has been waiting for.\n\nThe team's efforts, which were funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), have yielded a new type of air-fueled battery, which could potentially be built to store ten times more energy than any existing, conventional design. If the innovation turns out to be sustainable, then, in the near future, we could witness the raise of new classes of electric cars, mobile phones, handheld accessories and laptops, all running on the new type of batteries. In addition to civilian applications, the new devices could be used to benefit the renewable energy industry, which could thus ensure a steady output from sources such as solar panels, geothermal power plants and wind farms.\n\nThe lithium cobalt oxide is one of the main constituents of regular batteries today, but it may be rendered obsolete with the emergence of the new devices that will replace it with porous carbon, which uses oxygen drawn from the air during discharge to improve the overall storage capacity. This means that the same size battery could now yield a large capacity. The find will mostly benefit electric car manufacturers, as they have been striving to make their products lighter, while maintaining the same power for a very long time, but with little success.\n\nThe new STAIR (St Andrews Air) cells are developed in a four-year project, which will mark half of its running time this June. Already, STAIR is shaping up to be a very serious competitor on the international battery market, and threatens even to cost less than today's rechargeables. University of St Andrews Chemistry Department Professor Peter Bruce, who has also been the principal investigator on the project, said that, \"Our target is to get a five to ten fold increase in storage capacity, which is beyond the horizon of current lithium batteries. Our results so far are very encouraging and have far exceeded our expectations.\" At this point, the new cells can hold three times the capacity of an existing battery.\n\n\"The key is to use oxygen in the air as a re-agent, rather than carry the necessary chemicals around inside the battery,\" he added, saying that the oxygen was soaked up from the air inside the porous carbon, and that this process discharged the battery. \"Not only is this part of the process free, the carbon component is much cheaper than current technology,\" he concluded, explaining that the technology was still approximately five years away from mass implementation."

But, despite holding more energy than hydrocarbon fuels, its incredibly low density makes it difficult to store it in sufficient quantity to make it worthwhile.\n\nLiquefying hydrogen by placing it under great pressure is both expensive and potentially dangerous. With a density of just one tenth that of water, it would be necessary to store four times the volume of liquid to match the energy content of gasoline.\n\nAs such, the idea has always been to find materials with high surface areas that soak up hydrogen at much higher densities than previously possible, and without the need for extreme cooling or pressurisation"

      "text": "Fuel Cell Basics\n\nA fuel cell consists of a negatively charged\nelectrode (cathode), a positively charged\nelectrode (anode) and an electrolyte. The\nfuel is oxidized on the anode and free electrons\nare conducted through the electrode to a\nload or power application via the external\ncircuit. From the load, electrons are conducted\nto the cathode, where the oxidant is reduced.\nBoth the anode and the cathode contain a\ncatalyst to speed up the chemical processes.\nThe electrodes provide an interface between\nthe reactants and the electrolyte. The electrolyte\nprevents fuel and oxidant molecules from\nmixing and, therefore, it prevents direct\ncombustion while allowing ions to move through\nthe electrolyte towards the oppositely charged\nelectrode to maintain electrical balance\n-- and thus complete the circuit.\n\nFuel cells are similar to batteries in that\nboth systems have two electrodes separated\nby an electrolyte and electrical energy can\nbe withdrawn from the cell reaction. However,\nunlike batteries, the reactants in a fuel\ncell are supplied from an external source\nand it operates as long as it is supplied\nwith fuel and oxidant. The fuel is usually\nhydrogen and the oxidant is usually oxygen\n(typically from the air). In a hydrogen-oxygen\nfuel cell, hydrogen molecules are split at\nthe anode by the catalyst into protons and\nelectrons. The protons then travel through\nthe electrolyte to the cathode while the\nelectrons are conducted to the cathode through\nthe external circuit and the load or power\napplication. On the cathode, oxygen, protons,\nand electrons combine to form water. Depending\non the input fuel and the electrolyte, different\nchemical reactions will occur.\n\nFuel cells have several highly attractive\ncharacteristics. Carnot's law does not govern\nelectrochemical processes in fuel cells,\nand therefore high operating temperature\nis not necessary for achieving high efficiency.\nThe efficiency of a fuel cell can be higher\nthan in conventional energy conversion processes.\nLow operating temperature guarantees that\nno nitrous oxide is produced. The only waste\nproduct is oxidized fuel. Normally, the fuel\nis hydrogen and consequently, the product\nis water. Carbon dioxide may be present as\nwell, if a hydrocarbon fuel is used. Apart\nfrom being efficient and nonpolluting, fuel\ncells are silent, modular in design and respond\nrapidly to load changes. Fuel reformulation\nin fuel preprocessors adds the benefit of\nfuel flexibility."

The researchers used a chemical process called nanostructuring, which alters the structure of the crystals that make up the material.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Think about it in terms of a big crystal of quartz vs. very-fine beach sand,\" said Adam Rondinone, coauthor of a newly published study in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. \"You can have the same total volume of material, but it's broken up into very small particles that are packed together. It's made of the same atoms in roughly the same proportions, but at the nanoscale the structure is different. And now this solid material conducts lithium ions at a much greater rate than the original large crystal.\"\n\nToday's lithium-ion batteries rely on a liquid electrolyte, the material that conducts ions between the negatively charged anode and positive cathode. But liquid electrolytes often entail safety issues because of their flammability, especially as researchers try to pack more energy in a smaller battery volume. Building batteries with a solid electrolyte, as ORNL researchers have demonstrated, could overcome these safety concerns and size constraints.\n\n\"To make a safer, lightweight battery, we need the design at the beginning to have safety in mind,\" said ORNL's Chengdu Liang, who led the development team. \"We started with a conventional material that is highly stable in a battery system — in particular one that is compatible with a lithium metal anode"

Paired with microchips, the technology could be used in devices such as self-powering sensors, low-power electronic devices and implantable biomedical micro-devices, Chen said.\n\n\"If we can convert both light and heat to electricity, the potential is huge for energy production,\" Chen said. \"By increasing the number of the micro-devices on a chip, this technology might offer a new and efficient platform to complement or even replace current solar cell technology.\"\n\nIn lab tests, the new thin-film structure showed increases by as much at 80 percent in light absorption when compared to single-walled nanotube thin-film devices alone, making it a more efficient generator.\n\nCopper sulfide is also less expensive and more environment-friendly than the noble metals used in similar hybrids.\n\nIn October, the journal Nanotechnology published a paper on the work called \"Optical thermal response of single-walled carbon nanotube-copper sulfide nanoparticle hybrid nanomaterials.\" In it, researchers also say also found that they could enhance the thermal and optical switching effects of the hybrid nanomaterial as much as ten times by using asymmetric illumination, rather than symmetric illumination.\n\nCoauthors on the Nanotechnology paper from Louisiana Tech include Yi-Hsuan Tseng, Yuan He and Que, all of the school's Institute for Micromanufacturing.\n\n\"Dr. Chen's research with nanomaterials is an important advancement with the potential for far-reaching applications,\" said Pamela Jansma, dean of the UT Arlington College of Science. \"This is the kind of work that demonstrates the value of a research university in North Texas and beyond.\"\n\nChen is currently receiving funding from the U.S. Department of Defense to develop nanoparticle self-lighting photodynamic therapy for use against breast and prostate cancers. In 2010, he was the first to publish results in the journal Nanomedicine demonstrating that near infrared light could be used to heat copper sulfide nanoparticles for photothermal therapy in cancer treatment, which destroys cancer cells with heat between 41 and 45 degrees Celsius.\n\nNext month, the Journal of Biomedical Nanotechnology will publish Chen's work successfully coupling gold nanoparticles with the copper sulfide nanoparticles for the photothermal therapy.

It is a practical approach designed and inspired by nature. With the ever increasing population of the world and the demand for natural resources growing while supplies being constant, environmentalists all over the world are trying to come up with innovative solutions to help the environment, companies, and most of all–consumers. With about 7 million humans on earth, scientists are realizing that a sustainable world can be created only with the help of nature.\n\nAnimals, plants, and microbes are the world's greatest engineers. They have solved many of the problems that humans face today. One such solution to retain the environment is Lotusan, an innovative, environmentally-friendly and energy-saving paint, created by paint manufacturers using the concept of microscopic structure of the lotus. Buildings that are painted with Lotusan has the ability to clean themselves during rain. This article throws light on the developments in biomimicry in different areas.\n\nTrends\n\n1. MIT scientists successful in creating a stable artificial leaf\n\nA high revolutionary advancement in the field of chemistry has been researched and conceptualized at MIT's Nocera Lab, led by Dr. Daniel Nocera. The leaf is composed of electronic components, silicon, and low-cost catalysts such as nickel, for enhancing reactions. The leaf can utilize sunlight for photosynthesis and break water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen released in the reaction can be used to produce electricity.\n\nWorld's very first balanced artificial leaf, is not to decorate homes but is an innovative idea to address the issue of core function of creating clean energy. The research is cost-effective yet green and effective. This special artificial leaf can act as a source of inexpensive electricity, especially for small appliances. All that you require would be water and sunlight. In the present scenario, this artificial leaf can act as an inexpensive and compact source of electricity, specifically for small appliances. The requirements are just a gallon of water and sunlight.\n\n2. Mercedes-Benz Bionic Car\n\nA new concept vehicle has been used by Daimler Chrysler by examining the potential of bionics for automobile development. Combining pioneering diesel engine technology and innovative emission control methods, outstanding results has been achieved with fuel consumption and emissions.\n\nTo realize the Mercedes-Benz bionic car, the engineers at the Mercedes-Benz Technology Centre and the DaimlerChrysler Research department have looked for a specific example in nature which creates an aerodynamic, safe, comfortable and environmentally compatible car. Boxfish was the specific example in nature that helped in creating the bionic. Despite its boxy, cube-shaped body, Boxfish, a tropical fish is outstandingly streamlined representing an ideal aerodynamic. Besides the aerodynamics and a lightweight concept derived from nature, the innovative SCR technology greatly contribute to fuel economy.\n\n3. Nissan Solar Tree Concept\n\nThe Nissan Solar Tree is a concept that is part of the larger 2030 zero-emission city. Apart from Nissan, many major industrial companies in Japan are participating in it. Based on the green aspirations, the idea hopes to create the next-generation city design. The solar tree which is about 12 meters in height is fitted with 3 translucent solar panels. It could be deployed locally within the city, or in a forest along highways and other more remote areas. The Solar Tree is capable of providing energy to 7000 homes. The nature mimicking concept, if turned to reality, can completely eradicate the problem of electricity.\n\n4.NOMFET organic transistor that mimics a brain synapse\n\nNanotechnologies may aid scientists to create computers that can stimulate and emulate the brain's abilities of sensation, perception, interaction, and cognition. Nanotechnology researchers in France have developed a hybrid nanoparticle-organic transistor that can mimic the main functionalities of a synapse.\n\nThe potential application of this work is to increase the performance of neural-network computing circuits. Since nano particles and molecules are nanosize objects suitable for nanodevice fabrication, they can be easily assembled in a low-cost technique. Hybrid nanoparticle-organic transistor of Vuillaume might be advantageous if we connect artificial neuromorphic devices and circuits (based on the NOMEFT) with soft biological materials. However, even if this work reduces the number of electronic devices required to mimic a biological synapse, the high level of synapse-neuron connectivity in the brain requires the development of artificial neural networks computing circuits in 3D.\n\n5. COM-BAT\n\nNew platforms are being researched, especially which mimic the nature to improve surveillance options. This robotic spy plane, although just six inches long can be used as a power source and used for monitoring all sensory perceptions in a combat zone. This project is being funded by the US Army, but involves the University of California at Berkeley, the University Of New Mexico, and the University Of Michigan College Of Engineering. The spy plane with the aid of solar power, wind power and even vibration-sourced power can record images; audio and even smells of a combat area, transmitting them over radio signals.\n\n6. Corona Solar Lights\n\nNature mimicking's best example would be the Corona Solar Lights. This simple yet nifty device created by Emi Fujita and Shane Kohatsu is an eco-friendly luxurious lighting. Borrowing elements from the dish and sunflower as metaphors, they have combined a photovoltaic cell, LEDs, and floral form to render a beautiful solar-powered glow to your outdoor spaces. You can choose to place it in your garden in the midst of sunflowers, attach it to a wall or even place it in a flower vase. The no-adhesive function allows for easy disassembling and recycling.\n\nAdvancements\n\nBiomimetics has grown as complex as living organisms. Each day scientists are tapping into natural environment to produce practical use technologies. For example, scientists have been looking at whale flippers (which have points on the sides, rather than the expected smooth surface) and trying to apply their design to make efficient windmills. Scientists have also engineered a swimsuit that is made up of tiny teeth-like plates, like shark's dentricles. The dentricle like structure aids the swimmer cut through the water with less friction. Some engineers have studied the beaks of toucans to see how they can be so amazingly light so as not to disrupt flight, but hard enough to crack nuts.\n\nStanford University scientists have created a robot called Stickybot with footpads covered in nanotubules. The footpads are like a gecko's foot. A gecko's feet have around 6.5 million spatula-like hairs on each toe which allow the animal to stick onto and climb vertical surfaces due to Van der Wals attractions (the attractions between minute electrical charges caused by the constantly shifting electrons). Although the created technological bodies are not as fast moving as their original counterparts, scientists are looking for ways to improve it.\n\nThe Impact\n\nOver the years Biomimicry is gaining popularity across the globe. Scientists are discovering new technologies to provide design methodologies and techniques to optimize engineering products and systems. San Diego Zoo Global has one of the largest plant and animal collections in the world. With a set of scientific and behavioral experts and world-class facilities to help unlock nature's secrets and solve real-world problems San Diego Zoo Global has partnered with City of San Diego and other universities to become the world's first biomimicry hub. The vision of the organization is to connect people to wildlife and conservation. To maximize the use of Biomimicry, scientists and researchers are working together to improve it.\n\nParker, a researcher at the Natural History Museum in London and at the University of Sydney, is a leading proponent of biomimetics. His studies on iridescence in butterflies, beetles and antireflective coatings in moth eyes have led to brighter screens for cellular phones. Working with Procter & Gamble and Yves Saint Laurent he makes cosmetics that mimic the natural sheen of diatoms. He also works with the British Ministry of Defense to emulate the natural water-repallant property of ants.\n\nIn Berlin, Germany, the fingerlike primary feathers of raptors are inspiring engineers to develop wings that change shape to reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency. Architects in Zimbabwe are studying how termites regulate temperature, humidity, and airflow in their mounds in order to build more comfortable buildings. Japanese medical researchers are reducing the pain of an injection by using hypodermic needles edged with tiny serrations, like those on a mosquito's proboscis, minimizing nerve stimulation. Scientists all over the world are using the technique of Biomimicry and helping to achieve a sustainable earth"

Unlike batteries that supply power to implants, a power-generating device may not have to be surgically removed and replaced, because glucose is a potentially limitless source of energy.\n\nThe device uses enzymes to harvest energy from glucose and oxygen found naturally in the body. Past attempts at using such a device in animals have failed because the enzymes have required acidic conditions or were inhibited by charged particles in the fluid surrounding cells. But Philippe Cinquin and his team from Joseph Fourier University in Grenoble, France, overcame these obstacles by confining selected enzymes inside graphite discs that were placed into dialysis bags. Glucose and oxygen flowed into the device, but enzymes stayed in place and catalyzed the oxidation of glucose to generate electrical energy.\n\nThe team surgically implanted the device in the abdominal cavity of two rats. The maximum power of the device was 6.5 microwatts, which approaches the 10 microwatts required by pacemakers. The power remained around two microwatts for 11 days in one rat, and the other rat showed byproducts of glucose oxidation in its urine for three months, indicating that the device lasts at least that long. \"This is a big breakthrough for the field of implantable biofuel cells,\" says Shelley Minteer, an electrochemist at Saint Louis University.\n\n\"It's quite an interesting paper that demonstrates for the first time that one can generate electrical power from body fluids,\" says Itamar Willner, a biomolecular chemist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nThe technology could be used for a range of applications, such as neural and bone-growth stimulators, drug delivery devices, insulin pumps, and biosensors, says Eileen Yu, a chemical engineer at Newcastle University.

      "text": "Diesel-Powered Vehicles Soon to Be More Environmentally Friendly\n\nA scientist working with the University of Texas at Dallas now claims that he and his team have succeeded in finding a replacement for the platinum presently used by diesel engines manufacturers in order to control the amounts of pollution released into the atmosphere by diesel-powered vehicles.\n\nThus, Dr. Kyeongjiae Cho, who specializes in material science, engineering and physics, argues that manmade oxide mullite can not only successfully replace the platinum found in diesel engines, but that using this material also fosters financial and environmental benefits.\n\nTheir study on this issue, which is to be published in the research journal 'Science' on the 17th of August, shows how this innovative material yields better results in terms of pollution control and is also much cheaper to produce and use.\n\nMore precisely, tests carried out to verify this theory showed that manmade oxide mullite further reduces pollution by as much as nearly 50% when compared to the overall efficiency of platinum.\n\nFurthermore, diesel engine manufacturers stand to really take a liking to this material, simply because, as opposed to platinum, it is neither expensive, nor rare.\n\nAs Dr. Kyeongjiae Cho puts it, \"Many pollution control and renewable-energy applications require precious metals that are limited – there isn't enough platinum to supply the millions and millions of automobiles driven in the world. Mullite is not only easier to produce than platinum, but also better at reducing pollution in diesel engines.\"\n\nGiven the fact that, not very long ago, the World Health Organization warned about how the exhaust coming from diesel engines is likely to cause cancer when individuals suffer prolonged exposures to it, being able to further cut down on the amounts of pollution such vehicles produce simply by switching to a catalyst which is both cheaper and more efficient than platinum it seems to us like good news indeed.\n\n\"Our goal to move completely away from precious metals and replace them with oxides that can be seen commonly in the environment has been achieved. We've found new possibilities to create renewable, clean energy technology by designing new functional materials without being limited by the supply of precious metals,\" concluded Dr. Kyeongjiae Cho."

But even if not used, all batteries still have inherent discharge rates. This means that they lose available \"charge space\" gradually, regardless of whether it is rechargeable or not. Lithium-ion batteries for example, at optimal conditions are known to last for at least 5 years before succumbing considerably to performance limiting effects.\n\nOf course, we all know that scientists and researchers have been tackling the challenge of extending the service life of batteries, as they have been seeking the ultimate solution for it for quite some time already. In fact there is was a particular breakthrough in the field just recently, and it is presented as an alternative battery that has the potential to last for decades.\n\nBetavoltaics is an energy generating principle by which an electric current is produced by using a radioactive source that emits beta particles. It is different from other nuclear power sources in that it does not use the remnant heat of the radioactive reaction, but instead uses the trail created by the beta particles to directly generate electricity. The most commonly used source is tritium, a well known isotope of hydrogen.\n\nAccording to this report, the new battery is primarily made up of a layer of radioactive tritium. It is as big as an average adult's thumb, and the tritium layer is mounted onto a semiconductor material, producing energy using betavoltaics. They were designed by City Labs, and it has been just recently been completed to be able to generate the expected amount of power and electricity.\n\nLockheed Martin was given the responsibility for testing out the new nano-tritium battery. So, aside from confirming its power generating capabilities, the batteries were also tested on a variety of different conditions and environments to evaluate its durability. During the tests, it was confirmed that the batteries are capable of continued operation even within a wide range of temperature, elevation, and stress (vibration) levels. With combined resilience levels and constant/stable power delivery, it is expected that the nano-tritium battery can last for more than 20 years.\n\nThe description for this type of battery can be misleading though, because although it could technically last for decades, it is not actually used to power some of our more energy hungry gadgets. In fact, it is actually only capable of generating a few nanowatts of power. It is primarily designed for very small devices that require very little power to run (but needs to run constantly), such as sensors and implants.\n\nFor those who are wondering about the safety of the beta radiation emitted by the battery, there is no need to be alarmed. Unlike the more dangerous promethium (the first radioactive element used in betavoltaics), tritium is a relatively \"benign\" beta radiation source. In fact, tritium-based betavoltaics is already regularly used and applied to other things like self-powered exit signs, glow sticks, and diver's watches (see feature imageNice article but if i am allowed to think a little here tritium can last decades on a very small package so could someone explain to me why we cannot create this technology to size and run all of our things also? Oh wait, big corporation don't like the idea..i see , i see\n\nPlease just release those thousands of hidden patents that are kept up in secret for national security reasons…. It would be about time we evolve here and start building a newer society based on current technologies and spiritual intents"

The entire system was streamlined to make it more efficient and scalable by using PNNL-developed microchannel technology in combination with processes called external steam reforming and fuel recycling. PNNL's system includes fuel cell stacks developed earlier with the support of DOE's Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance.\n\n\"Solid oxide fuels cells are a promising technology for providing clean, efficient energy. But, until now, most people have focused on larger systems that produce 1 megawatt of power or more and can replace traditional power plants,\" said Vincent Sprenkle, a co-author on the paper and chief engineer of PNNL's solid oxide fuel cell development program. \"However, this research shows that smaller solid oxide fuel cells that generate between 1 and 100 kilowatts of power are a viable option for highly efficient, localized power generation.\"\n\nSprenkle and his co-authors had community-sized power generation in mind when they started working on their solid oxide fuel cell, also known as a SOFC. The pilot system they built generates about 2 kW of electricity, or how much power a typical American home consumes. The PNNL team designed its system so it can be scaled up to produce between 100 and 250 kW, which could provide power for about 50 to 100 American homes."

With new concepts – reduced anode-cathode spacing, evolved microbes and new separator materials – the technology can now produce more than two kilowatts per cubic meter of liquid reactor volume. This amount of power density far exceeds anything else done with microbial fuel cells.\n\nThe system also works better than an alternative approach to creating electricity from wastewater, based on anaerobic digestion that produces methane. It treats the wastewater more effectively, and doesn't have any of the environmental drawbacks of that technology, such as production of unwanted hydrogen sulfide or possible release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.\n\nThe OSU system has now been proven at a substantial scale in the laboratory, Liu said, and the next step would be a pilot study. Funding is now being sought for such a test. A good candidate, she said, might initially be a food processing plant, which is a contained system that produces a steady supply of certain types of wastewater that would provide significant amounts of electricity.\n\nContinued research should also find even more optimal use of necessary microbes, reduced material costs and improved function of the technology at commercial scales, OSU scientists said.\n\nOnce advances are made to reduce high initial costs, researchers estimate that the capital construction costs of this new technology should be comparable to that of the activated sludge systems now in widespread use today – and even less expensive when future sales of excess electricity are factored in Almost any type of organic waste material can be used to produce electricity – not only wastewater, but also grass straw, animal waste, and byproducts from such operations as the wine, beer or dairy industries\n\nIn which country that project was held?

A report of the research appears in this week's Physical Review Letters.\n\n\"The lead acid battery in a car must deliver exceptionally high electrical current and the key element of this is the lead dioxide anode which stores the energy within the battery. To release this energy requires lead oxide to have a very high conductivity and while lead-acid batteries have been around for over 150 years the fundamental reason for the high conductivity has remained elusive,\" explained Professor of Chemistry, Graeme Watson of the Trinity College's Department of Chemistry, an author of the paper.\n\nThe team used a combination of computational solid state chemistry and neutron diffraction to demonstrate that lead dioxide is in fact intrinsically an insulator with a small electronic band gap. They also showed that lead oxide very easily loses oxygen which causes it to become electron rich and transforming it from an insulator into a metallic conductor. The researcher team believes these insights could open up new avenues for the selection of improved materials for modern battery technologies."

      "text": "Long-life rechargeable batteries\n\nScientists at Brookhaven National Laboratory have developed a new metal alloy that could greatly improve the performance of rechargeable batteries for portable electronic devices and electric and hybrid electric cars\n\nBrookhaven researchers determined that the increased energy storage potential of an experimental alloy was due to \"dumbbells\" made of two nickel atoms (bottom, left) replacing a lanthanum atom in the lattice. Lanthanum atoms are shown in red, nickel atoms are shown in blue and white.\n\nSeptember 17—If you're tired of cell phones and laptops that quickly lose their charge—or worse, their ability to be recharged—help may be on the way. Brookhaven National Laboratory scientists James Reilly, Gordana Adzic, John Johnson, Thomas Vogt, and James McBreen have developed a new metal alloy that could greatly improve the performance of rechargeable batteries.\n\nWhen used as an electrode in nickel/metal hydride (Ni/MHx) batteries—the most popular rechargeables—the new alloy has a high capacity for storing charge, a long-lasting ability to be charged and recharged, and good resistance to corrosion. Furthermore, the alloy contains no cobalt, an expensive metal found in many Ni/MHx batteries, and no cadmium, a toxic metal found in nickel-cadmium rechargeables. Composed of lanthanum, nickel, and tin, \"this new alloy is inexpensive and relatively environmentally benign,\" said Reilly, the team leader.\n\nThe alloy is based on a classic formula used for Ni/MHx batteries, which consists of a cube-like lattice with lanthanum atoms on the corners and nickel on the inside. The electrode works by storing up hydrogen atoms (from the electrolyte) in the spaces between the atoms during charging, and releasing them into the electrolyte during discharge.\n\nBut the added hydrogen atoms have an adverse effect: They cause the crystal lattice to expand, and then contract as the battery discharges. \"This expansion and contraction is repeated in each charge/discharge cycle of the battery,\" said Reilly, \"which pulverizes the alloy into small particles that are more susceptible to corrosion. That's why batteries don't recharge an infinite number of times. Eventually corrosion takes over.\"\n\nThrough trial and error, scientists originally found that using a mixture of metals, including cobalt, in place of nickel helps the electrode resist this tendency to break apart and corrode. But even small amounts of cobalt can drive up the cost of batteries considerably. For batteries of the sizes needed in electric vehicles, the cost can be prohibitive. So scientists have been trying to understand the role cobalt plays—and find ways to replace it.\n\nThat's what the Brookhaven scientists were doing when they were investigating several relatively simple, cobalt-free alloys. They found a combination of lanthanum, nickel, and tin with a very high storage capacity that didn't decay over many charge/discharge cycles. This surprised the scientists, because normally, combinations of these atoms in the classic ratio of one lanthanum atom to five of the other atoms decayed rather quickly.\n\nAs it turns out, there was a mistake. Accidentally, the scientists had added a bit more of the nickel/tin combo, so that the ratio of atoms was no longer 1 lanthanum to 5 nickel or tin, but 1 to 5.157. That small difference in the ratio of the ingredients made a big difference in performance. The superior performance was then confirmed in a further series of experiments, carried out by Adzic and Johnson, with other 1 lanthanum/ 5+ nickel/tin combinations.\n\nVogt then studied the lattice structure at Brookhaven's National Synchrotron Light Source to figure out where the extra atoms went. By beaming samples of the material with high-intensity x-rays and looking at how the beam scattered, he determined that \"dumbbells\" made of two nickel atoms were replacing some of the lanthanum atoms on the cube corners.\n\nThese nickel dumbbells make the structure more compact, said Vogt, which decreases somewhat its ability to store hydrogen, and therefore its initial charge capacity relative to the classic 1-5 formula. But it also decreases the alloy's tendency to corrode, therefore increasing its life-span. The result is that the long-term energy-storage capacity of this new alloy exceeds that of cobalt alloys used in commercial batteries."

The team includes experts from the Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison, Florida State Univ. and the Univ. of Michigan. The group described its breakthrough March 3, 2013, in the advance online edition of the journal Nature Materials. The researchers' new material is composed of 24 layers that alternate between the pnictide superconductor and a layer of the oxide strontium titanate. The researchers maintained an atomically sharp interface. The(Ars Technica) A group of researchers in Germany who have a history of working with lithium-air batteries have turned their attention to sodium-air. The reason for the change is that lithium-air has some unfortunate chemistry that has proven difficult to overcome. The researchers wanted a simpler system that might not have as many technical hurdles. It turns out that sodium-air provides this system. The battery they constructed is very simple. There's a solid sodium electrode at one end. On top of that an electrolyte is placed, then an air-permeable carbon electrode. The metal atoms release an electron that travels through a circuit to do work while the ionic form of the metal dissolves into the electrolyte and travels to the carbon electrode. At that electrode it combines with oxygen and an electron to form sodium oxide. It's important to remember that this is very much exploratory, so the news is quite mixed. It certainly can't compare with a commercial lithium-ion battery, but it compares very well with lithium-air. The researchers found that it was easier to charge, held more charge, and had better discharge characteristics. In other words, even though lithium-air has a higher theoretical energy density, sodium-air has a higher practical energy density. Further, that energy is stored in the battery more efficiently and can be extracted more efficiently.\n\nThe adsorption of ions in microporous materials governs the operation of technologies as diverse as water desalination, energy storage, sensing, and mechanical actuation. Until now, however, researchers attempting to improve the performance of these technologies haven't been able to directly and unambiguously identify how factors such as pore size, pore surface chemistry and electrolyte properties affect the concentration of ions in these materials as a function of the applied potential. To provide the needed information, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory have demonstrated that a technique known as small angle neutron scattering (SANS) can be used to study the effects of ions moving into nanoscale pores. Believed to be the first application of the SANS technique for studying ion surface adsorption in-situ, details of the research were reported recently in Angewandte Chemie International Edition. Using conductive nanoporous carbon, the researchers conducted proof-of-concept experiments to measure changes in the adsorption of hydrogen ions in pores of different sizes within the same material due to variations in solvent properties and applied electrical potential. Systematic studies performed with such a technique could ultimately help identify the optimal pore size, surface chemistry and electrolyte solvent properties necessary for either maximizing or minimizing the adsorption of ions under varying conditions, the Fritz-Haber Institute in Berlin, The physicists illuminated a titanium dioxide crystal with an intense ultraviolet laser pulse of less than five femtoseconds duration. The laser pulse excites the valence electrons in the crystal and generates a small number of hot electrons with a temperature of several thousand Kelvin. Following the first, intense laser pulse, the changes in the reflectivity of the crystal on the femtosecond timescale were observed by a second, weak light pulse. This measurement provides the scientists with information on the changes in the crystal induced by the first laser pulse: the intense ultraviolet laser pulse did not only heat up the valence electrons but also changed the electron distribution within the lattice.\n\nA white Hyundai ix35 Fuel Cell (PEM-type) vehicle rolled off the assembly line at the company's Ulsan manufacturing facility today, as Hyundai became the world's first automaker to begin assembly-line production of zero-emissions, hydrogen-powered vehicles for fleet use.

      "text": "In the laboratory and on Capitol Hill, hydrogen has been touted by many as the potential fuel of the future in an age of rising gasoline prices and restricted oil supplies. But David Beach, leader of the Materials Chemistry Group in ORNL's Chemical Sciences Division, believes metallic nanoparticles may be even more promising candidates as a long-term solution to the rising cost of transportation fuels.\n\nBoron nanoparticles in gasoline might be tomorrow's automotive fuel.\n\nHe predicts that a car with a modified engine powered by boron powders could drive three times as far as today's gasoline-powered internal combustion engine. Metal fuels, he adds, also offer great potential for unmanned vehicles and battlefield power sources for military uses.\n\nLike hydrogen, a metal fuel is an energy carrier and burns cleanly. But unlike hydrogen, metal fuels—such as iron, aluminum, and boron—possess a higher energy content per unit volume, can be stored and transported at ambient temperatures and pressures, reach combustion at high efficiency in a heat engine, and avoid the high costs of fuel cells.\n\nLarge particles of metal do not burn until heated to the metal's boiling point. At this temperature, metal vapor combusts to form metal oxides. Unfortunately, the process leads to very high combustion temperatures, fouling of the internal surfaces of the combustion chamber, and the production of nitrogen oxide pollutants. Metal nanoparticles, however, burn faster and more completely at lower temperatures with no gas phase combustion. \"These particles oxidize fast enough that they never reach the peak combustion temperature,\" Beach says.\n\nBeach is leading experiments to demonstrate that metal fuels could be developed for both civilian and military transportation. He works with ORNL's Solomon Labinov, who originated the idea; John Thomas, who is designing an engine to run on\nmetal fuels; and Bobby Sumpter, who carries out first-principles modeling of the combustion using the extensive computing resources of ORNL's National Leadership Computing Facility.\n\nThey conducted initial experiments with iron nanoparticles for civilian applications. They demonstrated that combustion\noccurs entirely in the solid state, that nanostructuring is preserved through many cycles of oxidation and reduction, and that the particles are easily reduced with synthetic gas—the mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen that comes from heating coal and water in the absence of air.\n\n\"We have performed experiments with iron nanoparticles about 50 nanometers in diameter,\" Beach says. \"These nanoparticles are partially oxidized to develop a 2-nanometerthick oxide coating that keeps the particles from spontaneously combusting. With the oxide coating, which we measured using X-ray diffraction, a temperature exceeding 150°C is required to make the particles ignite. We measured the peak combustion temperatures of these particles, the ignition temperature, and the extent of the reaction. Then we determined the products\nof the reaction.\n\n\"In our radiometry experiment we measured the iron nanoparticles' peak combustion temperature, which is 1100 Kelvin,\" Beach continues. \"The temperature should be hot enough to achieve high energy efficiency but not so high that exotic materials, such as expensive ceramics, are required to contain the combustion. Cast iron can be used as the combustion chamber for nanostructured metal fuels.\"\n\nBeach says that the exhaust gas of metal fuels in a heat engine, such as a gas turbine or Stirling engine, is very clean. \"We take the oxygen out of the air, leaving nearly pure nitrogen,\" he says. \"We recover most of the heat using a recuperator and get much closer to the highest efficiency theoretically achievable in an engine.\n\n\"An even better energy carrier would be boron, but only if boron nanoparticles could be made at a reasonable cost. Boron is three times better than gasoline in terms of heat per unit weight and heat per unit volume.\""

      "text": "Methane-powered laptops may be closer than you think\n\nNov 17, 2010\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Making fuel cells practical and affordable will not happen overnight. It may, however, not take much longer.\n\nWith advances in nanostructured devices, lower operating temperatures, and the use of an abundant fuel source and cheaper materials, a group of researchers led by Shriram Ramanathan at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) are increasingly optimistic about the commercial viability of the technology.\n\nRamanathan, an expert and innovator in the development of solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), says they may, in fact, soon become the go-to technology for those on the go.\n\nElectrochemical fuel cells have long been viewed as a potential eco-friendly alternative to fossil fuels—especially as most SOFCs leave behind little more than water as waste.\n\nThe obstacles to using SOFCs to charge laptops and phones or drive the next generation of cars and trucks have remained reliability, temperature, and cost.\n\nFuel cells operate by converting chemical energy (from hydrogen or a hydrocarbon fuel such as methane) into an electric current. Oxygen ions travel from the cathode through the electrolyte toward the anode, where they oxidize the fuel to produce a current of electrons back toward the cathode.\n\nThat may seem simple enough in principle, but until now, SOFCs have been more suited for the laboratory rather than the office or garage. In two studies appearing in the Journal of Power Sources this month, Ramanathan's team reported several critical advances in SOFC technology that may quicken their pace to market.\n\nIn the first paper, Ramanathan's group demonstrated stable and functional all-ceramic thin-film SOFCs that do not contain any platinum.\n\nIn thin-film SOFCs, the electrolyte is reduced to a hundredth or even a thousandth of its usual scale, using densely packed layers of special ceramic films, each just nanometers in thickness. These micro-SOFCs usually incorporate platinum electrodes, but they can be expensive and unreliable.\n\n\"If you use porous metal electrodes,\" explains Ramanathan, \"they tend to be inherently unstable over long periods of time. They start to agglomerate and create open circuits in the fuel cells.\"\n\nIn a second paper published this month, the team demonstrated a methane-fueled micro-SOFC operating at less than 500° Celsius, a feat that is relatively rare in the field.\n\nTraditional SOFCs have been operating at about 800–1000°C, but such high temperatures are only practical for stationary power generation. In short, using them to power up a smartphone mid-commute is not feasible.\n\nIn recent years, materials scientists have been working to reduce the required operating temperature to about 300–500°C, a range Ramanathan calls the \"sweet spot.\"\n\nMoreover, when fuel cells operate at lower temperatures, material reliability is less critical—allowing, for example, the use of less expensive ceramics and metallic interconnects—and the start-up time can be shorter.\n\n\"Low temperature is a holy grail in this field,\" says Ramanathan. \"If you can realize high-performance solid-oxide fuel cells that operate in the 300–500°C range, you can use them in transportation vehicles and portable electronics, and with different types of fuels.\"\n\nThe use of methane, an abundant and cheap natural gas, in the team's SOFC was also of note. Until recently, hydrogen has been the primary fuel for SOFCs. Pure hydrogen, however, requires a greater amount of processing.\n\n\"It's expensive to make pure hydrogen,\" says Ramanathan, \"and that severely limits the range of applications.\"\n\nAs methane begins to take over as the fuel of choice, the advances in temperature, reliability, and affordability should continue to reinforce each other.\n\n\"Future research at SEAS will explore new types of catalysts for methane SOFCs, with the goal of identifying affordable, earth-abundant materials that can help lower the operating temperature even further,\" adds Ramanathan.\n\nFuel cell research at SEAS is funded by the same NSF grant that enabled the \"Robobees\" project led by Robert J. Wood, Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering. Wood and Ramanathan hope that micro-SOFCs will provide the tiny power source necessary to get the flying robots off the ground.\n\nRelated StoriesStacks of ceramic plates are capable of transforming fuels like natural gas into electricity using an electrochemical process.

But it also reflects a growing interest in using computer modeling now that it has increased in sophistication, according to the Energy Department.\n\nThe INCITE program is somewhat like the lottery in that everyone has a chance. The Energy Department has an open application process in which any scientist, whether working in the academic or commercial world, is welcome to submit a request to win supercomputing hours, and it's not restricted to energy-related science.\n\nAmong these latest 57 recipients, are large companies like Boeing and General Electric that are going to use the time for sophisticated modeling of potential designs for jet engines and wind turbines, respectively. There are also the climate change and earthquake prediction simulation projects, as one might expect.\n\nMost interesting to the energy sector perhaps is the Lithium/Air Battery Project led by Jack Wells, group leader of the Computational Nanotechnology Group at the Center for Engineering Science Advanced Research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. His team will be running simulations of lithium/air battery reactions.

      "text": "Spinach power gets a big boost\n\nWednesday, September 5, 2012\n\nThis is a biohybrid solar cell that uses the photosynthetic protein from spinach made by Vanderbilt students based on a previous design. Credit: Amrutur Anilkumar, Vanderbilt UniversityThe research was reported online on Sep. 4 in the journalAdvanced Materials and Vanderbilt has applied for a patent on the combination.\n\n\"This combination produces current levels almost 1,000 times higher than we were able to achieve by depositing the protein on various types of metals. It also produces a modest increase in voltage,\" said David Cliffel, associate professor of chemistry, who collaborated on the project with Kane Jennings, professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering. \"If we can continue on our current trajectory of increasing voltage and current levels, we could reach the range of mature solar conversion technologies in three years.\"\n\nThe researchers' next step is to build a functioning PS1-silicon solar cell using this new design. Jennings has an Environmental Protection Agency award that will allow a group of undergraduate engineering students to build the prototype. The students won the award at the National Sustainable Design Expo in April based on a solar panel that they had created using a two-year old design. With the new design, Jennings estimates that a two-foot panel could put out at least 100 milliamps at one volt – enough to power a number of different types of small electrical devices.\n\nMore than 40 years ago, scientists discovered that one of the proteins involved in photosynthesis, called Photosystem 1 (PS1), continued to function when it was extracted from plants like spinach. Then they determined PS1 converts sunlight into electrical energy with nearly 100 percent efficiency, compared to conversion efficiencies of less than 40 percent achieved by manmade devices. This prompted various research groups around the world to begin trying to use PS1 to create more efficient solar cells.\n\nAnother potential advantage of these biohybrid cells is that they can be made from cheap and readily available materials, unlike many microelectronic devices that require rare and expensive materials like platinum or indium. Most plants use the same photosynthetic proteins as spinach. In fact, in another research project Jennings is working on a method for extracting PS1 from kudzu.\n\nSince the initial discovery, progress has been slow but steady. Researchers have developed ways to extract PS1 efficiently from leaves. They have demonstrated that it can be made into cells that produce electrical current when exposed to sunlight. However, the amount of power that these biohybrid cells can produce per square inch has been substantially below that of commercial photovoltaic cells.\n\nAnother problem has been longevity. The performance of some early test cells deteriorated after only a few weeks. In 2010, however, the Vanderbilt team kept a PS1 cell working for nine months with no deterioration in performance. \"Nature knows how to do this extremely well. In evergreen trees, for example, PS1 lasts for years,\" said Cliffel. \"We just have to figure out how to do it ourselves.\"\n\nThe Vanderbilt researchers report that their PS1/silicon combination produces nearly a milliamp (850 microamps) of current per square centimeter at 0.3 volts. That is nearly two and a half times more current than the best level reported previously from a biohybrid cell.\n\nThe reason this combo works so well is because the electrical properties of the silicon substrate have been tailored to fit those of the PS1 molecule. This is done by implanting electrically charge atoms in the silicon to alter its electrical properties: a process called \"doping.\" In this case, the protein worked extremely well with silicon doped with positive charges and worked poorly with negatively doped silicon.\n\nTo make the device, the researchers extracted PS1 from spinach into an aqueous solution and poured the mixture on the surface of a p-doped silicon wafer. Then they put the wafer in a vacuum chamber in order to evaporate the water away leaving a film of protein. They found that the optimum thickness was about one micron, about 100 PS1 molecules thick.\n\nWhen a PS1 protein exposed to light, it absorbs the energy in the photons and uses it to free electrons and transport them to one side of the protein. That creates regions of positive charge, called holes, which move to the opposite side of the protein.\n\nIn a leaf, all the PS1 proteins are aligned. But in the protein layer on the device, individual proteins are oriented randomly. Previous modeling work indicated that this was a major problem. When the proteins are deposited on a metallic substrate, those that are oriented in one direction provide electrons that the metal collects while those that are oriented in the opposite direction pull electrons out of the metal in order to fill the holes that they produce. As a result, they produce both positive and negative currents that cancel each other out to leave a very small net current flow. The p-doped silicon eliminates this problem because it allows electrons to flow into PS1 but will not accept them from protein. In this manner, electrons flow through the circuit in a common direction.\n\n\"This isn't as good as protein alignment, but it is much better than what we had before,\" said Jennings"

You already said its 70% cheaper so why dont they commercialize it while continuing to research and when something better comes along then just replace it.\n\nI mean if its already that much of a improvement, commercializing it could fund even more research into the field.\n\nI always read about all these great improvements but they dont get commercialized until decades later because researching is a never ending process.\n\nThings can forever be improved, so if you find even a small improvement you should implement it into society otherwise your just holding back progress.\n\nActually, cheap means inexpensive. Coming from the Oxford English Dictionary, cheap means \"That may be bought at small cost; bearing a relatively low price; inexpensive.\" This is opposed to the slang \"cheap-and-nasty\" which means of poor quality or undesirable.\n\nGranted, definition 4b mentions that it might be \"worthless; paltry,\" but, I think that the author is correct in using cheap and inexpensive synonymously.\n\nbuckrodgers\nGlad this works in dirty water. A few more of these catastrophic oil spills and that's all we may have left to use.\nHow scalable is the process to make this catalyst or does it need more reasearch to make production profitable? How efficient is it? Will we need production plants so big that construction costs will be prohibitive?\nHow much energy will it take to produce this material?\nWe CAN treat it like we did corn and subsidize it till it is so cheap (no matter the real cost) that no one would even think of drilling another oil well.\n\nAccording to the article, it's 70 TIMES cheaper, ie, about $29/ounce. In any case, what matters is by how much does it decrease the needed energy to split H2O. Without that figure, which I didn't see in the article, it's rather vaporware.\n\nThis seems like it could be a potentially very lucrative discovery in the debate for renewable energy. I feel like $29/ounce is pretty reasonable and obviously this is a very safe way to store hydrogen energy. I just recently saw a video that explains in detail the process of how military scientists are doing the exact same thing only with aluminum nano-particles which I think may be even cheaper. I'll post a link if you would like to see more about the process. It's pretty rad stuff!\n\nmclean\nHydrogen production has always been cheap compaired to any oil product. What we have been seeing is that the money of oil is keeping hydrogen at bay. Once people realize what these following words mean, and please use your dictionaries, we will switch over to hydrogen and never look back:\nIT CAN BE PRODUCED ANYWHERE AT ANY TIME DAY OR NIGHT ANY TIME OF THE YEAR AND YOU CAN NEVER USE IT UP. THE CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS IS 100% COMPATABLE WITH ELECTRICTY. WIND AND WATER IS ALL YOU NEED. A WATERFALL WOULD DUE. ALL OF THE TEC IS ALREADY OUT THERE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE OIL COMPANIES ALREADY HAVE HUGH INVESTMENTS IN EXPENSIVE OIL RETRIVAL SYSTEMS AND THEY KNOW ALL OF THOSE RETURNS ON THOSE INVESTMENTS WILL BE STRETCHED ACROSS LARGE INTERVALS OF TIME IF WE FIND OUT THAT HYDROGEN IS EASY. YOU CAN EXTRACT HYDROGEN AT HOME TODAY GET A BATTERY AND WATER AND THE INTERNET AND GO FOR IT. OIL IS THE MAIN SOURCE OF ALL OF OUR MEDICINES AND SHOULD BE SAVED FOR THAT USE AND NOT BE USED FOR TRANSPORTATION AND HEATING.\nHYDROGEN PRODUCTION HAS LACKED LEADERSHIP DUE TO PRESSURES FROM BIG MONEY BACKING THE STATUS QUO - DON'T ROCK THE BOAT. THINK OF THIS - NO POWERLINES, NO UTILITY BILLS. YES ANOTHER POWERFUL ENEMY OF HYDROGEN. WHO WOULD WANT A FUEL SAFER THAN OIL PRODUCTS AND THAT CAN NEVER BECOME SCARCE - MUST BE CRAZY PEOPLE, AFTERALL, WHAT WOULD WE DO WITH OUR MARKETS BUILT ON THE POLITICS OF SCARITY.\n\n@voices1776 I think that as a catalyst it means that it is not consumed in the reaction. a catalyst is something that makes a reaction much more efficient through some sort of mechanism and is not part of the reaction if I remember right from my organic chemistry class. though there could be more than one definition, kind of like the word \"cheap\".\n\nalso if pockets of oil around the world can supply us with enough energy for 100 years so far just imagine the scale of energy we would have to use to actually have an impact on the oceans. also hydrogen is much more energy dense than oil so we would need even less hydrogen by volume(liquid hydrogen) than oil anyways.\n\nbut that is not even a problem, when you split water and store the hydrogen you take away from the oceans and the rains but as soon as you burn hydrogen it turns back into pure H20 and thus enters back into our environment. so as long as we can create it on demand (with a renewable source of power) it will have no impact on the amount of water on earth or the environment.\n\nlike we could ever store enough in tanks to have an effect on the oceans anyways\n\n@ ocmclean I know the idea that you can split water into hydrogen and oxygen with simply a car battery makes it seem as though someone is suppressing the technology because it is so simple and you can see it working when you stick some electrodes in the water but if you really do the calculations and test it you will find out that the cost of splitting it with electricity is way too expensive to ever be used instead of oil. it is also very inefficient and slow. there is no way that you could split water fast enough to run a car on. I fell into the trap of internet conspirators once too. I even bought a $15 instruction manuel on how to build a device to do it and I realized that its just not that simple. dont you think the people at berkly would have atleast tryed that first before spending tens of thousands on expensive catalysts to test.\n\nThe cost of the catalyst seems like a secondary concern as a catalyst by nature isn't used up in any way during the process. The amortized cost is negligible over the long term if the catalyst isn't destroyed.\n\nThe question I have about this article would be does this new metal simply perform the same task as the platinum at the same efficiency level, or is it more efficient? eg: Is this discovery simply a cost reducer for the existing process, or an improvement to the overall efficiency of the process as we knew it?\n\nI'm more interested in the actual content of the article. I don't need to bash the writer over one word - a perfectly acceptable word, by the way. It's fine if you disagree with the story, but you sound like a lunatic when you call for the editor to be expunged and call him/her a jackass over the use of the word \"cheap\".\n\nNo matter how efficient the electrolysis process is there is still no net increase in potential energy. The energy to drive the process still needs to come from somewhere and wind and solar power is still more expensive then coal and oil.\n\nA Hydrogen economy will require billions of dollars worth of new infrastructure to store and transport the Hydrogen.\n\nOnly about 40% of a barrel of oil is used for energy. The rest is used to make plastics, rubbers, waxes, tar, asphalt, lubricants, drugs, makeup, and a million other things.\n\nI was under the impression that \"our\" goal as a society is to use sunlight directly on the catalyst and water to drive the electrolysis.\n\nThere have been a large number of articles on synthetic photosynthesis and electrolysis. Why don't we put 2 and 2 together? This process is only truly worthy if no fuel (renewable or not) is required, only sunlight.\n\nIt is an elegant solution. We split water to release O2 and capture H2. We later burn H2 in the presence of O2 and release H2O. The net balance of water remains essentially the same.\n\nIn case you want to bring up the fact that H2 will be stored at various places, in car fuel tanks, etc... and this could permanently remove a certain percentage of water from the environment, think of all the fossil fuels and oxides we have been taking out of the earth for the past 100 years. Between them, we have been adding far more water into our ecosystem. Remember, fossil fuels consist of Carbon and Hydrogen, and burning then produces CO2 and H2O. We get Aluminum and many other similar metals from oxide ores. We remove the Oxygen (releasing a large amount) and retrieve the metal. That Oxygen in our atmosphere provides some of the source for burning the fossil fuels that create water as a byproduct...\n\nSecondary to that, we might get an offset from melting glaciers if we were to remove some water from circulation.\n\nThis is an idea who's time is close. We don't want to adopt the wrong technology early. It will mean that an industry will build up around it and make it more difficult to change. Someone else brought up the issue of industrial inertia. Remember the HD/BluRay battle? BetaMax/VHS? 8-Track/Cassette? LP/CD? LD/DVD? 2-D/3-D TV? Analog/Digital?\n\nAll language is, is a way to convey information. If someone uses a word in such a way that everyone gets the point, then that word was then in fact used properly. Only elitist, politicians and lawyers should worry about the ultimate \"proper\" use, and its really a mute argument.\n\nIn short language is constantly evolving and as long as the proper information was conveyed who cares. :)\n\nThis is a non-sequitur. The catalyst might be cheap, but that still doesn't make hydrogen cheap or a clever way to store electricity.\n\nThe cheapest way to make hydrogen, by far, is to gasify fossil fuels and use the water-gas shift reaction. If you convert fossil fuels to electricity and then use the electricity to make hydrogen you will necessarily only be ~1/3 as efficient as gasification.\n\nThe original word \"cheap\" in old English meant something that could be bought, as in \"that's good cheap\" which would mean a good deal. The meaning has changed over time to other meanings that are completely different. So you're both wrong, ha! No really, in today's world both meanings are acceptable...\n\n@Michael Taylor: Exactly. What's also worth noting here is that English, more so than any other language, has evolved almost exclusively to accommodate mental ease. In fact, the confluence of various Germanic dialects, French, and other Latin roots resulted in three distinct periods of English evolution: Old English, Middle English, and Modern English. In an effort to further facilitate ease of communication between competing dialects, we've even managed to drop inflectional endings. You won't find this in many other languages. So I think it's quite odd that GTO has such a hang-up about something as miniscule as colloquial usage of the term \"cheap.\" English is still evolving (or devolving recently as some might argue) and it will remain in a perpetual state of flux. Unless you fancy yourself a language maven intent on marginalizing valid forms of expression, you should enjoy the ride. Myself, I rather enjoy documenting the changesThis is some great news. It's really important for people to realize that platinum is not viable for use in electrolysis. At over $1,600 USD an ounce, and the price variable upon demand, we need an alternative. Nano particles are a great route to explore.\nA company in Georgia called Gridshift just released a white paper on a novel nano-catalyst which is extremely high rate and high efficiency. The catalyst itself is made from cheap and abundant componants. The paper is available at:\n\ngrid-shift.com/white_papers\n\nThe electrolysis unit is already up and running. It could be an important piece to help move us towards a hydrogen economy.\n\nIs it just me or have most people that are replying here missed to fact that platinum is $1680/ounce USD (as of 6May10), so where did the $29/ounce figure come from??? I figure this technology would reduce the cost of the catalyst to roughly $500/ounce USD. Still not cheap, but much better than the alternatives. I find this an interesting and highly volatile subject for many people. I plan to read up on some of the alternatives that were mentioned above. Good article, but like most of the PopSci web articles, not very detailed. I, like many of you, seem to want more details and a better explanation than what was offered in the article. PopSci you need to geek up your articles more!!!\n\nIf we are taking directly out of the ocean, that means salt, lots of it, we will release the oxygen and hydrogen, and be left with tons and tons of salt. This will not bode well for salt mining opperations around the world.\nAlso, there are is an inexplicible amount of waste and toxins in our water supplies, what do we do with those once we extract the hydrogen? after all, our nuclear waste has been collecting in Yucca moutnain for decades and we still have no way to dispose of it, waste is a huge problem for this process.\nNext, imagine of the 7 billion people on this planet average two litres of water a day in their hydrogen consumption; that is 14 billion litres or 6,363,636,363 gallons of water that would be drained out of the oceans every day. If the hydrogen recombines with oxyden in the atmosphere, then that means a ton of rain that is falling out of the sky that was created by man, what kind of effect would 6 billion gallons of water that was created by man have on the planet, that is a lot of rain for 1 day.\n\nblacklungace, nothing you've written here makes any sense. You mention we'll have a salt problem. Do you mean we'll have too much salt, like in piles on the ground? What a benign infection. Then you mention the salt miners we already have. Do you mean they will go out of business? If somone is an expert at managing salt, they should just move to the location where they will have a new job managing salt. Anyway, making ancient professions like \"salt miner\" or \"newspaper boy\" obsolete is a positive thing. We have nuch better ways to use our time.\n\nYucca Mountain stores exactly no nuclear power byproducts. The facility isn't even finished. I'm here in Henderson, NV. Trust me, Harry Reid is fighting the importation of spend uranium tooth and claw... and winning, much to my dismay.\n\nYou refer to \"inexplicable\" amounts of toxins in our water supply. Do you know anything about biochemistry? If there are more than a few parts per million (or billion) of most toxins in our water supply you die from drinking it, sometimes even from breathing the fumes. I do not deny that some leftovers may have to be captured, but the amounts will be far, far less than those of other industrial processes such as smelting.\n\nYou also freak out about \"a ton of rain that is falling out of the sky that was created by man.\" The chemical reaction that turns hydrogen into water happens inside the engine; the exhaust is water vapor. Water vapour is already released by other engines in proportion to their respective power outputs. A Hydrogen engine would only release about as much water vapour as the engines we already use but without the nasty byproducts like formaldehyde from ethanol or CO from petrol.\n\nGTO: You're completely wrong anyway. The original meaning of \"cheap\" (1500 years ago) was \"the deal you made in exchanging things for barter, even before money was involved.\" It later meant \"excellent bargain\" or \"inexpensive.\" The \"shoddy\" definition is much later than that. Google for podictionary 446 for more information.\n\nThat is 70 times cheaper or $27 an once of which we have no idea how much the process uses and what amount of hydrogen can be generated by it. However Hydrogen is by far the best alternitive fuel as it can be made by ANY electrical power sorce which is what we need. It also can store excess power which is lost every night 11 to 7am from the big coal and nuclear power statins as they can't shut them down. and best of all we can store power from wind and solar power excess or just plane produce hydrogen.\n\nAll the basics to begin a hydrogen economy are available now. Hydrogen is a 4 letter word to big oil and gas and they will do anything to stop it.\n\n\"finding less expensive ways to generate hydrogen gas is integral to kicking off that sea change.\"\n\nFalse and foolish. How much energy must be run thru the catalyst chamber to split the water? Hydrogen is a storage medium, not an energy source. And it's devilishly hard to store and transport. Sneaks through most materials.\n\nCheap energy generation here: focusfusion.org . 1/20 of current best costs. Hydrogen is irrelevant, a distraction.\n\nI hate to be the chemistry nerd here(well not really) but if the formulas is PY5Me2, where is the Molybdenum? I don't believe there is an element with the symbol Me. Maybe all these comments about bad editors have some factual data behind them?\n\n\"Reaction of [(PY5Me2)MoI]2+ with water to form [(PY5Me2)MoO]2+ and release H2 and half an equivalent of I2. The release of hydrogen was confirmed by mass spectrometry.\"\n\nMystery solved for anyone who cared\n\nCheap comes from the old english ceap meaning bargain or trade. Sorry, GTO, but you're completely wrong; the next time you call someone a jackass, I suggest you make sure you know what you're talking about.\n\nso if everyone in arizona switches to hydrogen power, and we grab all the water from the ocean to create the hydrogen rather than any nearby water sources, will it rain more in arizona after all the hydrogen burns off and turns back to water?\n\nThe comments are funny and I had not even noticed the subtle issue of \"cheap\", but do not find that particularly distasteful.\n\nWhat bugs me is the common use of denoting something as several times cheaper, like \"70 times cheaper\". I think they mean 1/70th the cost. It seems to me that if something is 2 times cheaper, it would be negative. How can something be made cheaper by more than 100%? If it costs $2,000 per ounce and I give it to you 100% cheaper, would that not be free? I know it is more eye catching to say \"70 times cheaper\" than 1.4% the cost or 98.6% cheaper. I see this kind of quote everywhere these days, but it seems incorrect to my way of thinking about math.\n\n@Voices1776 The thing you need to realize about using hydrogen as a fuel is that when burned, it reacts with oxygen to create water. A perfect cycle. All of the water taken from the ocean will eventually flow back into it.\n\nNothing will slow the consumption of oil until the last drop is gone. Oil corps will make sure of this. All this talk of alternative energy is exactly that. Talk. Like any other addiction you have to hit rock bottom before you really do anything about the problem.\n\nWhen the oil runs out and we rocket back to the dark ages and almost wipe each other out over it maybe then we'll find another way.\n\nElectrolysis can be done without a catalyst, though more energy is required. A salt is helpful, to make the water conductive. However, the problem is that you have to put more energy in than you get out.\n\nA catalyst can reduce the amount of energy required, but you still get less energy than you put in. Solar power could supply the electricity, and H2 could be used to store the energy for later use, or to make it portable.\n\nThe catalyst could also make use of waste energy in a car, namely, manifold and radiator heat. A thermocouple could produce electricity that would electrolize some water, and H2 could be fed into the air intake.\n\nToo bad we can't make direct use of heat energy, rather than converting it to electricity first. There is a lot of waste heat around, if we could only harness it.\n\nWhile everyone is flaming gto over stupid gramer you and popsci fail to realise this is very old news. This technology has been invented and damn near perfected by a company in the US named Hydrogen Technology Applications, Inc.\nThey are curently working with Ford and the U.S. Army.\n\n\"The Model 1500 Aquygen® Gas Generator runs on water and electricity only! It produces a stable hybrid hydrogen-oxygen gas, with many unique properties. The generator provides a superior gas for most conventional brazing, soldering and metal cutting operations.\"\n\nThe inventer adapted this tech into his car and is a hybrid test vehicle garnering over 100 miles on 8oz of water.\n\nmorals of the story is stop flaming over nonsense and pay attention to what the world has to offer\n\nThere is a lot of practical experience. U.S. Navy submarines throw away hydrogen when they split oxygen out of seawater for the crew to breathe. However, I take issue with the readers who figure it should be commercialized now. If you want me to buy a hydrogen car,\n\n1. it has to pay for itself by being cheaper to run.\n2. there need to be convenient refilling spots on highways.\n(I'm not running back and forth to the rest rooms with\na cup at a wayside.)\n3. the car has to be proven for several years\n4. the car has to be used so I can afford it.\n\nYou see, it's not the oil and utility money that creates the problem, it's me - the consumer"

      "text": "Disinfecting in the dark\n\n04 December 2009\n\nAn efficient titania photocatalyst that continues to work when the lights go out gives continuous protection against bacteria, say scientists in the US.\n\nPhotocatalysts create electron-hole pairs which generate free radicals able to undergo secondary reactions such as killing bacteria. Most current visible-light photocatalytic disinfection materials are based on anion-doped titanium oxide, explains Jian-Ku Shang at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. But they only operate in the light when electron and hole pairs are produced.\n\nShang and colleagues added palladium oxide PdO nanoparticles to nitrogen-doped titania. The nanoparticles act as a photoelectron trap and under visible light illumination, electrons flow from the titania to the PdO nanoparticles. When the light is switched off a catalytic memory effect makes the PdO nanoparticles release the electrons back slowly. The phocatalyst continues to operate in the dark, limiting the growth of bacteria for up to 24 hours.\n\nElectrons flow into the nanoparticles when it's light and are released again in the dark\n\nAs well as operating in the dark, Shang says that the photocatalyst is also more efficient than before in the light as the electrons stored in the PdO nanoparticles prevent recombination with holes, allowing them to be more effective in photocatalytic oxidation of bacteria.\n\n'This is very significant progress in the area,' says Max Lu an expert in functional nanomaterials at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. 'It has been a challenge to develop effective visible light photocatalysts with nitrogen-doped titania, as the doping always creates recombination centres for the electrons and holes. But the most interesting thing is the memory effect when the electrons are released in the dark,' he adds.\n\nShang says that he hopes to study the charge transfer process in more detail, so that he can optimise the efficiency of the individual charge transfer steps. He indicates that the solar driven materials could have many environmental antimicrobial systems. In particular, he says that it could be a cheaper and more environmentally-friendly alternative to water disinfection by chlorination, which produces harmful disinfection by-products.\n\nFay Nolan-Neylan\n\nEnjoy this story?

      "text": "The\nstorage and generation of electricity is a hotbed of scientific study\naround the world. New and improved methods of storing electricity\nhave a myriad of potential uses from phones and laptops that run\nlonger to new electric vehicles with much greater driving range.\n\nAt\nthe center of much of the research in the storage and generation of\npower in batteries and other devices are carbon nanotubes. The carbon\nnanotube has been studied for decades and new advances over the last\nfew years have made the nanotubes easier to produce and have offered\nbreakthroughs in the use of carbon nanotubes. Scientists at Rice\nUniversity made a breakthrough in carbon\nnanotube processing in November of 2009 that uses processes\nsimilar to those that have been employed in the plastics industry to\nmake the production of carbon nanotubes in bulk much\neasier.\n\nResearchers in late 2009 also found that defective\ncarbon nanotubes are more efficient at storing energy than\ncarbon nanotubes that are uniform in size. In February 2010, Bayer\nannounced that it was opening the world's\nlargest carbon nanotube production facility to develop\ncarbon nanotubes dubbed \"Baytubes\" using multi-wall carbon\nnanotube technology. The facility is expected to produce about 200\nmetric tons of nanotubes each year.\n\nNow, a team of researchers\nat MIT have announced that they have made a new\nbreakthrough for producing electricity with carbon\nnanotubes. The discovery may one day lead to a myriad of new devices\nsuch as sensors the size of dust that can be dispersed in air to\nmonitor the environment or the tech might lead to implantable devices\nthat produce their own power. The researchers discovered a phenomenon\nthat was previously unknown that produces powerful waved of energy\nthat shoots though carbon nanotubes, producing electricity.\n\nThe\nteam of researchers called the phenomenon \"thermopower waves.\"\nMIT's Michael Strano, the Charles and Hilda Roddey Professor of\nChemical Engineering, and senior author of the paper reporting the\nfindings said, \"[Thermopower waves] opens up a new area of\nenergy research, which is rare.\"\n\nThe thermal wave is a\nmoving pulse of heat that travels along the microscopic carbon\nnanotubes and drives electrons along with it creating an electrical\ncurrent. The team coated carbon nanotubes with a highly reactive fuel\nthat produces heat as it decomposes. The fuel was ignited at one end\nof the nanotube with a laser beam or high-voltage spark.\n\nThe\nresulting ignition created a fast moving thermal wave that travels\nabout 10,000 times faster than the normal speed of the reaction\naccording to the team. The temperature of the ring of heat reaches\nabout 3,000 kelvins, pushing electrons along the tube creating a\nsubstantial electrical current. Strano says that the combustion waves\nhave been mathematically studied for more than a hundred years, but\nhe claims to be the first to predict that the combustion waves could\nbe guided by a nanotube or nanowire and push an electrical current\nalong the wire.\n\nStrano says, \"[In early experiments] lo\nand behold, we were really surprised by the size of the resulting\nvoltage peak.\" He continued saying, \"There's something else\nhappening here. We call it electron entrainment since part of the\ncurrent appears to scale with wave velocity.\n\nStrano says that\nsince the discovery is so new it is hard to predict how it could be\nused in practical application. The team plans to conduct more\nresearch using different kinds of reactive materials for the fuel\ncoating and the team suspects that by using other materials for the\ncoating the front of the wave could oscillate to produce an\nalternating current. The team points out that most of the power\ngenerated with the new method is given off as light and heat and work\nis ongoing to make the process more efficient.\n\nComments\n\nThreshold\n\nUsername\n\nPassword\n\nremember me\n\nThis article is over a month old, voting and posting comments is disabled\n\nIf you don't wish to be part of a technological society, get off your ignorant, hypocritical, myopic, envirowhacko Luddite a**, get rid of your house, car, and the computer you used to post that message with, and go move out in the middle of the wilderness somewhere.\n\nI can't believe the inital post was down rated. With everything we know about air conditions, allergies, the respiratory system that someone would think this might be a good idea outside of a laboratory.\n\nSomeone a long time ago thought asbestos was a good idea.\n\nIf it can be cleaned up 100 percent then use it, otherwise we really don't need another alergen floating around.\n\nAsbestos was (and still is) a good idea. It's still the best fire resistant material we have.\n\nPersonally, I'd rather be in a tall building protected with properly contained asbestos than I would in one with any of the inferior alternatives. Had the WTC been fireproofed with asbestos all the way up, it most likely would have survived the 9/11 attacks....it certainly would have lasted hours longer, time enough to evacuate thousands more people.\n\nThe risks from asbestos fibers are incredibly small. There are counties in California that have asbestos fiber counts in the air and water dozens of times above EPA \"safe\" levels, due to the natural asbestos found in the area. And even unprotected asbestos miners -- who breathe in fiber levels many millions of times higher than your average person -- live many decades before developing problems.\n\nIn other words, the benefits for the safe and proper use of asbestos far outweigh the risks. Just like nanotechnology. But asking an environmentalist to put logic ahead of emotion is like asking a pig to give up the slop trough.\n\nDid you seriously just bring 9/11 into an \"argument\" caused by an offhanded comment about the possible carcinogenic properties of nano-technology? Obviously, asking you to put logic in front of emotion is like asking a pig to give up a dated analogy. Put your flag down, Ted, it's time to get off the internet and go talk to your gold broker.\n\nI think he has an honest concern that deserves, at least, a passing glance.\n\nDid you seriously miss the original referent to asbestos? The WTC was being constructed during the height of the anti-asbestos craze...as a result, construction crews stopped spraying asbestos fireproofing beyond the 64th floor. At the time of the decision, experts from the world's largest fireproofing company said, \"if a fire breaks out above the 64th floor, the tower will fall\".\n\nThe 9/11 attacks struck at the 96th and the 87 floors. The original asbestos fireproofing was rated to withstand at least four hours of heat at that level. We don't know exactly how long the inferior replacement material lasted -- but the first tower collapsed after only 56 minutes.\n\nI thought the explosion from the impact to the WTC towers blew off any fire protection above the floors. Even without asbestos above level # the designers didn't plan for a plane of that size and fuel to crash into it. They designed for older/smaller aircraft impact and standard office fires. It's impossible to be protected from every attack that may happen in the next 50 years. They will always find a way, eventually.\n\nA good example of emotion over logic would be deriding someone for simply referencing 9/11 in order to make a perfectly valid point. Should the loss of life make it so touchy a subject that we can't even learn from it??\n\n\"Those who cannot learn from history (even recent history), are doomed to repeat it.\"\n\nIt takes decades (not years) for them to develop the cancer in the first place....and even among miners who breathe in levels concentrated many millions of times higher than would a normal person, the majority of them live their entire lives without ever developing mesothelioma.\n\nOTOH, the prosecution of asbestos-related exposure cases is now by far the single largest source of funds to tort attorneys, who have succesfully extorted tens of billion of dollars from private firms, many of which have little or no tangible connection with asbestos production.\n\nIn the last month alone, I've been accused of working for the asbestos, nuclear, banking, and oil industries...as well as being a shill for Microsoft and even Apple. I suppose I should take it as a compliment.\n\nWhy not learn to think rationally, instead of making these ridiculous emotional appeals? Life's a lot more interesting when you actually use your brain.\n\nquote: I had wondered about the number of posts too. Either a fair amount of time available, or just damn smart [to think logically and communicate at that level, that fast].\n\nUsing basic logic and communicating it quickly is not that complicated for someone who puts in some effort to learn the basics of logic. Once the basics of logic are understood, arguments can easily be made from there and done well. An example is my brother spent quite a bit of time in debate classes. As such, he can argue with just about anyone extremely effectively and following the proper rules of logic. Couple this basic understanding with an above average intellect and access to the Internet and you get that. There are plenty of people who are able to do similar things while online. They are not gods or anything of that nature, merely intelligent people with access to instant information. Chances are his job sucks (I was in that situation years ago) and therefore the free time during the day skyrockets because an idle mind tends to wander (especially for the more intelligent).\n\nThis of course is not to take away from his abilities, he is quite well versed in logic, my post was merely a ribbing.\n\nIt wasn't the inferior properties of the fire retardent material that downed the towers, it was that the fire retardent materials were blown off by the explosion of the aircraft and jet fuel. No material could have remained adhered under those conditions.\n\nOf course carbon nanotubes have uses. But if most of the energy from burning the attached fuel is released as light and heat, then it isn't of much use in producing electricity is it? Since it is burning fuel, the efficiency is going to have to be well above 50%, else this is just another curious property of no practical use.\n\nWow, an enlightened post. Assumptions are at the foundation of every science. Fundamentally, there must be a leap of faith for us to do science, even with basic theorums. Your assertion is best expressed in that old saw: \"There is no empirical basis for empiricism.\" QED.\n\nIf you use the voltage spike to feed a conductive coil (as in two different types of nanotubes [conducting and combustive] laid out in a twisted cylinder)), would you not create an EMP pulse with it? Sure the combustive reaction would make it a one shot device, but it seems like it has potential as an anti tech weapon.\n\nHow do you make the leap from a laser ignited microscopic combustion wave to...\n\n\"The discovery may one day lead to a myriad of new devices such as sensors the size of dust that can be dispersed in air to monitor the environment\"\n\nWill we have dust-sized lasers to power them or do we need to have ground based lasers beaming power to each dust particle?\n\nThe researcher himself says \"since the discovery is so new it is hard to predict how it could be used in practical application.\" Yet the author of the article seems to have no problem with making predictions of his own, as if he understands the tech better than the researchers.\n\nGo easy of them! DailyTech is still struggling to understand that its niche is reporting on technology, and not reinventing conventional reporting via its news \"blogs\" and total disregard for the use of the inverted pyramid.\n\nI am amused that the Wikipedia entry for \"Inverted Pyramid\" requests a citation for the very first paragraph. I'm Sorely tempted to submit DailyTech as the citation for the antithesis example of \"the most widely preferred method in writing news stories.\"\n\nI'd prefer to see those people still clinging to Fahrenheit removed from the GENE pool.

State and countries are trying to meet a significant portion of their energy needs with renewable sources. Additionally, world events, such as the nuclear disaster in Japan, have changed the politics and thinking about the requirements for clean energy. As their costs become more competitive, renewable energy sources such as wind, geothermal, and solar can provide an alternative to fossil fuel and nuclear based power. Thin-film solar technologies have held the promise of reduced costs for solar power generation. The solar photovoltaic market landscape, however, is rapidly changing. In the past year, due to falling crystalline silicon prices and increased photovoltaic module manufacturing capacity, the price of solar panels has dropped dramatically. With this price shift, the potential cost advantage of thin-film has nearly disappeared. In addition to significant commercial questions, thin-film solar faces a number of technical challenges. Thin-film solar technology (CdTe, CIGS, CIS, and CZTS) is much younger than typical crystalline silicon and does not have the benefit of years of actual field installations. Some of the specific issues faced by thin-film are protection from the elements and the testing methods to predict product life. For thin-film to become a significant part of the photovoltaic market, it will need to answer these commercial and technical questions."

There are interesting innovations being made in lithium-ion batteries, as well, though, so you never know what designers may come up with.\n\nRegulation and green energy is sure to benefit from the \"giant battery\" approach. Let's hope the cost doesn't reflect size. A lithium-ion battery that size would do the job too, but the cost would be in the multi-millions.\n\nYes, Greg, it's also good that the chemistry was able to be modified to meet the availability of minerals for the battery. But I suppose that is something that the inventors had to consider in the design. Often what works when something is first developed doesn't always work well for mass production.\n\nWhile the chemistry may be very effective, keeping that much material that hot is going to require a bit of heating power and some very good insulation. So the practical utilization of the concept is a real challenge. Possibly use an atomic reactor to keep it hot, but what effect would the intense radiation have on the system? In summary, \"it works in theory, but will it ever be practical.\" Keeping metals melted is a hot task indeed.\n\nIf I'm reading this correctly, the entire contents of the battery is in a liquid state.

      "text": "Mar 20, 2012 by Lisa Zyga\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Scientists know that using supercapacitors in conjunction with batteries could greatly increase the fuel economy of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) due to the fact that supercapacitors can recover and supply energy much more quickly than batteries. This ability, for example, allows a supercapacitor to recover all of the energy during hard braking, while a battery would allow the energy to be wasted in frictional braking due to its inability to quickly harvest energy.\n\n\"Batteries cannot rapidly harvest or supply energy,\" Rajesh Rajamani, a mechanical engineering professor at the University of Minnesota, told PhysOrg.com. \"When a vehicle has to brake quickly, frictional brakes have to be used in addition to electromagnetic brakes, because the electromagnetic brakes cannot charge a battery quickly enough to decelerate the vehicle as rapidly as the driver wants. Unlike batteries, a supercapacitor can harvest and supply energy very quickly.\"\n\nHowever, one of the biggest challenges researchers face in implementing supercapacitors in HEVs is finding a place under the hood to fit the bulky devices. Part of the reason why supercapacitors are bulky is that they often use a hazardous liquid electrolyte that needs to be sealed and housed, and these protective materials add weight and volume to the devices.\n\nTo avoid this problem, Rajamani and his colleagues Shan Hu from the University of Minnesota and Xun Yu from the University of North Texas have designed a supercapacitor that is completely solid-state, including a solid-state electrolyte that doesn't require bulky protective materials. The new supercapacitor performs competitively with commercial supercapacitors, yet is thin and flexible enough that it could fit almost anywhere in an HEV, possibly even mounted on the inner surfaces of the vehicle's body. The researchers published their study on the flexible, solid-state supercapacitors in a recent issue of Applied Physics Letters.\n\n\"HEVs on the market today do not have supercapacitors,\" Rajamani said. \"Several research groups have been working on the use of supercapacitors together with batteries in HEVs to provide better fuel economy and faster vehicle response. Our research provides them a new supercapacitor that is flexible and solid-state and does not require space in the hood or the trunk.\"\n\nThe new solid-state supercapacitor consists of single-walled carbon nanotube-coated cotton paper as electrodes and a solid polymer as electrolyte. For the electrodes, the researchers used the cotton paper that is normally used for cosmetic facial masks, since it's more lightweight and absorbent than printing paper. After cutting the cotton paper to the desired shape, the researchers repeatedly dipped the paper into a solution of acid-treated nanotubes, which bonded strongly to the paper.\n\nFor the electrolyte, the researchers mixed and heated a polymer solution that originally looked like a clear, glue-like gel. But after dipping the finished electrodes into the gel, assembling the electrodes face-to-face and allowing everything to dry, the excess water evaporated and the electrolyte solidified.\n\n\"The greatest significance of our work is that it has resulted in a flexible and solid-state supercapacitor,\" Rajamani said. \"Other researchers have previously used carbon nanotubes in the electrodes for supercaps. However, their supercaps also utilized liquid electrolytes and were therefore neither fully solid-state nor flexible.\"\n\nIn tests, the supercapacitor could be charged to more than 3 volts, which is beneficial for achieving a high energy density, or allowing more energy to be stored in a given volume. The supercapacitor's other specifications – a specific capacitance of 13.15 F/g and a specific energy of 5.54 Wh/kg – are very similar to the values of commercial supercapacitors. Plus, its flexibility allows it to be bent for easy fitting into small spaces, which could make it useful for portable electronics as well as HEVs.\n\nThe new supercapacitor's biggest drawback is its high resistance, which results in a low overall power density and therefore a slow recharge rate. The researchers think the reason for the high resistance is due to the paper-nanotube electrodes, which have a higher resistance than metal electrodes. However, they predict that coating the cotton paper with a higher density nanotube solution can reduce the resistance, and they plan to work on this issue more in the future.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- In an effort to develop wearable electronics, researchers have designed a new ultra-thin supercapacitor that has a capacitance that is six times higher than that of any current commercial For future electric vehicles, powerful notebook computers, and other portable devices, we need a new generation of energy storage materials that are better suited to modern needs than currentOrg.com) -- Conversion to renewable energy sources like wind and sun is only a question of time.

The team says their breakthrough could lead to faster charging phones and cars, but also smaller gadgets. \"The integration of energy-storage units with electronic circuits is challenging and often limits the miniaturization of the entire system,\" said Richard Kaner, who is a professor of materials science and engineering at UCLA's Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science.

Hans-Peter Nee, Head of Electrical Energy Conversion at KTH, confers with two members of the team involved in developing the new converter with silicon carbide transistor. Pictured (from left) are: Dimosthenis Peftitsis, doctoral student; Hans-Peter Nee, professor; and Jacek Rabkowski, guest researcher. Photo Janne Danielsson\n\nPublicerad\n2012-05-22\n\nIn the future, we can expect to become more dependent on different sources of energy. This will demand smarter electric grids that can handle variations in power generation. At the kth School of Electrical Engineering (kth ee), researchers have developed a new type of power converter that makes the equation possible.\n\nIn the basement of a building at kth, there is a square box lying on a table. This is a converter that converts direct current to alternating current and where traditional silicon transistors have been exchanged for silicon carbide ones. The box is placed unobtrusively in the dark. Undeservedly so, you might think, considering the attention this device has received in the research community.\n\nSilicon carbide has long been considered an effective material for high-voltage transistors. But it is difficult to produce a good substrate for transistors made from silicon carbide. If you're not in complete control of the technical process, defects can creep into the material, making it impossible to build a transistor from it. However, several manufacturers have recently succeeded. The new transistors differ from their silicon predecessors in several ways, and it's not as easy as simply swapping the old components for new ones.\n\nA number of companies and research labs have worked on these issues internationally. But it was Hans-Peter Nee, Professor of Electrical Energy Conversion and his team at kth ee and the Swedish Center of Excellence in Electrical Power Engineering who discovered the answer.\n\n\"We haven't exactly achieved a miracle. But we can get miraculous results by using the available technology in a smart way,\" Nee says.\n\nThe use of silicon carbide in transistors results in significant energy savings. About three per cent of energy is lost with silicon transistors compared to only 0.3 per cent with those made of silicon carbide. Furthermore, the material can withstand higher temperatures – more than 250C compared to silicon that tolerates only 125C. This reduces cooling need considerably, which can have significant impact on automotive applications, for example, where weight and volume play a critical role. Energy is lost each time this mass of material is accelerated and decelerated. By minimizing energy loss, smaller cooling systems can be used.\n\nThis technology can also be used for larger scale converters. In the future, we can expect to use them in high-voltage direct current transmissions in new, smart super grids. In the electrical grid, energy gains are extremely important. Lower energy loss not only saves energy, but can also realize lower temperature variations and consequently improve reliability.\n\n\"What's good about this type of super grid is that it can help cope with large power variations when we start to use more sources of energy, which are less predictable in production terms, such as sun, wind and water,\" Nee explains.\n\nHandling the transition to hydropower located several hundred kilometres away during periods when it's less windy or when the big wind farms don't produce enough energy requires an electrical grid that can handle variations. But expanding today's electrical grid isn't done in the blink of an eye. In Central Europe, much of the land area is built up, making it difficult to lay new high-voltage cables. They simply take up too much space. Even sparsely populated areas in Sweden have the same problem. A better solution would be to lay underground cables that occupy less space and build converters fitted with silicon carbide transistors.\n\n\"This enables a smart, new electrical grid with converters that are completely controllable and can direct the power in cables in real time down to the millisecond level,\" Nee adds.\n\nThis future \"super grid\" will also of course create challenges. For example, when something is this effective, what happens when it breaks down? It is very important to be able to disconnect faulty parts using fast circuit breakers. Here, silicon carbide can become a key technology. Furthermore, the missing energy from the faulty link must be replaced by new fresh energy from energy storage units using power electronics. And here again, silicon carbide is power electronics may provide superior technology.\n\nThere is some way to go before the use of silicon carbide in transmission networks becomes a reality. So far there is greater probability of getting a reduced output from a large chip – which is demanded in a grid – than a relatively small chip, which is being developed today. This makes it problematic to build really large components. But as material and processes become better, they will also become lighter. Price-wise, silicon carbide is more expensive than silicon. However, with the reduced cooling requirements in the system, silicon carbide ultimately leads to transmissions that are both cheaper and better.\n\nIn the first stage, the new material will be used in engine controls and electric power supply. In all likelihood the next stage will involve electrical transmission.\n\n\"I'm hoping that in this area Sweden can establish an international position. Asia has become the main producer of silicon electronics but, in the area of silicon carbide, we can establish a commercial operation in Sweden where we build components with this material. Sweden is, and has been, at the forefront in this area. Hopefully we can keep our leading position in the coming years,\" Nee concludes."

In this paper, a transient model for a reversible, lead-acid flow battery incorporating mass and charge transport and surface electrode reactions is developed. The charge–discharge behavior is complicated by the formation and subsequent oxidation of a complex oxide layer on the positive electrode surface, which is accounted for in the model. The full charge/discharge behavior over two cycles is simulated for many cases. Experiments measuring the cell voltage during repeated charge–discharge cycles are described, and the simulation results are compared to the laboratory data, demonstrating good agreement. The model is then employed to investigate the effects of variations in the current density on the performance of the battery."

However, fossil fuel resources are of finite extent and are distributed unevenly beneath Earth's surface. When fossil fuel is turned into useful energy through combustion, it often produces environmental pollutants that are harmful to human health and greenhouse gases that threaten the global climate. In contrast, solar resources are widely available and have a benign effect on the environment and climate, making it an appealing alternative energy source.\n\n\"Sunlight is not only the most plentiful energy resource on earth, it is also one of the most versatile, converting readily to electricity, fuel and heat,\" said Crabtree. \"The challenge is to raise its conversion efficiency by factors of five or ten.

Although the method is still in its infancy, the research team has already obtained substantial progress in efficiency.\n\nThe use of solar energy is becoming viably competitive to fossil fuels. Zero-emission fuel cells deliver a clear advantage over energy generation technology including nearly 50 percent fuel-to-electricity efficiency and zero emissions because they are operating on pure hydrogen. However, this method of splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen is both expensive and energy-intensive.\n\nPlasmonic devices, developed by UCSB chemistry professor Martin Moskovits, offer more resilient and efficient ways to accomplish the same goal of splitting water.\n\nIn a conventional solar cell, when sunlight hits the surface, electrons shift positions, leaving positively charged \"holes\" resulting in an electric current. The positive charges are the agents of oxygen-release out of water, Moskovits said.\n\nAlthough plasmonic devices also create a shift in electrons, they are made of nanostructures instead of semiconductors. Moskovits and his team created a \"forest\" of gold nanorods that were capped with titanium titanium dioxide (TiO2) with additional platinum particles.\n\nThe gold nanorods serve as a light-harvesting antenna, and the titanium layer serves as an electron filter as well as support for the nanoparticles that are used as a hydrogen evolution catalyst. When the device is placed in water and exposed to visible light, the nanorods oscillate together to create \"plasmonic waves.\"\n\nThe resulting waves contain electrons that are excited by the light particles; some of the excited particles travel up the nanorod through the titanium filter while others are captured by the platinum particles. These \"hot\" excited electrons are the mediators of hydrogen release.\n\nSuch a reaction causes the splitting of the water molecule, forming hydrogen ions. When related to zero-emission energy, the hydrogen molecule is transportable fuel.\n\n\"When used, it becomes a ready source of energy,\" Moskovits said.\n\nAlthough semiconductors will likely never be replaced in electronics and photovoltaics, Moskovits said, an all-metal water-splitter is less efficient and more costly. However, some photovoltaics are based on materials that are not abundant in the earth and are therefore expensive or destined to become expensive. This opens a niche for novel technologies to work side-by-side with those based on semiconductors.\n\n\"Experience has taught us that such new discoveries, when advanced and perfected by the scientific and engineering communities world-wide, have often developed into useful and economical new technologies,\" Moskovits said.\n\nA version of this article appeared on page 4 of March 5th, 2013′s print edition of the Nexus.\n\n2 Comments\n\nYou will basically create your own solar panel coming from each part. You can place your order online, especially the photo voltaic cells. You can assemble the parts in a complete 80W, 100W, and 120W solar panel. If you are not confident enough to create your own solar panel from scratch, then the best thing to do is to purchase a commercial solar panel. These individual solar panels should be wired together to be able to create a huge solar array.;"

      "text": "2009GlobalResolve (GR) is a program at Arizona State that starts village-based ventures in developing countries by introducing sustainable technologies that address economic and health issues. One of those technologies is the Twig Light, a low-cost, sustainable light source. It consists of a wafer-type thermoelectric generator sandwiched between the upper and lower portions of a small box. The upper section is a small combustion chamber in which the user puts small pieces of wood (twigs) to be burned. The lower section sits on the ground or in a few centimeters of water. When the burning wood heats the upper chamber, the temperature difference between the two sections powers the thermoelectric generator, which powers the lights.\n\nAn alpha prototype has been developed and tested. With NCIIA funding the team will refine the Twig Light design, test it again, and distribute twenty prototypes to villages in Malawi and Ghana where they've worked previously. After a year of field testing they'll interview villagers about the light, develop a final design, and establish manufacturing capability and supply chains in Malawi and Ghana.\n\nUpdates\n\nIn 2010, the Twig Light team established a company, Daylight Solutions, LLC. Ghanaian partners include one company (Amstar Inc.), an NGO (The Center for Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development, CEESD) and Nana Afaokwa, the paramount chief of the Domeabra region in Ghana.\n\nThe students in Ghana have formed an NGO (The Center for Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development, CEESD)\n\nThe project is moving from the research phase into a venture with the Ghanaian partners. The first 100 commercial prototypes will be manufactured in the US to perfect the process, possibly this year, in a manufacturing cell consisting of micro-CNC equipment. This cell will either be shipped to Ghana or replicated in that country. The initial manufacturing location will be in Domeabra, a village near Kumasi. Plans are to expand to Cameroon and Kenya in a year.\n\nAdvancements in endoscopic technology have significantly widened the scope of possible procedures, going from being able to just look inside the body to being able stage cancer, drain pseudocysts and more. But, despite the success of endoscopic technology, doctors often have to remove one device and insert another one each time a new function is needed, whether it be electrocautery, stent deployment or fine needle aspiration. This E-Team is developing a new multifunctional endoscopic needle that will consolidate devices, ultimately reducing waste and procedure time. The team's needle would be dynamic, allowing the physician to begin a procedure with a small diameter needle to locate and reach a lesion, then further explore or alleviate the lesion by increasing the needle diameter during the procedure. The internal diameter of the needle device would remain large enough to allow simultaneous use of other devices, such as a stent or cautery device, increasing the doctor's procedural capacity without requiring the removal of the initial device.\n\nMany families in rural Peru make yogurt and cheeses, but, due to a lack of pasteurization equipment and sanitation controls, they can't legally sell their products in a larger market. Instead, they eat the food themselves or trade with neighbors. Building on prior work in the region and working closely with students from the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Peru (PUCP), this E-Team is developing affordable and easy-to-use pasteurization equipment for rural families in Peru. The need for this project comes directly from the villagers themselves, having spoken with team members while implementing a Sustainable Vision-funded project to install green homes in rural Peru. The region of Cusco is the top tourist site in the country, but the villagers have no way of getting their products certified so they can be sold to tourists. The team's gravity-fed pasteurizer will work by causing milk to flow from an upper pan through tubing submerged in a boiling water bath. The milk flowing through the tubing should reach the appropriate temperature to kill a sufficient number of bacteria. The team, consisting of students from RPI and PUCP, has been investigating the local market. With NCIIA funding they will develop and test a pasteurizer, make sure that dairy products made using the device can achieve certification, and work with microfinance organizations to make the device available for purchase. The purifiers are meant for plastic bottles that exist currently as rubbish in the target areas, cutting production and distribution costs and creating an environmentally friendly solution to the global water crisis.\n\nThis E-Team is looking to solve three interrelated problems in Lebialem, Cameroon with products derived from bicycle parts. Most people in Lebialem earn two dollars a day, primarily from agriculture, which requires people to walk 20-40 kilometers to get to market, bringing only what they can carry. Houses aren't electrified, which makes nighttime activities like studying more difficult. And while there's a longstanding metalworking industry in the region, it's currently on the decline. The team proposes three products, derived mostly from old bicycles, to help stimulate the metalworking industry and overcome the first two problems:\n\nThe River Light: a small hydrokinetic device that charges portable LEDs (home lighting)\n\nThe Side Cart: a side-cart for a bicycle to increase carrying capacity when going to market\n\nThe Universal Connector: a steel joint that can be the central unit for other products\n\nThe team has developed several iterations of prototypes of each of the three products. They've partnered with specialists from the cycling industry (Specialized Bicycles) and a Lebialem community group. With NCIIA funding the team will build third-generation prototypes, travel to Lebialem to do user testing and meet with metalworkers, build final prototypes, and start manufacturing in Lebialem.\n\nTesting a person's intrinsic hand muscle strength (IMHS) is helpful in diagnosing a number of health problems, from arthritis to diabetes to nerve injuries. The manual muscle test (MMT) is the most common clinical test to assess IMHS, but tends toward low validity, poor reliability and inherent subjectivity. There are a few other devices on the market, but all demand extensive clinician involvement and/or fail to isolate the intrinsic muscles, leading to errors. This E-Team is developing the Peg Restrained Intrinsic Muscle Evaluator (PRIME), a device that can comfortably and accurately measure IMHS for a wide range of hand types and sizes. It consists of a pegboard base, a force transducer enclosure and a display unit."

      "text": "Innovation\n\nA portable energy harvesting source in a soccer ball that captures impact energy when the ball is kicked and stores it to charge lights and batteries.\n\nHow many people does your innovation serve or plan to serve? Exactly who will benefit?\n\nYoung people in developing countries can be empowered to work and study with a soccer ball that generates energy for areas with poor or access to sources of electricity. This supplemental electricity can improve health and environment, as well as promote community building. Moreover, as four young women at university, we especially hope this innovation will inspire and allow girls and young women who have traditionally been excluded from sport and society to \"power\" their own lives!\n\nDo you have any existing partnerships? If so, please list and describe.\n\nThis initiative began as a result of a Harvard University Engineering Sciences course, \"The Idea Translation Lab.\" We have worked with the professor, teaching fellows, and other affiliated mentors. Our patent for this innovation is currently pending. We are also working with local South African organizations that use soccer as a way to promote youth development and health educationFor our pilot study for the summer of 2009, we are working with local established South African organizations that use soccer as a means for youth development and health education to coordinate play with the sOccket. By working directly with these groups, we hope to gain the necessary quantitative and qualitative feedback to have the sOccket be designed for suitable use in harsh conditions, as well as built with local materials found in Africa. Our 2009 summer will also allow us to build the necessary networks with other groups, schools, and teams to work with when we return to South Africa in the summer of 2010 to develop specialized partnering sOccket programs that supports girls' education, training, and play. We hope to utilize much of the energy and support surrounding the 2010 World Cup in South Africa to work with programs and sponsors to develop pricing, payment, and distribution schemes to make the balls affordable and sustainable for all.\n\nImpact\n\nPromote a healthy, fun, team-building life with soccer, and empower people with no electricity to power their own portable electric generators.\n\nWhat does impact/success look like? Please list any tangible measures of the impact of your innovation\n\nImpact can come in quantitative measures: first, powering a significant number of batteries and other electrical sockets in schools, hospitals, and home, which allow more people (especially those who have traditionally been without power) access to off-grid electricity. Women can cook at night and read to their children. Second, we can also measure the increase in the number of children who choose to stay off the streets and away from drugs, and instead play and enjoy the sOccket, improving their health and lives. Lastly, there is the serious health issue of the countless respiratory diseases associated with unclean forms of energy (such as the burning of\"traditional biomass\") for fuel and kerosene lamps, which millions of rural people rely on. We can thus measure the impact of sOccket's use of kinetic energy on health, which is clean and does not pollute the environment.\n\nIs there a chance that your project could change policy (within an institution or government)?\n\nThe sOccket has the ability to generate power for the community to rally its residents together to take the initiative and promote team building. The sOccket can thus help bring awareness to the energy problem and push institutions to make the qualitative policy changes necessary. Five hundred million people in Sub-Saharan Africa - in rural areas, slums, and many other places- do not have access to any modern energy source after sundown, lying beyond the reach of power grid connections. This lack of electricity causes developing nations to fall behind in economic development and human welfare because activities like agriculture, industry, and business all require some basic level of electricity in order to be productive. Lack of power sources is endemic amongst the poor, and poverty is directly connected to high infant and maternal mortality, illiteracy, as well as lowered life expectancy and fertility rates. The sOccket will be able to shed light on these interlinked policy issues.\n\nAside from financial sustainability, how do you plan to grow the initiative or expand your intended impact?\n\nWe plan to reach out to developed nations to spread awareness of problems like energy, health, and gender inequality in developing countries. We will also explore local African materials with which to construct the ball, as well as ball designs which will be durable in harsh conditions of dust, rain, and heat. Additionally, we hope to print global health messages and statistics directly on the balls themselves to educate young people and girls, working with large groups to expand our efforts.\n\nThis Entry is about (Issues)\n\nSustainability\n\nHow is your initiative financed (or how do you expect your initiative will be financed)?\n\nWe expect our initiative to be financed for the next six months via a grant from the Harvard University Engineering Sciences course, \"Idea Translation Lab.\" However, we are also seeking a number of external grants and competitions in order to achieve financial independence. We are confident that our current and developing partnerships with Harvard University and others will provide a strong net of connections and guidance to support our project in the long-term. Moreover, we plan to expand the sOccket to developed nations as a high-end tech toy, which will subsidize the price of the sOccket to developing nations.\n\nFinancing source\n\nAnnual budget\n\nn/a\n\nAnnual revenue generated\n\nn/a\n\nNumber of staff (full-time, part-time, volunteers)\n\nn/a\n\nWhat are the main barriers to financing your initiative, and how do you plan to address these barriers?\n\nThe main barrier to financing our initiative is that as students, we do not have the monetary stability and savings to finance ourselves. Therefore, we are currently dependent on organizations to provide us with money for our product development, pilot study, and international travel expenses. We plan to overcome these barriers by working with external investment and partnerships to produce the sOccket for developed countries to purchase as a high-tech toy.\n\nWhat are the major challenges with regards to partnerships?\n\nWe anticipate that there might be some difficulties in maintaining lines of communication should we establish a working relationship with partners in desperately rural areas where women are often most maligned. Constant inter-partner dialogue is critical to the success of sOccket's endeavor, so our initial partnerships are with groups in areas blessed with relatively more access to means of communication and infrastructure (phones and internet).\n\nThe Story\n\nWhat was the motivation or defining moment that led to create this innovation? Tell us the story.\n\nOur team came together Fall 2008 in an engineering course about entrepreneurial innovation. None of the team members knew one another since the group was assigned together by our professor. Though we could not be more different - we are all from different ethnic and social backgrounds - all the team members quickly agreed that idea was going to make a difference. After many changes, we sat down and we outlined on a big whiteboard observations we had made during our travels to Africa and other developing regions. From there, we set out to address the problems and present tangible solutions. Jessica Lin created two lists: one of needs, and one of materials and goods she saw Africans already had in their daily lives, and any type of existing behavior that could be amplified. Was there a way to meld these two together? For further inspiration, she looked through her library of photographs from her three previous summers working in Africa. One of the objects that came to mind was the soccer ball—the simple fixture of a much beloved game in all the countries she visited. The more Jessica Lin thought about it, the more she wondered: could energy be harnessed within a soccer ball? Like a cycle, the stored kinetic energy—clean energy—would in turn generate electricity. With that came the sOccket!\n\nPlease tell us about the social innovator behind this initiative\n\nJessica Lin was happy to discover that her teammates were just as excited about the idea, and the whole group ultimately became a driving force behind the idea. While Jessica Lin came up with the core concept of the sOccket ball, one cannot play soccer without a team. With the full support and diverse talents of Jessica Matthews, Julia Silverman, and Hemali Thakkar, the sOccket idea truly took off. Throughout the of the semester, our group grew to be the close-knit team of friends we are today.\n\n(Optional) To be eligible for an additional prize, please select age range\n\n221 weeks ago Jessica Lin said: Hi Renata,\nThanks very much for the invite!

At the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory, scientists are working toward this goal by studying the basic mechanisms that underlie reversible hydrogen storage in certain materials.\n\nCurrently, a main factor limiting the development of hydrogen-based energy technologies, such as fuel cells, is the ability to store a sufficient amount of hydrogen in a way that allows for easy and safe refueling. One of the most promising materials is titanium-doped sodium alanate, a type of material known as a \"complex metal hydride.\" Sodium alanate, on its own, is able to store and release a reasonable amount of hydrogen, but refueling the spent material requires it to be \"doped\" with a small amount of titanium. The titanium atoms allow sodium alanate to work efficiently at realistic temperatures and pressures.\n\n\"Our work focuses on how titanium atoms facilitate the hydrogen uptake in sodium alanate,\" said Brookhaven material scientist Peter Sutter, a member of the research team. \"Understanding the atomic mechanisms that govern this process will guide us in a targeted search for a viable material for large-scale hydrogen storage.\"\n\nA key step in the refueling process is the splitting of incoming hydrogen molecules (hydrogen atoms tend to bind in pairs) into single hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen then combines with aluminum and sodium to form crystalline sodium alanate. Sutter and his colleagues predict that the titanium atoms bind to the aluminum atoms in such a way as to create \"active sites\" where hydrogen molecules are separated and ultimately incorporated. These active sites are being studied experimentally using scanning tunneling microscopy, a powerful imaging technique that is able to image individual atoms at surfaces.\n\nErik Muller, a postdoctoral student working with Sutter and a research associate in Brookhaven's hydrogen storage research team, will discuss their results at the March meeting of the American Physical Society in Baltimore, Maryland. He will give his talk at 9:48 a.m. on Wednesday, March 15, in Room 312 of the Baltimore Convention Center.\n\nThis research is funded by the Office of Basic Energy Sciences within the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science.

      "text": "Jun 21, 2011\n\nSolid oxide fuel cells can operate on a wide variety of fuels, and use hydrocarbons gases directly – without a separate reformer. The fuel cells rely on anodes made from nickel and a ceramic material known as yttria-stabilized zirconia. Until now, however, carbon-containing fuels such as coal gas or propane could quickly deactivate these Ni-YSZ anodes, clogging them with carbon deposits in a process known as \"coking\" – especially at lower operating temperatures.\n\nTo counter this problem, researchers have developed a technique for growing barium oxide nanostructures on the anodes. The structures adsorb moisture to initiate a water-based chemical reaction that oxidizes the carbon as it forms, keeping the nickel electrode surfaces clean even when carbon-containing fuels are used at low temperatures.\n\n\"This could ultimately be the cleanest, most efficient and cost-effective way of converting coal into electricity,\" said Meilin Liu, a Regents professor in the School of Materials Science and Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \"And by providing an exhaust stream of pure carbon dioxide, this technique could also facilitate carbon sequestration without the separation and purification steps now required for conventional coal-burning power plants.\"\n\nThe water-mediated carbon removal technique was reported June 21 in the journal Nature Communications. The research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Basic Energy Sciences, through the HeteroFoaM Center, an Energy Frontier Research Center. The work also involved researchers from Brookhaven National Laboratory, the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\n\nConventional coal-fired electric generating facilities capture just a third of the energy available in the fuel they burn. Fuel cells can convert significantly more of the energy, approximately 50 percent. If gas turbines and fuel cells could be combined into hybrid systems, researchers believe they could capture as much as 80 percent of the energy, reducing the amount of coal needed to produce a given amount of energy, potentially cutting carbon emissions.\n\nBut that would only be possible if the fuel cells could run for long periods of time on coal gas, which now deactivates the anodes after as little as 30 minutes of operation.\n\nThe carbon removal system developed by the Georgia Tech-led team uses a vapor deposition process to apply barium oxide nanoparticles to the nickel-YSZ electrode. The particles, which range in size from 10 to 100 nanometers, form \"islands\" on the nickel that do not block the flow of electrons across the electrode surface.\n\nWhen water vapor introduced into the coal gas stream contacts the barium oxide, it is adsorbed and dissociates into protons and hydroxide (OH) ions. The hydroxide ions move to the nickel surface, where they combine with the carbon atoms being deposited there, forming the intermediate COH. The COH then dissociates into carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which are oxidized to power the fuel cell, ultimately producing carbon dioxide and water. About half of the carbon dioxide is then recirculated back to gasify the coal to coal gas to continue the process.\n\n\"We can continuously operate the fuel cell without the problem of carbon deposition,\" said Liu, who is also co-director of Georgia Tech's Center for Innovative Fuel Cell and Battery Technologies.\n\nThe researchers also evaluated the use of propane to power solid oxide fuel cells using the new anode system. Because oxidation of the hydrogen in the propane produces water, no additional water vapor had to be added, and the system operated successfully for a period of time similar to the coal gas system.\n\nSolid oxide fuel cells operate most efficiently at temperatures above 850 degrees Celsius, and much less carbon is deposited at higher temperatures. However, those operating temperatures require fabrication from special materials that are expensive – and prevent solid oxide fuel cells from being cost-effective for many applications.\n\nReducing the operating temperatures is a research goal, because dropping temperatures to 700 or 750 degrees Celsius would allow the use of much less expensive components for interconnects and other important components. However, until development of the self-cleaning process, reducing the operating temperature meant worsening the coking problem.\n\n\"Reducing the operating temperature significantly by eliminating the problem of carbon deposition could make these solid oxide fuel cells economically competitive,\" Liu said.\n\nFuel cells powered by coal gas still produce carbon dioxide, but in a much purer form than the stack gases leaving traditional coal-fired power plants. That would make capturing the carbon dioxide for sequestration less expensive by eliminating large-scale separation and purification steps, Liu noted.\n\nThe researchers have so far tested their process for a hundred hours, and saw no evidence of carbon build-up. A major challenge ahead is to test the long-term durability of the system for fuel cells that are designed to operate for as long as five years. Researchers must also study the potential impact of possible fuel contaminants on the new electrode.\n\nForming the barium oxide structures can be done as part of conventional anode fabrication processes, and would not require additional steps. The anodes produced in the technique are compatible with standard solid oxide fuel cell systems that are already being developed for commercial electricity generation, home power generation and automotive applications.\n\n\"We have started with state-of-the-art technology, and simply modified the surface of the electrode,\" said Mingfei Liu, a postdoctoral researcher in the Center. \"Because our electrode would be built on existing technology, there is a lower barrier for implementing it in conventional fuel cell systems.\"\n\nRelated Stories A new version of an environmentally friendly, energy efficient technology that could replace combustion engines in cars and batteries in mobile devices such as phones and laptops is being ...\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- A new type of natural-gas electric power plant proposed by MIT researchers could provide electricity with zero carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, at costs comparable to or less thanA new chemical process for removing unwanted minerals from coal could lead to reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power stations.\nThere is already a way of burning coal in a cleaner, more efficient fasIf this holds up, then diesel electric locomotives can be converted to coal electric locomotives. Likewise, an eventual payoff is possible in Diesel trucking. The high efficiency electricity powerplants (if true) means lower emissions of CO2, regardless of sequestration, so halving the CO2 from the worst emitters is a big step forward. Also, the USA is the \"Saudi Arabia\" of coal, so we can reduce dependence on foreign oil and lower balance of payments. That will, in turn, provide Federal capitol to outrun the current recession"

      "text": "Breakthrough could bring tenfold increase in battery life\n\nAlthough the autonomy of mobile computing devices has improved in the last decade, the gains are mostly through advancements in microprocessor and display technologies. Batteries themselves have remained largely unchanged in recent years, but a team of engineers at Northwestern University claims to have discovered a breakthrough that could revolutionize the industry.\n\nThe researchers have developed an electrode for lithium-ion batteries that increases the capacity and recharge rate by 10 times. If accurate, the innovation could afford smartphones with an all-week battery life instead of a day, and recharge times would be measured in minutes instead of hours. Even after a year of regular use, such a battery would be five times more efficient.\n\nLithium-ion batteries are charged by a chemical reaction that causes lithium ions to move between the anode and cathode. As energy is used, lithium ions travel from the anode to the cathode through the electrolyte. This is reversed when recharging. The anode is composed of carbon-based graphene sheets and they can only handle one lithium atom per six carbon atoms.\n\nScientists have attempted to replace carbon with silicon because it is far more efficient at transferring lithium atoms, but its charging capacity degrades too quickly. Meanwhile, because the graphene sheets inside today's batteries are only one carbon atom thick and comparatively long, the recharging process is hindered. Physorg describes the process as an \"ionic traffic jam.\"\n\nThe researchers have drastically improved both qualities by sandwiching clusters of silicon between the graphene sheets. This stabilizes the silicon while allowing the graphene to transfer a larger number of lithium atoms. To improve the recharge rate, the team uses chemical oxidation to create tiny 10-20nm holes in the graphene sheets, giving the lithium ions many shorter paths to travel instead of clumping along the edges.\n\nIt's said that the group has focused on improving the anode but it should make further refinements when it begins working on the cathode. The technology is expected to reach consumers within three to five years. A full overview written by researcher Harold H. Kung has been published by Advanced Energy Materials (Volume 1, Issue 6, pages 1079-1084). That release is available through Wiley online library, though it's not free.\n\nThis is insanely great! I hope developments do not halt and more effort is taken to improve battery life. I hope this breakthrough could be available sooner though. (of course after the necessary tests has been carried out.)\n\nIf capacity is up x10 and they charge 10 times faster wouldn't the charge time be the same as it is now..The article states charge time in minutes not hours.\n\nNo. What this means is that the energy density is up 10 fold (IE, rather than the Galaxy S II having a 1.45Ah battery, it'll be able to have a 14.5Ah battery with no size increase). At the moment, batteries can be charged (generally) at 1C - I.E the Galaxy S II's battery can be charged at 1.45A normally without issue. Some more high performance batteries (those used in the R/C market for instance) can be charged at 10C, so a rate 10x that of the capacity. This battery technology is promising 10x the charge rate (the C), so it depends on which sort of battery they're comparing it with.\n\nCharging a battery at 10C means for the SGSII you'd have to charge at 14.5A (or with the 10x capacity, 145A), which is far more than a USB port is designed to supply (1A @ 5V, which means current phones charge at less than 1C already). I can't see the charge rate increase being utilised by most consumer electronics, but it's nice to have if the technology could be used with electric cars.\n\n\"The technology is expected to reach consumers within three to five years\"\n\nWow is that disappointing.\n\nThats disappointing? Whats disappointing is I could bet my life savings that we will not see this in 10 years. There has been a few articles over the years about battery technology and I've yet to see anything result of it. And with technology, manufacturers don't like to make big jumps. They like to spoon feed innovations. So if they give us this technology, they'll reduce its full potential somehow.\n\nlchu12 said:\n\nWonder whats the cost to get these batteries to be integrated with today's tech...\n\nI would think the answer would be 0 beyond the cost of producing the battery itself. Same battery design except using better materials. But no doubt they'll change the battery connection so you'll have to upgrade your phone first but thats par for the course and 2 years to phase out old batteries isn't that badIndeed.\n\nAlso, I think it's pretty difficult to charge a battery of that size at a fast rate.This is absolutely correct. Big oil will likely buy the patent and we will never see this. I am an engineer in this field and I can tell you I have witnessed this personally on at least 3 occasions. Battery tech will not improve until we are nearly out of oil (and natural gas etc) and then it will be the the oil companies that control this tech and there is nothing to be done about it without drastic legislative changes and that will not happen until we are are on the brink of disaster. Sorry folks, keep your chargers handy..\n\nI recall roughly 3-5 years ago reading something about \"Fancy brand new battery technology promises 10 hours of battery life\" i remember reading it used some sort of fiber-mesh to store electricity and they could mash tons of these fibers into the battery thusly storing tons of energy, Having just bought my first laptop and feleing limited by the 4 hours (now 1hour, hah!) I i thought this was very exciting news, yet here I sit 3-5 years later still reading about 4 hour battery life."

Michael Gratzel and colleagues in Switzerland note that nature found this Holy Grail of modern energy independence 3 billion years ago, with the evolution of blue-green algae that use photosynthesis to split water into its components, hydrogen and oxygen.\n\nGratzel is namesake for the Gratzel Cell, a more-efficient solar cell that his group developed years ago.

The inventor, Laurence Kemball-Cook has formed the company Pavegen to manufacture these pavement slabs. Essentially, the invention is based on generating electricity by applying mechanical stress – such as a footstep – on materials that store an electric charge from such stress. In this case, the power generated can be used immediately for lighting, for example, or stored on the national electric grid. An added green feature is that each slab has a surface made of recycled truck tires and a base made of recycled polymer concrete. As with many inventions, the idea seemed simple — the trick has been in putting it into practice and then fighting to take it to market. The initial test ground was a high school hallway, which was lit by the slabs. Ultimately, however, such slabs could harness the footsteps of people at airports, railway stations, shopping malls, and main tourist locations throughout the world. Now that's power!\n\nHow power-generating paving lightens up public spaces and some pedestrians. It could be the last word in concrete solutions to carbon emissions: a paving slab that generates electricity with every footstep taken on it, providing clean power to both cities and remote areas not connected to a national grid. Best of all, it requires mainly used tires and concrete. ClimateWire"

The primary component of natural gas is methane, which has the advantage of releasing less carbon dioxide when it's burned than do many other hydrocarbon fuels. But because of the very stable structure of the methane molecule, it can be difficult to access the energy stored within. When unburned methane escapes into the atmosphere, it's a greenhouse gas 20 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.\n\nNow, researchers have created a material that catalyzes the burning of methane 30 times better than do currently available catalysts.\n\nThe discovery offers a way to more completely exploit energy from methane, potentially reducing emissions of this powerful greenhouse gas from vehicles that run on natural gas. The catalyst may also offer a cleaner and cheaper way of generating energy from catalytic combustion in gas turbines.\n\nConventional catalysts for methane combustion are composed of metal nanoparticles, and in particular palladium (Pd), deposited on oxides such as cerium oxide (CeO2). Tweaking that approach, the researchers instead used a method that relies on self-assembly of nanoparticles. They first built the palladium particles — just 1.8 nanometers in diameter — and then surrounded them with a protective porous shell made of cerium oxide, creating a collection of spherical structures with metallic cores.\n\nBecause small particles such as these tend to clump together when heated and because these clumps can reduce a catalyst's activity, the team deposited them on a hydrophobic surface composed of aluminum oxide to ensure they were evenly distributed.\n\nTesting the material's activity, the researchers found that their core-shell nanostructure performed 30 times better than the best methane combustion catalysts currently available, using the same amount of metal. It completely burned methane at 400 degrees C.\n\nThe researchers plan to further study the structure of the new catalyst to better understand why it works so well. And they will use similar methods to create new materials to test"

Unfortunately, its tendency to creep and cover leads many people to spend hours (and hundreds of dollars) trying to eliminate it from their lawns and gardens. What many don't realize is that in addition to being soft and beautiful, moss could be used as a source of renewable energy in the very near future.\n\nTo demonstrate moss's fuzzy green potential for generating electricity with zero carbon emissions, a team of designers and scientists from Cambridge University built a combination table and lamp. The table features a layer of moss-filled cells connected to conductive fibers inside the furniture. This energy is collected into a battery that can be used to power small electronic devices.\n\nImage via Biophotovoltaics/Cambridge University\n\nThis unique piece of furniture is a critical part of the researchers' study of biophotovoltaic (BPV) technology. BPV generates electricity from light energy by exploiting the photosynthesis of living organisms such as moss, algae, cyanobacteria and vascular plants. As the moss photosynthesizes, it releases organic compounds as waste, and the bacteria break these compounds down, releasing electrons as they do, notes Dvice.com.\n\nNow before you get too excited, the moss doesn't generate enough electricity to power the lamp. Yet. Unfortunately, this is a relatively new area of research, and scientists say there are significant technical hurdles to overcome before BPV can be used to power large objects like laptops or cell phone chargers.\n\nCurrently, the moss generates about 50 milliwatts per square metre (mW/m2).

It wouldn't look that different from a bunch of plant life.\" Cables from the array might then connect to the town's power grid at different spots along the bank.\n\nThe power generation project is just one part of the Vandergrift Improvement Program, in which the borough, designed in 1894 as a model steelmaking community, now hopes to revitalize itself as a model \"green\" community, with the help of Pitt, the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation and the state Department of Community and Economic Development.\n\nDr. Weiland is Pitt's key liaison to the project, and she plans to put as much energy into community education work on environmental sustainability as she does on the power experiment.\n\nBy working with Vandergrift's citizens on conserving energy and developing clean technologies like solar power, she said it's conceivable Downtown could one day function without using any fossil fuels.\n\nThe residents' creativity and ideas will be crucial to the effort, she said, because even though \"technology is going to have a very important role to play, technology alone is not going to come to the rescue. It took all of us to make this mess and it will take all of us to clean it up.\"\n\nWhile the Vandergrift project has become Dr. Weiland's personal mission, it is not her professional passion.\n\nThat is planes, and specifically, changing the shape of military aircraft in midflight, a process known as morphing.\n\nThe idea behind this experimental work is to develop an aircraft that can perform more than one function. Right now, for instance, if a fixed-wing military surveillance plane spots some trouble from high altitude, it has to signal for other planes to investigate, and by that time, it might be too late.\n\nBut what if the surveillance plane could change the shape and angle of its wings and go down to eyeball the situation itself? That's the idea behind morphing, she said.\n\nEngineers have made great strides in figuring out how to change the shape and angle of the wings in midair, she said, but haven't licked the problem of how to get the craft's skin to alter itself. \"The skin is one of the last hurdles to developing an airplane that can morph in flight, just like a bird does,\" Dr. Weiland said.\n\nThe trick is to find a material that can soften when the wings are changing shape and then harden again. There is one class of materials that can be softened with heat and then regain its rigidity, but that process is too slow and could give off a \"heat signature\" that the enemy could detect, she said.\n\nAs an alternative, her lab is investigating materials that could soften and reharden after exposure to different wavelengths of light, or different electrical frequencies.\n\nThat work has also led her down another pathway, exploring materials that incorporate the same energy packets that are used by human cells -- ATP, or adenosine triphosphate.\n\nThe ATP can drive microscopic pumping action in a material, and one possible use of that might be to deliver vaccines or medications to target cells that would activate the pumps and release the substances in the body, she said.\n\nIf the ionic polymers she is working with in Vandergrift don't end up being the best material for generating power, they still hold great promise as self-powered sensors, especially for spots that are too remote or dangerous for regular human inspection, such as deep mine shafts or nuclear plants, she said.\n\nThere might even be medical uses, Dr. Weiland said. One experiment has used an ionic polymer patch on the arm to detect the subtle turbulence in the bloodstream that might indicate clots are forming near the heart.\n\nDr. Weiland grew up in the Baltimore area and can remember being so fascinated by planes at a young age that she would climb out of her crib if she heard one flying overhead.\n\nAfter earning an associate degree at a community college, she got her bachelor's in mechanical engineering at the University of Maryland. Eventually, her airplane mania lured her to graduate school at Purdue University and the Georgia Institute of Technology, where she earned her Ph.D. in 2002 and did her first airplane morphing.\n\n\"One day it hit me like a ton of bricks -- why in the world am I not taking my technology training and applying at least a little of my time to [helping the environment]?\""

Immersing the alloy in freshwater or saltwater causes a spontaneous reaction, splitting the water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules. The hydrogen could then be fed to a fuel cell to generate electricity, producing water in the form of steam as a byproduct, he said.\n\n\"The steam would kill any bacteria contained in the water, and then it would condense to purified water,\" Woodall said. \"So, you are converting undrinkable water to drinking water.\"\n\nBecause the technology works with saltwater, it might have marine applications, such as powering boats and robotic underwater vehicles. The technology also might be used to desalinate water, said Woodall, who is working with doctoral student Go Choi.\n\nA patent on the design is pending.\n\nWoodall envisions a new portable technology for regions that aren't connected to a power grid, such as villages in Africa and other remote areas.\n\n\"There is a big need for this sort of technology in places lacking connectivity to a power grid and where potable water is in short supply,\" he said. \"Because aluminum is a low-cost, non-hazardous metal that is the third-most abundant metal on Earth, this technology promises to enable a global-scale potable water and power technology, especially for off-grid and remote locations.\"\n\nThe potable water could be produced for about $1 per gallon, and electricity could be generated for about 35 cents per kilowatt hour of energy.\n\n\"There is no other technology to compare it against, economically, but it's obvious that 34 cents per kilowatt hour is cheap compared to building a power plant and installing power lines, especially in remote areas,\" Woodall said.\n\nThe unit, including the alloy, the reactor and fuel cell might weigh less than 100 pounds.\n\n\"You could drop the alloy, a small reaction vessel and a fuel cell into a remote area via parachute,\" Woodall said. \"Then the reactor could be assembled along with the fuel cell. The polluted water or the seawater would be added to the reactor and the reaction converts the aluminum and water into aluminum hydroxide, heat and hydrogen gas on demand.\"\n\nThe aluminum hydroxide waste is non-toxic and could be disposed of in a landfill.\n\nA cartoon illustrates the potential uses of a new theoretical type of mobile technology that would use an aluminum alloy to convert non-potable water into drinking water while also extracting hydrogen to generate electricity.

Well connected areas with LiCoO2, where only cobalt is present, and Li2MnO3, where manganese atoms surround lithium atoms in a hexagonal pattern, are observed. Each of these areas gives rise to a distinctly different EXAFS spectrum (bottom panel) that is characteristic of the local chemical environment\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- \"What we are trying to do is put different pieces of a puzzle together,\" said Argonne National Laboratory scientist Daniel P. Abraham. The puzzle is a lithium-rich compound material, Li1.2Co0.4Mn0.4O2, that holds key insights into the development of more powerful and robust batteries for electric cars. Using a suite of advanced techniques, including the resources of the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Photon Source at Argonne, Abraham and his colleagues have pieced together both the long-range and local structure of this compound, devising a model that could explain how such materials operate on the electrochemical level — and how to use them to build a better battery.\n\nArgonne is at the cutting edge of the effort to create advanced battery technologies, focusing especially on the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery, which promises more energy and longer life than the nickel-metal hydride battery currently used in electric and hybrid vehicles. For instance, the new Chevy Volt, the first mass-produced plug-in hybrid electric car, is powered by a battery whose chemistry is based in part on important breakthroughs developed by scientists at Argonne. Like all batteries, Li-ion batteries work by moving electric charge (in this case, lithium ions) between an anode and cathode. But vital properties — such as the amount of electricity a battery can deliver before recharging is necessary and how many times it can be recharged before its microstructure breaks down under the repeated cycling stress — can vary greatly depending on the composition of the cathode and anode. Most research has focused on compounds using transition metals such as cobalt and manganese, but the precise structural formulation of the compounds and what might make one work better than another have largely been a matter of trial and error and speculation. The new Argonne work, published in Chemistry of Materials, is an important step toward resolving the confusion.\n\nCo-principal investigator Mahalingam Balasubramanian (also from Argonne), Abraham, and colleagues from Argonne and the Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory of the University of Illinois examined the layered lithium oxide Li1.2Co0.4Mn0.4O2 , which is a model compound for many of the advanced battery materials currently under development for electric vehicles. The experimenters subjected samples to a variety of techniques including x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning-transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The combination of methods yielded a more comprehensive picture than previously achieved. \"It's sort of like the story of the blind men and the elephant,\" Abraham explained. \"When different people use different techniques, they obtain data that are only one part of the puzzle, but often the results are presented in literature as the final answer. The most important thing that we did was to put together information from the various experimental techniques to obtain a composite picture.\"\n\nWhen examined by XRD, Li1.2Co0.4Mn0.4O2 reveals an average long-range crystal structure similar to that of layered LiCoO2. STEM results, however, revealed the presence of lithium atoms, in sites typically occupied by cobalt and manganese atoms, ordered in a manner similar to that in layered Li2MnO3. But the STEM data could not establish the structural relationship between the ordered lithium atoms and the neighboring cobalt and manganese atoms. The XAS experiments conducted at the X-ray Science Division 20-BM bending magnet beamline of the Advanced Photon Source, on the other hand, were successful in distinguishing the local atomic environments around the cobalt and manganese. Balasubramanian and his collaborators determined that while the crystalline structure of the Li1.2Co0.4Mn0.4O2 compound is largely homogeneous over the long range, the local structure contains Li2MnO3 and LiCoO2 nanoclusters. These local clusters might present connectivity over long distances as a dendritic network. \"Having continuous regions allows for each unit cell to 'talk' to the next unit cell over very long distances,\" Balasubramanian said. This connectivity enhances the transport of lithium ions and hence, the electrochemical performance of the material for battery applications. \"It's the local structure that determines the properties of the compound,\" Abraham added.\n\nThe team's broad-based approach of bringing together a wide palette of experimental methods, rather than relying on a single technique, is an important step towards the custom design of battery materials based on results from advanced diagnostic techniques. \"In the past, most advances in battery materials development arose from intuitive experimentation,\" explained Balasubramanian. \"We want to complement this intuitive Edisonian approach with a rigorous basic approach to tailoring new materials.\"\n\nThe next step is to observe the structural changes that occur in these lithium-rich compounds as they are cycled through various voltage windows, which is critical for determining battery life and durability. \"Tools and techniques like those available at the APS can provide us unique insights to develop structure-property correlations, which are very important to predict long-term battery performance,\" Abraham said.\n\nThe work lays a solid foundation for the design and development of new compounds. \"We want to be able to tailor these materials with desired properties for specific applications,\" Balasubramanian said. \"We need transformational materials with high capacities, high power, and stable crystal structures for the successful commercialization of lithium-ion batteries for a myriad of demanding applications.\"\n\nRelated Stories"

      "text": "Researchers work to make fuel cells more affordable\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy has recently increased its support for the research and development of hydrogen fuel cells in the hopes of making the energy systems more financially viable for the country. Hydrogen fuel has been targeted as a promising alternative to fossil-fuels, particularly foreign oil, and could help the country establish energy independence and sustainability. One of the major detractors of hydrogen fuel cells, however, is that they are expensive energy systems. Researchers from the Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) may have found a way to make fuel cells more affordable.\n\nA viable replacement for platinum catalysts developed by the Brookhaven National Laboratory\n\nThe reason fuel cells are so expensive is because they require costly materials, such as platinum, in order to function. Platinum is used to create catalysts that are used within fuel cells to generate hydrogen gas. Without this catalyst, fuel cells would be unable to produce electricity, thus rendering them an ineffective energy system. Replacing this catalyst has been a popular topic for scientists and many have tried to accomplish this feat with varying degrees of success. BNL researchers believe they have found a way to replace platinum catalysts without sacrificing the performance of fuel cells.\n\nCatalyst uses inexpensive materials but is nearly as effective as platinum\n\nInstead of using platinum, researchers have developed a catalyst that is made of nickel, molybdenum and nitrogen. These materials are used to create a nanosheet that is resistant to the chemical processes that occur within a fuel cell. The nanosheet can separate hydrogen from water and produce enough of the gas for a fuel cell to generate large amounts of electricity. Researchers note that it is not as effective as platinum catalysts, but it is more efficient.\n\nNew catalyst cited as being 1,000 times less expensive than conventional models\n\nThe nanosheet is scalable, meaning that it is viable for commercialization and can be used in any type of hydrogen fuel cell, mobile or stationary. Researchers claim that the new catalyst is 1,000 times less expensive than platinum, which could have major implications for the fuel cell industry as it would make hydrogen fuel much more economically viable than the alternative energy is today"

      "text": "For the past eight years, Andreas Mershin has worked on isolating photosystem-I (PS-I) molecules from plants to use in solar panels. The PS-I is a protein complex which carries out photosynthesis. They've been isolating PS-I, stabilizing it with expensive chemicals and complex lab equipment, and putting a layer of the resultant goo on glass, which is even cooler to do to your windows than lining them with aluminum foil. The biggest drawback to their earlier methods, besides the high expense, was that the panels were so weak they would only produce a current when hit with a high-powered laser. Oh man, I need more panels to produce enough electricity to run this high-powered laser.\n\nNow Mershin and his team at MIT (along with Barry Bruce from the University of Tennessee) have accomplished the hardest part: greatly reducing the expense and complexity of isolating the PS-I while raising the efficiency enough to produce a small current in regular light. The downside is that the newest design has an efficiency of only 0.1% while most modern solar panels have 15% to 18% efficiency. The upside is that the materials involved are not rare, not toxic, and not expensive, unlike some conventional solar panel components. They've replaced the expensive chemicals and lab equipment with an easy-to-use readymade \"stabilizing powder\".\n\nThe stabilizing powder is made from inexpensive, common chemicals which can be added to agricultural waste (like grass clippings) to create a green goo with the PS-1 structures still performing photosynthesis even after the plant's death. The ingredients include zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, both to increase the surface area (to increase efficiency) and to protect the PS-I from damage caused by UV rays. Wait, slathering common sunscreen ingredients on plants keeps their photosystems safer? I will use this information in a completely rational way that doesn't frighten my neighbors at all.\n\nThe stabilizing powder — much like your mom — is cheap and easy enough to be used by hobbyists and classroom labs. The team hopes this ease of experimenting with panels will lead to improvements in the design. Mershin says the efficiency of the panels would have to increase at least tenfold (to 1% efficiency or more) for the panels to be good enough for use on roofs in the third world.\n\nYou can watch Mershin discussing these solar cells in the video below, although he never explains whether or not I should slather the trees in my yard with sunscreen. I'm just going to assume the answer is an emphatic yes.\n\nUPROXX Best of The Web\n\nFor the stabilizing powder try looking at the fall leaf change. The tress endure A predictable process of chemical leaf change in which trees begin to lose water due to the positioning of the sun and other factors. During this loss of water the catalyst of photosynthesis which is chlorophyll starts to decrease. If there would be a way to reverse the process an chlorophyll we increase to an endless amount making it cheap and very effective for creating solar pannels."

      "text": "Aug 19, 2005\n\nWith gasoline prices hovering at $3 per gallon, probably few Americans need convincing that another energy crisis is imminent. But what precisely is to be done about our future energy needs is still a puzzle. There's talk about a \"hydrogen economy,\" but hydrogen itself poses some formidable challenges.\n\nThe key challenge is, of course, how to make the hydrogen in the first place. The best and cheapest methods currently available involve burning coal or natural gas, which means more greenhouse gases and more pollution. Adopting the cheapest method by using natural gas would merely result in replacing our dependence on foreign oil with a dependence on foreign gas.\n\n\"Clearly, one clean way to get hydrogen is by splitting water with sunlight,\" says Harry Gray, who is the Beckman Professor of Chemistry at the California Institute of Technology.\n\nGray is involved with several other Caltech and MIT chemists in a research program they call \"Powering the Planet.\" The broadest goal of the project is to \"pursue efficient, economical ways to store solar energy in the form of chemical bonds,\" according to the National Science Foundation (NSF). With a new seed grant from the NSF and the possibility for additional funding after the initial three-year period, the Caltech group says they now have the wherewithal to try out some novel ideas to produce energy cheaply and cleanly.\n\n\"Presently, this country spends more money in 10 minutes at the gas pump than it puts into a year of solar-energy research,\" says Nathan S. Lewis, the Argyros Professor and professor of chemistry. \"But the sun provides more energy to the planet in an hour than all the fossil energy consumed worldwide in a year.\"\n\nThe reason that Gray and Lewis advocate the use of solar energy is that no other renewable resource has enough practical potential to provide the world with the energy that it needs. But the sun sets every night, and so use of solar energy on a large scale will necessarily require storing the energy for use upon society's demand, day or night, summer or winter, rain or shine.\n\nAs for non-renewable resources, nuclear power plants would do the job, but 10,000 new ones would have to be built. In other words, one new nuclear plant would have to come on-line every other day somewhere in the world for the next 50 years.\n\nThe devices used in a simple experiment in the high school chemistry lab to make hydrogen by electrolysis are not currently the cheapest ones to use for mass production. In fact, the tabletop device that breaks water into hydrogen and oxygen is perfectly clean (in other words, no carbon emissions), but it requires a platinum catalyst. And platinum has been selling all year for more than $800 per ounce.\n\nThe solution? Find something cheaper than platinum to act as a catalyst. There are other problems, but this is one that the Caltech group is starting to address. In a research article now in press, Associate Professor of Chemistry Jonas Peters and his colleagues demonstrate a way that cobalt can be used for catalysis of hydrogen formation from water.\n\n\"This is a good first example for us,\" says Peters. \"A key goal is to try to replace the current state-of-the-art platinum catalyst, which is extremely expensive, with something like cobalt, or even better, iron or nickel. We have to find a way to cheaply make solar-derived fuel if we are to ever really enable widespread use of solar energy as society's main power source.\"\n\n\"It's also a good example because it shows that the NSF grant will get us working together,\" adds Gray. \"This and other research results will involve the joint use of students and postdocs, rather than individual groups going it alone.\"\n\nIn addition to the lab work, the Caltech chemists also have plans to involve other entities outside campus--both for practical and educational reasons. One proposal is to fit out a school so that it will run entirely on solar energy. The initial conversion would likely be done with existing solar panels, but the facility would also serve to provide the researchers with a fairly large-scale \"lab\" where they can test out new ideas.\n\n\"We'd build it so that we could troubleshoot solar converters we're working on,\" explains Gray.\n\nThe ultimate lab goal is to have a \"dream machine with no wires in it,\" Gray says. \"We visualize a solar machine with boundary layers, where water comes in, hydrogen goes out one side, and oxygen goes out the other.\"\n\nSuch a machine will require a lot of work and a number of innovations and breakthroughs, but Lewis says the future of the planet depends on moving away from fossil fuels.\n\n\"If somebody doesn't figure this out, and fast, we're toast, both literally and practically, due to a growing dependence on foreign oil combined with the increasing projections of global warming.\"\n\nThe NSF grant was formally announced August 11 as a means of funding a new group of chemical bonding centers that will allow research teams to pursue problems in a manner \"that's flexible, tolerant of risk, and open to thinking far outside the box.\" The initial funding to the Caltech and MIT group for the \"Powering the Planet\" initiative is $1.5 million for three years, with the possibility of $2 to $3 million per year thereafter if the work of the center appears promising.\n\nIn addition to Gray, Lewis, and Peters, the other Caltech personnel include Jay Winkler and Bruce Brunschwig, both chemists at Caltech's Beckman Institute. The two faculty members from MIT involved in the initiative are Dan Nocera and Kit Cummins.\n\nJonas Peters's paper will appear in an upcoming issue of the journal Chemical Communications. In addition to Peters and Lewis, the other authors are Brunschwig, Xile Hu, a postdoctoral researcher in chemistry at Caltech, and Brandi Cossairt, a Caltech undergraduate.If nanoscience were television, we'd be in the 1950s.

      "text": "ABSTRACT Thin-film dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) based on mesoporous semiconductor electrodes are low-cost alternatives to conventional silicon devices. High-efficiency DSCs typically operate as photoanodes (n-DSCs), where photocurrents result from dye-sensitized electron injection into n-type semiconductors. Dye-sensitized photocathodes (p-DSCs) operate in an inverse mode, where dye-excitation is followed by rapid electron transfer from a p-type semiconductor to the dye (dye-sensitized hole injection). Such p-DSCs and n-DSCs can be combined to construct tandem solar cells (pn-DSCs) with a theoretical efficiency limitation well beyond that of single-junction DSCs (ref. 4). Nevertheless, the efficiencies of such tandem pn-DSCs have so far been hampered by the poor performance of the available p-DSCs (refs 3, 5-15). Here we show for the first time that p-DSCs can convert absorbed photons to electrons with yields of up to 96%, resulting in a sevenfold increase in energy conversion efficiency compared with previously reported photocathodes. The donor-acceptor dyes, studied as photocathodic sensitizers, comprise a variable-length oligothiophene bridge, which provides control over the spatial separation of the photogenerated charge carriers. As a result, charge recombination is decelerated by several orders of magnitude and tandem pn-DSCs can be constructed that exceed the efficiency of their individual"

They can be conducting an experiment looking, or hoping, for a particular result and end up with something totally unexpected and, well, cool.\n\nFor example: Generating electricity by harnessing the power of water vapor.\n\n\"Initially, we planned to develop a strong and flexible polymeric electrode for tissue engineering purposes,\" Mingming Ma, a postdoc at MIT's David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and lead author of a paper describing the discovery, told TakePart. \"We designed our material based on well-studied polypyrrole [a chemical compound], but also added the second polymer component: polyol-borate.\"\n\n\"We found that this new composite material was highly responsive to water vapor, which was unexpected and unique. Then we studied the mechanism of its water-responsive property and designed a generator that can harvest energy from low-temperature water vapor to generate electricity.\"\n\nMa explained that when the polymer film the researchers created lies on a surface that contains even a small amount of moisture its bottom layer absorbs evaporated water, which then forces the film to curl away from the surface. \"Once the bottom of the film is exposed to air, it quickly releases the moisture, somersaults forward, and starts to curl up again. As this cycle is repeated, the continuous motion converts the chemical energy of the water gradient into mechanical energy,\" said Ma.\n\nMIT News noted that this type of film could act as either actuators (a type of motor) or generators. \"The researchers demonstrated that a 25-milligram film can lift a load of glass slides 380 times its own weight, or transport a load of silver wires 10 times its own weight, by working as a potent water-powered \"mini tractor.' \"\n\nAsked how this was possible, Ma explained: \"It's like the power of ants. Ants can lift objects much heavier than themselves. What happens is that when the film is absorbing water and curling, there is a strong force, or stress, generated inside the film. This force is strong enough to lift heavy objects. That's why this type of material is called artificial muscle.\"\n\nWhile Ma noted that real-world applications are at least five years off, the possibilities are extremely diverse.\n\n\"Potential applications include large-scale water-vapor power generators, or small generators to power wearable electronics,\" he said. \"If used to generate electricity on a larger scale, the film could harvest energy from the environment—for example, while placed above a lake or river. Or, it could be attached to clothing, where the mere evaporation of sweat could fuel devices such as wearable physiological parameter monitoring sensors (for blood pressure and heart rate). On a smaller scale, the film could power microelectrical mechanical systems, including environmental sensors, or even smaller devices, such as nanoelectronics.\"\n\nAs if all of that weren't enough, because the new polymer film uses so little water, it's also environmentally friendly.\n\nCan you imagine other ways this new material might be used?

That's why they say coffee grounds can make good fertilizer, or even green lego blocks, and that's where the idea for regenerative braking in hybrid electric cars came into the picture. But what about you as a human being? What wasted energy could be recaptured from you?\n\nWake Forest University researchers from the Center for Nanotechnology and Molecular Materials have come up with a fabric that they call Power Felt. The unique thing here is that it can convert temperature differences into usable electric current. What they've done is taken carbon nanotubes and locked them up in flexible plastic fibers. After weaving those fibers together, the resulting fabric can react to temperature gradients.\n\nSo, as an example, if you were to weave these into a pair of shorts or a t-shirt, the fabric could react to the difference in temperature from your body (warm) and from the outside air (cool), generating a current to charge up your iPhone, iPod, or whatever else. The researchers envision this being used with insulating pipes, roof tiles, car seats, and so on.\n\nThe hurdle is that the current version of this tech only yeilds 140 nanowatts of power from 72 stacked swatches of the thin material. That's one millionth of the power that your iPhone needs when it's idle. They'll need to seriously ramp up the efficiency, but this is looking like a very promising development.\n\nSome fun stats to start with:\nIf you are from a 1st world nation you will spend an estimated 96% of your life indoors or in a car. If you dont buy that take notes on your daily routine. If you are from a 1st world nation chances are you are from a part of the world that has winters. If you have winters you must have heaters if you convert your body heat into electricity you will radiate less body heat. Less body heat means running a heater more. Running a heater more means more fuel is used.\n\nNow, you are going to say that human body heat is to low to worry about anyway. If you say this then I ask you why you are trying to charge your phone with it.\n\nYou might point out to me that people run ACs in the summer time so this will be a moneysaver. Only problem is that the efficiency of any process that converts thermal energy into another form of energy is strictly dependent on temperature differences. So, in a nutshell in the winter it will run the best but that is the time you do not want it to run, in the summer it will run badly even through that is the time you want it to run.\n\nWhat about outside? I guess it could have some use outside if say you were jogging. I would still wonder through if you would really want this fabric pressed close to your skin."

      "text": "MIT Finds Cooler Way to Protect Silicon Surfaces\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 13 —\n\nNow a team of MIT researchers has found a way to passivate silicon at room temperature, which could be a significant boon to solar-cell production and other silicon-based technologies.\n\nThe research, by graduate student Rong Yang and engineering professors Karen Gleason and Tonio Buonassisi, was recently published online in the journal Advanced Materials.\n\nTypically, silicon surfaces are passivated with a coating of silicon nitride, which requires heating a device to 400 degrees Celsius, explains Gleason, the Alexander and I. Michael Kasser Professor of Chemical Engineering. By contrast, the process Gleason's team uses decomposes organic vapors over wires heated to 300 C, but the silicon itself never goes above 20 C — room temperature. Heating those wires requires much less power than illuminating an ordinary light bulb, so the energy costs of the process are quite low.\n\nConventional silicon-nitride passivation \"is one of the more expensive parts, and one of the more finicky parts, in the processing\" of silicon for solar cells and other uses, says Buonassisi, an associate professor of mechanical engineering, \"so replacing part of silicon nitride's functionality with a simplified, robust organic layer has the potential to be a big win.\"\n\nEssential process\n\nPassivation is essential: Without it, silicon's surface is oxidized as soon as it's exposed to air, impeding its performance as a solar cell. \"It would oxidize within minutes,\" Yang says. By contrast, the MIT team has tested silicon chips with the new polymer coating in place for more than 200 hours, observing no degradation at all in performance. \"The electrical properties did not change,\" she says.\n\nThe low temperature of the silicon chip in this process means that it could be combined with other materials, such as organic compounds or polymers, that would be destroyed by the higher temperature of the conventional coating process. This could enable new applications of silicon chips — for example, as biosensors following bonding with compounds that react with specific biological molecules. \"People have grafted DNA and protein antibodies to silicon,\" Yang notes.\n\nSaving energy\n\nThe energy used in manufacturing silicon solar cells is a critical concern because every bit of cost savings helps to make them more competitive with other sources of electricity. The lower temperatures could significantly reduce manufacturing costs, the MIT researchers say.\n\nThe new process also has an added benefit, providing an anti-reflective coating that improves a solar cell's overall efficiency, the team says.\n\nBoth the conventional process and the new process take place in a vacuum chamber. Liquid reactants evaporate, then adsorb and react on the surface. The adsorption step is much the same as mist forming on a cold bathroom window after you take a shower.\n\nThe process can easily be scaled to the size of conventional solar cells, Gleason says. Additionally, the materials involved are all commercially available, so implementing the new method for commercial production could be a relatively quick process.\n\nBuonassisi describes lowering the cost of manufacturing equipment, including that used to apply the passivating and antireflection coating, as \"one of the three steps that's needed to drive down the price of solar modules to widespread grid competitiveness.\" (The other two are improvements in efficiency and reducing the amount of materials used.) The next step for his team is to scale up the process from laboratory-scale to production levels that could lead to commercialization, he says.\n\nThe challenge in making this advance, he explains, was found at the atomic level — specifically, at the interface between the organic coating material and the silicon, to ensure that the two bonded solidly. Tests have shown that the process this team developed has solved that challenge, Buonassisi says. While the team used one specific polymer for the coating, the process could be replicated using other organic materials.\n\nThe research was supported by the Italian energy company Eni S.p.A., under the Eni-MIT Alliance Solar Frontiers Program open"

In bright sunlight, it absorbs and stores energy, but when it is full to capacity, the window darkens to limit the amount of light that enters. This controls the temperature and brightness of the room and the captured energy can be used to power equipment, such as television screens. As the electricity gets used up, the energy storage smart window (ESS window) will lighten and begin to absorb more sunlight to recharge itself.The ESS window is made of polyaniline nanowire arrays, which are deposited onto a transparent film that has been coated with a conductive layer. The nanowires are then covered with a gel electrolyte layer to form an electrode, and two electrodes are sandwiched together to make a working device.Polyaniline has a high capacity and doesn't cost much to make, plus it has the added advantages of being transparent and flexible. 'Flexible devices are attracting more and more attention because they are lightweight, easy to roll up, and can be designed in a more fashionable way. It is no doubt that a flexible smart window like ours possesses these properties. For instance, the ESS window can be rolled up like a curtain if it is not being used,' says Wei.John Rogers, an expert in photonic devices from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, US, was cautiously optimistic about the work.

However, it's enough to power an LED headlamp or an ipod and it's \"free power\" in the sense that there's no extra effort required by the walker.\n\nResearchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology are taking the piezoelectric idea one step further; they're embedding nanotechnology fibers into fabric and making power-generating duds. Simply by moving around and jostling the clothing, the wearer is cranking out power.\n\nZhong Lin Wang and colleagues at the Georgia Institute of Technology covered individual fibers of fabric with nanowires made of zinc oxide. These wires are 50 nanometers in diameter, 1,800 times thinner than a human hair.\n\nAlternating fibers are coated with gold. As one strand of the fabric is stretched against another, the nanowires on one fiber rub against the gold-coated ones on the other, like the teeth of two bottle brushes. The resulting tension and pressure generate a piezoelectric charge that is captured by the gold and can be fed into a circuit.\n\nThe allure of the idea is that it doesn't take unusual movement to generate usable electricity. Pretty much anything someone does while wearing a piezoelectric shirt would be productive.\n\nOur friends at EcoGeek recently ran a story on a \"knee dynamo\" that harnesses energy directly from the walking motion.\n\nFrom EcoGeek:\n\nIt actually uses the energy of the leg swinging forward at the beginning of the stride to generate the power.\n\nThis energy would otherwise need to be counteracted by the leg muscles to keep the leg from jarring the knee. This way, the dynamo can actually produce more power than the extra energy the wearer spends to use the device. Think of it like regenerative breaking in hybrid cars. Every time you take a step, your thigh has to both speed up and slow down your lower leg. This thing just helps your leg slow itself down, and captures some of that energy. There's an excellent video of the thing in action at BBC news, I suggest you check it out.\n\nNot quite \"free power,\" as there's still a little extra effort required by the user. However, the energy gained is greater the extra energy expended. Sounds a bit like perpetual motion – as long as you keep walking!\n\nOr, perhaps the next step in self-contained power is to carry mini-solar panels around with us. Computer bags and backpacks with solar panels have been around for a while. Well, why not dispense with the luggage and put the panels right on our bods? Groovy Green recently featured a stylish little number from Studio 5050 made up of solar-cell-packing tiles. Somewhere in the scanty outfit is a USB interface to charge your accessories on the go.\n\nAs Hank Green of EcoGeek said, \"..if I can't power my own iPod 15 years from now, I give up on this planet…thanks to these guys for getting this technology another step (or half-stride) closer to reality.\"\n\nIt would be interesting to see this debate taking place again today. Given that the Census Bureau has found there are more people living in poverty in suburbs than in cities I think it would be difficult to defend the idea that everyone wants to live there. Apparently people with money are choosing cities and exurbs.\n\nI don't have the official reference off hand but here's a quote from a Brookings report: [quote]In 1999 large cities and their suburbs had nearly equal numbers of poor individuals, but by 2005 the suburban poor outnumbered their city counterparts by at least 1 million.[/quote][url]\n\nThe saddest part is that people who can ill afford cars in the first place feel more need for them and often can only afford older, lower mileage, higher emission vehicles, compounding their problems.\n\nInterestingly enough, some of the earliest \"suburbs\" were areas outside of a city's center made accessible by new train lines being built. This raises an interesting idea–what if developers were required to provide a portion of funding for mass transit access to areas being newly developed?"

This new tech could be available as early as spring 2010.\n\nThe technology is dubbed Stoba, and it took five years to develop by the lead research organization of Taiwan at the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). Stoba sits between the positive and negative sides of a battery, functioning as a porous material under normal conditions. However, once a Stoba battery hits 266 degrees Fahrenheit, the material transforms into a non-porous film that cuts off battery functions and prevents over-heating or explosion.\n\nThere has been concern related to mid-air fire caused by battery hazards, the Taiwanese government noted.\n\nAsian battery makers are now testing Stoba in small quantities, with the additional price of the technology only adding two or three percent to manufacturing costs. Taiwanese battery manufacturers expect to see products ready in Q1 2010.\n\nThe ITRI has been prevalent in international research the past few years, with 151 start-up companies launched by its employees. The research organization has almost 6,000 employees and more than 9,000 patents in several countries.\n\nLithium-ion safety hazards were catapulted into news headlines recently after several cases of fires or explosions were caused by faulty batteries in laptops or MP3 players. Many companies have issued product recalls for particularly hazardous batteries that were provided to consumers."

The researchers estimate that the process could cost less than the conventional one.\n\nThe new process could eliminate a major global source of carbon dioxide emissions. Lime is used to make cement, purify iron, treat soil, and produce glass, paper, sugar, and other things. Cement production alone emits 5 to 6 percent of total man-made greenhouse gases, and most of that comes from producing lime.\n\nRather than simply heating up limestone until it releases carbon dioxide, as in the conventional method, the process uses a combination of heat and electrolysis, which produces lime, oxygen, and either carbon or carbon monoxide, depending on the temperatures used. The researchers built a device that includes three Fresnel lenses for concentrating sunlight. Two of those heat a mixture of lithium carbonate and limestone (calcium carbonate). The third focuses light on a high-efficiency solar cell, which provides the electricity needed to electrolyze the carbonate mixture. High temperatures reduce the amount of electricity needed and cause the lime to precipitate out of the mixture, making it easy to separate.\n\nThe device works only when it's sunny, and intermittent operation isn't ideal for an industrial process. The researchers propose using molten salt to store heat, a system used in some solar thermal power plants. That would allow the process to run day and night"

It's a battery with tanks of electrolytes that effectively let the battery store more energy than normal batteries. The electrolytes flow or circulate through the system. The larger the tanks, the more electricity it can store.\n\nFlow batteries won't appear in watches or MP3 players any day soon. They are too big, Winter explained. The batteries are for bulk energy storage and will serve as backup or emergency power sources. An individual flow battery can provide backup power for 8 to 16 hours and store several kilowatts of power. The electricity is discharged during peak demand periods.\n\nDeeya claims its batteries are 3 times less expensive than lead acid batteries, which were around when Calvin Coolidge still strode the earth, and 10 to 20 times cheaper than lithium ion batteries. \"They are cheaply made out of plastic. They are low maintenance,\" said Rick Winter, an executive at Deeya last fall.\n\nEnergy storage is the big kahuna in the\ngreen tech market (along with clean coal.) Demand for both these technologies is huge.\nCar makers, utilities, industrial sites, solar homes, and wind power companies all want better batteries and other devices for storing energy. Unfortunately, it's also a difficult problem.\n\nHence, a lot of money is flowing into companies like Deeya, Boston-Power (notebook and later plug-in hybrid batteries), and General Compression (compresses air for later use)."

David Kilper / WUSTL Photo\n\nDevice generates electricity using bacteria, Double threat could power 900 American homes An environmental engineer at Washington University in St. Louis has created a device similar to a hydrogen fuel cell that uses bacteria to treat wastewater and create electricity.\n\nLars Angenent, Ph.D., assistant professor of Chemical Engineering, and a member of the University's Environmental Engineering Science Program, has devised a microbial fuel cell which he calls an upflow microbial fuel cell (UMFC) that is fed continually and, unlike most microbial fuel cells, works with chambers atop each other rather than beside each other.\n\nAngenent has created electricity with the device — in its current mode, about the size of a thermos bottle — and says it has to be scaled up considerably to someday handle the two million or so gallons of wastewater it needs to treat to churn out enough power.\n\n\"We have proven we can generate electricity on a small scale,\" Angenent said. \"It will take time, but we believe the process has potential to be used for local electricity generation.\n\n\"The upflow microbial fuel cell is a promising wastewater treatment process and has, as a lab-scale unit, generated electricity and purified artificial wastewater simultaneously for more than five months.\"\n\nA description of the process and research is in the July issue of Environmental Science and Technology. Angenent's co-authors are Jason He, his doctoral student, and Shelley D. Minter, Ph.D., of the Saint Louis University Chemistry Department.\n\nAngenent has filed a provisional US patent on the process. He has received a $40,000 Bear Cub award from Washington University to develop the concept. The Bear Cub Fund was initiated by the Washington University vice chancellor for research to support faculty in applied studies not normally supported by federal grants from NIH, NSF, and other sources. The purpose of the awards is to support research or development that is designed to extend basic observations to make them more attractive for licensing by commercial entities or to serve as the \"foundation\" for a start-up company.\n\nAngenent uses a carbon-based foam with a large pore size on which biofilm grows, allowing him to connect two electrodes in the anode and cathode chambers with a conductive wire. In a hydrogen fuel cell a membrane separates the anode and cathode chambers. When hydrogen meets the anode electrode, it splits into protons and electrons, with protons going across the membrane to the cathode chamber, and electrons passing over the wire between electrodes to create a current. Oxygen is added to the cathode chamber, and on the electrode there is a reaction of electron plus proton plus oxygen to form water. Catalysts, such as platinum, are needed on both electrodes to promote the reactions.\n\n\"We are doing basically the same thing as is done in a hydrogen fuel cell with our microbial fuel cell,\" said Angenent, whose graduate student, Jason He has done all the research on the process. \"We've found that the bacteria on the anode electrode can act as the catalyst instead of platinum,\"\n\n\"The bacteria form a biofilm on the anode electrodes, and what I want to do is optimize this process so that we get higher currents, which should allow us to scale up the system,' Angenent said.\n\nAngenent said that producing energy from wastewater should be a high international priority because of population growth and worldwide depletion of energy resources. Wastewater, with its high-content organic matter, also can produce methane and hydrogen fuels, however, that theoretically more readily usable energy can be produced when electricity is produced directly in a microbial fuel cell. He noted that a bioelectricity generating wastewater treatment system in just one large food-processing plant could power as much as 900 American single-family households.\n\nRelevant PhysicsForums posts\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Like mutual back-scratching, two common bacteria involved in what was thought to be only a marginally important relationship actually help each other thrive when grown together in bioreactors"

      "text": "Cheaper Hydrogen Production\n\nI thought of a way to produce hydrogen much cheaper using less electrical energy.\nPractical Hydrogen production:\nUse radioactivity to change water into hydrogen peroxide [H2O2], then use electrolysis to change the hydrogen peroxide into hydrogen and oxygen. It should take less electrical energy to change H2O2 into hydrogen and oxygen than it does to change H2O into hydrogen and oxygen. Nuclear waste could be used to provide the radioactive material to do this. The hydrogen and oxygen separation facility could be placed close to a nuclear power plant. The cooling water that is used to cool down the atomic pile is subjected to high levels of radiation, and some of that must be changed into hydrogen peroxide. Run the cooling water from the nuclear power plant to the hydrogen and oxygen separation facility. Separate the hydrogen peroxide from the water (if you can economically do that), and use electolysis sending electrical energy into the hydrogen peroxide and separate that into hydrogen and oxygen. If you can't sepearate the H2O2 from the H2O, then use the electrolysis on the mixture; it would still take less electricity for separtation because some of the electrical energy is going to go into H2O2 molecules.\nWithout using a nuclear facility you could just put radioactive waste into a large pool of water. Allow the radioactivity to change the water into hydrogen peroxide, and then separate the water from the hydrogen peroxide, and do the electrolysis on the hydrogen peroxide, separating it into hydrogen and oxygen. This should make hydrogen a practical fuel to use in engines world wide, making both hydrogen and oxygen much cheaper to produce.\n[As far as energy is conscerned, H2O2 is like an intermediate energy stage before you get to water. It should take much less electrical energy to convert that to hydrogen and oxygen. The energy from the radioactive waste is totally free, provided by the nuclear decay of the radioactive material.]\n\nuhhh, how does radioactivity turn h20 into h202? I am not a chemist, but I don't see how it would happen.\nRadiation is alpha (2 protons and 2 neutrons), beta (fast electron), gamma (electromagnetic radiation)\nIt looks like an alpha particle, knocks a hydrogen atom (which is a proton with an electron orbiting it) off of the H2O molecule, changing it to an OH and an H. These free radicals (highly interactive) react with H2O molecules, changing them to H2O2. That seems to be the mechanism based on what I read from that article.\nA long time ago I heard that hydrogen peroxide poisoning is a part of radiation sickness.Yeah, I thought about that, the separation is not needful. You can put the electrodes close to the radioactive material where the H2O2 would probably be more concentrated.\nIf OH interacts with H2O, to form an H and H2O2, then you would get 2 hydrogen atoms released every time an H2O2 molecule is produced, without using any electricity. The first when the H is knocked off the H2O, and the second when the OH and another H2O combine to produce an H and H2O2. So just by having the radioactivity acting on the water it should produce Hydrogen automatically, without needing any electrolysisYou don't put any energy into the radiation. The energy from the radiation is free energy. It is supplied by the conversion of mass to energy as the radioactive waste decays. What you would be doing is using the energy from the radioactive decay to assist in the splitting of the hydrogen and oxygen. You might consider this a fundamentally new way of using nuclear energy. Instead of using the heat it produces, you would be using its energy to produce a hydrogen/oxygen fuel....If OH interacts with H2O, to form an H and H2O2, then you would get 2 hydrogen atoms released every time an H2O2 molecule is produced, without using any electricity.... produced produced not suggesting that hydrogen is going to bubble up caused by any energy flux. I am suggesting that it would happen if the water is exposed to alpha radiation. It The reaction of producing the free hydrogen and the hydrogen peroxide will probably happen within 2 inches or so away from the alpha radiation source. Any electrodes for electrolysis on the hydrogen peroxide, should be placed close to the alpha radiation source, where the H2O2 is more concentrated.\nUse a nuclear waste material that is a high alpha radiation source and expose it directly to the water. It can't be in a container.\n\nAccording to this article, the situation is not as simple as you state:Alpha radiation acting on water does produce hydrogen peroxide, which is one of the poisons that causes radiation sickness. It looks like the alpha particles energetically tearing the H2O molecules apart, is producing H2O2. During the production of this, one of the OH is lost to the H2O2 molecule and is no longer free. You would now have more free H than you have free OH, so it is out of balance and cannot just recombine faster to go back to H2O.\nAccording to this there should be hydrogen gas produced.\nAnyway, even if there is not significant extra Hydrogen produced by the radioactivity, the energy from the radioactivity producing the H2O2 will help reduce the amount of electricity needed to separate the water into Hydrogen and Oxygen. So you should still get cheaper production of hydrogen and oxygen using electrolysis on the H2O2The radioactive materials, that do spontaneous fission, are usually very heavy metals, or isotopes of heavy metals. I never heard of radioactive hydrogen or radioactive oxygen, two light gasses. (Double wt. and triple wt. hydrogen are not radioactive; not fissile.) Never heard of radioactive water either. There can be radioactive compounds in water, but the water itself is not radioacativeRadioactive hydrogen (tritium mostly) is used for the longer term equivalent of carbon dating ....\n\nI'm sure you have an error here. I don't recall exactly, but the half life of tritium is something betwee 10 and 20 years while that radio active carbon (C14 - think is the unstable isotope) is hundreds, it not thousands of times longer. Tritium is a gas and this also makes it much less useful for radioactive dating - It easily migrates form the material you want to date. I am too lazy to look up the half lifes, but if you do, you will see that I am basically right.\n\nYour \"most tritium\" is also miss leading if detrium is stable, and I think it is, or at least it has a very long lifetime. There are only these three isotopes of hydrogen , pn, & pnn where \"p\" is a proton and \"n\" is a neutron.\n\nI am not suggesting that hydrogen is going to bubble up caused by any energy flux.\n\nGood, we agree on this.\n\nOriginally Posted by ghost7584\n\nI am suggesting that it would happen if the water is exposed to alpha radiation.\n\nUntil provided with some evidence I have my doubts about it bubbling up even in a rich alpha flux.

It can't be in a container.\nOriginally Posted by ghost7584\n\nAlpha radiation acting on water does produce hydrogen peroxide....I went an researched about radioactive hydrogen and oxygen on the web.\nOxygen is no problem at all. Radioactive oxygen is only produced by the extremely high energy of a cyclotron. It would not be produced by radioactive substances in water.\nRadioactive hydrogen is only in the form of tritium. It is supposed to be rare. It is produced by neutron bombardment of heavy water (deuterium oxide) or Li6 in a reactor. The ammount of heavy water occuring naturally in water is very small. If any tritium would be produce by having the radioactive substance in the water, it would only be minimal and not a problem. Also tritium only decays into a weak bata particle that can't go through paper. It also occurs naturally already in the air by cosmic rays acting on deuterium.\nIt looks like a very small and insignificant amount of radioactive hydrogen would be produced, and it should cause no serious problems.\nAlso, perhaps the neutrons could be controlled in some way to help stop thelm from entering the water, or you could use a radio active source that is high in alpha radiation and produces no neutrons.\n\nGood, we agree on this.\nUntil provided with some evidence I have my doubts about it bubbling up even in a rich alpha flux. I tried to read your only reference but my browser reports that site does not exist. Please see if it does for yours. oneGot this from the web:\nSecondary reactions occur after free radicals have been produced in the irradiated water. The free radicals want to combine with other free radicals to become more chemically stable. There are three possible combinations: 1. A hydrogen free radical combines with another hydrogen free radical to produce hydrogen gas. Cells already have a measureable amount of dissolved hydrogen gas present so this reaction has little impact. 2. A hydrogen free radical combines with a hydroxyl free radical to produce water. As we know, the introduction of another water molecule is not a problem. 3. A hydoxyl free radical combines with another hydroxyl free radical to produce hydrogen peroxide. If you think this sounds harmful to the cell you are right! The hydrogen peroxide is poisonous to the cell as well as the peroxide radicals that can be formed which in turn attack other bio-organic molecules to form stable organic peroxides. The organic molecule that was attacked may have been imperitive to the cell's cycle and is no longer available for utilization, eventually causing the cell's death.* *Source: Basic Radiation Protection Technology, 1994.\n\nSince two OH combine to form H2O2 instead of an OH and an H2O like I thought, it would only produce half of the hydrogen from the radioactivity alone than I thought.\nWhatever they use for increasing the conductivity for water electrolysis would probably also work with H2O2 electrolysis.\nThe idea is that you are using some free energy from nuclear decay to assist in the tearing apart of the water molecule. So you need less electrical energy to do it. This makes hydrogen fuel really practicle.\nWorking out the details of how to really do it would require experimental trial and error, like working out the details of anything else.\n\nI am not suggesting mixing the isotopes in a powder and water form. I am suggesting putting them uncontained in the water in whole pieces, and placing the electrolysis electrodes close to them where the hydrogen peroxide should be most concentrated. The shielding is provided by the water. [I think you need something on the order of 150 pounds of anything per square foot, for shielding?]\nHalf life of tritium is 12.5 years. Deuterium completely stable.\nRadioactive oxygen produced only by cyclotron.\nInsignificant amount of tritium should be produced. Only decays into a weak Beta particle anyway.\n\nTo Ghost 7584:\nI don't want to discourage you from thinking (dreaming?) about new ways to use, generate, and/or store hydrogen. I am glad you are turning to the web to get some of the facts straight, but you need to do a lot more of this still.\n\nI am too lazy to look things up there and tend to rely on my memory for information. I knew tritium would not be a problem in your scheme and only remembered it half life was more than 10 and less than 20 years (Thanks for informing me it is 12.5)\nThe only reason I mentioned it is you erroneously said it could be used to make radioactive dating of objects older than radioactive carbon could. (I still don't recall the half life of c14, but am almost sure it is at least 1000 times longer than tritium, so I knew your claim for it \"reaching farther\" back into the past than tritium was erroneous.\nC14 is continiously produced by cosmic ray hitting CO2 in the high atmosphere. It is especially useful for dating old bones because animal's bodies treat the normal, stable, C12 and the radioactive C14 exactly the same (in their chemical food processing).\nThe continuous production and decay of C14 establishes a fixed concentration of C14 in the air (assuming the atmospheric CO2 and cosmic ray flux remains constant). I.e. the ratio of c12/c14 is fixed and known. I don't know what this ratio is, but lets guess it is 10 million. That means two of every 20 million carbon atoms in the animal's body on the day it dies (stops eating grass or meat etc = stops its intake of carbon). If one finds some old skin or bones and measures that, for example, there is now only 1 c14 for every 20 million C12s, then one knows that from the day it died until now, one half life of C14 has passed. We can now agree to say no more on this issue (but if you trouble to find the half life of C14, tell me.)\n\nI will respond to your most recent post about using H2O2 for electrolysis in separate post.\n\n........\nI am not suggesting mixing the isotopes in a powder and water form. I am suggesting putting them uncontained in the water in whole pieces, and placing the electrolysis electrodes close to them where the hydrogen peroxide should be most concentrated. ...\n\nYour first paragraph, taken from web source, which I have not reproduced above, appears basically OK. I am sure that ordinary water (\"pure water\") is not just H2O molecules. I have several times told that in each liter of water there are 10^7 H ions and 10^7 OH ions. I don't know the number, probably it is less than 10^7/ L, but I am sure there are some electrically neutral H2O2 molecules as well.\n\nThe electrical neutral molecule H2O2 does not move towards either electrode in an electrolysis cell. Only charged ions move under the influence of the applied electric field. Thus, I have little reason to think that your basic idea:\n\"to change the water to hydrogen peroxide and then use less electrical energy to split that into hydrogen and oxygen.\"\nis a correct idea. I can guarentee you that if you could put electrolysis electrodes in truely pure H2O2 (i.e. a non-existent liquid with only H2O2 molecules present - no H or OH ions, etc.) then no current would flow between the electrodes and ZERO Hydrogen would be produced.\n\nYour hope/ wish / dream to the contrary, does not cancel this physical fact.\n\nI don't know if it is easier or harder to split H2O2 than H2O. All I know about H2O2 is that it is reactive (used to bleach colors out of cloth etc.) and that it has consider energy that can be extracted becaues it is reactive. - In WWII, the germans used H2O2, as fuel in some of their submarines, instead of electrical batteries, to run below the water surface without a \"snorkel pipe\" above the surface (without exposure to RADAR). You can surely drive a car on H2O2 fuel. You will spend energy to make hydrogen from H2O2. You can drive a car on H2O2, without this expenditure of energy (and you never recover 100% of the energy you expend to make Hydrogen from anything) The fact that H2O2 can be used as a fuel, has been known for at least 100 years. It is not attractive, and less attractive after passing thru your scheme, even if your scheme would work! (You need to do more research and a little less dreaming. In another post I will give you an idea that may have some merit about hydrogen, but I doubt it and have not explored it much. - I'll let you do that if you like.)\n\nI am no chemist, but bet it is true that it takes less energy to split H2O2 than H2O, but this would make no difference in your scheme. The alpha particle has at least a million times more than the required energy for splitting either. To give you an analogy: Suppose you want to smash ants and there are big strong ants and small weak ones. If your smashing tool is a feather, then it may make a difference which type of ant you try to smash. If your smashing to is a wrecking ball droped from 100 meters above the ant, then which type of ant your are smashing makes no difference. The alpha particle is like a wrecking ball, not a feather, when the task is to break apart any chemical compound.\n\nYou said: \"Chernobyl was precipitated by a hydrogen explosion.\" This is incorrect. The \"accident\" may have ended this way, I forget if there was a hydrogen explosion or not. I may be confusing the fear of one at three mile island - which as I now understand it was baseless, but a very real fear for a day or two at the time.\n\nWhat participated the Chernobyl event, was really the cold war and in some sense the US should shair some of the blame for the accident. The russian were afraid US would conduct a \"preemptive strike.\" (A doctrine Presendent Bush supports even today.) They needed to be able to have enough nuclear weapons to be confident that they could survive a first strike and still make it so costly for the US to make a \"pre-emtive first strike\", which was publicaly advocated by many, especailly before the Russian set off their first hydrogen bomb and the US had Hydrogen bombs, that the US would not make as first strike. I.e. both sides adopted the \"MAD policy\" (Mutual Assured Destruction)\n\nAs is the case today with North Korea, the Russian (USSR) government (via its physicists) knew that the quickest way to get material for nuclear bombs is to run a nuclear reactor desiged to produce as much pultonium as possible; I.e not one designed for efficient production of electric power. Unfortunately, most if not all such \"plutonium production reactors\" have what is called a positive temperature coefficient. The one built at Chernobyl certainly did. It was designed to make plutonium the ussr needed for MAD.\n\nA positive temperature coefficient reactor can be run safely. If the temperate goes up alittle and the reaction rate increases as a resullt, you jsut put the neutron absorbing \"control rods\" in a little deeper. Likewise if the reactor core coolant is at 200 degrees C,(in pressure pipes and still liquid that when the pressure is redced will flash into steam for the turbins driving the electric generations - I am omitting the heat exchanges that are always used, even at Chernoble) and you pull the control rods out a little, immediately the reaction rate will increase (essentailly step like increase) and then more slowly the temperature of the core will increase. Because the design has a \"positive temperature coefficient,\" - the reaction rate will have a slow increase as the core temperature increases.\n\nEven at Chernoble, there were automatic controls that increase the coolant flow to prevent the temperature from increasing and causing the reaction rate to increase. The \"engineers\" running the reactor on the night of the \"accident\" wanted to measure the temperature coefficent and these automatic controls were frustrating their efforts, so they shut them off.\n\nThe plan was to pull the control rods out a little, note immediate step up in power production (reaction rate) and them watch the realtive slow increase in reaction rate increase caused by the relatively slow increase in temperature of the core. After the tempurture and reaction rate increase caused by the the temperature rise had been measured, they planned to plunge the control rods back in deeply and essentially kill the reaction rate. This experiment was done late at night when the suddend drop in power from Chernble reactor could easilly be compensted by incresed electric power production at other reactors and thermal power plants.\n\nI am not sure what went wrong, perhaps no one is. A very good possibility is that some of the fuel rods got so hot that the passageway for control rods was partiallly blocked, perhaps by pieces of fuel rod case that had come off or loose with the excess thermal heating of the rods. In any case, they could not \"crash\" the reactory as they had planned and the rest is history. - With a positive thermal coeficient, it entered a \"run away\" mode and parts of the core melted. etc.\n\nI will conclude this post with a few words about your statement:\n\n\"I am not suggesting mixing the isotopes in a powder and water form. I am suggesting putting them uncontained in the water in whole pieces...\"\n\nAs you correctly observed in another post, alpha particles don't penetrate much. Thick alumium foil will stop them. Even thiner foil of heavy atoms will also. Most atoms in the spent fuel are heavier than aluminum. Thus if you want a significant fraction of the alphas produced by the radioactive decay of the spent fuel to enter the water, your \"pieces\" should have diameter significantly smaller than the thickness of aluminum foil. That is, what i'd call a \"powder,\" but if you want to call it \"pieces,\" I will not object.\nThe point was the fuel rod is full of \"pellets\" about a centimeter in diameter and/ or length and you must grind them up to get your \"pieces\" (my \"powder\"). The cost of doing this, with the care that environmentalists would demand to avoid any air born release of radioacive dust, is so high that even if everything else in your process were absolutely free, I bet your hydrogen fuel would be at least 100 times more expensive than gasoline on an equal energy content basis. (when nuclear power plants were first being designed and no one realized how many years the environmentalist could delay/block construction the plan was to charge a low fixed rate for the power (big house pay more and factories would be metered if they used a lot of power.) This was because for the typical house, the capital cost of the meter would be more tha the cost of the electricity the house used. \"Too cheap to meter\" was the phrase that was used, before the economic impact of the environmentalists was understood."

A promising new technology called Power Felt, a thermoelectric device that converts body heat into an electrical current, soon could create enough juice to make another call simply by touching it.\n\nDeveloped by researchers in the Center for Nanotechnology and Molecular Materials at Wake Forest University, Power Felt is comprised of tiny carbon nanotubes locked up in flexible plastic fibers and made to feel like fabric. The technology uses temperature differences – room temperature versus body temperature, for instance – to create a charge.\n\nTheir research appears in the current issue of Nano Letters, a leading journal in nanotechnology.\n\n\"We waste a lot of energy in the form of heat. For example, recapturing a car's energy waste could help improve fuel mileage and power the radio, air conditioning or navigation system,\" says researcher and Wake Forest graduate student Corey Hewitt. \"Generally thermoelectrics are an underdeveloped technology for harvesting energy, yet there is so much opportunity.\"\n\nPotential uses for Power Felt include lining automobile seats to boost battery power and service electrical needs, insulating pipes or collecting heat under roof tiles to lower gas or electric bills, lining clothing or sports equipment to monitor performance, or wrapping IV or wound sites to better track patients' medical needs.\n\n\"Imagine it in an emergency kit, wrapped around a flashlight, powering a weather radio, charging a prepaid cell phone,\" said David Carroll, director of the Center for Nanotechnology and Molecular Materials. \"Power Felt could provide relief during power outages or accidents.\"\n\nCost has prevented thermoelectrics from being used more widely in consumer products. Standard thermoelectric devices use a much more efficient compound called bismuth telluride to turn heat into power in products including mobile refrigerators and CPU coolers, but researchers say it can cost $1,000 per kilogram. Like silicon, they liken Power Felt's affordability to demand in volume and think someday it could cost only $1 to add to a cell phone cover.\n\nCurrently, 72 stacked layers in the fabric yield about 140 nanowatts of power. The team is evaluating several ways to add more nanotube layers and make them even thinner to boost the power output.\n\nAlthough there's more work to do before Power Felt is ready for market, Hewitt says, \"I imagine being able to make a jacket with a completely thermoelectric inside liner that gathers warmth from body heat, while the exterior remains cold from the outside temperature. If the Power Felt is efficient enough, you could potentially power an iPod, which would be great for distance runners. It's definitely within reach.\"\n\nWake Forest is in talks with investors to produce Power Felt commercially.\n\nSource: Wake Forest University – 22 university researchers, aided by scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), have succeeded in integrating a new, highly efficient piezoelectric material into a silicon microelectromechanical system (MEMS).* This development could lead to significant advances in sensing, imaging and energy harvesting.\n\nA piezoelectric material, such as quartz, expands slightly when fed electricity and, conversely, generates an electric charge when squeezed.

      "text": "Latest News\n\nThree 5-kilowatt Plug Power Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells provide power at Brooks City-Base, San Antonio, Texas. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Engineer Research and Development Center Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (ERDC-CERL) is working to supply more fuel cells to military bases and federal facilities to reduce costs and fossil-fuel usage.\n\nHydrogen-powered cars may be the rage in the commercial sector, but the U.S. military is employing the first element of the periodic table to provide energy beyond transportation. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is powering stateside installations as well as bases in forward operating locations with fuel cells—electrochemical cells that convert fuel sources into electric currents. The efforts result in money savings, a reduction of the dependence on foreign oil, essentially unlimited power generation and a cleaner environment.\n\nThe Corps of Engineers Engineer Research and Development Center Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (ERDC-CERL) includes an energy branch that installs, deploys and identifies new power technologies for fixed installations. The branch began its fuel cell research in the mid 1990s, and it focuses primarily on stationary fuel cells, which have two main uses: prime power and backup power. For prime power use, installations employ the tools to provide electricity for buildings. Some fuel cells also can pull double duty. In addition to providing heating through electrochemical reactions, they can be combined with an absorption chiller that uses the excess heat from the fuel cell to cool the building. The result is a single fuel cell that can supply electricity, heat and cooling to a building.\n\nFor backup power, installations can connect fuel cells to a grid so the energy sources will kick in during an emergency without a disruption in electrical services. This ensures the continued operation of mission critical resources such as computer rooms, telephone switching equipment, command centers, hospitals and emergency centers.\n\nNick Josefik, a mechanical engineer at the ERDC-CERL, says that over the years the laboratory has installed more than 200 fuel cells in various sizes. These range from 500-watt models that back up a few computers to 250- to 500-megawatt systems that can power entire subdivisions, hospitals or industrial buildings. The fuel cell installations are split almost evenly between prime power and backup power use. Through this work, CERL is helping the military meet its goal to reduce energy usage 25 percent by 2015.\n\nJosefik explains that two of CERL's main goals are to meet the power needs of installations and to enhance the renewable technology industry. \"If they have a need we want to fix it or solve it,\" he states. The overall mission at CERL is to push toward sustainable installations.\n\nIn addition to putting the fuel cells in place on Army posts, CERL personnel have installed them on other military branch bases as well as federal buildings and in national parks. At Yosemite National Park in California, power generation has to be balanced against pollution limits. Thousands of people drive their cars in the area each year, so the park had to find ways to reduce its carbon footprint. Fuel cells generate few to no greenhouse gases and produce no carbon monoxide, making them cleaner than combustion technologies. They also lose less heat during the electricity-generating process, which helps to make them more efficient than combustion generators.\n\nJosefik explains that when fuel cells use hydrogen as the power source, the only emission is water. However, not all fuel cells use hydrogen, though he states that it is the popular belief. \"It's a marketing problem with the fuel cell industry,\" Josefik states. All proton exchange membrane fuel cells need hydrogen, but others can use different substances as the charge carrier.\n\nAll CERL-installed fuel cells are powered by hydrogen, but not necessarily in its pure form. Other power sources include natural gas and propane. \"We've looked into ethanol, but haven't been successful there yet,\" he shares. Scientists also have conducted methanol research as well as some projects that use methane from wastewater treatment plants. The fuel cells running on natural gas or propane pull out the hydrogen component and feed that into the fuel cell stack—several fuel cells grouped together to produce more power—that requires hydrogen flow.\n\nIn terms of civilian use, propane and natural gas are more accessible for the general public than pure hydrogen. For example, many houses in the United States already have a natural gas pipeline, and propane is easy to acquire and transport.\n\nHydrogen also is relatively easy to obtain, but generally must be procured through compressed gas dealers. To provide a continuous source of fuel, it has to be delivered in bottles regularly. Josefik says researchers are working on ways to make hydrogen more available. Because CERL is a research organization, it tests different fuel types, but Josefik says most units installed on military bases use straight hydrogen. Natural gas is the second-most common fuel source, with fewer units employing propane.\n\nUsing fuel cells connected to a natural gas line as backup generators for installations offers the benefit of continuous power. As long as the line continues to provide the fuel, the generator will continue to run. Fuel cells trump battery banks as a power source because batteries decline over time even when not in use. \"If you connect to a natural gas line, it could be unlimited time of operation,\" Josefik explains. Even choosing bottled hydrogen as the fuel source offers benefits over batteries because users know exactly how long the fuel cells will operate based on the amount of hydrogen stored.\n\nThe inside workings of a 5-kilowatt Plug Power PEM fuel cell at a Champaign, Illinois, facility are shown here.\n\nIn addition to installing fuel cells on military facilities stateside, CERL also is conducting experiments to power bases overseas. SilentCamp is a system concept in which a diesel generator is coupled with an electrolyzer, hydrogen storage system and fuel cell to power forward base camps silently. By feeding excess power from generators to electrolyzers, the generators run at higher efficiency. Electrolyzers are devices that turn water into hydrogen and oxygen, and the resulting hydrogen can be stored and used by fuel cells. The project could improve traditional generators; reduce noise, heat and chemical pollution; lessen maintenance costs; and fuel hydrogen vehicles. \"That's really an exciting, ongoing project,\" Josefik says.\n\nThe work involves examining the combination of generators with fuel cells, helping generators run at their most efficient point. Users also could turn the generators off at times and only use the fuel cell. For example, when soldiers need to sleep, they could turn off the generator so power flows silently. Fuel cells create no noise and generate little heat. However, before technologies deploy to forward operating locations, they have to be proven. Josefik says that deployed technologies must meet the highest standards to ensure the protection of warfighters. He explains that one reason some of these renewable technologies slowly make their way to forward operating bases is because they lack the robustness of technologies that have been in existence for long periods of time.\n\nAnother CERL project, currently in its final stages, is the Advanced Power and Energy Program conducted in conjunction with the University of California-Irvine. Military goals of the work include advancing the fuel flexibility of solid oxide fuel cell systems for Defense Department applications as well as investigating the performance and durability of hybrid fuel cell gas turbine systems for military applications. Another focus is on technology transfer from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to Defense Department deployment.\n\nA project just starting involves a partnership between the laboratory and the DOE. A broad agency announcement has gone out for installing backup power fuel cells for emergency operation of critical applications at federal facilities. CERL has identified 15 host sites at military locations and DOE laboratories. The partners still are reviewing applications and will begin installing the fuel cells over the next year. So far, about 75 have been identified for installation.\n\nCERL has worked with the host sites to have them determine the electrical loads they want to power during emergency situations. Josefik describes this as the \"spear point\" of rolling out more fuel cell technology. After those locations become familiar with the technology, he hopes to see a snowball effect in which CERL and its partners will install the power sources in many more locations.\n\nThough CERL focuses on installations, Josefik says the military and civilian sectors have many applications that could benefit from fuel cell use. Because they can produce energy ranging from microwatts to megawatts, fuel cells can apply to a variety of technologies. \"The possibilities are limitless,\" he states. One area of research involves making fuel cells portable enough so they could replace electrical batteries in almost any device, including laptops. Scientists also are studying the use of fuel cells in forklifts. \"Research is showing that dollar for dollar, they can compete against a battery-powered forklift,\" Josefik says.\n\nDuring an eight-hour shift, forklifts powered by battery lose speed and lifting capacity. Fuel-cell forklifts, on the other hand, maintain those capabilities. Locations that have multiple forklifts generally need twice as many batteries as machines so they can use one and charge another at the same time. Fuel cells could reduce that need. Another more common application for fuel cells is in motor vehicles. \"The research [question] is how do we get more of those in the field,\" Josefik explains. Researchers are debating a chicken-and-egg scenario, trying to determine whether to create the fueling stations or the vehicles first.\n\nLooking toward the future, Josefik says fuel-cell costs are decreasing thanks in part to continuous improvement in material durability. The materials also are becoming less expensive. \"There's been a lot of incremental progress,\" he explains. \"There hasn't been that whiz-bang iPod phenomenon with mass market presentation in the last year or couple of years.\" Rather, he adds, that time has been a period of continuous growth.\n\nIn addition to fuel cells, CERL's energy branch is researching other renewable technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines and a technology called a flow battery, which is an energy storage device. \"Fuel cells can be one part of an energy solution,\" Josefik says. Some of the research focuses on combining technologies to create better power systems. For example, solar power is intermittent, but if people use the sun to create hydrogen and then they store it, they can run a fuel cell during the night to supply continuous energy.\n\nOne of the focuses of CERL is to publish as much data about its experiments as possible. The laboratory makes information about renewable energy products available to the public so civilians can use the technologies. Josefik explains that when laboratory personnel deploy and test technologies, they monitor how well they work, how much they cost and how durable they are so they can feed the answers back to industry.\n\nCombining technologies also can serve as protection efforts. Josefik explains that laboratory personnel always examine security both of people on installations and of energy sources. By installing what is called distributed generation, experts can put electrical sources right at locations, eliminating power lines that are vulnerable to accident or attack. Generating power on site at stateside and forward operating locations also dispenses with the need to deliver fuel.\n\nBritain's hydrogen fuel cell car fleet may hit top gear within five years, but only if there is enough investment in filling stations, the UK Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Association (UK HFCA) told Reuters on Friday.\n\nFuel cells convert hydrogen into electricity, with heat and water being the only by-products, with a number of car makers including Toyota<7203.T>, Ford<F.N>, and Hyundai<005380.KS>, pushing to commercialise the low-carbon hybrid fuel cell vehicle by 2015.\n\n\"Somewhere around 2015 to 2017 we'll be over threshold and I think we'll see a larger and growing fleet,\" HFC chairman Dennis Hayter said.\n\n\"It's all aligned with the rollout of the infrastructure. In order to get to a semi-ubiquitous availability of hydrogen, then yes, you're talking may billions of pounds, but it doesn't have to come at once.\"\n\nHayter said fuel cell cars only take minutes to refill with a range of around 250 miles range. Plug-in electric vehicles take hours to recharge with a range of around 100 miles.\n\nExisting petrol filling stations could be converted, with hydrogen companies possibly leasing some of the pumps, while current hydrogen production capacity is seen as adequate for the next decade.\n\n\"You may find there's a deal to be made between the hydrogen gas and petroleum companies. Things are happening in the background and gradually a network is starting to appear,\" Hayter said.\n\n\"At present, the majority of hydrogen is derived from reforming of natural gas for industrial purposes such as refining and in chemicals.\n\n\"The quantities currently used and likely to be needed for transport in the next five to 10 years would still be minimal alongside hydrogen consumed for industrial use.\"\n\nFUEL COSTS\n\nFor the long term estimates of hydrogen costs, Hayter believes it will be competitive with petrol, or cheaper. Using U.S. hydrogen prices of $8 a kilogram, it would cost around $32 to fill up fuel cell car with a 250 mile range, he said.\n\n\"It's not comparing apples with apples, but if they're the long term costs, then it could be significantly cheaper but it depends on the fuel duty,\" Hayter added.\n\nThe UK HFCA is calling for hydrogen not to be taxed as a transport fuel, as petrol is, to help incentivise uptake.\n\nBritain has around 30 hydrogen fuel vehicles, mostly buses and taxi in London, with two filling stations in the city and another four expected by 2012, the UK HFCA said.\n\nSeen as a way to decarbonise the transport sector, Britain's former Labour government planned to subsidise low-carbon vehicle purchases from 2011, with a grant worth up to 5,000 pounds ($7,584).\n\nDisclaimer: This aggregation service is provided to all who visit this page and is non fee-based.\nIf you are a publisher and you do not want your publications linked here, please notify us and your links will be removed."

But, to date, the photovoltaic sheets cannot muster enough energy per square inch to make them attractive to manufacturers.\n\nThe UF team has crossed the critical threshold of 8 percent efficiency in laboratory prototype solar cells, a milestone with implications for future marketability, by using a specially treated zinc oxidepolymer blend as the electron charge transporting material. The full report outlining the details of their latest laboratory success in solar cell technology is published in the Dec. 18 online version of Nature Photonics.\n\nThe researchers said the innovative process they used to apply the zinc oxide as a film was key to their success. They first mixed it with a polymer so it could be spread thinly across the device, and then removed the polymer by subjecting it to intense ultraviolet light.\n\nJohn Reynolds, a UF professor of chemistry working on the project, said the cells are layered with different materials that function like an electron-transporting parfait, with each of the nano-thin layers working together synergistically to harvest the sun's energy with the highest efficiency.\n\nReynolds' chemistry research group developed an additional specialized polymer coating that overlays the zinc oxide polymer blend.\n\n\"That's where the real action is,\" he said.

The new fuel cells will help soldiers by lessening the number of batteries that they carry for missions lasting longer than 24 hours.\n\nDr. Cynthia Lundgren, chief of the electrochemistry Branch, discussed that fuel cell technology, which has the potential to lower the weight burden carried by soldiers, during a Oct. 21 webcast of \"Armed with Science: Research and Applications for the Modern Military.\"\n\nDepending on their role in the battalion, some soldiers may carry as much as 35 pounds of batteries with them for a 72-hour mission, Lundgren said. She'd like to see that weight reduced to 12 pounds.\n\nDr. Barry Spargo, head of the Chemical Dynamics and Diagnostics Department at the Naval Research Laboratory, discussed research related to the development of new and alternative sources of energy. As global first responders, the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps rely on readily available, reliable sources of energy to perform a variety of missions, and the vulnerability of energy supplies could jeopardize naval forces' ability to support forces afloat and ashore. The Department of the Navy's energy strategy aims to decrease U.S. naval forces' dependence on foreign fuel sources. Science and technology investments will provide many solutions.\n\nCol. Dave Belote, commander of the 99th Air Base Wing, will discuss one of the Air Force's most ambitious green initiatives, the Nellis Air Force Base Solar Array, which is comprised of more than 72,000 solar panels containing 6 million solar cells. The Nellis Solar Array took only three years of planning and 26 weeks to complete, and debuted as North America's largest renewable venture. The project, which was completed in December 2007, represents a public-private partnership between the Air Force, Sunpower Corporation, Nevada Power Company and MMA Renewable Ventures.\n\n Marc Mossburg, chief of curriculum at Department of Defense Education Activity and Kim Day, chief of science at DoDEA, said a shortage in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields creates opportunities for students. They discussed DoDEA's curriculum in a September 30 interview on the Pentagon Channel's weekly podcast, \"Armed with Science: Research and Applications for the Modern Military.\"\n\nMany of the best ideas for solving Warfighter challenges come from the Warfighters themselves. Unfortunately, these good ideas often get buried in the bureaucracy and never make it into the formal acquisition, research, and/or development processes. In 2004, a small team of ANG officers sought to correct this by \"data mining\" good ideas from front line Citizen-Airmen and then rapidly delivering inexpensive, high return-on-investment solutions.\n\nLt. Col. Edward Vaughan, deputy director of Air Force Blue Horizons, discusses how employing old technology in radically new ways can result in high yield solutions that challenge conventional thinking, thus breaking old paradigms and \"disrupting\" the bureaucracy. While such an approach is not suitable for all applications, it has proven effective in areas such as human factors, safety, energy, disaster relief, and ethics of technology.\n\nHow did you spend your summer vacation? We'll talk next to three students from the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) Schools who were selected to participate in the 2009 Research Science Institute (RSI) Program held from June through August at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nHusain Mogri, from Bahrain American School, Derrick Lewis, from Ramstein High School and Shannon Grammel, from Heidelberg American High School will join us to discuss their experiences working under the mentorship of eminent scientists and researchers. Sponsored by the Center for Excellence in Education, RSI is a six-week residential summer program where students attend college-level classes taught by distinguished professors; work with scientists, mathematicians, and engineers; and complete hands-on research with professionals at corporations, universities and research organizations.\n\nTwenty-one previous DoDEA students have participated in the RSI program. Student selectees have demonstrated superior achievement in math, the sciences, and verbal arts and show potential to become leaders in science. This program provides an opportunity for academically talented high school to become leaders in science, engineering, technology and mathematics.\n\nTwo seemingly unrelated U.S. Army organizations are gathering robotics experts and companies from across the country in search of innovative robotic solutions to save Soldier's lives. Fort Hood's III Corps and the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) – are hosting a first-ever \"Robotics Rodeo\" this week at Fort Hood to encourage development of autonomous systems in support of our Nation's war fighters. At 1400ET, on Sept. 9, Lt. Col. Barry \"Chip\" Daniels, Robotics Project Officer at III Corps, Ft.

      "text": "In her doctoral dissertation (Modelling Approaches to Mass Transfer and Compression Effects in Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells), M. Sc. (Tech.) Suvi Karvonen examines the local and cell level modelling of PEMs, or polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. Her dissertation, which will be examined at Aalto University, states that the functioning of PEM fuel cells can be substantially improved through a very simple modelling exercise.\n\nAccording to Karvonen, experimental research in many questions relevant to fuel cells is expensive and slow. Instead of manufacturing a number of cells and experimentally testing their functioning, different variations can be produced by modelling, which is much faster and less expensive. On the other hand, there are aspects that cannot be studied, not even by experimental methods.\n\nFor example, owing to the practical limitations of temperature sensors and current measurements, it is simply not possible to measure current density or temperature everywhere inside the cell, says Karvonen.\n\nCurrent density fluctuations may affect cell function negatively\n\nThe fuel cell modelling produced information on the distribution of cell compression pressure and its impact on cell function locally. The modelling results indicate that among others, transversal electric currents are generated locally in the cell. This phenomenon may have a negative impact on fuel cell function and life span.\n\nAccording to Karvonen, an irregular current density distribution causes uneven ohmic heating in the cell. As a result the Nafion membrane, or the cell electrolyte, at the core of the cell may dry out and become damaged.\n\nIn order for the cell to work, the Nafion membrane must be moist. Heating may dry out the membrane or burn a hole in it. In that case, the cell will leak fuel and oxygen through the hole and perish, or at least start working poorly, explains Karvonen.\n\nA fuel cell for an electric car?\n\nFuel cells are electrochemical devices producing electricity to which the reactant is fed from outside. The cells can be used to replace batteries, and plenty of research has already been conducted on their suitability for such applications as electric cars. The fuel cell could extend the distance an electric car can travel.\n\nIn a battery, all fuel must be contained inside the battery. In order for the car to travel a long distance, the batteries would need to be really large. This would make the car extremely heavy, and the batteries would not necessarily fit in the car. A fuel cell car, on the other hand, could go and fill up every now and then, as it is possible to feed more fuel into it, Karvonen illustrates.\n\nAccording to Karvonen, however, the current problem is the availability of fuel. The most common fuel used for the cells is hydrogen, which does not occur freely on earth. Storing hydrogen is also difficult."

The performance of Ni-cermet anodes with zirconia and ceria as the ceramic phase in SOFCs operating on hydrogen and ethanol is compared by means of current-voltage and impedance spectroscopy measurements in the 700–900°C temperature range. The experimental data indicate that the studied ethanol-fueled SOFCs have comparable performance. However, different ceramic matrix and metallic phase composition of cermets result in different behavior of the ethanol direct oxidation. Below 800°C, the performance of fuel cells is relatively more stable as compared to higher temperatures, but the catalytic activity for ethanol conversion of doped ceria is insufficient to prevent carbon formation. The experimental results provide evidence for the importance of an appropriate combination of fuel, operating conditions, and anode materials in designing SOFCs for direct operation using ethanol as fuel."

      "text": "8 March 2010\n\nSilicon Microwires: A Powerful Lesson in Technology Strategy\n\nAs the world's supplies of conventional energy sources run lower and the problems of greenhouse gas emissions have become better known, the business opportunities for alternative energy sources have skyrocketed.\n\nThe challenge with many of those opportunities, however, is that they often have significant environmental costs of their own that must be dealt with. As a well-known example, nuclear power, however clean it might be able to operate provided all safeguards are considered, still leaves a mass of nuclear waste to dispose of in the long term. As another example, the battery systems of hybrid cars may present toxic disposal problems at end of their lives — and become a costly accumulation as adoption rates for these kind of vehicles increase.\n\nThough these examples are fairly obvious, one of the surprises to many who begin to investigate the full lifecycle issues with many so-called \"green\" or \"low carbon footprint\" technologies is how dirty some of those really are, especially as compared to the amount of energy they can provide.\n\nAs one recent study looking at alternative energy in the U.K. recently noted, if you consider full lifecycle carbon footprint implications (including all emissions from initial manufacturing and/or harvesting of raw materials all the way to eventual waste disposal), direction combustion of grass (for bioreactor energy) contributed almost 80 grams CO2 per kWh of energy eventually delivered. On the other end of the spectrum, Nuclear Energy produced only around 5 grams CO2 per kWh of energy.\n\nPerhaps those numbers aren't a surprise, but one that certainly will be to me is that current Photovoltaic Cell technology is actually fairly high in carbon footprint, with some 58 grams of CO2 produced per kWh of energy for installations based in the U.K. (The reference to the U.K. location is because total energy produced by solar cells is a function of how much sunlight is available for the cells to receive.) Comparatively, then, using a so-called \"clean\" solar cell produces almost 75% of the CO2 that burning grass in biomass reactors would produce.\n\nWhy are the Photovoltaic numbers so high? Because it takes a great deal of energy to produce solar cells in the first place. Once produced, the carbon emissions are lower, but the carbon footprint is already established and the damage is done.\n\nTo improve on this, many companies and research facilities have investigated the making of ultra thin film Photocell technology, which of course lowers both costs and overall carbon footprint. According to the Department of Energy, conventional single-crystal silicon cells produce approximately 10 X the energy required to produce them. Multicrystalline silicon can produce between 12 X and 16 X the energy required to produce them, depending on whether or not they are in a ribbon form.\n\nThose are mportant steps forward, but perhaps one of the most exciting of recent strategic innovations in this field is the one recently announced by graduate student Michael Kelzenberg and other materials scientists at CalTech in the February 14th issue of Nature Materials. (See also the related Scientific American article about the same work.) Their system reforms silicon into vertical \"microwires\" of crystalline structures (shown in the attached picture here). These microwires, which also include embedded nanoparticles of aluminum oxide to reflect more light inside (and therefore increase the efficiency of the systems), capture as much as 85% of the available solar spectrum while requiring only around 1% of the silicon conventional wafers would need.\n\nThis is of course only an early result and will take some time before moving from the lab to production reality. It is, however, an example of how asking the right strategic question of precisely the right group of people can make the biggest possible business impact. We look forward to hearing how this breakthrough innovation develops over the next few years. It will likely make a major difference in all of our lives — and make this part of \"Green Technology\" even greener than ever before"

      "text": "Scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory have fabricated transparent thin films capable of absorbing light and generating electric charge over a relatively large area. The material, described in the journal Chemistry of Materials, could be used to develop transparent solar panels or even windows that absorb solar energy to generate electricity.\n\nThe material consists of a semiconducting polymer doped with carbon-rich fullerenes. Under carefully controlled conditions, the material self-assembles to form a reproducible pattern of micron-size hexagon-shaped cells over a relatively large area (up to several millimeters).\n\n\"Though such honeycomb-patterned thin films have previously been made using conventional polymers like polystyrene, this is the first report of such a material that blends semiconductors and fullerenes to absorb light and efficiently generate charge and charge separation,\" said lead scientist Mircea Cotlet, a physical chemist at Brookhaven's Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN).\n\nFurthermore, the material remains largely transparent because the polymer chains pack densely only at the edges of the hexagons, while remaining loosely packed and spread very thin across the centers. \"The densely packed edges strongly absorb light and may also facilitate conducting electricity,\" Cotlet explained, \"while the centers do not absorb much light and are relatively transparent.\"\n\n\"Combining these traits and achieving large-scale patterning could enable a wide range of practical applications, such as energy-generating solar windows, transparent solar panels, and new kinds of optical displays,\" said co-author Zhihua Xu, a materials scientist at the CFN.\n\n\"Imagine a house with windows made of this kind of material, which, combined with a solar roof, would cut its electricity costs significantly. This is pretty exciting,\" Cotlet said.\n\nThe scientists fabricated the honeycomb thin films by creating a flow of micrometer-size water droplets across a thin layer of the polymer/fullerene blend solution. These water droplets self-assembled into large arrays within the polymer solution. As the solvent completely evaporates, the polymer forms a hexagonal honeycomb pattern over a large area.\n\n\"This is a cost-effective method, with potential to be scaled up from the laboratory to industrial-scale production,\" Xu said.\n\nThe scientists verified the uniformity of the honeycomb structure with various scanning probe and electron microscopy techniques, and tested the optical properties and charge generation at various parts of the honeycomb structure (edges, centers, and nodes where individual cells connect) using time-resolved confocal fluorescence microscopy.\n\nThe scientists also found that the degree of polymer packing was determined by the rate of solvent evaporation, which in turn determines the rate of charge transport through the material.\n\n\"The slower the solvent evaporates, the more tightly packed the polymer, and the better the charge transport,\" Cotlet said.\n\n\"Our work provides a deeper understanding of the optical properties of the honeycomb structure. The next step will be to use these honeycomb thin films to fabricate transparent and flexible organic solar cells and other devices,\" he said.\n\nThe research was supported at Los Alamos by the DOE Office of Science. The work was also carried out in part at the CFN and the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies Gateway to Los Alamos facility. The Brookhaven team included Mircea Cotlet, Zhihua Xu, and Ranjith Krishna Pai. Collaborators from Los Alamos include Hsing-Lin Wang and Hsinhan Tsai, who are both users of the CFN facilities at Brookhaven, Andrew Dattelbaum from the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies Gateway to Los Alamos facility, and project leader Andrew Shreve of the Materials Physics and Applications Division.\n\nTwo sheets of the DuPont encapsulant surround and protect the module's sensitive silicon cells and circuitry, which is sandwiched between two 1.1-mm sheets of thin glass.\n\nThe new Fujipream module incorporates new innovative material technology from DuPont Photovoltaic Solutions and NSG Group to provide the strength, rigidity, resistance to impact and weatherability required to meet international module standards. The result is the world's thinnest commercially available glass-glass c-Si photovoltaic module.\n\nA key innovation is the use of DuPont PV5300 Series ionomer-based encapsulant sheets that replace traditional EVA-based encapsulants. The resulting laminate strength enables the thinner module to pass required load and hail tests, and thin glass replaces standard solar grade front glass and backsheet to provide a new lighter-weight glass-glass laminate structure.\n\nTwo sheets of the DuPont encapsulant surround and protect the module's sensitive silicon cells and circuitry, which is sandwiched between two 1.1-mm sheets of thin glass.\n\n\"The ionomer sheet's adhesion to glass is well-established from years of related experience in laminated structural glass. The high shear coupling of the glass layers via use of the ionomer encapsulant creates a composite-like module structure with strength comparable to a single piece of thicker glass.\n\nMinoru Amoh, president – DuPont Kabushiki Kaisha in Japan, sees the Fujipream module as a natural result of DuPont applying the power of its integrated science to help deliver clean solar power.\n\n\"DuPont is strategically focused on a thriving photovoltaic industry,\" said Amoh.\n\n\"We are applying our market-driven science to offer products and technologies that can transform the sun's potential into clean energy, and delivering growth through our market-leading position in materials.

Each team is escorted by a support team throughout.\n\n\"The team spirit is always very high despite a long and tiring day,\" Hiestermann said – and despite low points, like when the panels refused to charge the batteries and when their motor burnt out .\n\nFrom Pretoria last Wednesday, teams raced to Bloemfontein and from there to Cape Town, George and then Grahamstown, from where they left yesterday for Kokstad.\n\nThe Tokai Challenger has led the race since last week.\n\n\"We have to stick to the speed limit, but the Tokai Challenger has reached a speed of 145km/h and can theoretically clock 160km/h. It's the fastest solar-powered car in the world and we're very proud of it,\" Professor Hideki Kimura of the University of Tokai told The Herald in Plettenberg Bay earlier this week.\n\nAfter Richards Bay, they head for Badplaas – and then return to Pretoria on Saturday for prize-giving.\n\n\"We plan on improving our design and entering every challenge from now on,\" HiestermannUsing carbon nanotubes (hollow tubes of carbon atoms), MIT chemical engineers have found a way to concentrate solar energy100 times more than a regular photovoltaic cell.

They expect to bring it to the market within a year.\n\nRechargeable lithium-ion batteries are made up of two electrodes, a cathode and an anode. The movement of lithium ions from one to another is responsible for both the charging and discharging of the battery's energy.\n\nWhen charging, the lithium ions move from the cathode to the anode. The anode holds the lithium ions and stores that battery's energy. When the battery is used, the ions move from the anode to the cathode, discharging electrons and creating a current.\n\nThe tin anode is made by creating \"whiskers,\" some as long as 10 millimeters. These whiskers are observed on tin-plated electronics, causing a problem in microelectronics as they can cause short circuits.\n\nFor battery anodes however, the tin \"whiskers\" provide a storage capacity that exceeds that of the current anode material graphite.\n\nThe researchers grow the tin \"whiskers\" directly onto copper foil using a standard industrial process known as electroplating. Using this process also means the tin-based anode is easier and more cost-effective to produce than graphite anodes.\n\nThe end product battery will look exactly the same as current batteries, so manufacturers don't have to redesign their electronic devices.\n\nThe researchers were supported by the Washington State University College of Engineering and Architecture's Emerging Technology Fund. – EcoSeed Staff\n\nSolar quote provider Here at Solar Quote Provider we provide a central hub for consumers to search and compare renewable energy installers and find a wealth of information as well as direct access to our renewable energy experts."

Earlier this month, Lovley announced at a meeting that he and his colleagues were able to achieve a 10-fold increase in electrical output by allowing the bacteria in microbial fuel cells to grow on biofilms on the electrodes of a fuel cell.\n\nThis week, Gemma Reguera, a researcher in Lovley's lab will present data identifying for the first time how these bacteria are able to transfer electrons through the biofilms to the electrodes.\n\n\"Cells at a distance from the anode remained viable with no decrease in the efficiency of current production as the thickness of the biofilm increased.

Breathing new life into an old idea, MIT Institute Professor Mildred S. Dresselhaus and co-workers are developing innovative materials for controlling temperatures that could lead to substantial energy savings by allowing more efficient car engines, photovoltaic cells and electronic devices.\n\nNovel thermoelectric materials have already resulted in a new consumer product: a simple, efficient way of cooling car seats in hot climates. The devices, similar to the more-familiar car seat heaters, provide comfort directly to the individual rather than cooling the entire car, saving on air conditioning and energy costs.\n\nThe research is based on the principle of thermoelectric cooling and heating, which was first discovered in the early 19th century and was advanced into some practical applications in the 1960s by MIT professor (and former president) Paul Gray, among others.\n\nDresselhaus and colleagues are now applying nanotechnology and other cutting-edge technologies to the field. Shell describe her work toward better thermoelectric materials in an invited talk on Monday, Nov. 26, at the annual meeting of the Materials Research Society in Boston.\n\nThermoelectric devices are based on the fact that when certain materials are heated, they generate a significant electrical voltage. Conversely, when a voltage is applied to them, they become hotter on one side, and colder on the other. The process works with a variety of materials, and especially well with semiconductors the materials from which computer chips are made. But it always had one big drawback: it is very inefficient.\n\nThe fundamental problem in creating efficient thermoelectric materials is that they need to be very good at conducting electricity, but not heat. That way, one end of the apparatus can get hot while the other remains cold, instead of the material quickly equalizing the temperature. In most materials, electrical and thermal conductivity"

Image credit: Karen Gleason, MIT.\n\nTo demonstrate how a new fabrication technique can print solar cells on extremely thin, flexible materials, researchers from MIT have patterned solar cells onto ordinary toilet paper. While toilet paper may be an unlikely substrate for practical solar cell applications, it illustrates the versatility of the technique for low-cost printing on a wide variety of materials.\n\nKaren Gleason, a chemical engineering professor at MIT, along with graduate student Miles Barr and others, showed that the technique could be used to print solar cells on a variety of delicate materials. One example is rice paper, which is used to make spring rolls in restaurants and usually dissolves in wet processes. Since the researchers' technique is a dry, solvent-free process, the rice paper remains intact. The researchers also demonstrated the technique on plastic Saran wrap, which repels water and would normally be difficult to coat.\n\nThe new method, called oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD), involves spraying a vapor of a monomer and an oxidizing agent onto a substrate. The monomer and oxidizing agent polymerize when they meet and form PEDOT plastic. The plastic itself is conductive, but the conductivity can be further increased up to 1,000 times by controlling the substrate temperature so that small nanopores form, which can be laced with highly conductive silver particles.\n\nThe printed solar cells can also withstand a great deal of bending and stretching with minimal effect on their properties. In tests, the researchers bent a printed plastic substrate to a radius of less than 5 mm more than 1,000 times, and found that its efficiency was still 99% of what is was before bending. The electrodes could also be bent and stretched, and still retained their conductivity. To further demonstrate the method's robustness, Barr folded a piece of paper printed with solar cells into a paper airplane, and showed that the device still generated a current.\n\nMIT Professor Karen K. Gleason explains how graduate student Miles Barr folds a solar cell into a paper airplane. The research is part of the Eni-MIT Solar Frontiers Center. Video credit: MIT.\n\nAs the researchers noted, paper is not typically considered a good substrate for photovoltaics because it's not transparent. However, the ability to print solar cells at low-cost on flexible, stretchable materials could be very useful for making solar cells more widespread. Since the technique can also be used to print other electronic devices besides solar cells, it could be used for novel applications such as printing electronics on fabric and other flexible displays.\n\nRelated StoriesThe development of new electronic applications like thin-film solar panels, wearable displays and non-invasive biomedical devices, which require significant deformation to copy body movements, has heightened the need for ...\n\nIMEC has realized a single-junction GaAs solar cell on a Ge substrate with a record conversion efficiency of 24.7%. The efficiency was measured and confirmed by NREL (National Renewable Energy LaboratoryPrint out rolls of it on toilet paper and then wait until Halloween. Annoy some neighborhood kids until they TP your house and bam - you've eliminated installation costs.\n\nIf you did put it on something flexible you could wrap many structures like lamp posts and electrical poles (though I do wish people would bury the electrical lines more often). Solarizing (is that a word) things like street lights - even if they need to be hooked up to the grid for backup - could reduce the losses caused by transmission.\n\nIf they ever get wind power to become economically sensible (able to pay for itself without massive subsidies, solve maintenance and storage issues) they could wrap the turbine poles for some extra power. Since the wind turbines seem to have a beneficial effect on crops there would be an added insentive for farmers to use them.\n\nSo this technology should allow solar cells to be printed onto a plastic film that could be applied to windows in buildings or homes, enabling power generation wherever there is a window.\n\n...or automobiles or geodesic domes as stated.\n\nThis could be extremely useful in hydroponic greenhouses, because in some locations they get too much sunlight and need screens. It would be nice to have the \"screen\" be build into some of the plastic in the form of these solar cells, and then use the electricity to power water pumps or something else.\n\nvideo showed less than a micro amp at full light. what is efficiency of light conversion?\n\nIt's hard to say since their light source could be tuned perfectly to the wavelength that their cells respond to best, or they could have just used some typical light source that doesn't posses the wavelength needed to fully excite the cell. Also, without the voltage or resistance of the circuit known, we can't calculate the power being generated. Finally, I don't know exactly how much of the surface was actual working solar cell, so it's hard to calculate the per area power generated. But if you imagine multiple square meters of this stuff, it adds up pretty quickly.\n\nSeems that the trade off is: the more efficient something is at converting light to electricity, the more opaque it becomes...\n\nOf course, because it needs to _capture_ the energy in order to convert it. Any photon that is captured does not pass through (and hence cannot be seen on the other side). Transparent solar cells would need to restrict themselves to the UV or IR parts of the spectrum (because we don't see these wavelengths we wouldn't notice when they're missing)\n\nThe most energy of our sun is, however, in the visible spectrum. (Naturally we evolved to make use of just this part because it allows us to see the most energy and hence gather the most information about our environment)"

      "text": "It is common knowledge that an alternative to fossil fuels must be found. The search is on for a clean energy source and it looks like hydrogen could be the answer. However most of the hydrogen we use today comes from fossil fuels. It is the production method of the hydrogen that is the deciding factor as to whether the fuel is environmentally friendly or not. A European project has now developed a way to produce hydrogen from some of the greenest raw materials available: water and sunlight.\n\nAnthanasios Konstandopoulos (Director of the APT Lab, CPERI) is the head of the European project Hydrosol. The goal of the project is to produce hydrogen from exclusively renewable resources. Dr. Konstandopoulos is an expert in catalytic converters for car engines and has used his knowledge of this technology to produce hydrogen using a green method.\n\nHydrogen is the most abundant element on the Earth. The problem is that hydrogen is a very reactive atom, so it is hard to find as a free element. The most appropriate source of hydrogen is water. However the water molecule is one of the most stable molecule structures. It is therefore very difficult to break it up into hydrogen and oxygen.\n\nThese technical challenges have already been overcome. The hydrosol device was developed in Greece together with partners in Britain, Denmark and Germany. It uses the thermal content of solar energy to split the water molecule. The solar reactor is a ceramic body with many channels coated with a nano-material, through which water vapour flows. A set of mirrors is used to concentrate the solar energy, increasing the temperature in the reactor. With an efficiency of about 70%, the water vapour is converted into hydrogen. It is a wonderfully simple setup, a reactor with no moving parts.\n\nThe isolated hydrogen gas is then of great value to the automobile industry, but can also be used for many other devices (for example fuel cells, PCs, or as a battery). In the BMW Hydrogen 7 automobile the hydrogen is burnt in a modified internal combustion engine. The driver can switch between the petrol tank and the hydrogen tank. The required infrastructure to support the use of hydrogen as a fuel is gradually being developed. In Berlin, Germany, there are two hydrogen filling stations open to the public.\n\nHydrogen has a high potential to help us with the problem of global warming. The aim for this application of hydrogen is to replace carbon-based fuels, fossil fuels. If this can be achieved, the advantages will be clear: when driving a fuel cell car the only substance to come out of the exhaust pipe is water"

Well as we all know CO2 seems to be a bit of an issue right now. Copper has always had the wonderful property of converting COs to a hydrocarbon fuel when made into an electrode and provided with energy.\n\nOf course the process is not a miracle and it requires the energy input to convert but the product is methane which is a nice fuel substance that can be made portable and then given the output is CO2 and relatively clean it could be recycled through the process again to make more fuel and on and on.\n\nWhere would the energy come from? It doesnt really matter so much at this stage what is important is that the issue with this conversion was always that copper as we all know turns into that green color. That patina or oxidization is what has always limited this fuel cycle from being utilized.\n\nWell some smart folks over at MIT figured out a way to engineer copper and gold nanoparticles so that the properties of the copper were combined with the resistence of oxidation of gold to form something new.\n\nEverything is still very small and research based and there is a pretty high cost to rolling this out into production but I cannot help thinking about how harnessing solar energy to produce methane from CO2 in the atmosphere would lock up some of the CO2 that we have released into our environment. That CO2 would then live as permenantly as possible in that cycle over and over. The initial cost of this process might be steep but the cost spread over the amount of time would be well worth the investment. The article from MIT news above is really the place to go to get more details."

      "text": "Better Lithium Battery Is On the Way\n\nLithium-ion batteries are everywhere, in smart phones, laptops, an array of other consumer electronics, and the newest electric cars. Good as they are, they could be much better, especially when it comes to lowering the cost and extending the range of electric cars. To do that, batteries need to store a lot more energy.The anode is a critical component for storing energy in lithium battery.\n\nThe secret is a tailored polymer that conducts electricity and binds closely to lithium-storing silicon particles, even as they expand to more than three times their volume during charging and then shrink again during discharge. The new anodes are made from low-cost materials, compatible with standard battery manufacturers technologies. The research team reports its findings in Advanced Materials, now available online.\n\nHigh-capacity expansion\n\n\"High-capacity lithium-ion anode materials have always confronted the challenge of volume change -swelling -when electrodes absorb lithium,\" says Gao Liu of Berkeley Lab's Environmental Energy Technologies Division (EETD), a member of the BATT program (Batteries for Advanced Transportation Technologies) managed by the Lab and supported by DOE's Office of Vehicle Technologies.Says Liu, \"Most of today's lithium-ion batteries have anodes made of graphite, which is electrically conducting and expands only modestly when housing the ions between its graphene layers. Silicon can store 10 times more — it has by far the highest capacity among lithium-ion storage materials — but it swells to more than three times its volume when fully charged.\"\n\nThis kind of swelling quickly breaks the electrical contacts in the anode, so researchers have concentrated on finding other ways to use silicon while maintaining anode conductivity. Many approaches have been proposed; some are prohibitively costly.One less-expensive approach has been to mix silicon particles in a flexible polymer binder, with carbon black added to the mix to conduct electricity. Unfortunately, the repeated swelling and shrinking of the silicon particles as they acquire and release lithium ions eventually push away the added carbon particles. What's needed is a flexible binder that can conduct electricity by itself, without the added carbon.\n\nWhen Liu discussed the excellent performance of the PFs with Wanli Yang of Berkeley Lab's Advanced Light Source (ALS), a scientific collaboration emerged to understand the new materials. Yang suggested conducting soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy on Liu and Xun's candidate polymers using ALS beamline 8.0.1 to determine their key electronic properties.Says Yang, \"Gao wanted to know where the ions and electrons are and where they move. Soft x-ray spectroscopy has the power to deliver exactly this kind of crucial information.\"\n\nCycling for success\n\nHaving gone through one cycle of material synthesis at EETD, experimental analysis at the ALS, and theoretical simulation at MSD, the positive results triggered a new cycle of improvements. Almost as important as its electrical properties are the polymer's physical properties, to which Liu now added another functional group, producing a polymer that can adhere tightly to the silicon particles as they acquire or lose lithium ions and undergo repeated changes in volume.\n\nScanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy at the National Center for Electron Microscopy (NCEM), showing the anodes after 32 charge-discharge cycles, confirmed that the modified polymer adhered strongly throughout the battery operation even as the silicon particles repeatedly expanded and contracted. Tests at the ALS and simulations confirmed that the added mechanical properties did not affect the polymer's superior electrical properties.\n\nThe icing on the anode cake is that the new PF-based anode is not only superior but economical. \"Using commercial silicon particles and without any conductive additive, our composite anode exhibits the best performance so far,\" says Gao Liu. \"The whole manufacturing process is low cost and compatible with established manufacturing technologies. The commercial value of the polymer has already been recognized by major companies, and its possible applications extend beyond silicon anodes.\"Anodes are a key component of lithium-ion battery technology, but far from the only challenge. Already the research collaboration is pushing to the next step, studying other battery components including cathodes"

This renewable natural gas is a clean, carbon-neutral methane gas that can be used as a direct replacement for traditional natural gas to power the world, without drilling or fracking, while mitigating CO2 emissions.\n\n\"The sun is our greatest source of energy and a method to use this energy to make clean, renewable fuel is a very significant discovery,\" said Tim Young, CEO of HyperSolar. \"We intend to focus all our energies and resources on commercializing this breakthrough technology.\"\n\nInspired by the photosynthetic processes that plants use to harness the power of the sun to create energy molecules, HyperSolar is developing a novel solar-powered nanoparticle system that mimics photosynthesis to separate hydrogen from water. The free hydrogen can then be reacted with carbon dioxide to produce methane, the primary component in natural gas.\n\n\"With global consumption projected to surpass coal in 2035, natural gas will be the next great fuel,\" continued Young. \"From sunrise to sunset, our proprietary nanoparticles will work in a water-based solution to produce clean and environmentally friendly renewable natural gas that can be collected for later use in power plants, industrial plants and vehicles – anywhere and anytime.\"\n\nWith hundreds of billions of dollars already invested in natural gas infrastructure and trillions more dollars on the way, we believe natural gas as a primary fuel is a reality. However, the environmental risks associated with the extraction and usage of conventional natural gas is also a reality.\n\nUsing advanced nanotechnology, HyperSolar intends to eliminate the harmful aspects of extracting natural gas and preserve its existing delivery infrastructure and economy by fundamentally changing the source of natural gas from underground to above ground. The company intends to do this by creating natural gas above ground using sunlight, water and carbon dioxide, in a renewable and sustainable manner"

But critically, it seems the carbon particles (soot) generated during combustion are easily charged, and once charged they respond to electric fields in strange ways that affect the stability of the flame. Shake that stability hard enough, and the flame collapses.\"\n\nIf an electrical field can extinguish the flames, it offers an easily transportable method for extinguishing fires on jet fighters and submarines (and DARPA is backing research on the process). Building materials and their contents may be able to be saved from both the fire and from the water damage that often occurs from fire fighting. The system could also help reduce the use of fire retardant gasses such as Halon, which is a potent ozone-depletion causing gas.\n\nElectrical fire suppression also has the potential to be a very fast-acting system, which could also be a benefit for locations with especially sensitive contents. The effect also seems to be generated from a manageable level of power, which suggests that, in a few years, backpack sized gear may be available to fire fighters as an alternative to the hoses and foam sprayers.\n\nGreen roofs are a familiar concept among high-performance building designers and other EcoGeeks, but what about a mobile green roof moving through a city? A project called Bus Roots takes the idea of green roofs and installs it on a bus. The project is the graduate thesis of NYU student Marco Antonio Castro Cosio. A mobile science lab called Bio Bus is the host for this project.\n\nThe Bus Roots project uses an extensive green roof system similar to that used for buildings and covers the 340 square feet (31.6 square meters) of bus roof with shallow trays of plants in growth media.\n\nBringing a mobile patch of plants through the city offers a list of potential benefits, including mitigation of heat island effect, CO2 absorbtion, oxygen production, and aesthetic value. For those of you in or around New York City and are planning to attend the MakerFaire at the end of September, the Bio Bus is scheduled to appear at that event, and you may be able to see it in person.\n\nThe eighth largest economy in the world has a new carbon cap-and-trade program in place. And no, it's not a country in Europe, it's the State of California, which this week auctioned the rights to emit 60 million tons of carbon dioxide.\n\nThe California Air Rights Board auction serves to set a price on the emission of a ton of CO2. Companies can decide whether to invest in cleaner, more efficient systems, or can choose to pay for the right to pollute. As noted in the Marketplace report, \"We've been living in a world where there is no price on pollution,\" says Dan Kammen, a professor of energy policy at U.C. Berkeley. \"It doesn't send the right signals. It doesn't reward innovators.\"\n\nAbsent such a system, industry has been free to exhaust CO2 into the atmosphere without regard to impact on others. Establishing a market for carbon emissions will begin to put a price on that right, and to allow the true costs of carbon emissions to be more accurately reflected in the economy.\n\nThe California Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit to object to the auction, but the Air Rights Board believes that the auction will withstand legal challenge.\n\nA critique of the study in the New York Times by columnist and food writer Mark Bittman points out the weaknesses and oversimplifications in the study that have been used to \"debunk\" organic food based on criteria that are significantly immaterial to the organic label.\n\nBittman says of the study, \"[it] was like declaring guns no more dangerous than baseball bats when it comes to blunt-object head injuries. It was the equivalent of comparing milk and Elmer's glue on the basis of whiteness. It did, in short, miss the point.\" The other half of the conclusion of the study, \"Consumption of organic foods may reduce exposure to pesticide residues and antibiotic-resistant bacteria,\" was much more overlooked. that, as Bittman points out, \"you can claim that, based on nutrients, Frosted Flakes are a better choice than an apple.\"\n\nThe benefits of organic farming are numerous, and are far beyond relative comparison of the amount of some vitamin content. Not only are there potential individual benefits (the aforementioned reduced exposure to pesticide residue and so forth), but contributing to such broader environmental benefits as reduced pesticide use and more sustainable farming practices are also worthwhile goals.\n\nResearchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics have developed a method to break down old concrete debris into its constituents for better recycling and re-use of the material. The process, called electrodynamic fragmentation, uses very short pulses (less than 500 nanoseconds) of induced lightning to separate gravel from cement materials in concrete.\n\nConcrete is a material with a mixed environmental pedigree. Although its workability and durability make it extremely useful for a lot of purposes, it also has several drawbacks. There are the environmental impacts from the production of concrete, and it is also a major component of the materials going into landfills, so this makes the idea of recycling concrete a compelling one.\n\nAt present, most concrete recycling is merely to crush it and use it for sub-base under roads. This is better than landfilling it, but is a downcycling of the material. With the new lightning process, the aggregates can be more readily salvaged and re-used in new concrete.\n\nProduction of new cement from the recovered, separated material would be the ultimate goal of concrete recycling, since the production of cement is one of the single most intensive sources of CO2 emissions at present. While this process does not accomplish that, it does lay the way for that kind of recycling to become a possibility."

      "text": "UK scientists develop optimum piezoelectric energy harvesters\n\nMar 02, 2012\n\nScientists working as part of the Metrology for Energy Harvesting Project have developed a new model to deliver the maximum power output for piezoelectric energy harvesters.\n\nPiezoelectric materials convert electrical energy into a strain (or vice-versa). The best known use of piezoelectricity is for medical ultrasound.\n\nPiezoelectric energy harvesters utilise energy from unwanted mechanical vibrations, such as the rattling of an air conditioning duct or the movement of a bridge with passing traffic. Power levels are small, usually a few milli-watts or less, but the scavenged energy could be used to power autonomous devices such as wireless sensors.\n\nPiezoelectric energy harvesters are typically vibrating cantilevers, covered with a piezoelectric layer that converts mechanical strain to an electrical charge to power devices. Most developers cover the entire length of the cantilever with piezoelectric material in an attempt to maximise the conversion efficiency.\n\nHowever, scientists based at the UK's at National Physical Laboratory, one of seven national measurement institutes involved in the European Metrology Research Programme funded project have discovered that this approach is counterproductive. Their research shows that due to the charge redistribution across the cantilever there is an internal loss of power of up to 25% of potential output. To counter this the team has developed a model to show that more energy can be converted if the beam is only covered with piezoelectric for two thirds of its length.\n\nCurrent piezoelectric energy harvesting devices are used in applications such as wireless and battery-less light switches, and sensors. However, their potential applications range from the predictive maintenance of any moving or rotating machine parts, to electronic devices that harvest their own wasted operational energy to be more energy efficient.\n\nHarvesting energy that would otherwise be wasted is key to meeting future energy demands while reducing carbon emissions. This energy can come from light, heat, movement or vibrations.\n\nMarkys Cain, Knowledge Leader at NPL, said:\n\n\"The energy harvesting market was worth $605 million in 2010 but is predicted to reach $4.4 billion by the end of this decade. For the market to reach its true potential we need to develop the products that can guarantee a greater energy yield and drive industrial adoption of energy harvesting products. The work undertaken by the Functional Materials Group at NPL will do exactly that, providing a model for more efficient piezoelectric energy harvesting methods.\"\n\nThe research was originally published in Applied Physics Letters 100, 073901 (2012). Although the idea of harvesting ambient energy from the environment and using it to generate electricity is alluring, most of the technology so far is capable of generating only very small ...\n\nIMEC has fabricated an energy harvester to generate energy from mechanical vibrations by using micromachining technology. The harvester comes together with a model which can be used to optimize the deviceResearchers in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and the Materials Research Institute at Penn State are part of a multidisciplinary team of researchers from universities and national laboratories"

LOL Keep it up, this and another discovery about 130 percent efficiency from a quantum dot solar cell. Love it! Love it! Love it!!\n\nI think they should always notate efficiency as absolute (energy created from all energy available.) - Rather than calculating the efficiency of a cell from the portion of the spectrum that it utilizes.\n\nI remember my engineering school back in the 70's when computers first started coming into college campuses in computer rooms on green and black screens with 2 color grafix. Our highest aspiration other than beer was to own a HP35 calculator, and microsoft was not yet an itch in ole Bill's greedy palm. Back then the internet was called 'arpanet' and only colleges had limited access as much of it was 'culllassssified'. Friends of mine were building solar panels out of wood frames with enough copper tubing to make a half dozen moonshine stills, and the bottoms had to be larded with fiberglass insulation to keep the heat in and on the tubes. One idea was to face the collector with one way mirror glass so the light would come through the backwards facing glass and heat the water filled tubes, reflect off the foil facing on top of the insulation layer...and reflect back and forth from the inside of the mirror glass to the foil..lather ...rinse ...repeat. Yeah we cum a long way since.\n\nI remember playing with an HP35 back in my university days. It was about the size of a microwave oven, had a 4 inch CRT display that showed all three levels of it's internal stack, recorded programs on a magnetic card about the size of a credit card, and had a fertite core memory.\n\nThe one I played with was connected to a plotter with a bundle of wires about 3 cm in diameter.\n\nYou know I was in chip design for two decades so I also started out with PDP 8s,11s, and the mighty PDP10, all great stuff.\n\nThe fact that computers today are literally millions times faster, cheaper, less power, just doesn't apply to solar power in the same way. Computers benefit from the reduction in feature sizes on an exponential curve going from 10u down to 20nm. The reduction in silicon wafer costs is a tiny part of that, silicon substrates are cheap but have very high energy content.\n\nA PV panel is nothing but a very large no of simple diodes on a large substrate using very course features. The cost of making substrates has declined much slower than you think mostly due to China using dirty coal to make this.\n\nNow the extra equipment needed like the grid tie inverters does benefit from the huge sale of PC switching PSUs to get them close to 50c/W peak. Inverters are PSU the other way around. Without PCs, solar panels and inverters would cost far more, but not zillions more.\n\nYou are talking about solar thermal collectors which is probably a far better value than solar PV for most home owners, and its a better way to exploit the available insolation, but then peeps want electrical too. The Carter Whitehouse had these on the roof top and not the PVs.\n\nThe really good tubes from Germany though don't seem to be that cheap. In Israel I think solar thermal on roofs is mandated on new homes"

Investigators are now exploring on the possibility of making battery life longer and recharging time shorter. This means more efficient gadgets with a reduction in power drains.\n\nAt the University of Illinois, a team of engineers is now designing more efficient devices that can survive without a recharge every other day or so. The scientists say the key to redesigning lies on the primary reason for the power drain-memory. Most modern electronic gadgets work using flash memory; bits of data are stored in this memory in the form of an electric charge. This activity, however, requires high voltage and often leads to fast power drainage. Eric Pop and other engineers are exploring alternatives for flash memory, which can eventually sustain gadgets with longer power, thus leading to energy efficiency and a reduced need to recharge.\n\nThe PCM\n\nThe research team introduces a new type of memory called Phase Change Materials or PCM. In this type of memory, running electric currents through nanowires produces heat. This then switches the wire between two states. This type of memory has the promise for a more efficient energy use compared to flash memory.\n\nThere are even more efficient types of PCM, says Eric Pop. PCMs that use carbon nanotubes; which are series of minute, atomic chains, can be used instead of metal wires. These types of tubes are believed to change the way memory will be accessed for the coming decades. The research team already tested a number of these new types of memory. The results confirmed that this type of technology only utilizes 1% of the power used today.\n\nThe Carbon Nanotube\n\nWhat are carbon nanotubes? They are simply tiny tubes composed of chains of carbon atoms. The carbon atoms form a pattern similar to a honeycomb, this pattern serves as the structure for the tube's walls. This pattern makes the walls stronger even if its size is reduced. The size of these carbon nanotubes is almost similar to human DNA, which is comparable to the size of the human hair, smaller by 10,000 times.\n\nThe concept of carbon nanotubes is not something new. In fact research had been conducted before to explore the possible use of these strong yet miniscule tubes. Carbon nanotubes have been a focal interest because of its strength, flexibility, and lightness. Fuel filter housing for Audi's A4 and A5 models and high quality tennis rackets already utilizes these nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes also caught the attention of NASA, and they are now exploring on how to use the material for creating a cable that can eventually support a space elevator.\n\nWhen it comes to electronic gadgets and memory, these nanotubes serve as excellent conductors. Copper wires can never be shrunk to the size of these nanotubes, disabling it to conduct electricity well. Size is another advantage, as a smaller contact point in the memory means less energy is needed for power.\n\nThe Future: Carbon Nanotubes in iPods, Smart phones and Tablets\n\nThe potential use of carbon nanotubes in electronic gadgets seem promising, but Pop says it will still take years before this technology can be applied to electronic gadgets such as iPods, mobile phones, tablets, etc. The technology is compared to what silicon was during the 1960s.

Based on this the total amount of space required for holding all 80 different versions of the video at standard compression ratios is about 2.8GB.Spreading this storage with a triple redundancy across a maximum of 30 locations must then cost YouTube only about $2.20 – at an estimated cost of $0.025 for each GB.\n\nNext Mr Pradhu works out the cost of streaming the encoded files, which at the time he made his calculations had been viewed around 530million times. Based on broadband and 3G network penetration rates, Mr Pradhu guesses that 63 per cent of users watch the videos in high resolution while the rest watch in lesser formats.\n\nBased on that, he comes up with estimates of 24PB total bandwidth consumed to stream in high resolution and 2.19PB total bandwidth for low resolution screening. At a cost of $10,485 per petabyte to stream, that means the company has spend a total of $251,658.24 for streaming in high resolution and a further $22,963.81 for low resolution.\n\nBut that's not the end of Google's costs. The total that its YouTube business has spent hosting the static pages on which their videos are embedded also has to be taken account. Mr Pradhu says that a standard YouTube page weighs in at about 580kb, plus another 900kb for thumbnails and other static resources.\n\nA lot of other variables like user login management and recommendations involve back end services, which means this costs more to serve up than purely streaming videos, so Mr Pradhu estimates that the cost to YouTube was about $0.03 per GB.Mr Pradhu's revenue estimate for the song is based on the YouTube revenue sharing model for contributors. He estimates earnings average $0.46 per thousand views which, if YouTube takes 100 per cent, means it has raked in $348,285.\n\nMr Pradhu admits that his answer roughly estimates a huge number of variables, and he says he doubts that even Google itself could not give an accurate answer of the profit garnered from just one video.\n\n'The type and energy costs of the infrastructure are closely guarded trade secrets of Google as that is how they gain a competitive advantage,' Mr Pradhu writes.\n\n'The networking gear purchase/sourcing/operation wars between Google, Facebook, and Amazon are stories of delight and are shaping the energy needs of these companies, and very little about these are public knowledge, which means we cannot determine an accurate number unless someone from Google does a lot of digging and makes the info public.'\n\nWith a total size of the pages distributed for Gangnam Style adding up to 724,609.37GB, he calculates the cost of the distribution of these pages at $21,738.28.\n\n]]> Chatroulette\n 24 Sep 2012 20:21:19 +0000vlajca been done by the Harvard baseball team, \"President Obama\" and even Cookie Monster. It's been done in so many ways by so many people that we thought — surely — it'd be categorically impossible to make a \"Call Me Maybe\" parody that was still funny.\n\nBut Steve Kardynal (of shake weight fame) has proved us wrong.\n\nIn this cringe-worthy YouTube video, Kardynal — lipsticked, bearded and scantily clad in women's garb — shimmies and shakes in front of a Chatroulette crowd that alternates between delighted reactions and those of utter disgust.\n\nKardynal, known for his outlandish antics, is in top form as he lip-syncs and gyrates his way through Carly Rae Jepson's hit song, but the other users on the online chat website (and their priceless reactions) are the true stars of the clip.\n\nAnd though we know that the world probably doesn't need any more \"Call Me Maybes,\" the grimaces of all those shirtless men sitting in half-dark rooms makes this one well worth it.\n\n]]> network for Muslims – Salamworld\n 05 Sep 2012 12:22:43 +0000vlajca is a global social network based on Islamic idea of \"collaboration\". Salamworld allows to express your individuality through different communities. Salamworld is the chance for every user to claim about its social integrity and interests.\n\nThis is one of the ways the new social network, called Salamworld, hopes to make it easier to connect Muslims around the world.\n\nIn Malaysia, Muslims make up the majority of the population of 29 million people, about 60% of whom are internet users.\n\nBesides this South East Asian country, a trial version of Salamworld is currently being tested by about 1,000 users in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Turkey, Egypt and Indonesia.\n\nLocal rules\n\nIt is not the first attempt to create a Muslim-tailored social network, but so far none has become popular on a large scale.\n\nFinland-based Muxlim.com came out in 2006, but is currently shut down. Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood launched Ikhwanbook.com in 2010 but the site is also currently offline.\n\nCritics say that these networks tended to appeal only to their respective regions.\n\nSalamworld, based in Turkey but with advisers from more than a dozen countries, hopes to be different.\n\nOne way it aims to achieve the goal of uniting Muslims globally is by using a three-level content-filtering feature.\n\nIt will allow authorities to set content guidelines based on different interpretations of Islam, which vary from country to country. For example, a picture of a Muslim woman who is not wearing a hijab may be fine in secular Indonesia but not acceptable in Saudi Arabia.\nA person using Facebook Salamworld wants to rival Facebook and other Western social networks\n\nIt is not clear how internet users will react to such censorship – in Malaysia, for instance, attempts to control the web have been met with fierce opposition.\n\nEarlier this month, politicians and activists staged an internet blackout day to protest against changes in the law they say aimed to stifle free speech online.\n\nSome Malaysians, however, say they will tolerate a certain degree of censorship, such as filtering out photos of skimpy outfits or alcohol ads, which are against Islamic values.\n\n\"But if they are censoring things for political reasons, like to prevent us from seeing the real situation in Syria or the violence committed against Muslims in Burma, then that is not OK,\" says another student, Abdul Hadi bin Haji.\n\n]]> Trucks – The Ballerina Stunt\n 25 Aug 2012 11:21:10 +0000vlajca say that stunts promoting brands are becoming popular.

Did she make it before the trucks reach the tunnel that lies behind the next bend?\n\nWhat a piece of advertising… who ever said it should be boring to market trucks!?\n\nThe stunt was set up to show the precise handling of the new Volvo FH. Created in cooperation with Hollywood stunt director Peter Pedrero (James Bond, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean) and directed by Academy Award nominee Henry Alex Rubin.\n\nAir travel has become so popular that you will hardly find a place on earth, where you cannot reach by air.

These are indeed world's most difficult landing approaches. It needs a lion's heart or Instrument Landing to land an aircraft there.\n\nHere I have compiled 5 most difficult and dangerous landing approaches of the world\n\nSaba Island Airport, Netherlands Antilles\n\nThe locals claim that this is the shortest commercial airport runway in the world. There are not any overrun areas on either end of the paved runway where sheer cliffs immediately drop off over 200 feet into the sea.\n\nLugano Airport, Switzerland\n\nLugano-Agno's instrument approach procedure is quite challenging because of its steep angle of descent of 6.65°which is double of the standard approach. This is due to its geographic location in the mouth of a valley.\n\nNarsarsuaq Airport, Greenland\n\nNarsarsuaq Airport is located in Narsarsuaq, in southern Greenland. The lake at the end of the runway and steep cliffs makes it difficult to land even for skilled pilots.\n\nPrincess Juliana Airport, Saint Maarten\n\nThe airport is famous for its short runway at only 2,400 meters it is barely long enough for heavy jets to land. Therefore, incoming airplanes approaching the island have to fly extremely low, passing only 10-20 meters over relaxing tourists on Maho Beach.\n\nCourchevel Airport, France\n\nCourchevel's airport has a certain degree of infamy in the aviation industry as home to one of the shortest runways in the world. The airport has a dangerous approach through deep valleys which can only be performed by specially certified pilots"

The efficiency is of a comparable level to real plants used in the biomass energy source.\n\nThe reaction rate is completely proportional to the light power due to the low energy loss with simple structure; in other words, the system can respond to focused light. This will make it possible to realise a simple and compact system for capturing and converting wasted carbon dioxide from incinerators and electric generation plants.\n\nCarbon dioxide is one of the substances responsible for greenhouse effect and as such, efforts are being made to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide worldwide. The problem of carbon dioxide is also directly connected to an issue of the depletion of fossil fuels.\n\nArtificial photosynthesis is the direct conversion from carbon dioxide into organic materials, which would be able to solve both of these problems, according to Panasonic."

      "text": "Broadly speaking, there have been two approaches to capturing the sun's energy: photovoltaics, which turn the sunlight into electricity, or solar-thermal systems, which concentrate the sun's heat and use it to boil water to turn a turbine, or use the heat directly for hot water or home heating. But there is another approach whose potential was seen decades ago, but which was sidelined because nobody found a way to harness it in a practical and economical way.\n\nThis is the thermo-chemical approach, in which solar energy is captured in the configuration of certain molecules which can then release the energy on demand to produce usable heat. And unlike conventional solar-thermal systems, which require very effective insulation and even then gradually let the heat leak away, the heat-storing chemicals can remain stable for years.\n\nResearchers explored this type of solar thermal fuel in the 1970s, but there were big challenges: Nobody could find a chemical that could reliably and reversibly switch between two states, absorbing sunlight to go into one state and then releasing heat when it reverted to the first state. Such a compound was discovered in 1996, but it included ruthenium, a rare and expensive element, so it was impractical for widespread energy storage. Moreover, no one understood how the compound worked, which hindered efforts to find a cheaper variant.\n\nNow researchers at MIT have overcome that obstacle, with a combination of theoretical and experimental work that has revealed exactly how the molecule, called fulvalene diruthenium, accomplishes its energy storage and release. And this understanding, they said, should make it possible to find similar chemicals based on more abundant, less expensive materials than ruthenium.\n\nEssentially, the molecule undergoes a structural transformation when it absorbs sunlight, putting the molecule into a higher-energy state where it can remain stable indefinitely. Then, triggered by a small addition of heat or a catalyst, it snaps back to its original shape, releasing heat in the process. But the team found that the process is a bit more complicated than that.\n\n\"It turns out there's an intermediate step that plays a major role,\" said Jeffrey Grossman, the Carl Richard Soderberg Associate Professor of Power Engineering in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. In this intermediate step, the molecule forms a semistable configuration partway between the two previously known states. \"That was unexpected,\" he said. The two-step process helps explain why the molecule is so stable, why the process is easily reversible and also why substituting other elements for ruthenium has not worked so far..\n\nIn effect, explained Grossman, this makes it possible to produce a \"rechargeable heat battery\" that can repeatedly store and release heat gathered from sunlight or other sources. In principle, Grossman said, a fuel made from fulvalene diruthenium, when its stored heat is released, \"can get as hot as 200 degrees C, plenty hot enough to heat your home, or even to run an engine to produce electricity.\"\n\nCompared to other approaches to solar energy, he said, \"it takes many of the advantages of solar-thermal energy, but stores the heat in the form of a fuel. It's reversible, and it's stable over a long term. You can use it where you want, on demand. You could put the fuel in the sun, charge it up, then use the heat, and place the same fuel back in the sun to recharge.\"\n\nIn addition to Grossman, the work was carried out by Yosuke Kanai of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Varadharajan Srinivasan of MIT's Department of Materials Science and Engineering, and Steven Meier and Peter Vollhardt of the University of California, Berkeley. Their report on the work, which was funded in part by the National Science Foundation and by an MIT Energy Initiative seed grant, was published on Oct. 20 in the journal Angewandte Chemie.\n\nThe problem of ruthenium's rarity and cost still remains as \"a dealbreaker,\" Grossman said, but now that the fundamental mechanism of how the molecule works is understood, it should be easier to find other materials that exhibit the same behavior. This molecule \"is the wrong material, but it shows it can be done,\" he said.\n\nJeffrey Grossman explains how this material can be used to store and release energy in the form of heat. Video: Jeffrey C. Grossman; additional editing: Melanie Gonick\n\nThe next step, he said, is to use a combination of simulation, chemical intuition, and databases of tens of millions of known molecules to look for other candidates that have structural similarities and might exhibit the same behavior. \"It's my firm belief that as we understand what makes this material tick, we'll find that there will be other materials\" that will work the same way, Grossman said.\n\nRoman Boulatov, assistant professor of chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said of this research that \"its greatest accomplishment is to overcome significant challenges in quantum-chemical modeling of the reaction,\" thus enabling the design of new types of molecules that could be used for energy storage. But he adds that other challenges remain: \"Two other critical questions would have to be solved by other means, however. One, how easy is it to synthesize the best candidates? Second, what is a possible catalyst to trigger the release of the stored energy?\"\n\nGrossman plans to collaborate with Daniel Nocera, the Henry Dreyfus Professor of Energy and Professor of Chemistry, to tackle such questions, applying the principles learned from this analysis in order to design new, inexpensive materials that exhibit this same reversible process. The tight coupling between computational materials design and experimental synthesis and validation, he said, should further accelerate the discovery of promising new candidate solar thermal fuels.\n\nHow does fulvalene diruthenium's energy density compare with hydrocarbon fuels. Can its rate of release be controlled?\n\nIs cost currently the only barrier to commercial use?\n\nJose Hernandez\n\nTekton\n- Solar Residential Apps\n\n2010-11-02 07:18:37\n\nJeffrey,\nThis appears to be a milestone innovation in solar energy application.\n\nIs the FD system potentially applicable to residential applications?

      "text": "Nanocables could lead to more powerful lithium-ion batteries\n\nJan 28, 2010 by Lisa Zyga\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- By itself, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a very poor electrode. Electrons move very slowly through the material - so slowly, in fact, that it can take years to fill a millimeter-thick piece of TiO2. However, things change when the TiO2 is extremely thin: a 10-nm-thick piece of TiO2 can be filled with electrons in milliseconds. Inspired by this ability, scientists have recently investigated whether TiO2 could be useful for fabricating high-capacity batteries.\n\nA team of scientists, Fei-Fei Cao, et al., from institutions in China and Germany, have found that applying a thin coat of TiO2 to the outside of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can create coaxial nanocables. The nanocables can then be formed into a crystalline solid that turns out to be very good at trapping lithium ions and quickly transporting electrons - much better than either TiO2 or CNTs on their own.\n\n\"On one hand, the CNT core provides sufficient electrons for the storage of lithium in the TiO2 sheath,\" the researchers wrote in a study published in Chemistry of Materials. \"On the other hand, the CNT itself can also store lithium whereby this storage kinetics is, in turn, improved by the presence of the nanoporous TiO2 … [which] enables rapid access of lithium-ions from the liquid electrolyte.\"\n\nThese symbiotic advantages could directly lead to improvements in lithium-ion batteries that use nanocable-based anodes. The researchers found the new anodes offer improvements in storage capacity, release rate, and cycling performance compared with either pure CNT or pure TiO2. The nanocables also had good reliability, showing almost no capacity loss after one hundred cycles.\n\nThese abilities are also competitive with graphite-based anodes, which are commonly used in today's lithium-ion batteries. Plus, the nanocables are easy to produce and made of inexpensive materials, which could make them attractive for commercial use.\n\n\"This fascinating symbiotic behavior and the fact that the cable morphology leads to an efficient use of this symbiosis makes this solution match the requirements of lithium-ion batteries extremely well,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nThe scientists hope that this demonstration of the synergistic benefits of hybrid materials might motivate further research in using hybrid materials for other energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nResearchers in Spain and the United Kingdom are reporting development of a new electrode material that could ease concerns about the safety of those unbiquitous lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, while giving Li-ion batteries ...\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Researchers have found a way to incorporate silicon into the structure of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which are used to power a wide variety of portable electronic devices, including ...\n\nThe next generation of electric and hybrid cars may be a step closer thanks to new and improved polymer membranes that allow the development of bigger, safer, and more powerful lithium ion batteries, according to an article ...\n\nNeed to store electricity more efficiently?

      "text": "Rensselaer Pioneers Hydrogen Storage and Graphene Composites\n\nResearch Summary Groundbreaking research currently being conducted at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is helping to contribute toward energy efficiency and the growth of the hydrogen-powered vehicle, a leading candidate for green cars. Recently, the Nanostructured Materials and Devices Lab at Rensselaer has been focusing their research on graphene, a two-dimensional carbon-based sheet capable of storing hydrogen at levels far exceeding that of any other material currently available. Graphene's main component – graphite – is available at a cost low enough to allow bulk manufacturing, and its potential for use in hydrogen vehicles and many other polymer composite products is promising.\n\nCurrent Research For hydrogen-powered vehicles to replace the conventional oil- and gas-powered ones, four major challenges must be addressed – distribution, production, energy conversion and storage. The specialized research team within Rensselaer's Department of Mechanical, Aerospace and Nuclear Engineering is addressing the challenge of storage; their tests with graphene have found a storage capacity of 14% by weight at room temperature, far surpassing the Department of Energy's goal of 9% capacity by 2015. This means that engineered graphene can store, absorb and release more hydrogen molecules at a lower cost and higher efficiency than ever before.\n\nGraphene is called the strongest and thinnest of materials, with a density of more than six times that of copper. It is a layer of carbon one atom thick; it is mass-producible; and because it is carbon-based, it is available in abundance. Rensselaer's work on graphene enhancement sought to strengthen materials to which the carbon-based material could be added, such as composites, and their results show an improved resistance to fatigue crack propagation.\n\nThe Rensselaer team discovered three advantages of graphene that ensure its future in several electrical and mechanical processes. First, its rough and wrinkled surface texture enhances its ability to interlock with surrounding polymer materials, giving strength to an infused composite. Secondly, compared to carbon nanotubes, graphene planar sheets offer a considerably higher surface area to be in contact with a polymer composite, further enhancing its strength. And lastly, small, micro-cracks in a composite structure can be deflected by the two-dimensional graphene sheet surrounding it, absorbing energy that could otherwise lead to breaks and cracks.\n\nFuture Developments The research team is hopeful that advanced composites infused with graphene can become an integral component in new windmill blades and aircraft, as well as several other applications with similar lightweight demands. Javad Rafiee, a Ph.D. candidate in mechanical engineering, is focusing his research on applying graphene sheets to the inside of hydrogen storage tanks for next-generation automobiles. Cheap yet strong, graphene is beginning to make its way into commercial applications and transition from the lab to the marketplace. Future plans at Rensselaer include partnering with private business. Once Rafiee finishes his graduate research, he hopes to start a business focused on clean energy and green manufacturing.\n\nTeam Nikhil Koratkar, professor in the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace and Nuclear Engineering, heads Rensselaer's Nanostructured Materials and Devices lab. Mechanical engineering Ph.D. candidate Javad Rafiee is one of the leading researchers on the team and recently was awarded a $30,000 Lemelson-MIT Rensselaer Student Prize for his work with hydrogen storage tanks and graphene. Mechanical engineering Ph.D. candidate Mohammad Ali Rafiee, Javad's brother, is another leading researcher on the team and was recently awarded the 2010 International Robert L. Lichten Award from American Helicopter Society (AHS) for his breakthrough in graphene nanocomposites for the aerospace industry."

The main one is the layer that absorbs the light and transforms it into electricity.\n\n\"If these absorbers are not processed immediately they lose part of their ability to convert light energy,\" says researcher David Regesch of the Laboratory for Photovoltaics, Physics Research Unit at the University of Luxembourg.\n\nResearchers measured the light that is released by a solar cell when a laser is shone on it, and found that the degradation happens within the first few minutes. They also found that the degradation is reversible and prevented by quickly placing another layer on the solar cell. This makes the solar cell stable.\n\nIn the photovoltaics industry, solar cells are processed as fast as possible for economic reasons, and now scientists have shown a physical reason why this process should be completed quickly. This study was recently published in Applied Physical Letters and chosen as a research highlight.\n\nChina denounces solar tariffs Beijing (UPI) Oct 11, 2012\nChina has denounced the U.S. decision to raise tariffs on imports of solar panels by Chinese companies.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department on Wednesday said Chinese producers and exporters have sold solar cells in the United States at dumping margins ranging from 18.32 percent to 249.96 percent.\nCommerce said it would impose anti-subsidy \"countervailing duties\" against solar cell imp"

The new MEMS, (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) discovery will allow video camera batteries to increase their charging life approximately 2-1/2 times, consume 1/5th of the energy of disc storage and store 1-Tb on a postage stamp size device. Dr. Khatib expects this new technology to be available to the public within the next five-years.\n\nMEMS technology is currently used in iPhone and Wii devices. Dr. Khatib's MEMS technology differs insofar as it optimizes the technology for use as a data storage device. The high-end Green technology discovery is less expensive to produce. The cost to operate will be cheaper than any other known memory device available for mobile devices. Dr. Khatib's discovery is as effective as flash memory, but more cost-effective in all respects.\n\nAccording to the University of Twente spokesperson, \"this new green storage technology with extremely high data densities has shown experimentally a storage density of 4Tb/in2 in a demonstration. In effect this means that when this technology is fully developed, it will be possible for a storage device to be reduced to the size of a fingernail, with a capacity of 1 Tb, (200 DVDs) and energy consumption remains extremely low. Thereby, MEMS combines the advantages of a disc (inexpensive) and a memory card (energy efficient).\"\n\nNearly everyone is familiar with digital still or video cameras. Video cameras often use storage on a disc such as a DVD (disk storage). Cameras often store their data on a memory card, such as a flash card (flash memory). Both methods have their own disadvantage. The cost of disk storage requires a lot of energy and the battery must be recharged often. Storage on a memory card is costly. Dr. Khatib's method combines the best of both worlds and delivers a product which has low energy consumption with the advantages of high-density data storage on a low cost disc.\n\nDr. Khatib received his PhD on June 11, 2009 from the TU Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science and the Centre for Telematic and Information Technology under the supervision of Professor Pieter Hartel and Dr. Leon Abelmann.

And through the use of titanium dioxide nanotubes, the battery's operational capacity gradually increases over time.\n\nBut how does this work? As it turns out, the group, led by nanoscientist Tijana Rajh and battery expert Christopher Johnson, discovered that these titanium dioxide nanotubes can \"switch their phase as the battery is cycled\". What this means is that the structures orient themselves to improve the way that energy flows through them. In the video below, you can see the structure \"evolve\" or become less random to improve efficiency.\n\nIn the past, the US Department of Energy and other groups have done related research with nanotubes and graphene due to their unique physical and electrochemical properties. In 2010, The U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory made a unique discovery involving graphene that could allow batteries to charge in a matter of minutes.\n\nHowever, unlike the graphene research where the graphene remains stationary, Argonne's nanotubes are actually capable of self-orienting.\n\nArgonne notes that there is some level of plasticity to the system that allows the structures to move about and therefore improve their own performance. In other words, this new technology is a significant breakthrough because it's a self-improving structure.\n\nAccording to an Argonne chemist, Jeff Chamberlain, this is a highly unusual behavior for a material. As Chamberlain says in the press release, \"We're seeing some nanoscale phase transitions that are very interesting from a scientific standpoint, and it is the deeper understanding of these materials' behaviors that will unlock mysteries of materials that are used in electrical energy storage systems.\"\n\nSo far, Argonne has done a number of tests with the titanium dioxide nanotubes and lithium-ion battery technology that show that the nanotubes not only improve the speed at which the batteries charge, but they also improves the reliability and safety of the batteries.\n\nThe new technology might also be used for sodium-ion batteries in the time to come; one researcher, Sanja Tepavcevic, has already adopted the technology to make a sodium-ion nanobattery. Someday this technology may reach your laptops, smartphones, and other electronic device,s giving you more time to do what you want without forcing you to stand next to an outlet."

The process transfers hot electrons from quantum dots to an electron acceptor. In typical semiconductor solar cells, photons with energies above the semiconductor's bandgap generate hot electrons, and much of the energy from the hot electrons is lost through heat before it can be captured and used for electricity. This new process uses quantum dots to slow down the cooling process of hot electrons and then captures and transfers them. This allows the addition of energy that is currently lost as heat in conventional solar cells.\n\n\"This is a dramatic leap forward in making solar power more cost efficient,\" states Robert Hines, president of Evolution Solar Corp., Tempe, Ariz. \"This has the potential to double solar power output and cut solar payback times in half.\"\n\nEvolution Solar is currently building a solar demonstration site in partnership with Texas Southern University, to be located at the University's Houston campus.

On the other, we have silicon - an abundant material made from sand and the front-runner as the material most likely to be used in photovoltaic cells for your solar energy panels. Between the simplicity of silicon and the broad spectrum of sunlight, falls the innovation.\n\nAs oil reserves deplete and energy prices rise, solar power is emerging as an essential source of clean, affordable energy. The scientific searchlights are on for new discoveries that could make solar energy competitive with fossil fuels.\n\nTechnion new recruit, Dr Carmel Rotschild, who arrived in August 2011 at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering from MIT, is aiming to do just that. His dream is to increase the efficiency of photovoltaics by around 20 percent, by developing efficient appliances to convert the lost rays of the sun that silicon is unable to process. This involves the fusion (or up conversion) of infrared solar radiation to make that power accessible to silicon, and the fission (or down conversion) of radiation in the blue range to near infrared radiation, which could double the quantum efficiency of photovoltaics. The highly multidisciplinary approach includes the design and fabrication of nanoscale optical materials within an optical cavity, and Rotschild and his multidisciplinary team draws on expertise in nonlinear optics, material engineering, and energy transfer in molecules.\n\n\"My vision is to increase efficiency by 20 percent for a given photovoltaic cell.\"\n\n\"What I'm doing in my research is combining nonlinear optics and luminescent solar concentrators to build accessories for photovoltaics,\" explains Rotschild. \"My vision is to increase efficiency by 20 percent for a given photovoltaic cell. The main issue that limits efficiency is the mismatch between the broad solar spectrum, and the narrow spectral response of photovoltaics. For example: silicon is very effective at one micron wavelength, but light with a longer wavelength cannot be converted into electricity by silicon solar cells. It would be nice to look at nonlinear optics as a toolbox for converting inefficient parts of the solar spectrum into emissions where solar panels can be more efficient.\"\n\nRotschild has a personal passion for creating cleaner, more efficient ways to power our world: he lost a friend to cancer and is concerned that air pollution was a chief culprit. And his belief in the urgency of the need to advance energy research in Israel is shared by the Grand Technion Energy Program (GTEP) and the Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute (RBNI) who are jointly supporting his work.\n\n\"The energy revolution is already here, and the funny thing is it doesn't come from science, it comes from engineering,\" says Rotschild. \"If you include the cost that we as a society pay for using petrol, coal and fossil fuels in terms of health and pollution, we are now even in the cost we can pay... we are reaching an era where solar energy becomes affordable for society.\"\n\nRotschild says that multidisciplinary programs such as GTEP are powerful platforms for attracting scientists back to Israel. \"Energy is a key part of the Technion vision, and my lab is evidence of that,\" he says. \"GTEP is a great platform to interact and collaborate in order for Israel to become a world leader in this field. It is really a great vision and I think we are reaching it.\"\n\nDr Carmel Rotschild is a Horev Fellow in the Leaders in Science and Technology Program."

Credit: Frank Wojciechowski\n\nScientists are reporting an advance toward scavenging energy from walking, breathing, and other natural body movements to power electronic devices like cell phones and heart pacemakers. In a study in ACS' Nano Letters, they describe development of flexible, biocompatible rubber films for use in implantable or wearable energy harvesting systems. The material could be used, for instance, to harvest energy from the motion of the lungs during breathing and use it to run pacemakers without the need for batteries that must be surgically replaced every few years.\n\nMichael McAlpine and colleagues point out that popular hand-held consumer electronic devices are using smaller and smaller amounts of electricity. That opens the possibility of supplementing battery power with electricity harvested from body movements. So-called \"piezoelectric\" materials are the obvious candidates, since they generate electricity when flexed or subjected to pressure. However, manufacturing piezoelectric materials requires temperatures of more than 1,000 degrees F., making it difficult to combine them with rubber.\n\nThe scientists describe a new manufacturing method that solves this problem. It enabled them to apply nano-sized ribbons of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) — each strand about 1/50,000th the width of a human hair — to ribbons of flexible silicone rubber. PZT is one of the most efficient piezoelectric materials developed to date and can convert 80 percent of mechanical energy into electricity. The combination resulted in a super-thin film they call 'piezo-rubber' that seems to be an excellent candidate for scavenging energy from body movements.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nPower-generating rubber films developed by Princeton University engineers could harness natural body movements such as breathing and walking to power pacemakers, mobile phones and other electronic devices.\n\nMany important electronic devices used by people today would be impossible without the use of ceramics.

Researchers measure the difference between the amount of charge that went into the battery and the amount that comes out, even small differences in those amounts signal reactions in the battery that lead to a shortened life span.\n\nTypically these losses in charge aren't detected until after months of testing, but the new technique can detect very small losses within weeks. The scientists have already used the battery testing to identify and correct small changes in chemistry that have multiplied battery lifespan by up to six times.\n\nSanyo's new battery factory located in Kasai city, Hyogo prefecture, Japan will make lithium-ion battery packs for electric vehicles. While that's nothing special, the factory's starting production capacity is. The factory will make one million lithium ion cells per month, with production expanding if demand increases.\n\nSanyo already has partnerships with Volkswagen and Suzuki to supply lithium ion battery packs for their hybrid and plug-in vehicles, but that list could soon include Ford, Honda and PSA Peugeot Citroen as well since Sanyo already provides NiMH batteries for those auto makers.\n\nSanyo appears to be making great strides toward its goal of capturing 40 percent of the rechargable battery market by 2020.\n\nI'm hoping this new factory is an indicator of scaling up in electric vehicle production in general. As the vehicles and their parts become more mass produced, the costs will go down and the likelihood of more people buying them will go up.\n\nScientists at MIT have developed a positive electrode made of carbon nanotubes that significantly boosts lithium ion battery performance and could lead to much greater range in electric vehicles and longer battery lives for gadgets.\n\nThe carbon nanotube electrodes enable lithium ion batteries to deliver ten times more power than a conventional battery and store five times more energy than a conventional ultracapacitor. The nanotubes accomplish this because they have a very high surface area for storing and reacting with lithium, which increases the battery's storage capacity and the speed at which it can charge and discharge.\n\nThe MIT scientists have already licensed the technology to a battery company (as yet, unnamed) and are perfecting quick methods of making the electrodes, like spraying the nanotubes on a substrate, to facilitate mass production.\n\nOne of the major issues facing the growth of renewable energy is figuring out how it will be transmitted and what kind of infrastructure changes will have to be made to accomodate it. NREL has good news for us. It turns out that the existing grid is ready to take on lots more wind and solar energy with little changes necessary.\n\nA new study by NREL found that the nation's power grid is able to handle a large increase in renewable energy, but there will have to be operational and organization changes.\n\nThe study looked at the benefits and challenges of having wind and solar energy make up 35 percent of energy capacity by 2017. The study used the WestConnect group of utilites as a testing ground (they cover the mountain and southwest states) and found that it was possible for that group, with existing transmission networks, to achieve a 30 percent wind energy and 5 percent solar energy portfolio.\n\nThe study found that expanding coordination of power delivery to a larger geographic area, and doing so more frequently (as wind and solar conditions changed), reduced the need for back-up energy generation (like from natural gas) and new transmission. Also, wind and solar forecasts would become essential for utility operations.\n\nNREL found that if the WestConnect utilities generated 27 percent of their electricity from wind and solar, carbon emissions would be lowered by as much as 45 percent. Fuel and emissions costs would fall by 40 percent.\n\nOne of the most frequent objections to renewable energy systems is that their production is too variable. But technologies continue to be developed that will allow storage of power generated from wind, solar, and other intermittent renewable sources. The latest development comes from researchers at Isentropic in Cambridge, England who propose giant batteries filled with gravel and argon gas. These batteries would provide a number advantages over pumped hydro, which is presently used for almost all electricity storage today, as well as over underground compressed air storage.\n\nThe gravel battery system would use excess capacity generated by a renewable source to heat and pressurize the argon gas and then pump it through a gravel filled silo to store energy. Then, when demand calls for electricity, the system is simply operated in reverse to generate electricity. According to the company, the system's \"round trip efficiency is over 72% - 80%.\" This is comparable to the efficiency of pumped storage hydro, which has an efficiency of 70 - 85%. But gravel batteries are much more compact, and can be more readily installed in relatively flat areas characteristic of many areas with good windpower potential, such as the American Great Plains. A gravel battery can use far less land (1/300th) than that required for a pumped hydro lake, as well.\n\nUnderground compressed air storage is another technology that has been suggested, but that requires the presence of underground caverns, which are not always present where you might want to put a power storage facility. In addition to being able to be located anywhere, gravel batteries could be relatively inexpensive because they do not need costly materials. Costs could be as low as $55/kWh, and $10/kWh at scale for large installations."

It is therefore prudent to 1) reduce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from power generation and 2) sequester the currently high levels of CO2 in a secure storage environment. Figure 1 shows a schematic of a concept capable of meeting both goals. A key part of this process is the separation of CO2 from the reformed fuel (pre-combustion), where it is advantageous to maintain a high temperature and pressure of the reformed fuel, minimizing inefficiencies from heat loss and compression of CO2 exhaust for sequestration, respectively [2]. These constraints require a membrane capable of intermediate temperature operation at high pressure, with tolerance to the reducing environment. In this collaborative work with Assoc.

      "text": "Success Story: The Next Semiconductor Revolution\n\nUmesh Mishra is at the helm of High Efficiency Power Conversion, one of the hottest innovations In Energy Efficiency\n\nTHE SITUATION\n\nElectricity is converted at various stages of its journey to homes, factories, and businesses to meet the needs of the devices it powers. Here's the bad news: More than 10 percent of all power generated in the U.S. is lost in power conversion, acting as a hidden tax we all pay on electricity. These losses add up to over $40B annually and over 300 Terawatt hours (TWH) of electricity energy wasted.\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\n\nAfter electricity is generated, it is transmitted as AC current over high-voltage power lines. It must be converted back to DC current before it can be used in many applications such as data servers and laptop computers. Conversion of power from AC to DC and back to AC is required for applications such as motor drives, air conditioners, etc. DC voltages are connected to AC in applications such as PV inverters and within a hybrid car to use the energy from the battery which is a DC source. Within these applications, electricity is often converted from one voltage level to another. Conversion losses are a significant barrier to adopting sustainable technologies as well, since these losses make solar panels less efficient and electric vehicles heavier.\n\nFor decades, silicon-based converters, which perform at about 90 percent efficiency, have been the best option, but their progress is slowing. Another technology will be needed to continue these efficiency improvements and keep up with rising electricity demand.\n\nTHE OBSTACLES\n\nInstitute faculty member Umesh Mishra has been working with a material called gallium nitride (GaN) since 1996. The material has been instrumental in advancing LED technology, but had never been applied to electricity conversion.\n\n\"Silicon has reached its limits in power conversion, and literally, silicon has reached its physical limit. We are using gallium nitride to move away from the path set by silicon,\" says Mishra.\n\nThere are two basic requirements for a material that can outperform silicon. First, the material must be able to withstand high power levels. Second, it must have the ability to easily transport electricity. Gallium nitride's ability to accomplish both tasks is what makes it such an exciting advancement.\n\nTo create GaN-based convertors, Mishra and colleagues first had to find a substrate that would be compatible with GaN. \"You cannot mine GaN. It has to be grown on foreign substrates,\" Mishra notes. Fortunately, the structures of GaN and silicon are similar enough to be effectively combined.\n\nTHE BIG IDEAS\n\nThink small, think light. Previously, there has been a trade-off between efficiency and power density. As a result, devices that maximized efficiency were larger than their counterparts. GaN's unique characteristics allow it to increase both efficiency and power density. This means that the rectangular adapter connected to our laptop cords could shrink or even disappear altogether. Moreover, electric vehicles could be lighter and have smaller batteries, increasing their marketability.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nAfter years of incremental progress, Mishra and his team have developed a gallium nitride convertor that is about 99 percent efficient. Full implementation of GaN electricity convertors could reduce U.S. electricity demand by the equivalent of 300 large coal-fired power plants. \"The amount of savings added up is more than all the electricity consumed by the West Coast each year,\" says Mishra. \"That's the scale of the impact.\"\n\nTo take his breakthroughs to the marketplace, Mishra co-founded Transphorm, located in Goleta, California. His team's breakthroughs and the power conversion solutions they can provide are so significant that Transphorm has attracted many investors and international attention."

A subset of PEFC's are Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFC) which use methanol instead of hydrogen as a fuel, which is easier to transport.\n\nSolid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) and Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC) operate at high temperatures, and the heat can internally reform almost any hydrocarbon fuel into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The difference between them is their electrolyte, SOFC uses a ceramic compound and MCFC uses a molten carbonate held in a ceramic matrix.\n\nThe high power density and low operating temperature of PEFC lends itself to transport applications. The high temperatures (~900°C) of SOFC and MCFC means they are suited to co-generation stationary power, as waste heat can be used to run a turbine.\n\nFuel cells can also operate in \"reverse\"; using electricity to create hydrogen and oxygen from water."

      "text": "Researchers create new nanostructure that absorbs broad spectrum of light from all angles\n\nNov 10, 2011 by Bob Yirka\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Researchers working at Cal Tech, have taken an idea first proposed by Koray Aydin, now at Northwestern and have created a new nanostructure that appears to be capable of absorbing light of any polarization and virtually any angle. The new \"plasmonic\" material has thus far shown it can convert light into heat, and holds promise for improving the efficiency of solar cells. The team, led by Harry Atwater has published their findings in Nature Communications.\n\nResearchers have been working hard for several years to improve the efficiency of solar panels, because doing so would drive down costs, which so far have not been enough to allow solar cells to compete with fossil fuels. The problem is that current solar cells are based on silicon which is somewhat expensive to manufacture. Efforts to reduce the amount used in solar cells have resulted in lower efficiencies, and so are not really viable. Now however, it appears a different way to approach the problem might be at hand. The new material created by the Cal Tech team, because it absorbs more light, could be laid over conventional solar panels making them far more efficient. This means the silicon in them could be made thinner and the cells would still be more efficient than what is currently available. All because the new material is able to absorb more of the light that strikes it due to a scattering effect that it causes.\n\nThe new material is made of silver and is shaped into rows of trapezoids with a variety of bumps along the edges of various shapes and lengths to cause the light to bend in diverse ways. The result is a material that is able to absorb up to 70% of light across the visible spectrum. To make it polarization independent, they laid an identical sheet of the material across the first at a 90° angle.\n\nBy absorbing more light, the new material is able to convert the same amount of light shining on the material into more heat than other materials. The next step is in figuring out how to convert that extra absorbed light to more electricity and to do so with different kinds of materials, and that is just what Aydin and Atwater are working on together.\n\nAbstract Resonant plasmonic and metamaterial structures allow for control of fundamental optical processes such as absorption, emission and refraction at the nanoscale. Considerable recent research has focused on energy absorption processes, and plasmonic nanostructures have been shown to enhance the performance of photovoltaic and thermophotovoltaic cells. Although reducing metallic losses is a widely sought goal in nanophotonics, the design of nanostructured 'black' super absorbers from materials comprising only lossless dielectric materials and highly reflective noble metals represents a new research direction. Here we demonstrate an ultrathin (260 nm) plasmonic super absorber consisting of a metal–insulator–metal stack with a nanostructured top silver film composed of crossed trapezoidal arrays. Our super absorber yields broadband and polarization-independent resonant light absorption over the entire visible spectrum (400–700 nm) with an average measured absorption of 0.71 and simulated absorption of 0.85. Proposed nanostructured absorbers open a path to realize ultrathin black metamaterials based on resonant absorption.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nSolar power may be on the rise, but solar cells are only as efficient as the amount of sunlight they collect.

When the beads are left in the sun, they absorb heat melting the mixture. At night, the beads release the heat stored during the day as the mixture turns solid again.\n\nPCMs have a high heat of fusion and melt/freeze at a certain temperature. Heat is absorbed when the material melts and released when it freezes. Heated in the sun, the mixture of paraffin wax (which melts at about 37 Celsius) and stearic acid (a fat commonly used to make soap) becomes entirely liquid. However, as it solidifies it slowly releases the stored heat.\n\nThe research team has tested beads the size of 38 millimeters (about 1.5 inches) floating on top of a tank of water. Once manufactured, they might resemble the bath oil beads pictured above.\n\nWhile the technology is not all that involved, it works well. People using these beads for heating would save energy and money with lower power bills. In areas where electricity is nonexistent, these beads can provide some badly needed warmth.\n\nThe ability to gather heat during the day and then release it slowly during the night is similar to the thermal properties of adobe bricks. Not everyone can afford an adobe dwelling so the beads offer a great alternative.\n\nIn climates like the American Southwest that can go from very hot day time temperatures to very cold at night, these beads would be an inexpensive way to heat small areas while cutting down on energy bills. No idea if the beads once they hit production will ever make it to North America. If not, it sounds like a possible business opportunity. License the technology and then manufacture the beads for those interested in staying warm while conserving energy."

For example, advances in a group of materials called \"critical materials\" are more important to America's competitiveness than ever before – particularly in the clean energy field. Cell phones, wind turbines, solar panels and a variety of military technologies depend on these roughly fourteen elements (including nine \"rare earth\" elements). With about 90 percent coming from China, there are growing concerns about potential supply shortages and disruptions.\n\nWith the Materials Project, researchers can use supercomputers to characterize properties of inorganic compounds, including their stability, voltage, capacity, and oxidation state, which had previously not been possible. The results are then organized into a database that gives all researchers at DOE's national labs free access. This database already contains the properties of more than 15,000 inorganic compounds, and hundreds of more compounds are added every day.\n\nAlready, scientists are using the tool to work with several companies interested in making stronger, corrosion-resistant lightweight aluminum alloys, which could make it possible to produce lighter weight vehicles and airplanes. Scientists have also already successfully applied this tool for prediction and discovery of materials used for clean energy technologies, including lithium ion batteries, hydrogen storage, thermoelectrics, electrodes for fuel cells, and photovoltaics.\n\nDOE's Office of Science is the single largest supporter of basic research in the physical sciences in the United States, and is working to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time.

Their goal is to develop structural materials with a high specific strength, which measures how much load it can carry per unit of weight.\n\nThe researchers focused on magnesium alloys because magnesium is very light. They were able to strengthen the material by introducing \"nano-spaced stacking faults\". These are essentially a series of parallel fault-lines in the crystalline structure of the alloy that isolate any defects in that structure. This increases the overall strength of the material by approximately 200 percent. The nano-spaced stacking faults were introduced to the alloy using conventional \"hot rolling\" technology.\n\n]]>\n\nSun, 05 May 2013 19:19:37 GMTThe Editorstag:nanoarchitecture.net,2013-05-05:95cb34d1dc950c51e7255c634cb4a43c/aebe043855b524a471ebecac669f4737Ionic Thrusters May Be Alternative To Conventional Propulsion\n.\nWhen a current passes between two electrodes — one thinner than the other — it creates wind in the air between. If enough voltage is applied, the resulting wind can produce a thrust without the help of motors or fuel. This phenomenon, called electrohydrodynamic thrust — or \"ionic wind\" — could be a viable propulsion system.\n\nMIT researchers have found that ionic thrusters may be a far more efficient source of propulsion than conventional jet engines. They found that ionic wind produces 110 newtons of thrust per kilowatt, compared with a jet engine's 2 newtons per kilowatt. Ionic wind may be used as a propulsion system for small, lightweight aircraft. In addition, ionic thrusters are silent, and invisible in infrared, as they give off no heat — ideal traits for a surveillance vehicle.\n\n]]>\n\nSun, 05 May 2013 19:11:56 GMTThe Editorstag:nanoarchitecture.net,2013-05-05:95cb34d1dc950c51e7255c634cb4a43c/a1c6f5298a780d3d8bb4046556b07d5bRemoving Contaminants From Water\n.\nResearchers from Rice University, DuPont Central Research and Development, and Stanford University have announced a full-scale field test of a new process that quickly rids groundwater of contaminants.

The company says it has built a prototype of a tubular overhead LED light that produces 200 lumens of light with a watt of power. Its current products produce light at 100 lumens per watt, about the same as florescent tube lights. Even though the price of LEDs will be higher, Philips thinks that they can start to displace more of the florescent tube lights that are everywhere from office buildings to parking garages based on energy savings.\n\nThe company plans to commercialize the technology in 2015 and transfer it to other products, including consumer light bulbs. In a consumer LED light bulb, that would mean that a 60-watt replacement would consume about 5 watts. \"You could easily see how it will work through the entire retrofit line,\" says Coen Liedenbaum, the innovation area manager in lighting at Philips Lighting.\n\nEngineers were able to get the jump in efficiency by tuning the light the lamp gives off. The LED semiconductor and the phosphor – the coating material that converts blue LED light to white light – have been optimized for how people perceive brightness. \"We are trying to exactly match the eye sensitivity of people, therefore needing less energy to perceive the same level of brightness,\" Liedenbaum says. The optics and other components were also improved for efficiency.\n\n]]>\n\nSun, 05 May 2013 18:32:06 GMTThe Editorstag:nanoarchitecture.net,2013-05-05:95cb34d1dc950c51e7255c634cb4a43c/0e69ce56fb3ab50fece16e47a5263cadSynthetic Biology Produces Glowing Plants\n.\nGlowing Plants is a Kickstarter project which sells night lights – the only catch is that they're delivered in seed form and you have to grow them yourself.

Reactive Orange 84 is a dye used in the textile industry when applied to cotton fabric, only 65% ??of it is impregnated and the remaining 35% is hydrolyzed in the water, creating a highly polluting wastewater. In recent years educational institutions have been aware of the damage generated by the human on the planet in general, which is increasingly common the creation of environmental projects, such is the case of the next. Photocatalysis with sunlight is presented as a simple and economical alternative for the treatment of colored wastewater effluents from the textile industry. The use of this technology to degrade and mineralize the dye reactive orange 84 may open an alternative route to traditional processes of oxidation. This system allows the energy of direct solar radiation reaching the earth's surface to cause a series of chemical reactions (redox) that result in the removal of organic compounds in urban waste water, industrial and agricultural. The solar decontamination of wastewater dyes used in textiles, through photosensitizers, to prevent water reaching difficult to degrade organic compounds, many of them toxic, as is the case of some dyes, this will allow plants water purification easier capture therapy and aquatic fauna and flora are less endangered. This treatment is a clean technology because it uses solar energy is not clean, clean photosensitizers are used, and no toxic by-products originate. Recently this technology has gained interest for their potential application in solar energy use, although only 5% of the sunlight that reaches the Earth contains the energy required to activate the titanium wave ring dioxide photo- Fenton act as photocatalysts. In different experiments have been used chromophore dyes, anthraquinone and phthalocyanine, alone and in combination. The treatment of residual dye bath was performed by direct sunlight and solar simulator exposure in open drums and solar detoxification pilot plant. The effectiveness of the processes was checked by spectrophotometry. This process in the direct absorption of radiant energy either titanium dioxide or photo-Fenton, being able to absorb solar energy emitted by capturing photons and excited electronic states reached when these are turned off, it generates an aggressive organic species is the responsible for initiating attack organic matter oxidative degradation. The heterogeneous photocatalysis with titanium wave ring dioxide was effective in the treatment of residual baths chromophore azo dyes and reactive orange 84, resulting in discolouration and enabling high reuse of treated new dye baths. However, the chromophore phthalocyanine dyes require more aggressive treatments such as photo-Fenton, for degradation. Tests on titanium dioxide adsorbed on glass rings, material developed by IMTA, the disinfection efficiency was 90%, with the material at the bottom of the reactors and 4 h of recirculation. Given the limited efficiency obtained with other reagents, was modified arrangement of rings in the form of a bar covered with spiral rings. In this arrangement, the titanium wave ring dioxide concentration equivalent to 41 mg / l of catalyst concentration which has been shown to inactivate fecal coliforms. With the rings in spiral arrangement, we obtained a 100% effectiveness for inactivation of fecal and total coliforms in ninety minutes of recirculation. Under the same conditions, we obtained a 99% reduction of aerobic mesophilic microorganisms by 3 h of recirculation. Consideration should be given that such tests were conducted in the month of December, which is characterized by low radiative energy.

Wind turbines don't turn on a still day. Solar doesn't work at night and can be hampered in the day by cloud, dust or snow coverage,\" Dr Minakshi said.\n\n\"To provide power at non-generation times, excess energy needs to be stored in batteries, but storage technologies now being considered, such as molten salt or molten sulfur, work at high temperatures, making them expensive and impractical.\"\n\nDr Minakshi said he was drawn to sodium because its chemical properties were similar to lithium, the element that powers most portable electronic devices.\n\nHis challenge was to find material for cathodes and anodes capable of accommodating sodium's ionic size – which is 2.5 times larger than that of lithium.\n\n\"Ions travel out of the cathode and into the anode to form a current. As an imperfect analogy, you can think of them as mesh filters that ions pass through.

About 100,000 of them would fit on the head of a pin.\n\nBaldo and other researchers from MIT, the University of Tennessee and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, including electrical and biomedical engineers, nanotechnology experts and biologists, collaborated on the world's first solid-state photosynthetic solar cell. The work was reported in NanoLetters, a publication of the American Chemical Society.\n\n\"We have crossed the first hurdle of successfully integrating a photosynthetic protein molecular complex with a solid-state electronic device,\" Baldo said.\n\nPlants' ability to generate energy has been optimized by evolution, so a spinach plant is extremely efficient, churning out a lot of energy relative to its size and weight. But combining biological and non-biological materials in one device has stymied researchers in the past. Biological materials need water and salt to survive—both are deadly for electronics.\n\nFrom wet to dry\n\nA new twist in the current work is a membrane of peptide surfactants—similar to the main ingredient in soap—that helped the photosynthetic complexes self-assemble and stabilize while the circuit was fabricated.\n\nSo far, scientists and engineers' efforts to harness the photosynthetic properties of green plants have been most successful with naturally soft organic materials in liquid solutions. But if organic solar cells are to be practical for commercial devices, they need to be integrated with solid-state electronics.\n\nThe researchers ground up ordinary spinach and purified it with a centrifuge to isolate a protein deep within the cell.\n\nThe resulting dark green pellets that smell like cut grass were purified still further and coaxed into a water-soluble state. One of the challenges was to keep the proteins in the same configuration as they appear naturally in the organism.\n\nHere's where peptides come in. The 80,000-plus kinds of proteins in our body, when in fragments called peptides, transform themselves like tiny LEGOs™ into millions of substances. Shuguang Zhang, associate director of MIT's Center for Biomedical Engineering, discovered that these same peptides can be tweaked into forming completely new natural materials that perform useful functions. One of his designer nanomaterials, which acts like the main ingredient in soaps and detergents, turns out to be ideal for keeping protein complexes functional on a cold, hard surface.\n\nThe spinach-sandwich device has no water. Proteins usually need water to survive, but using Zhang's detergent peptide, the researchers were plant seeds hoard oils that maintain the seeds' integrity in dry conditions.\n\nBuilding the sandwich\n\nThe bottom layer of the molecular electronic device is transparent glass coated with a conductive material. A thin layer of gold helps the chemical reaction that assembles the spinach chlorophyll Photosystem I complexes. The researchers then evaporate a soft organic semiconductor that prevents electrical shorts and protects the protein complexes from the layer of metal that completes the sandwich.\n\nThe researchers shone laser light on the device to create optical excitation, then measured the resulting current. \"An important caveat is that we got very little current out, mostly because we had just a thin layer of the complexes in our devices,\" Baldo said. \"Most of the optical excitation passed straight through without being absorbed. Of the light that was absorbed, we estimate that we converted around 12 percent to charge.\"\n\nThe researchers hope to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 20 percent or more (which would provide an extremely efficient power source) by creating multiple layers of PSI or assembling them on rough surfaces or 3-D surfaces, like skyscrapers that concentrate a huge amount of surface area within a relatively small space.\n\nPatrick J.

Now, a team of researchers has developed a new manufacturing technique to cut down the time of charging from hours to minutes.\n\nLi-on batteries today have conductors that feed the charge holding particles held within the cell. the problem is when that charge is deposited from the outside in, the charge holding section in the middle isn't directly exposed to any current.\n\nWhat the new technique does is that it makes the batteries densely interwoven with conductors so that the entire battery can start to charge at the same time. It was developed by researchers at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea.\n\nThe researchers placed the cell material in a solution containing graphite, causing carbon to permeate the materials. When it became carbonized, the result is a \"dense network of conductors throughout the electrodes of the battery\".\n\nThe demo shown by the team showed that the battery can be recharged between 30 and 120 times faster than normal li-on batteries."

In this context, it is important to establish new mechanisms by which water splitting can take place.\n\nNow, a unique approach developed by Prof. David Milstein and colleagues of the Weizmann Institute's Organic Chemistry Department, provides important steps in overcoming this challenge. During this work, the team demonstrated a new mode of bond generation between oxygenatoms and even defined the mechanism by which it takes place. In fact, it is the generation of oxygen gas by the formation of a bond between two oxygen atoms originating from water molecules that proves to be the bottleneck in the water splitting process. Their results have recently been published in Science.\n\nNature, by taking a different path, has evolved a very efficient process: photosynthesis - carried out by plants - the source of all oxygen on Earth. Although there has been significant progress towards the understanding of photosynthesis, just how this system functions remains unclear; vast worldwide efforts have been devoted to the development of artificial photosynthetic systems based on metal complexes that serve as catalysts, with little success. (A catalyst is a substance that is able to increase the rate of a chemical reaction without getting used up.)\n\nThe new approach that the Weizmann team has recently devised is divided into a sequence of reactions, which leads to the liberation of hydrogen and oxygen in consecutive thermal- and light-driven steps, mediated by a unique ingredient - a special metal complex that Milstein's team designed in previous studies. Moreover, the one that they designed - a metal complex of the element ruthenium - is a 'smart' complex in which the metal center and the organic part attached to it cooperate in the cleavage of the water molecule.\n\nThe team found that upon mixing this complex with water the bonds between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms break, with one hydrogen atom ending up binding to its organic part, while the remaining hydrogen and oxygen atoms (OH group) bind to its metal center.\n\nThis modified version of the complex provides the basis for the next stage of the process: the 'heat stage.' When the water solution is heated to 100?C hydrogen gas is released from the complex - a potential source of clean fuel - and another OH group is added to the metal center.\n\n'But the most interesting part is the third 'light stage,'' says Milstein. 'When we exposed this third complex to light at room temperature, not only was oxygen gas produced, but the metal complex also reverted back to its original state, which could be recycled for use in further reactions.'\n\nThese results are even more remarkable considering that the generation of a bond between two oxygen atoms promoted by a man-made metal complex is a very rare event, and it has been unclear how it can take place. Yet Milstein and his team have also succeeded in identifying an unprecedented mechanism for such a process. Additional experiments have indicated that during the third stage, light provides the energy required to cause the two OH groups to get together to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which quickly breaks up into oxygen and water. 'Because hydrogen peroxide is considered a relatively unstable molecule, scientists have always disregarded this step, deeming it implausible; but we have shown otherwise,' says Milstein. Moreover, the team has provided evidence showing that the bond between the two oxygen atoms is generated within a single molecule - not between oxygen atoms residing on separate molecules, as commonly believed - and it comes from a single metal center.\n\nDiscovery of an efficient artificial catalyst for the sunlight-driven splitting of water into oxygen and hydrogen is a major goal of renewable clean energy research. So far, Milstein's team has demonstrated a mechanism for the formation of hydrogen and oxygen from water, without the need for sacrificial chemical agents, through individual steps, using light. For their next study, they plan to combine these stages to create an efficient catalytic system, bringing those in the field of alternative energy an important step closer to realizing this goal.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nScientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Institute for Molecular Science in Japan are trying to mimic part of the complex natural process of photosynthesis with ...\n\nIn a familiar high-school chemistry demonstration, an instructor first uses electricity to split liquid water into its constituent gases, hydrogen and oxygen.

      "text": "Coal and solar cells may have more in common in the future than you think. In recent months there has been a burst of interest in Polymer Solar Cells thanks to research showing them able to reach efficiencies of over 10%. And, since this is a Coal Bin article, that means they are partially made from coal.\nBefore going into greater detail, here's a simple explanation of how a solar cell works. Photons in sunlight hit the solar panel and are absorbed by semiconducting materials, such as silicon.\n\nThen the electrons (negatively charged) are knocked loose from their atoms, allowing them to flow through the material to produce electricity. Due to the special composition of solar cells, the electrons are only allowed to move in a single direction. An array of solar cells converts solar energy into a usable amount of direct current (DC) electricity.\n\nTraditionally silicon has been used for solar cells because it has a high efficiency rate (20%+). The problem is that the most efficient solar cells require large crystals of silicon, which are more expensive to grow. Consequently, there has been a search for other, cheaper alternatives. These have included poly-crystalline silicon. However, researchers have begun to look at different materials. That's where coal comes in.\n\nThat's also where polymer solar cells come in. Compared to silicon-based devices, polymer solar cells are lightweight, potentially disposable, inexpensive to fabricate (sometimes using printed electronics), and flexible. They still have some problems like the fact that they tend to deteriorate in sunlight.\nHowever, depending on the polymer used, solar cells can be tailored to be especially efficient in absorbing certain parts of light spectrum. That means they could capture more of the energy from the sun than other types of solar cells.\n\nThe key to these cells are the types of polymers used. And, that is where coal comes in. Polymer solar cells use what are known as conducting polymers – they can conduct electricity. They can also act as semiconductors just like silicone.\n\nThis is a relatively new field and the discovery of conductive polymers earned its three discoverers the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000. One such polymer is polyaniline. It is a plastic that is polymerized from aniline, which was discovered over 150 years ago and comes from coal tar. There are other polymers that are being considered that have their basis in coal based chemicals too.\n\nAlthough a solar cell that degrades in sunlight seems impractical, they may be ideal economically. If the cells are inexpensive and easy to manufacture, they might be ideal to power a while array of low power personal electronics. Since few digital gadgets last longer than a few years before being upgraded or becoming obsolete, a solar panel that doesn't last 20 years is unnecessary.\n\nNeedless to say, a plastic that can generate energy from the sun has great potential. One company Konarka has a product called Power Plastic that it claims can be used in umbrellas, curtains, and even buildings. Although the efficiency is less than traditional silicon cells (9%), the ability to \"tune\" the plastic to certain wavelengths means it is more efficient in low light conditions and even indoors.\n\nPolymer solar cells don't stop there. Since they are so flexible, there is research on turning them into a fiber that will allow woven solar panels that could be used in backpacks or even clothes.\n\nUnfortunately, the promise of solar cells has usually failed to live up to expectations. The biggest problem is that they can't produce the high levels of electricity necessary for modern living. However, we can take comfort in knowing that whether it's traditional coal powered electricity or the latest polymer solar cells, we still need coal to power our lives."

The cells have matured beyond expensive, fire-prone energy systems, becoming the go-to chemistry to power new mobile devices and electric vehicles. Still, prices need to drop further and the batteries themselves need be more durable to drive electric cars into more driveways and garages.\n\nResearchers at Argonne National Laboratory outside Chicago are now tackling this problem, from designing batteries by the molecule in computers to postmortem battery analyses. In the process, the facility hopes to create innovations that will drive the industry, giving American manufacturers an edge over other countries as these energy storage systems find their way under the hood.\n\nKhalil Amine, senior fellow scientist and manager for the Advanced Lithium Battery Program at Argonne, noted that historically, the United States led the world in energy storage research, but other countries like South Korea, Japan and China were better at commercializing these technologies.\n\nBut with high gasoline prices and increased global competition, the U.S. government has taken a renewed interest in developing and producing next-generation batteries within its borders. \"Energy storage now is very strategic, not only for Argonne, but for the country,\" Amine said. \"Whoever develops the technology will become the Saudi Arabia of batteries, so obviously it's very critical to get the technologies.\"\n\nUnder the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Argonne received $8.8 million to build new labs to design battery components, test them, scale up their production, build prototypes, run them through tests and analyze them.\n\nThe cheaper, more powerful battery starts with molecules\nThough some other countries have more manpower devoted to researching energy storage, Amine said that Argonne has its own advantages. \"Here, we use our advanced supercomputer to design molecules for validation,\" he said, allowing engineers to create suitable molecules from the ground up rather than testing various materials to see what sticks. \"It's a very powerful tool that companies do not have.\"\n\nOnce researchers find a candidate molecule for a battery component, they produce it in small amounts to see if it works as predicted, usually in 100- to 500-gram batches. However, many promising materials languished in the past, failing to make the jump from the test tube to the assembly line and attract interest from industry.\n\n\"Great research is being done, great materials are being developed, but not a lot of them are making it out of the lab,\" explained Gregory Krumdick, a researcher at Argonne. \"When you're scaling up technologies, what works at the bench will not work at the industrial scale.\"\n\nTo bridge this \"Valley of Death,\" Argonne is building the Materials Engineering Research Facility. The laboratory takes processes that produce grams of compounds used in electrolytes, cathodes and anodes, and ramps up the output by an order of magnitude or more. Krumdick is the principal systems engineer at this scale-up facility.\n\nScientists tend to craft their chemicals like artisans, using specialized tools and forming the products in tiny quantities. This gives them precise control over their work and lets them tweak the process, validating their results through experiments and computer models. The material is often sufficient for a button cell like the ones that power wristwatches, but to get manufacturers really interested, you have to make enough for large batteries while using cheaper, off-the-self hardware.\n\n9 Comments\n\nI don't know, but I think I smell a skunk. Lithium has been used since the 70s and the improvements have been near zero, just like the ICE engine has been in use for over one hundred years and is still a crappy, dirty, stinking source of providing transportation. What does this company think that they can change about lithium in ten years that will make a difference? I think we should give up lithium and try thorium. 8 grams of thorium in a stainless steel encased battery - ignited by a laser can get you over 300,000 miles. So why are we still playing with children's chemistry sets and not advanced physics? I would rather have a battery that I can hand down to my great great grandchildren than I would a battery that will not even make it to my son's (and 'no', I do not have a daughter, so get off the politically correct bull sh**) 40th birthday.\n\nLithium is not the technology that can replace the worlds fleet of one billion ICE vehicles with electric. \"Analysis of Lithium's geological resource base shows that there is insufficient economically recoverable Lithium available in the Earth's crust to sustain Electric Vehicle manufacture in the volumes required, based solely on LiIon batteries.\"\n\nAlso: \"Two other battery technologies exist which could provide \"Sustainable Mobility\" in a world without oil, without the same resource constraints. These are: ● The \"Zebra\" Sodium Nickel Chloride battery ● The Zinc Air battery and Fuel Cell\". In addition to the above the Sodium Iron Chloride battery could power the world's fleet of vehicles. All of the above are also much cheaper than Li.\n\nIn the computer industry, I've seen an improvement in both price and performance for lithium-ion -- though admittedly, not a large one.\n\nI still hear rumors of ways to use lithium more efficiently -- particularly lithium-air. But who knows?\n\nIn any case, we have to move forward in research, rather than listening to the ever-present curmudgeons who are always claiming \"it can't be done\" and \"you're wasting your time.\" If people like this ruled research science, we'd still be living in caves!\n\nOne of the statements of this article caught my eye...that they(the battery) does not like to stay inactive...If I remember correctly, the ten year plus storage life of the original lithium batteries is what got them where they are today...\n\nThat study by William Tahil has been widely discredited. The article mentions a couple later studies, on in response to Tahill's that refers to it as both \"alarmist\" and \"ludicrious.\" \n\n\". Lithium has been used since the 70s and the improvements have been near zero,...\"\n\nThat, sir, is an utterly false statement. Both energy and power density of lithium batteries have increased greatly in the past 10 years alone. Currently, lithium batteries increase in energy density about 8% a year with the very real prospect of that figure rising exponentially with the advent of lithium air, lithium sulphur or other promising configurations"

That's 1,000 times more than the entire rest of the United States was using at the time. It is the highest-energy laser shot ever fired in real life, although some fictional lasers have exceeded the record.\n\nThe NIF's ultimate goal is to induce nuclear fusion in a highly compressed pellet of hydrogen, which will be held at the target point of the laser beams. The fusion reaction will generate energy, so we'll earn back our 500 terawatts with interest.\n\nBy now you are probably well familiar with the concept of the urban heat island effect, even if you can't quite pinpoint the physics at play when your sneaker sole melts a little on a hot black street in July. Asphalt is an awesome material for storing the sun's heat. On a steamy summer day, the surface of a road may be as hot as 140 degrees Fahrenheit. And it'll stay that miserable long after the sun sets, pushing up the temperature of whole neighborhoods covered in this blacktop.\n\n\"The bottom line is that roads get hot in summertime, even springtime,\" says Rajib Mallick, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. \"They have a large surface area, which is collecting solar energy. Why not use that solar energy for something? It's free energy, and if you use it, at the same time you can lower the temperature of the pavement.\"\n\nMallick and other researchers have been developing a model that would harness the heat contained in asphalt and put it to productive uses. Asphalt, for instance, could heat water coursing through a series of pipes embedded in the road. And that process would both cool street surfaces and send their heat somewhere useful.\n\nRippling With Energy\n\nLong strands of bull kelp ripple beneath the surface of churning coastal waters, drawing fuel from the sun and, perhaps, pointing out a better way for humanity to capture and use energy.\n\nSeaweed is just one of the innovations of nature from which engineers are drawing inspiration as they seek to design energy systems that are cleaner and more efficient. In plants—the engines of photosynthesis—and in creatures as small as insects and as large as whales, advocates of \"biomimicry\" are looking for systems that can help humanity better meet the challenge of fueling civilization sustainably.\n\nBiomimicry simply means using designs inspired by nature to solve human problems. The idea is that over 3.8 billion years of evolution, nature itself has solved many of the problems that humanity finds itself grappling with today. Since energy is one of the greatest challenges facing the world, with much of the research aimed at designing systems that would work in greater harmony with the planet, it is not surprising that science would look to nature for answers.\n\nBull kelp, named for its bullwhip shape, is one of the strongest and most flexible seaweeds in the world and can grow up to 100 feet from its holdfast (similar to roots) on the sea floor to the tips of its leaves. The movement of the kelp's leaves as they photosynthesize sunlight into energy inspired at least one Australian company, which is seeking to commercialize a system that generates energy from the gentle motion of floats bobbing up and down in the waves.\n\nBioWAVE: Capturing Ocean Power\n\nIllustration courtesy BioPower Systems\n\nBioPower Systemsof Sydney, Australia, is working toward a $14 million pilot demonstration of its trademarked BioWAVE system off the coast of Port Fairy in the southeastern state of Victoria. Late last year, BioPower received a $5 million ($5.2 million U.S.) award from the Victoria government to help bring the project to fruition.\n\nAt 250 kilowatts, the planned pilot would have about a fifth of the capacity of a common commercial wind turbine. But it will be connected to the electric grid, and systems of this size in the past have been large enough to power neighborhoods or large institutional buildings, such as schools. It all depends on how much efficiency the system achieves. The company has spent five years performing multiple tests in tanks at increasing scale before ocean deployment.\n\nBioWAVE's floats are designed to pick up the energy from the ocean's waves, while a flexible \"stem\" would allow the floats to pivot to catch the most energy. But the inspiration gained from seaweed must be tempered by practicality. Unlike kelp, BioWAVE is designed so its floats would flood with water during big storm surges. The floats would then sink to the seabed to await calmer seas. That's important because ocean-wave devices do not work if the waves are too rough. The costs of the system are reduced because BioWAVE does not require an ironclad grip on the ocean floor.\n\nA New Leaf In Energy Storage\n\nPhotograph courtesy Dominick Reuter, MIT\n\nPlants are so fantastic at converting energy into a storable form (by photosynthesizing water with sunlight into sugars) that scientists are striving to figure out a way that humans can mimic this basic process.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology scientist Daniel Nocera's artificial leaf device, seen above with some real leaves, is a step closer to making artificial photosynthesis possible.\n\nMade of a silicon solar cell with catalytic materials bonded to each side, the cell, when placed in water, splits water into oxygen and hydrogen for later use in fuel cells. Unlike previous artificial leaves, Nocera's works in ordinary water and requires no wires or equipment. It is lightweight and portable.\n\nIf researchers could develop a simple system to collect and store the gases, each of us could have \"personal energy\" at our fingertips: The hydrogen and oxygen can be fed into a fuel cell that combines them once again into water while delivering an electric current.\n\nWhale Bumps for Power\n\nPhotograph by Jason Edwards, National Geographic\n\nThe bumps on a humpback whale's flipper, seen here in a mating ritual, are on the \"wrong\" side. Physicists are familiar with bumps on the trailing edges of wings or fins, but here they are found on the leading edge.\n\nThat led Dr. Frank E. Fish, a biologist at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, to try to design a fan blade that moved air as efficiently as a whale's flippers move the animal through water. The result wasWhalePower, a Toronto-based company that designs blades for fans, turbines, and more, inspired by a whale's bumps.\n\nOn a whale, the bumps help it move effortlessly through the water at much steeper angles than it would otherwise. A Harvard study found that the angle of attack (the angle between the flipper and the direction of water flow) of a humpback whale flipper can be up to 40 percent steeper than a smooth flipper, giving the whale more control.\n\nWhalePower: Seeking More Efficient Blades\n\nPhotograph courtesy Joe Subirana, WhalePower\n\nWhalePower's product is \"the first time, other than in whales and some fossilized fish, that this has been done,\" said WhalePower's director of research and development, Stephen Dewar. \"Everyone knew\" that a blade's leading edge should be smooth to facilitate air flow, but the humpback whale proved everyone wrong.\n\n\"I did nature documentaries at one point in my career,\" Dewar added. \"And I asked, 'What are the bumps on humpback whales for?' [The response was] 'Oh, they're just barnacles.' They weren't.\"\n\nCurrently, the technology is appearing in industrial fans for warehouses, where WhalePower fans move 25 percent more air than conventional fans while using 20 percent less energy, but WhalePower hopes to retrofit wind turbines with these bumps to increase energy output by 20 percent and reduce the noise associated with large turbines.\n\nTermite Temperature Control\n\nPhotograph by Monica Rua, Alamy\n\nA termite mound is like a miniature city, housing as many as a few hundred thousand termites in its above- and below-ground tunnels. And the insects manage to keep their home at a relatively stable temperature.

      "text": "Glass leaf 'sweats' to generate electricity\n\nArtificial photosynthesis has yet to be cracked, but electrical engineers in the US think that synthetic leaves could be used to generate electricity in a different way – by sweating.\n\nNatural leaves constantly lose water through evaporation in a process called transpiration, which draws water from the roots to the very top of even the tallest trees.\n\nThe new synthetic leaves also lose water through evaporation to create that mechanical water pump effect, and use it to generate power.\n\nFlowing bubbles\n\nMichel Maharbiz at the University of California, Berkeley, working with Ruba Borno at the University of Michigan and Joe Steinmeyer at MIT, built their leaves from glass wafers shot through with a branching network of tiny water-filled channels arranged like the veins of a leaf.\n\nThe smaller channels extend to the edge of the plate and have open ends that allow water to evaporate, drawing fluid along the leaf's central stem at a rate of 1.5 centimetres per second.\n\nThe researchers added metal plates to the walls of the central stem and connected them to a circuit. The charged plates and the water within the stem create a sandwich of two conducting layers separated by an insulating layer – in effect, a capacitor.\n\nThe leaf is transformed into a source of power by periodically interrupting the water flowing into the leaf with air bubbles. Thanks to the different electrical properties of air and water, every time a bubble passes between the plates the capacitance of the device changes and a small electric current is generated, which passes to an external circuit where it's used to pump up the voltage on a storage capacitor.\n\n\"We use the mechanical energy in the liquid flow to change the capacitance and add energy to the capacitor,\" says Maharbiz.\n\nEnergy scavenger\n\nEach bubble results in an increase in output voltage of some 2 to 5 microvolts, and the device has a power density of some 2 microwatts per cubic centimetre. \"I think we could easily reach hundreds of microwatts per cubic centimetre [with modifications],\" he says.\n\nThe device could be scaled up to produce artificial trees that generate power entirely through evaporation wherever there's a cyclical change in humidity. Although the modest power output is not enough to rival solar technology, Maharbiz thinks it could act as a complementary technology – the sunlight that generates solar power could also drive transpiration to boost the electricity generated.\n\nBreaking the tension\n\nAbraham Stroock at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, thinks this is the first attempt to generate electricity from evaporation-driven flow. Although he points out that one US firm Voltree has succeeded in generating tiny quantities of power from the pH difference between soil and the roots of real trees.\n\n\"One challenge with the new study is that a bubble is used to generate the current in the capacitor,\" Stroock says. Bubbles prevent transpiration taking place over long distances because they break the tension that allows the water column to be pulled along like a piece of string.\n\nMaharbiz says he can get round this issue by using solid insulators instead of bubbles, that spin in place as the water is pulled passed like a water wheel to create the permittivity differences needed to generate\n\nNearly A Liquid Dynamo?\n\nThu Jul 30 16:05:19 BST 2009 by Dave Howe\n\nProblem there is - as the water evaporates, the material in solution will be left behind. fairly rapidly, the edge points where the water evaporates will be clogged with the solid precipitate, and no flow will take place."

The thin spherical structure improves light absorption by trapping the light inside the material, creating what are known as optical whispering galleries. Credit: Yan Yao\n\nVisitors to Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol Building may have experienced a curious acoustic feature that allows a person to whisper softly at one side of the cavernous, half-domed room and for another on the other side to hear every syllable. Sound is whisked around the semi-circular perimeter of the room almost without flaw. The phenomenon is known as a whispering gallery.\n\nIn a paper published in Nature Communications, a team of engineers at Stanford describes how it has created tiny hollow spheres of photovoltaic nanocrystalline-silicon and harnessed physics to do for light what circular rooms do for sound. The results, say the engineers, could dramatically reduce materials usage and processing cost.\n\n\"Nanocrystalline-silicon is a great photovoltaic material. It has a high electrical efficiency and is durable in the harsh sun,\" said Shanhui Fan, a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford and co-author of the paper. \"Both have been challenges for other types of thin solar films.\"\n\nThe downfall of nanocrystalline-silicon, however, has been its relative poor absorption of light, which requires thick layering that takes a long time to manufacture.\n\nWhispering galleries\n\nThe engineers call their spheres nanoshells. Producing the shells takes a bit of engineering magic. The researchers first create tiny balls of silica — the same stuff glass is made of — and coat them with a layer of silicon. They then etch away the glass center using hydrofluoric acid that does not affect the silicon, leaving behind the all-important light-sensitive shell. These shells form optical whispering galleries that capture and recirculate the light.\n\n\"The light gets trapped inside the nanoshells,\" said Yi Cui, associate professor of materials science engineering at Stanford and a senior author of the paper. \"It circulates round and round rather than passing through and this is very desirable for solar applications.\"\n\nThe researchers estimate that light circulates around the circumference of the shells a few times during which energy from the light gets absorbed gradually by the silicon. The longer they can keep the light in the material, the better the absorption will be.\n\n\"This is a new approach to broadband light absorption. The use of whispering-gallery resonant modes inside nanoshells is very exciting,\" said Yan Yao, a post-doctoral researcher in the Cui Lab and a co-lead author of the paper. \"It not only can lead to better solar cells, but it can be applied in other areas where efficient light absorption is important, such as solar fuels and photodetectors.\"\n\nThrough thick and thin\n\nIn measuring light absorption in a single layer of nanoshells, the team showed significantly more absorption over a broader spectrum of light than a flat layer of the silicon deposited side-by-side with the nanoshells.\n\n\"The nanometer spherical shells really hit a sweet spot and maximize the absorption efficiency of the film. The shells both allow light to enter the film easily and they trap it so as to enhance the absorption in a way larger-scale counterparts cannot. That is the power of nanotechnology,\" said Jie Yao, a post-doctoral researcher in Cui's lab and co-lead author of the paper.\n\nFurther, by depositing two or even three layers of nanoshells atop one another, the team teased the absorption higher still. With a three-layer structure, they were able to achieve total absorption of 75% of light in certain important ranges of the solar spectrum.\n\nClever structure\n\nHaving demonstrated improved absorption, the engineers went on to show how their clever structure will pay dividends beyond the mere trapping of light.\n\nFirst, nanoshells can be made quickly. \"A micron-thick flat film of solid nanocrystalline-silicon can take a few hours to deposit, while nanoshells achieving similar light absorption take just minutes,\" said Yan.\n\nThe nanoshell structure likewise uses substantially less material, one-twentieth that of solid nanocrystalline-silicon.\n\n\"A twentieth of the material, of course, costs one-twentieth and weighs one-twentieth what a solid layer does,\" said Jie. \"This might allow us to cost effectively produce better-performing solar cells of rare or expensive materials.\"\n\n\"The solar film in our paper is made of relatively abundant\n\nFinally, the nanoshells are relatively indifferent to the angle of incoming light and the layers are thin enough that they can bend and twist without damage. These factors might open up an array of new applications in situations where achieving optimal incoming angle of the sun light is not always possible. Imagine solar sails on the high seas or photovoltaic clothing for mountain climbing.\n\n\"This new structure is just the beginning and demonstrates some of exciting potentials for using advanced nanophotonic structures to improve solar cell efficiency,\" said Shanhui Fan.\n\nSource: Stanford School of Engineering – 07 UC Merced professors and students discovered that changing the shape of a solar concentrator significantly increases its efficiency, bringing its use closer to reality\n\nA team of researchers at the University of California, Merced, has redesigned luminescent solar concentrators to be more efficient at sending sunlight to solar cells.\nThe advancement could be an important breakthrough for solar energy harvesting, said UC Merced physics Professor Sayantani Ghosh, who led the project.\n\"We tweaked the traditional flat design for luminescent solar concentrators and made them into cylinders,\" Ghosh said. \"The results of this architectural redesign surprised... more more\n\nA cheap material that can store heat energy collected from the sun during the day that can be released slowly over night has been developed by researchers in the India.\n\nThe material based on paraffin wax and stearic acid is described in a forthcoming issue of the International Journal of Renewable Energy Technology and could help keep homes warm in sunny parts of the world that get very cold at night without burning wood or fossil fuels.\nMechanical engineer Meenakshi Reddy of Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering and Technology, in Chittoor, Andra Pradesh, and colleagues explain how certain materials, known as phase change materials (PCM) can store a large amount... more"

Virginia Tech researchers are developing catalysts that will convert water to hydrogen gas. The research will be presented at the 228th American Chemical Society National Meeting in Philadelphia August 22-26, 2004\n\nSupramolecular complexes created by Karen Brewer's group at Virginia Tech convert light energy (solar energy) into a fuel that can be transported, stored, and dispensed, such as hydrogen gas.\nThe process has been called artificial photosynthesis, says Brewer, associate professor of chemistry. \"Light energy is converted to chemical energy. Solar light is of sufficient energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gas, but this does not happen on its own; we need a catalysts to make this reaction occur.\"\n\nOne major challenge is to use light to bring together the multiple electrons needed for fuel production reactions. Electrons are the negatively charged particles that surround an atom's nucleus, allowing atoms to react and form bonds.\n\nPrevious research has focused on collecting electrons using light energy. The Brewer group has gone the next step and created molecular machines that use light to bring electrons together (photoinitiated electron collection) then deliver the electrons to the fuel precursor, in this case, water, to produce hydrogen.\n\nThe researchers create a large molecular assembly called a supramolecular complex. Light signals this molecular assembly or machine to collect electrons and make them available for delivery to substrates.\n\nWater is readily available and cheap, says Brewer, \"but, so far, our compound is expensive. The goal is to make it catalytic and to couple it to oxygen production. We are working to build a supramolecular complex that will initiate the collection and movement of electrons and bonding of atoms without being destroyed in the process, so we don't have to build another molecular machine every time we want to convert water to hydrogen.\" Our systems do functioning catalytically but the efficiency needs to be enhanced."

We're the first to do so and to demonstrate that energy in the form of hydrogen can be stored with sodium borohydride at practical temperatures and pressures,' said Dr Kondo-Francois Aguey-Zinsou from the School of Chemical Engineering at UNSW.\n\nConsidered a major fuel of the future, hydrogen could be used to power buildings, portable electronics and vehicles, but this application hinges on practical storage technology.\n\nBorohydrides (including lithium and sodium compounds) are known to be effective storage materials but it was believed that once the energy was released it could not be reabsorbed. This perceived 'irreversibility' means there has been little focus on sodium borohydride.\n\nHowever, the result, published last week in the journal ACS Nano, demonstrates for the first time that reversibility is possible using a borohydride material by itself and could herald significant advances in the design of novel hydrogen storage materials.\n\n'By controlling the size and architecture of these structures, we can tune their properties and make them reversible — this means they can release and reabsorb hydrogen,' said Aguey-Zinsou, lead author on the paper. 'We now have a way to tap into all these borohydride materials, which are particularly exciting for application on vehicles because of their high hydrogen storage capacity.'\n\nThe researchers reportedly observed remarkable improvements in the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of their material, thus chemical reactions needed to absorb and release hydrogen occurred faster than previously studied materials and at significantly reduced temperatures — making possible application far more practical.\n\nIn its bulk form, sodium borohydride requires temperatures higher than 550ºC to release hydrogen. Even on the nanoscale, the improvements were minimal. However, with their core-shell nanostructure, the researchers saw initial energy release happening at just 50°C and significant release at 350°C.\n\n'The new materials that could be generated by this exciting strategy could provide practical solutions to meet many of the energy targets set by the US Department of Energy,' said Aguey-Zinsou"

Therefore, devices based on this approach can be oriented in any direction without the need to worry about gravity.'\n\nThe results of the Duke University experiments were published online in the journal Applied Physical"

      "text": "How to boil water using only sunlight\n\nBoiled water has many uses. It produces steam, which be used for energy. It can also be used for sanitation or desalination. But as anyone who has left a pot of water outside knows, sunlight alone is not enough to boil water.\n\nOr is it? Researchers at Rice University have devised a way to boil water using only sunlight - and small carbon or metal particles, which are smaller than a wavelength of light, which reflect the sun's rays and heat the water. The particles' heat is concentrated near the water's surface, creating a vapor bubble - and producing steam. In this way, only a small portion of a container of water must be heated in order for the liquid to boil - a small enough portion that sunlight alone can do the trick. The notion is a radical departure from traditional boiling, which requires that the entire container be heated.\n\n\"We're going from heating water on the macro scale to heating it at the nanoscale,\" said Naomi Halas, the director of Rice University's Laboratory for Nanophotonics and the lead scientist on the project. \"Our particles are very small — even smaller than a wavelength of light — which means they have an extremely small surface area to dissipate heat. This intense heating allows us to generate steam locally, right at the surface of the particle, and the idea of generating steam locally is really counterintuitive.\"\n\nStudents are already at work on potential applications of the technology, including a steam-powered autoclave, used to sterilize medical and dental instruments, and small-scale system for treating human waste in areas without access to sewage systems or electricity. Future applications could include powering hybrid air-conditioning and heating systems.\n\n\"This is about a lot more than electricity,\" Halas said. \"With this technology, we are beginning to think about solar thermal power in a completely different way.\"As a matter of fact...I just hope\n\nAs a matter of fact...\n\nI think the most important aspect of this is...\n\nI think the most important aspect of this, (if it truly works,) is that since the entire volume of water isn't being heated, more water can be added without bringing the boiling to a stop. Something I wonder about in large scale facilities that do produce steam. I assume they just pump so much energy into it, that it can overcome the new addition of water quickly.\n\nI have to ask, though, is this actually producing steam, or just fast evaporation? True steam generates tremendous pressure to turn machinery. This seems like a good system for making a constant trickle of condensation to produce fresh water, but run a decent size generator? Also, what are you going to switch to at night? Is your daylight production going to be so efficient as to store power for night time use?"

      "text": "Nanotech: Up and Atom\n\nA Nobel Prize-winning chemist says the impending world energy shortage requires several miracles of science that nanotechnology can help to deliver.\n\nSeptember 8, 2004 |\n\nLike this article?\n\nJoin our email list:\n\nStay up to date with the latest headlines via email.\n\nThe key to solving the biggest challenge of today could be small – very small – technology. Nobel Prize-winning chemist Richard Smalley says the impending world energy shortage requires several miracles of science that nanotechnology can help to deliver.\n\nSmalley, a professor at Rice University, and two other scientists won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery in 1985 of soccer-shaped molecules known as fullerenes or buckyballs. Smalley's carbon-based buckyballs have been instrumental in launching the burgeoning field of nanotechnology, in which new types of medicines, materials and computer chips are being designed, one atom at a time.\n\nHowever, Smalley believes that the most urgent mission for chemists to undertake is pursuing technologies needed for creating, storing and transporting renewable energy.\n\nC02 Denial\n\nLast month, Smalley challenged an audience of his peers at the American Chemical Society's National Meeting in Philadelphia to \"be on a mission to save the world\" and develop cheap and clean energy. \"Miracles happen, but not fast enough to solve the challenges ahead of us,\" he said.\n\nBy 2050, the world will need at least twice the current amount of energy being produced today, he said. The current consumption of energy, equivalent to 210 million barrels of oil per day, would have to be increased to at least 450 million barrels to support the world's growing population. And that energy production must not increase pollution.\n\nNuclear reactors will not provide enough energy to provide for a hydrogen economy, and relying on coal would only increase the real problem of greenhouse gas emissions, Smalley noted, adding, \"If you have been in C02 denial, take another look.\"\n\nCarbon Spinning\n\nBut Smalley's call for better breathing through chemistry recognizes many challenges. Scientists would need to use nanotechnology to create home storage systems for hydrogen as well as a new material to replace copper wiring and allow electricity to be sent great distances. Smalley and his fellow researchers at Rice are working on a new carbon \"spinning\" process that would create a polymer material that will be one-sixth the weight of copper with the same conductivity and have the same strength as steel.\n\nThis material could be used to send electricity over great distances, such as from solar farms in the southwest to New York City. \"We could be transferring 1000 gigawatts at pennies per gigawatt,\" he said, explaining that if the conversion of solar energy to electricity could be made more efficient by a factor of 10, large solar farms in six areas of the globe could provide all of the world's required electricity.\n\nSmalley described how nanotechnology can also be used to create \"super batteries\" for storing hydrogen at homes or businesses to avoid using the electricity grid at peak times of demand. Temporary storage is needed because solar and wind provide energy only intermittently. The batteries for an average home would be about the size of a washing machine and cost less than $1,000.\n\nWorld's Top 10 Problems\n\nSmalley believes that finding a replacement for fossil fuels is essential to solving the world's top 10 problems, which he said include poverty, hunger, water, the environment and terrorism. Affordable energy would also help to reduce the economic imbalance between have and have nots. \"The pharaoh did not live better than the slaves more than Bill Gates or I live better than the poorest two billion people in the world today,\" Smalley said.\n\nA substantial investment would be needed to create the energy technologies, which Smalley said could happen as soon as 2020, since, \"It's time to stop pussyfooting around and get it done.\" He outlined a nickel and dime approach – a 5-cent tax on each gallon of gas for the next five years, and then a 10-year tax of 10 cents per gallon.\n\nEven if the energy problem isn't solved by then, he said, \"At worst we will have created many new technologies and industries for the future.\"\n\nBeginning of the End\n\nGeophysicist Kenneth Deffeyes' research agrees with Smalley's sense of urgency. Deffeyes, a professor at Princeton University, and the author of \"Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Crisis,\" said the countdown to the end of the oil era will begin in approximately 15 months. Deffeyes, who also spoke at the ACS meeting, said that as of Thanksgiving 2005, half of all the oil on the planet would be used up. \"We should all give thanks for the era of cheap oil, because as of then, it's over,\" Deffeyes said.\n\nIn his book Deffeyes used the formulas of geophysicist M. King Hubbert, who accurately predicted in 1956 that U.S. oil production would peak in the early 1970s coinciding with half of all the oil reserves in the U.S. being consumed. \"The exploration game is essentially over,\" Deffeyes said.\n\nDuring the following decades, Deffeyes said oil prices will soar because demand will increase while no new supplies will be made available. \"The good news is OPEC is no longer in charge of the oil. No one is.\"\n\nJohn Gartner writes about environmental technology and alternative energy from his home in Philadelphia."

So what exactly is a fuel cell?\n\nWhat are they?\n\nOne of the most exciting applications of spongy nickel catalyst is in the area of hydrogen fuel cells. A fuel cell is an electro-chemical converter; that is it takes a fuel and an oxidant and produces electricity together with heat and exhaust chemicals. There are many different designs of fuel cell and not all of them run on hydrogen. Some designs are powered by hydrocarbons such as methane and diesel or by alcohols. Others use exotic oxidants such as chlorine. Hydrogen fuel cells are particularly environmentally attractive since they use hydrogen as a fuel, oxygen from the air as an oxidant and so as a result the exhaust is pure water. Consequently they are 'locally non-polluting'\n\nEven within the category of hydrogen fuel cells there are many different types, each with different operating temperatures, peak efficiencies maximum loads and designs. The information here relates to the alkali fuel cells that are being developed as part of the IMPRESS project. Do not be surprised if you encounter different designs that operate in fundamentally different ways and uses different materials.\n\nAn image of an IMPRESS fuel cell is shown next to an animation of its operation.\n\nContent on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.\n\nThe fuel store contains the supply of hydrogen, adsorbed on to the metal hydride surface. This results in large quantities of hydrogen being stored in a small volume but at quite low pressure. A standard external hydrogen store can hold 230 litres of hydrogen (measured at STP) in a container approximately the size of a soft drinks can at a pressure of three bar (three atmospheres). The unit weighs just 2.5 kg.\n\nHydrogen released from the fuel store reacts with the spongy nickel catalyst thus:\n\nThe hydrogen ions remain adsorbed on the spongy nickel catalyst surface whilst the electrons are free to flow through an external circuit in order to drive the load.\n\nOxygen from the air reacts with a separate catalyst thus:\n\nThe electrons are drawn from the external circuit and the water molecules are drawn from the electrolyte which contains a potassium hydroxide gel. The electrolyte gel supports the transport of K+ and OH- ions as well as water.\n\nBack at the hydrogen side the hydroxyl ions react with the adsorbed protons to produce water, thus:\n\nThe fuel cell has been around for a very long time; the theory was first published in 1838 and the first working fuel cell was presented seven years later. However these early cells were more demonstrations of scientific theory than economically viable products. When fuel cells became commercially available in the 1960s the high cost meant that they were limited to very specialist areas. For example, the electrical power for the Apollo 11 spacecraft that carried Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins to the Moon in 1969 was produced by a bank of fuel cells.\n\nOne reason for the high cost of fuel cells has been that the catalyst used to oxidise the hydrogen has traditionally been made of platinum, an extremely expensive metal. The total annual world production of the metal is only a little over 200 tonnes. Put that in context, if you poured the entire supply of platinum produced in the last ten years in to an olympic sized swimming pool it would only form a layer 7.5 cm thick. Environmentally speaking, platinum also has a large impact since a great deal of ore has to be extracted in order to produce a small quantity of the pure metal, typical concentrations in a good deposit are as low as 0.5 ppm.\n\nDespite this, hydrogen fuel cells are already being widely used. For example the European Union is funding a trial of fuel cell powered buses in several major European cities including London, Amsterdam, Madrid, Stuttgart and Stockholm. They have proved to be very popular and many of the trial cities have already committed themselves to purchasing more of these buses in the near future.\n\nFuel cells can be made in to compact, light weight units and the fact that they have no moving parts leads to very high reliability. This makes them ideal for powering equipment in remote locations. In Finland for example many families own small cabins on the shores of the numerous lakes, far from the nearest roads and power supply. To operate a diesel powered generator here, producing noise and exhaust fumes would largely defeat the object of the isolated rural retreat. Many Finns use hydrogen fuel cells of different sizes to power their cabins, boats and computers. It is even possible to purchase a fuel cell 'boosted' bicycle. All of these fuel cells operate silently and of course produce only water vapour as their exhaust.\n\nAs fuel cells become more compact and a distribution system for hydrogen becomes a reality we can expect to see fuel cells being more widely used. Iceland is already phasing in fuel cell powered public transport and working on eliminating fossil fuels from private transport in the near future. If you visit the London Science Museum you can see a scooter powered by an IMPRESS hydrogen fuel cell pack. The near future should also bring micro-fuel cells to power lap top computers and mobile phones.\n\nIf hydrogen can be piped in to houses then you can expect the home of the future to be powered by electricity generated from large, fixed fuel cells. Any waste heat generated could be used immediately to heat the house or stored for later use\n\nThe limiting factors to adoption are currently the high purchase price of the fuel cells and availability of a widespread hydrogen distribution system. The development in the IMPRESS project of spongy nickel as a replacement for the current expensive platinum catalyst should contribute to a dramatic reduction in cost and so drive the development of an effective distribution system."

      "text": "Novel nanowires boost fuel cell efficiency\n\nNew Haven, Conn.—Fuel cells have been touted as a cleaner solution to tomorrow's energy needs, with potential applications in everything from cars to computers.\n\nBut one reason fuel cells aren't already more widespread is their lack of endurance. Over time, the catalysts used even in today's state-of-the-art fuels cells break down, inhibiting the chemical reaction that converts fuel into electricity. In addition, current technology relies on small particles coated with the catalyst; however, the particles' limited surface area means only a fraction of the catalyst is available at any given time.\n\nNow a team of engineers at the Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science has created a new fuel cell catalyst system using nanowires made of a novel material that boosts long-term performance by 2.4 times compared to today's technology. Their findings appear on the cover of the April issue of ACS Nano.\n\nYale engineers Jan Schroers and André Taylor have developed miniscule nanowires made of an innovative metal alloy known as a bulk metallic glass (BMG) that have high surface areas, thereby exposing more of the catalyst. They also maintain their activity longer than traditional fuel cell catalyst systems.\n\nCurrent fuel cell technology uses carbon black, an inexpensive and electrically conductive carbon material, as a support for platinum particles. The carbon transports electricity, while the platinum is the catalyst that drives the production of electricity. The more platinum particles the fuel is exposed to, the more electricity is produced. Yet carbon black is porous, so the platinum inside the inner pores may not be exposed. Carbon black also tends to corrode over time.\n\nTaylor and Schroers engineered nanowires out of a novel material called bulk metallic glass in order to make fuel cell catalyst systems more durable and efficient.\n\n(Photo Credit: Golden Kumar and Miriam Schroers/Yale University)\n\n\"In order to produce more efficient fuel cells, you want to increase the active surface area of the catalyst, and you want your catalyst to last,\" Taylor said.\n\nAt 13 nanometers in scale (about 1/10,000 the width of a human hair), the BMG nanowires that Schroers and Taylor developed are about three times smaller than carbon black particles. The nanowires' long, thin shape gives them much more active surface area per mass compared to carbon black. In addition, rather than sticking platinum particles onto a support material, the Yale team incorporated the platinum into the nanowire alloy itself, ensuring that it continues to react with the fuel over time.\n\nIt's the nanowires' unique chemical composition that makes it possible to shape them into such small rods using a hot-press method, said Schroers, who has developed other BMG alloys that can also be blow molded into complicated shapes. The BMG nanowires also conduct electricity better than carbon black and carbon nanotubes, and are less expensive to process.\n\nSo far Taylor has tested their catalyst system for alcohol-based fuel cells (including those that use ethanol and methanol as fuel sources), but they say the system could be used in other types of fuel cells and could one day be used in portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones as well as in remote sensors.\n\n\"This is the introduction of a new class of materials that can be used as electrocatalysts,\" Taylor said. \"It's a real step toward making fuel cells commercially viable and, ultimately, supplementing or replacing batteries in electronic devices"

The problem has been generating sufficient energy to power what you want to power, and to do so with a unit that's conveniently sized for the application.\n\nIt's taken the motor industry years to develop a fuel cell capable of powering a car, for example. GM's HyWire is the first drive-by-wire car to be based on a fuel cell.\n\nSimilarly, Toshiba's DMFC is the first fuel cell to be small enough to potentially replace laptop batteries. The technology uses water produced by the fuel cell to dilute the methanol to the 3-6 per cent concentration required for the electricity generating reaction. The upshot: the methanol can be stored at a much higher concentration, requiring a much smaller (ten per cent) fuel tank. That means smaller, more practical cells.\n\nToshiba has also shrunk other key components, including the electronics needed to allow the host notebook to monitor and control power production so that none is wasted.\n\nToshiba will unveil a prototype DMFC at CeBit next week, but commercialisation of the technology is unlikely to take place until next year.\n\nIf it gets product out by then, Toshiba will probably be first to market. An Intel-funded start up, PolyFuel is working on direct methanol fuel cells for laptops. This delivers 150 watt hours hour battery capacity, three times greater than the best mobile PC batteries a day, but commercial product will take two-to-three years to get to market.

      "text": "A conventional lead-acid battery is a simple affair, made up of a series of cells each containing a positive electrode made of lead dioxide and a negative electrode of metallic lead. These are immersed in an electrolyte of dilute sulphuric acid.\n\nIn Axion's battery the negative electrode is replaced with one made from activated carbon, a material used in supercapacitors. Normal capacitors—those that power the flashguns in cameras for instance—can be charged and discharged rapidly, but cannot store much energy. Supercapacitors are meatier versions that are able to hold a reasonable amount of energy as well as taking it in and releasing it quickly. Some, indeed, are already used in tandem with the lithium-ion batteries in electric cars to boost acceleration and recapture energy during so-called \"regenerative\" braking. Axion's plan, therefore, is to have the best of both worlds by building a lead-acid/carbon hybrid, or PbC.\n\nThe primary goals of lead-carbon research have been to extend the cycle lives of lead-acid batteries and increase their power. Basically, developers start with conventional lead-acid chemistry and add carbon components to the negative electrodes. While the carbon components increase specific power and reduce a chemical reaction called \"sulfation\" that occurs during charging cycles and is the principal reason ordinary lead-acid batteries fail. Lead-carbon batteries are different from other types of batteries because they combine the high energy density of a battery and the high specific power of a supercapacitor in a single low-cost device.\n\nOver the last several years, lead-carbon researchers have followed three different development paths:\nthe following graph highlights the magnitude of the cycle-life improvements that lead-carbon technologies offer today.\n\nThis Sandia graph is the first time I've seen independent comparative test data for advanced lead-acid technology, advanced Li-ion technology and emerging lead-carbon technology on the same page. Since it's coming from Sandia I have no reason to suspect a technology bias.\n\nIn addition to the cycle-life data represented by the colored lines, the Sandia graph provides parenthetical power data expressed in terms of \"C rates;\" a measure of the time required for a battery to deliver its stored energy. For example, if a 10-volt battery has a nominal 100 Amp-hour rating, it can theoretically deliver 500 watts for two hours at a 0.5 C rate; 1,000 watts for one hour at a 1 C rate; 2,000 watts for a half hour at a 2 C rate; or 4,000 watts for 15 minutes at a 4 C rate. Historically, lead-acid batteries have had C rates of less than one while higher C rates have been the exclusive province of supercapacitors and premium-priced battery chemistries.\n\nAs the Sandia graph shows, they began testing the lead-carbon Ultrabattery at a 1 C rate, doubled the power and tested at a 2 C rate and then doubled the power again and tested at a 4 C rate. By the time the testing was completed, the Ultrabattery had survived more than 17,000 cycles at increasing C rates. This is just one series of tests, but it provides irrefutable proof that lead-carbon is re-writing the rules when it comes to both cycle-life and battery power.\n\nA 10-fold improvement in the performance of any technology is by definition highly disruptive. The fact that lead-carbon achieved these disruptive performance gains using cheap and plentiful raw materials that are readily available from domestic sources and easily recyclable for use in new batteries using existing infrastructure is an absolute game changer; particularly when the closest comparable technology is based on expensive imported raw materials that are not easily recyclable for use in new batteries using existing infrastructure.\n\nLi-ion technology can be a problem because it requires expensive imported raw materials, the bulk of the global manufacturing base is in Asia, the batteries are far too expensive for large-scale energy storage systems and there are many alternative uses for Li-ion batteries that are largely insensitive to battery prices\n\nThe best lead-acid batteries are more than adequate for many emerging energy storage applications and a new generation of advanced lead-carbon batteries will change the landscape dramatically. The Sandia graph is the first independent confirmation, but more information will become available as the lead-carbon battery developers complete their testing and introduce commercial products to the market.\n\nNormal lead-acid starter batteries do not compete well against Li-ion in terms of cycle-life or power. However the picture changes dramatically when you realise that lead-carbon batteries are expected to offer comparable cycle-lives and power for about 40% of the cost of Li-ion. Li-ion is the only rational choice for portable electronics, power tools, electric bicycles and hybrid scooters.\n\nThere is also little doubt that Li-ion will be the battery of choice for sleek packaging, size and weight. However, when it comes to large-scale energy storage applications like HEVs and utility support installations, size and weight are simply design issues. They are not mission critical constraints that justify paying a 150% premium for similar performance.\n\nIn another project, called Power Cube, Axion is putting banks of its PbCs into a shipping container, which can then be used as a mobile energy-storage system that can supply up to 1MW of power for 30 minutes or 100KW for ten hours. Power Cubes could help deliver power to local electricity grids that might otherwise suffer \"brownouts\" as a consequence of demand temporarily exceeding supply. They might also provide an answer to the problem of matching the supply of solar and wind energy to the demand for electricity, by storing electricity during the day, or during particularly windy periods, so that it is available at night, or during periods of calm.\n\nIn the early days of an industrial revolution, function is more important than form and fundamental economics drove the mass market to the cheapest solution. There is no reason to believe the renewable energy revolution will be any different. Lead-carbon batteries are game changers for alternative energy storage.\n\nPHILADELPHIA, February 1, 2009 – The future of transportation has arrived and it's safe, reliable, affordable and 100% electric.

      "text": "Textured Silicon for Cheaper Solar Panels\n\nSilicon is a very useful material thanks to its semiconducting properties. These not only allows for modern electronics but also some forms of solar panels. Unfortunately silicon is not always cheap as solar panels need highly purified silicon. This alone can account for 40% of the cost of modern solar cells. Researchers at MIT recently found a way to reduce the thickness of silicon used by 90% without sacrificing much efficiency.\n\nThe battle between cost and efficiency for solar panels has been going on for about as long as they have existed. This has led to the development of solar panels that use cheaper materials than silicon, but silicon still offers the highest efficiency. Researchers have considered shaving off some thickness to the silicon, to cut costs, but the thinner the silicon the fewer photons it can trap. The MIT researchers got around this by making pyramid-shaped indents in the silicon. This texturing increases light absorption of the cell without greatly increasing the surface area, which is important. The more surface area there is the more likely electrons are to lose their energy.\n\nThis new design has not yet been tested, but the researchers expect it will be able to convert 20% of the light that hits it into electricity. That is respectably close to the 24% we see with the most efficient silicon solar panels currently on the market. If this textured design ever comes to market itself, it will come without a great additional cost, because the tools used to etch the texture are standard equipment for etching silicon already."

These don't need extra anti-reflection layers (like typical solar cells do), which should help to significantly lower the cost of solar energy.\n\nThe specially designed nanostructured surface ensures that the light-generated electricity is still collectable in an efficient way from the solar cell, while still conferring the inherent advantages of a 'black silicon' material.\n\n\"The researchers made nano-islands of silver on a silicon wafer and immersed it briefly in liquids to make billions of nano-sized holes in each square-inch of the silicon wafer surface,\"an NREL news release states. \"The holes and silicon walls are smaller than the light wavelengths hitting them, so the light doesn't recognize any sudden change in density at the surface and, thus, don't reflect back into the atmosphere as wasted energy. The researchers controlled the nanoshapes and the chemical composition of the surface to reach record solar cell efficiencies for this 'black silicon' material.\"\n\nRegularly, solar cell manufacturers need to add an additional anti-reflection layer, sometimes even more than one, to their cells; this raises the manufacturing costs considerably.\n\nIn previous research, NREL has shown that its nanostructures reflect significantly less light than even the best anti-reflection layers currently used. It had previously been unable to achieve overall conversion efficiencies that could challenge other solar cells with these 'black-silicon' solar cells, however.\n\nTo reach these efficiencies, the researchers first needed to resolve why having an increased surface area on the nanostructure-featuring solar cells drastically reduced the gathering of electricity current.\n\n\"Their experiments demonstrated that the high-surface area, and especially a process called Auger recombination, limit the collection of photons on most nanostructured solar cells.

However it did also state that the process is immune to most impurities and can be done in a glass container at standard environmental conditions which is saying a lot. Even if it is just as efficient as current methods it could possibly be a little bit cheaper.\n\nAnd current solar cells that are available to the public are typically no better than 8%.

Although the article refers to the process of making O2 not H2.\n\nGathering the protons together has been a long time solved problem for chemists; the issue has been the other half: finding a catalyst that reorganized the O ions, hence the title of the paper.\n\nAnd current solar cells that are available to the public are typically no better than 8%. The ones that operate at 15% are gallium arsenide based and are used in satellites. And of course extremely expensive.Efficiency is how much of the sun's energy gets converted into usable electricity - current silicon PV cells are around 15%. But ultimately it is cost per watt, ...Some of the thin-film technologies are in the 7-9% efficiency range, but can be printed on a roll and do not need a semiconductor fab to manufacture them leading to dramatically lower costs. Nanosolar claims to be gearing up for $1 /watt production....Yes, and he commits another error. This is *primary energy* use, while electricity is a substitute for end energy use. In almost all applications (and certainly in electricity generation, but also in locomotion, and even heat when you use heat pumps) you find a factor of about 3 between both.\n\nThat means that the *electrical* capacity you need to replace, say 18 TW primary energy, usually turns more around 6 TWe.\n\nSo it is not right to say that we'd need 30 TW of *electricity* in 2050 (even taking on his numbers) - we'd need around 10 TW, if we would do everything with electricity (and if we don't, well, then we don't need that electric capacity).\n\nWhat potential do TED (thermo-electric devices) devices hold?\n(correct me if i'm wrong) -I realize that the efficiency is wretched; but what is so horrible about TEDs?

Come on mass production!!!\n\nwhy do you suppose Pickens wouldn't think TEDs weren't good enough to fund?\n\nNot much. TEDs, except for the radioactive ones, have like you said very poor efficiency. Not like 1 or 2% but like 0.01% if that. They are just not capable of producing large amounts of power given the resources required to make them work not to mention the cost of those resources. Would you rather pay $0.10/kwh for power from wind and solar or $8.00/kwh from a TED plant in a volcano?\n\nI should add that per the blogosphere the 20% panels are running $8/W, I don't have any other direct price information from those vendors. The panels driving the worldwide prices above are apparently ~10-12% efficient. Of course one would save on installation costs w/ the more efficient panels (less area required for a given power requirement).Well I know there is a huge amount of Natural Gas off of the coast of the Carolinas and Virginia. If the current prohibitions on drilling there were lifted, it would make a significant impact I think. Don't know if it would be enough to supply the entire US though."

The process is entirely carbon-neutral, making it one of the cleanest forms of energy production known to man.\n\nMicrobial fuel cells have been gaining support in the scientific community of late because of their ability to unlock a self-sustaining energy system. Penn State researchers believe that such fuel cells are the key to future energy production and will help the whole of the world transition from oil.\n\nConventional fuel cells require some external electricity in order to power the chemical conversion – called electrolysis – that produces hydrogen. This electricity is often derived from burning coal or oil. Researchers have built a new fuel cell that can generate hydrogen without the need for grid electricity, however, showing that fuel cells can be a carbon-neutral technology.\n\nPenn State is currently working on a larger version of the fuel cell that can produce higher volumes of hydrogen using a molybdenum sulfide catalyst instead of the more conventional platinum catalyst found in most"

Their process uses a mere quarter of the energy traditional semiconductor fabrication requires and eliminates the vast majority of the toxic chemicals needed, Kovio says. Developed at MIT and spun into a company in 2001, Kovio has taken in funding totaling $34 million.\n\nKovio's technology combines silicon ink with inkjet-style fabrication. The process allows the company to print low-cost, albeit low-intelligence, silicon circuits directly onto cheap, and potentially flexible, substrates. This means RFID and item-level intelligence can be built directly into products and labeling. Consumers will be seeing these circuits far more frequently and demanding green processes, Vik Pavate, VP of Business Development, tells Earth2Tech.\n\nThere's a reason chip makers wear those full-body Tyvek suits: Silicon semiconductor fabrication is a dirty business. \"The dirtiest room in the world is actually the clean room in silicon fab,\" Pavate says. By his estimates, it takes 62 million liters of chemicals, 17 million liters of hazardous gases and 2 billion kilowatt hours of electricity to make 100 billion RFID tags using traditional fab methods.\n\nKovio, he claims, can produce the same 100 billion tags using 5 percent of those chemicals, 0.05 percent of those gases and between 10 percent and 25 percent of that electricity. But perhaps the most important efficiency is the saved silicon. In traditional fab, silicon wafers are usually ground down to the needed thinness, wasting precious material. With printing, it's an additive process, depositing only the needed silicon where it needs to be.\n\nKovio is not the only one working in printed electronics. Thin-film solar companies like Nanosolar print thin layers of non-silicon photovoltaic materials onto flexible substrates. Also, organic LED fabrication, which GE recently demonstrated, uses printing technology to create illuminating circuits. But Kovio says they're sticking with silicon. \"We really like the idea of leveraging silicon as much as we can,\" Pavate explains.\n\nThe company has about 45 employees currently, but will likely ramp up as production begins over the next three years. Pavate says they're going after a market opportunity of \"a few billion dollars\" as RFID tags could immediately be integrated into access control, toll booths and livestock management. Once tags start rolling off the presses Kovio hopes to be rolling in the money; it isn't currently look for investment.\n\nImage of printed circuits courtesy of Kovio a salesperson with Mitsubishi Fuso Trucks in Milpitas Ca.

Jaime Schmitt, Phil McGraw and Kevin McAloon from Morgan Technical Ceramics look at the growing use of ceramics in solar cell production, which is bringing grid parity for solar power closer than ever before.\n\nC\n\neramic's unique physical, thermal and electrical properties make it a reliable,\n\nhighly durable and cost-effective material for the harsh environments found in solar cell manufacturing. It is being used to optimise the two key manufacturing processes, silicon wafer and thin film PV.\n\nIncreased productivity and efficiency can be achieved through using components made from materials that have a long lifetime despite the harsh manufacturing conditions and do not contaminate the PV cells. Innovative technologies and materials from Morgan Technical Ceramics, such as Pyrolytic Boron Nitride (PBN), are playing a key role, and the continual development of new materials with advanced mechanical properties will lead to further improvements. This article describes the use of ceramic materials in the two main solar cell manufacturing processes being silicon or thin film based.\n\nCrystalline silicon wafer technology The main solar cell technology, which accounts for about 80% of the market, is based on wafers of crystalline silicon. This technology is attractive to manufacturers because crystalline silicon wafers produce efficient cells and the cost of silicon has reduced significantly in the last two years. The first stage is processing polysilicon to create ingots of crystalline silicon.\n\nAccurate temperature measurement In the manufacture of crystalline silicon ingots the\n\nmelting process for polysilicon takes four to five days and the furnaces reach a temperature of 1600°C. The temperature of the molten silicon needs to be measured accurately to ensure it is not too high, which wastes energy and increases costs, or too low, in which case the silicon does not melt correctly.\n\nTraditionally thermocouples manufactured with alumina have been used for this temperature measurement, but in some cases they have reacted with graphite in the furnace at the high temperatures required. Now thermocouples made from new materials such as fully stabilized zirconia are being developed especially for high temperature measurements. These can be used in environments up to 2000°C degrees with less reaction with other materials."

      "text": "Discovery of a 'dark state' could increase maximum theoretical efficiency of solar cells from 31 to 44 percent\n\nDec 15, 2011\n\nThe efficiency of conventional solar cells could be significantly increased, according to new research on the mechanisms of solar energy conversion led by chemist Xiaoyang Zhu at The University of Texas at Austin.\n\nZhu and his team have discovered that it's possible to double the number of electrons harvested from one photon of sunlight using an organic plastic semiconductor material.\n\n\"Plastic semiconductor solar cell production has great advantages, one of which is low cost,\" said Zhu, a professor of chemistry. \"Combined with the vast capabilities for molecular design and synthesis, our discovery opens the door to an exciting new approach for solar energy conversion, leading to much higher efficiencies.\"\n\nZhu and his team published their groundbreaking discovery Dec. 16 in Science.\n\nThe maximum theoretical efficiency of the silicon solar cell in use today is approximately 31 percent, because much of the sun's energy hitting the cell is too high to be turned into usable electricity. That energy, in the form of \"hot electrons,\" is instead lost as heat. Capturing hot electrons could potentially increase the efficiency of solar-to-electric power conversion to as high as 66 percent.\n\nZhu and his team previously demonstrated that those hot electrons could be captured using semiconductor nanocrystals. They published that research in Science in 2010, but Zhu says the actual implementation of a viable technology based on that research is very challenging.\n\n\"For one thing,\" said Zhu, \"that 66 percent efficiency can only be achieved when highly focused sunlight is used, not just the raw sunlight that typically hits a solar panel. This creates problems when considering engineering a new material or device.\"\n\nTo circumvent that problem, Zhu and his team have found an alternative. They discovered that a photon produces a dark quantum \"shadow state\" from which two electrons can then be efficiently captured to generate more energy in the semiconductor pentacene.\n\nZhu said that exploiting that mechanism could increase solar cell efficiency to 44 percent without the need for focusing a solar beam, which would encourage more widespread use of solar technology.\n\nThe research team was spearheaded by Wai-lun Chan, a postdoctoral fellow in Zhu's group, with the help of postdoctoral fellows Manuel Ligges, Askat Jailaubekov, Loren Kaake and Luis Miaja-Avila. The research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy.\n\nScience Behind the Discovery\n\n• Absorption of a photon in a pentacene semiconductor creates an excited electron-hole pair called an exciton.\n\n• The exciton is coupled quantum mechanically to a dark \"shadow state\" called a multiexciton.\n\n• This dark shadow state can be the most efficient source of two electrons via transfer to an electron acceptor material, such as fullerene, which was used in the study.\n\n• Exploiting the dark shadow state to produce double the electrons could increase solar cell efficiency to 44 percent.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nConventional solar cell efficiency could be increased from the current limit of 30 percent to more than 60 percent, suggests new research on semiconductor nanocrystals, or quantum dots, led by chemist Xiaoyang ...\n\nResearchers of the Chemical Engineering department and the Kavli institute of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands have demonstrated that electrons can move freely in layers of linked semiconductor nanoparticles ...\n\nScientists have experimentally verified a theory suggesting that hot electrons could double the output of solar cells. The researchers, from Boston College, have built solar cells that successfully use hot ...\n\nVictor Klimov and Richard Schaller at Los Alamos National Laboratory have enhanced the phenomenon called \"impact ionization,\" which can significantly improve the efficiency of the conversion of solar energy to ...\n\nResearchers of the Opto-electronic Materials section of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and Toyota Europe have demonstrated that several mobile electrons can be produced by the absorption of a single light ...\n\nThe sun provides more than enough energy for all our needs, if only we could harness it cheaply and efficiently. Solar energy could provide a clean alternative to fossil fuels, but the high cost of solar cells has been a 12\n\nDoes this mean a lot of power comes from the dark side, quoth Darth Vader? LOL Keep it up, this and another discovery about 130 percent efficiency from a quantum dot solar cell. Love it! Love it! Love it!!\n\nI think they should always notate efficiency as absolute (energy created from all energy available.) - Rather than calculating the efficiency of a cell from the portion of the spectrum that it utilizes.\n\nI remember my engineering school back in the 70's when computers first started coming into college campuses in computer rooms on green and black screens with 2 color grafix. Our highest aspiration other than beer was to own a HP35 calculator, and microsoft was not yet an itch in ole Bill's greedy palm. Back then the internet was called 'arpanet' and only colleges had limited access as much of it was 'culllassssified'. Friends of mine were building solar panels out of wood frames with enough copper tubing to make a half dozen moonshine stills, and the bottoms had to be larded with fiberglass insulation to keep the heat in and on the tubes. One idea was to face the collector with one way mirror glass so the light would come through the backwards facing glass and heat the water filled tubes, reflect off the foil facing on top of the insulation layer...and reflect back and forth from the inside of the mirror glass to the foil..lather ...rinse ...repeat. Yeah we cum a long way since.\n\nI remember playing with an HP35 back in my university days. It was about the size of a microwave oven, had a 4 inch CRT display that showed all three levels of it's internal stack, recorded programs on a magnetic card about the size of a credit card, and had a fertite core memory.\n\nThe one I played with was connected to a plotter with a bundle of wires about 3 cm in diameter.\n\nYou know I was in chip design for two decades so I also started out with PDP 8s,11s, and the mighty PDP10, all great stuff.\n\nThe fact that computers today are literally millions times faster, cheaper, less power, just doesn't apply to solar power in the same way. Computers benefit from the reduction in feature sizes on an exponential curve going from 10u down to 20nm. The reduction in silicon wafer costs is a tiny part of that, silicon substrates are cheap but have very high energy content.\n\nA PV panel is nothing but a very large no of simple diodes on a large substrate using very course features. The cost of making substrates has declined much slower than you think mostly due to China using dirty coal to make this.\n\nNow the extra equipment needed like the grid tie inverters does benefit from the huge sale of PC switching PSUs to get them close to 50c/W peak. Inverters are PSU the other way around. Without PCs, solar panels and inverters would cost far more, but not zillions more.\n\nYou are talking about solar thermal collectors which is probably a far better value than solar PV for most home owners, and its a better way to exploit the available insolation, but then peeps want electrical too. The Carter Whitehouse had these on the roof top and not the PVs.\n\nThe really good tubes from Germany though don't seem to be that cheap. In Israel I think solar thermal on roofs is mandated on new homes"

      "text": "Tuesday, April 26, 2011\n\nScientists at the Naval Research Laboratory Plasma Physics Division demonstrate significant progress in the efficiency and cost effectiveness of light ions in the fast ignition of fusion targets. Light ions such as lithium or carbon are easier to produce technologically and the ion beam properties can be manipulated and tailored best to suit the necessary requirements for fast ignition.\n\nThe fast ignition concept has been conceived as an alternative to other approaches for nuclear fusion energy. In the fast ignitor scenario a high-energy particle beam, driven by an ultrashort pulse laser, is deposited into a pre-compressed deuterium-tritium (DT) fuel capsule and creates a 'hot spot' with temperature and density parameters suitable for ignition, approximately 10 kiloelectron volts (keV).\n\nInitially, the easiest path for ignition was taken using electrons, but it was soon recognized that numerous problems such as instabilities exists. The next logical step was to use ions, more specifically, protons. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that protons could be accelerated to relevant energies with conversion efficiencies of 5 to 10 percent and they were proposed as an alternative to relativistic electrons. However, the number of protons required for fast ignition is in order of magnitude two times greater than that of light ions that have a conversion efficiency of laser energy into ions of up to 25 percent.\n\n\"Presently, all efforts in the direction of fast ignition focus entirely on protons, but this continues to be plagued by problems,\" said Dr. Jack Davis. \"Our research strongly indicates that the use of light ions, heavier than protons, in the lithium to aluminum range is a path in the right direction for ignition.\"\n\nFor ions of the appropriate range, the beam energy can be deposited directly in the fuel, with high efficiency. In general, ion beams offer the advantage of more localized energy deposition, improved beam focusing, straight line trajectory while traversing the DT fuel, maximum energy deposition at the end of their range and suppression of the various kinds of instabilities.\n\nThe Ion stopping power — the gradual energy loss of fast particles as they pass through matter — results in a quadratic increase in the required ion kinetic energy relative to atomic number, but a decreasing number of these ions is needed to deliver the fast ignition hot spot energy, translating into a decreased irradiated spot size on the coupling target. The ionization density (number of ions per unit of path length) produced by a fast charged particle along its track increases as the particle slows down. It eventually reaches a maximum called the Bragg peak close to the end of its trajectory. After that, the ionization density dwindles quickly to insignificance.\n\nOther considerations such as tailoring the ion energy and angular distribution, which are responsible for ion beam focusing and energy density deposition in time and space, may turn out to be more important for the practical realization of the fast ignition"

      "text": "News in the field of ceramic, glass and related materials science and engineering.\n\nArchive for August 2010\n\nWeddings, vacation, illness, travel days . . . Looking back, sometimes there have been events that caused us to miss a few good ceramic- and glass-related developments and press releases. The stories in this grab bag have only a few cobwebs on them, so check 'em out:\n\nA fascinating report presented today at a science meeting in Boston describes technology that could capture large amounts of electrical energy from the air, energy that is normally manifest as lightning.\n\nA research group from the University of Campinas (Brazil) led by Fernando Galembeck thinks this air-based power source can be harnessed into a significant supply of electricity for a variety of consumers and lessen the dangers of lightening. \"Our research could pave the way for turning electricity from the atmosphere into an alternative energy source for the future,\" says Galembeck. \"If we know how electricity builds up and spreads in the atmosphere, we can also prevent death and damage caused by lightning strikes.\" He delivered the report at a meeting of the American Chemical Society.\n\nElectricity in the air is formed when water vapor collects on microscopic particles of dust and other airborne materials. Galembeck has been studing electricity in the air for some time.\n\nRecently, his group used particles of silica and aluminum phosphate, both common in the atmosphere, and according to Galembeck, found that that silica becomes negatively charged in high humidity and aluminum phosphate becomes more positively charged. They also found \"clear evidence that water in the atmosphere can accumulate electrical charges and transfer them to other materials it comes into contact with,\" says Galembeck. \"We are calling this 'hygroelectricity,' meaning 'humidity electricity'.\"\n\nSome of the groups work is discussed in a letter in a recent edition of Langmuir.\n\nGalembeck describes the concept of special photovoltaic-like collectors that could capture hygroelectricity and route it to homes and businesses. He adds that hygroelectrical panels would best in geographic regions with high humidity.\n\nHis group also envisions using the panels to prevent the formation of lightning. They believe that hygroelectrical panels on top of buildings could drain electricity out of the air, and prevent the building of electrical charge that is released in lightning.\n\nHe says the next step is to find materials with the greatest potential for use.\n\nThe American Chemical Society today distributed a story that came out of one of its meetings regarding the use of \"dry water\" powder as a medium for absorbing CO2, enhancing certain chemical reactions and storing emulsions. Although the story is interesting, it's not exactly clear to me if the CO2 angle, which is the one being played up, is really news. But, here is the scoop anyway.\n\nThe background to this is that Andrew Cooper and his group at the University of Liverpool have been playing around with uses for dry water for several years. Dry water is really just tiny water droplets that have been given a coating of hydrophobic fumed silica, except that it sort of looks like fine sand or sugar. What goes on with the creation of dry water is akin to the phenomenon one sees if a water droplet fall onto powdered mud: The water droplet balls up and has a visible coating of the dust.\n\nMaking dry water (DW) is apparently simple enough. It basically requires putting a mixture of water and hydrophobic fumed silica (19:1, by mass) in an ordinary blender.\n\nBack in 2008, Cooper and his researchers gained some notoriety because they successfully demonstrated that DW could be used to store methane (in the form of methane gas hydrate) in a powder form if kept at low temperatures (-70°C) or under pressure.\n\nThe thinking of Cooper and others in his group at the time was that since the DW/methane gas hydrate combo can be easily made, it could be used to store and transport large amounts of methane for use, for example, in cars. They said that in 30 minutes a liter of methane gas could be stored in just 6 grams of DW.\n\nCooper et al. also published an update on DW in late 2009, describing a method of making the DW perform as a gas separator and be recyclable by including a gelling agent.\n\nSo, the thrust of today's story is that Cooper argues that DW is being overlooked as a piece of solving the CO2 accumulation problem. According to the ACS release, \"Cooper and coworkers found that dry water absorbed over three times as much carbon dioxide as ordinary, uncombined water and silica in the same space of time. This ability to absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide gas as a hydrate could make it useful in helping to reduce global warming, the scientists suggested.\"\n\nBut, like I said, I am not sure what the news is here.\n\nPerhaps its more newsworthy that Cooper also described two new applications for DW:\n\nTo speed up catalyzed reactions between hydrogen gas and maleic acid to produce succinic acid, eliminating the need to stir the mixture; and\n\nTo transform simple emulsions into a dry powder, making it safer and easier for manufacturers to store and transport potentially hazardous materials.\n\nAccording to a University of Connecticut press release, researchers believe they have developed a new material that could be used as a catalyst in alternative fuel development.\n\nFeatured in the September issue of the nanotechnology journal, Small, University of Connecticut chemistry professor Steven Suib describes a method developed for the production of a nanosized crystalline material that can potentially be used for energy conservation.\n\nSmall fibers or rods of titanium oxide emanating from the manganese oxide-based template. (Credit: UConn.)\n\nThe material, sized at 100 nanometers, consists of two materials, one a template and the other a material that can grow around it in a well-ordered array. The growth can be controlled and its photocatalytic properties may be useful to drive reactions such as the splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen.\n\nAccording to Suib, the material can be a component of paint or can be applied to a surface, and will be useful in solar applications.\n\n\"It's very hard to make materials this size,\" Suib says, \"as small antennas come in and out of a surface that small.\"\n\nSuib's work with catalysts also expands to new oxygen reduction catalysts composed of octahedral molecular sieves of the the gamma form of manganese oxide (gamma-MnO2) and a small amount of titanium. We published a story on this work with active oxidation catalyst for Li-air batteries, which can be seen here.\n\nPV panels on the Mars rover Spirit were covered with dust over a two-year period. Credit: NASA/JPL.\n\nSelf-cleaning surfaces aren't a particularly novel idea, and self-cleaning glass commercial products made by companies, such as Saint Gobain, have been around in various products for at least five years – but at a premium price. These technologies use a TiO2 coating to photocatalyze organic dust that is then washed away by humidity and rain. However, for some dusty (e.g., nonorganic) materials, even this self-cleaning system doesn't work.\n\nThe cost and performance problems with these existing systems are unfortunate, especially when it comes to photovoltaic solar panels and mirrors, particularly when one considers that many utility-scale solar energy systems are being located in desert areas that are prone to large amounts of non-organic dust. In some of these regions, even dragging out a hose or water truck to rinse off PV panels and mirrors is not practical nor economically feasible.\n\nThe effects of the dust on these solar energy system are tangible. \"A dust layer of one-seventh of an ounce per square yard decreases solar power conversion by 40 percent,\" explains MIT visiting professor Malay K. Mazumder. \"In Arizona, dust is deposited each month at about four times that amount. Deposition rates are even higher in the Middle East, Australia and India.\"\n\nMazumder knows something about dust. He has worked with NASA on a similar but more difficult problem: Extraterrestrial dust. When the problem is dust on surfaces somewhere lacking Earth's atmosphere and weather – say, Mars or the moon – terrestrial technology just won't cut it. Lunar dust was nasty stuff for astronauts to deal with and is described as tiny pieces, sharp and interlocking pieces of glass or coral that is everywhere on the lunar surface.\n\nAccording to NASA, Mars dust isn't quite so bad, but still a big problem:\n\nDust is also ubiquitous on Mars, although Mars dust is probably not as sharp as moon dust. Weathering smooths the edges. Nevertheless, Martian dust storms whip these particles 50 m/s (100+ mph), scouring and wearing every exposed surface. As the rovers Spirit and Opportunity have revealed, Mars dust (like moon dust) is probably electrically charged. It clings to solar panels, blocks sunlight and reduces the amount of power that can be generated for a surface mission.\n\nNASA knew that dust interference with solar panel function could be catastrophic for Mars missions. Working with the agency, Mazumder and other researchers developed a novel self-cleaning solar panel technology for use in lunar and Mars missions.\n\nNow, Mazumder says the time has come to apply the same technology on earth. \"Solar panels powering rovers and future manned and robotic [NASA] missions must not succumb to dust deposition. But neither should the solar panels here on Earth,\" he says\n\nMazumder describes the technology he has in mind as having three parts. The first part is thin layer of transparent, electrically sensitive material on the glass or plastic covering of a solar panel. The second part is a sensor to monitor dust levels on the surface of the panel. The third part is a system to send a brief electric charges over the surface of the panel. Because, like the stuff on moon and Mars, most Earth dust carries an electrical charge, delivering alternating electric fields acting through the thin layer on the panel dislodges, carries and deposits dust particles off and away from surfaces.\n\nAccording to a news release, Mazumder says a two-minute process removes about 90 percent of the dust deposited on a solar panel. Further, his approach requires only a small amount of electric power, which can easily be supplied by the panel."

In addition, tests have shown they hold the majority of their charge over 3,000 charge cycles, many more than today's smartphone batteries. Magnesium is also cheap and abundant. However, the technology is still unproven. To be truly useful, researchers need to find a suitable cathode, something that has held back previous efforts. And this is where his computational approach comes in.\n\nProf Ceder and his colleagues have virtually screened more than 12,000 materials. Those that show potential are synthesized and tested. At least four materials are now being studied in detail. He claims that one cathode material has already demonstrated performance that would create batteries with greater energy density than today's lithium ion technology. He will not reveal more details, but it is enough to have attracted significant interest from investors and the US military. He has also established a start-up called Pellion Technologies to exploit the technology, initially for use in cars. However, if he is successful the technology could trickle down to mobile phones in years to come.\n\nApple juice\n\nIf and when it does, it may have to compete with another powerful contender for your future phone – the fuel cell. Like batteries, these convert chemical energy into electricity through a chemical reaction. However, these work more like tiny engines, converting the chemical energy from a fuel – an alcohol, say - into electricity through a chemical reaction with oxygen. And like an engine, they continue to run providing there is enough fuel and oxygen flowing through them.\n\nThey are an old technology dating back to the 19th Century and were successfully used to power elements of the early Gemini and Apollo space missions, for example. But they have now caught the attention of phone manufacturers because they have a high energy density. Simply put, fuels contain lots of energy. For example, hydrogen contains nearly 150 times the energy of an equivalent weight of lithium. However, to be workable they need to be small and have an easily rechargeable reservoir for fuel.\n\nTo build these, researchers are focusing on so-called MEMs technology - miniaturized mechanical devices and structures built using the patterning and etching techniques pioneered to build early computer chips. These are already used to make everything from solar cells to flat-screen TVs. Crucially, these techniques have advanced to the point where they can now be used to construct complex 3D structures – such as the networks of channels and pipes necessary for a tiny fuel cell.\n\nThe technology can be expensive, with precious metals such as platinum and palladium used to speed up chemical reactions, and hydrogen sources, even when compressed or in liquid form, taking up a lot of space. There are also the practicalities of having to moving and storing the fuel necessary to charge your phone on the go, not to mention the potential problems of handling potentially toxic fuels to make a phone call.\n\nHowever, companies such as NEC and Toshiba have already shown off prototype fuel cells for mobiles. And in December 2011, news that Apple had filed two more patent applications for fuel cells for portable electronic devices reignited interest. The applications showed the company is proposing the use of reducing agent sodium borohydride, which when mixed with water generates pure hydrogen, and that they would be used alongside a battery to cut down on size, weight and cost. The documents suggest the technology could power devices for \"days or even weeks\".\n\nBut, according to St Andrew's Prof Bruce, we should not get too excited yet. \"In the longer term there are these radical technologies which could transform energy storage for consumer electronics applications,\" he says. But, for the next few years, he believes, lithium-ion batteries are here to stay. Better remember to pack that charger"

      "text": "The plasma used in fusion reactors holds great potential in terms of bringing down costs of this energy source. Over the past few years, researchers have been exploring ways to contain and stabilize this plasma.\n\nDuring the International Atomic Energy Association's 24th annual Fusion Energy Conference, held in San Diego this week, the team led by Thomas Jarboe, Proffesor of aeronautics and astronautics at University of Washington, presented a method that uses around 1% of the energy required by existing methods, to contain the material.\n\nThe shape of the new tool resembles a handles on a coffee mug. It is attached to a vessel filled with plasma heated to 1 million degrees. The process of nuclear fission, where nuclear power is generated from splitting of an atom, is known to many, however nuclear fusion, where two atoms are smashed together, is still under research. It is established that during this process, energy is released without generating radioactive waste, or using rare elements.\n\nMost people know about nuclear fission, the commercial type of nuclear power generated from splitting large atoms in two. Still under research is nuclear fusion, which smashes two small atoms together, releasing energy without requiring rare elements or generating radioactive waste.\n\nThe main limitation of this process is the amount of energy needed in order to bring the atoms together. The focus of current studies is directed towards finding a way to produce more energy that the amount put in.\n\nJarboe commented on the method used in a big international project, based in France, where the teams are constructing a huge fusion reactor in order to generate fusion power. This reactor is designed to inject high-frequency electromagnetic waves, together with high-speed hydrogen ions to sustain the plasma. These two components should keep the operation temperature at a million degrees and enclose it with magnetic fields.\n\nAccording to the Professor from Washington University, however, the method is inefficient and too expensive. Therefore, together with his team, he has worked on finding better alternatives. They have investigated helicity injection, where spirals in the plasma produce asymmetric currents. These produce electric and magnetic fields that do similar job in heating and preserving the contents.\n\nThe high temperature of the plasma causes electrons to separate from the nuclei and keep it away from any contact with the walls, allowing it to be contained by a magnetic bottle.\n\nThe team found that although the required input energy is still high, it is a lot less than what is used in other existing methods. The system, however, was still vulnerable and any small twist in the plasma could disturb the equilibrium of the system and shutdown the reactor.\n\nThis presented a major challenge. The team's initial concern was leakage during a distortion of the bottle. They wanted to stabilize the equilibrium, so small shifts would go back to their original state. To do this, they imposed the asymmetric field, which stabilized the plasma and driving of the current was possible, allowing the bottle to hold more plasma.\n\nThe equipment that they developed has two coils in the shape of handles. They follow the so-called method of imposed dynamo current drive, where the \"handles\" generate currents on either side of the central core alternately. The plasma remains stable, the method is energy-efficient, however the reactor used in their study is too small to contain all plasma and gas still manages to escape. Whether a larger reactor would be able to maintain a sufficiently tight magnetic bottle, we will find out from the team's next publication"

And new developments at MIT mean it could happen in the next few years.\n\nEarlier this year, MIT professor Daniel Nocera made a discovery: By dipping a cobalt-and phosphate-coated artificial silicon leaf into a jar of water, he could effectively mimic photosynthesis and create power at an efficiency greater than today's\nsolar panels. Now two separate teams of MIT researchers have figured out how to combine a standard silicon solar cell with Nocera's cobalt phosphate catalyst--meaning a cheap, simple, artificial leaf is one step closer to reality.\n\nIn Nocera's vision of a photosynthesis-mimicking artificial leaf, a water-filled glass container would feature a solar cell with cobalt phosphate catalysts on both sides. The cell would be attached to a divider that separates the container into two sections. Upon exposure to the sun, the catalysts would generate hydrogen and oxygen bubble streams that could be combined to generate electricity.\n\nBoth teams of researchers have managed to produce functioning devices, but there is still plenty of work to be done to make sure that the device could continue performing for longer than a few days:\n\nRajeshwar Krishnan,\nDistinguished University Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the\nUniversity of Texas at Arlington, says it remains to be seen \"whether\nthis 'self-healing' catalyst would hold up to several hours of current\nflow … under rather harsh oxidative conditions.\" But he adds that these\npapers \"certainly move the science forward.\"\n\nNocera anticipates that the artificial leaf system will be ready in three years. In the meantime, Nocera and his company Sun Catalytix are working on a first-generation system featuring cobalt phosphate catalysts connected via wire to conventional solar cells. And eventually, a more advanced (and reasonably priced) artificial leaf could be sold to the billions of people who lack access to the electrical grid, but have plenty of access to the sun"

Future models of GPS trackers could also be powered by the wearable devices.\n\nResearchers from Cranfield University, the University of Liverpool and University of Salford were credited with the invention.\n\nIt would be a circular device that can strap onto the outside of the knee.

Credit: Alexandru Vlad/Rice University\n\nResearchers at Rice University and the Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium, have developed a way to make flexible components for rechargeable lithium-ion (LI) batteries from discarded silicon.\n\nThe Rice lab of materials scientist Pulickel Ajayan created forests of nanowires from high-value but hard-to-recycle silicon. Silicon absorbs 10 times more lithium than the carbon commonly used in LI batteries, but because it expands and contracts as it charges and discharges, it breaks down quickly.\n\nThe Ajayan lab reports this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.\n\nTransforming waste into batteries should be a scalable process, said Ajayan, Rice's M. and Mary Greenwood Anderson Professor in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and of chemistry. The researchers hope their devices are a step toward a new generation of flexible, efficient, inexpensive batteries that can conform to any shape.\n\nCo-lead authors Arava Leela Mohana Reddy, a Rice research scientist, and Alexandru Vlad, a former research associate at Rice and now a postdoctoral researcher at the Université catholique de Louvain, were able to pull multiple layers of the anode/electrolyte composite from a single discarded wafer. Samples of the material made at Rice look like strips of white tape or bandages Credit: Jeff Fitlow, Rice University\n\nThey used an established process, colloidal nanosphere lithography, to make a silicon corrosion mask by spreading polystyrene beads suspended in liquid onto a silicon wafer. The beads on the wafer self-assembled into a hexagonal grid – and stayed put when shrunken chemically. A thin layer of gold was sprayed on and the polystyrene removed, which left a fine gold mask with evenly spaced holes on top of the wafer. \"We could do this on wafers the size of a pizza in no time,\" Vlad said.\n\nThe mask was used in metal-assisted chemical etching, in which the silicon dissolved where it touched the metal. Over time in a chemical bath, the metal catalyst would sink into the silicon and leave millions of evenly spaced nanowires, 50 to 70 microns long, poking through the holes.\n\nAs silicon is dissolved in a chemical bath, a gold mask sinks to the bottom, leaving silicon nanowires about 100 nanometers wide poking through the holes. Because silicon holds as much as 10 times the lithium as the anode in a typical lithium-ion battery, researchers at Rice University and in Belgium are researching ways to recycle waste silicon into functional battery components. Credit: Alexandru Vlad/Rice University\n\nThe researchers deposited a thin layer of copper on the nanowires to improve their ability to absorb lithium and then infused the array with an electrolyte that not only transported ions to the nanowires but also served as a separator between the anode and a later-applied cathode.\n\n\"\n\nWhen combined with a spray-on current collector on one side and a cathode and current collector on the other, the resulting battery showed promise as it delivered 150 milliamp hours per gram with little decay over 50 charge/discharge cycles.

In fact they've been around for nearly a century. Though understood, thermoelectric materials didn't see practical applications until the 1960s, with work done by former MIT professor and president Paul Gray.\n\nThe cornerstone of the research is\nthat, even in the present, thermoelectric materials are typically\nvery inefficient. An efficient thermoelectric material must be good\nat conducting electricity, but not heat, a property most do not\npossess. A current MIT professor, Mildred S. Dresselhaus, and her\nteam are working to address the issue with new composite materials.\n\nWhat the team found is that engineering tiny structures into the material can alter the conductive behavior. Even structures as small as a few billionths of a meter interfere with the flow of heat, but allow electricity to travel unobstructed. The structures could be as simple as a matrix of nanoscale particles or wires.\n\nDresselhaus began her work in the 1990s, and the US Navy took interest. Air conditioning systems and power generation in submarines keep them from being truly silent, and advanced thermoelectric materials could provide a way to reduce both. Her current research in semiconductor materials and nanostructures is sponsored by NASA.\n\nRecent Other technologies, such as photovoltaics, most commonly seen as solar cells, could benefit from the materials as well, using not only the sun's light, but its heat to generate power. Materials could even be built into microchips, greatly enhancing their heat dissipation properties, allowing either cooler running chips, or even faster processing.\n\nThe work is not simply theoretical. At least one company has had minor success with a thermoelectric seat cooling device for automobiles. As technology moves, maybe we could see these new materials in every day devices, like kinetically powered thermoses that keep drinks cool or hot or solar-powered passive cooling systems for car interiors on hot summer days.\n\nComments\n\nThreshold\n\nUsername\n\nPassword\n\nremember me\n\nThis article is over a month old, voting and posting comments is disabled\n\nI particularly interested in the automotive applications. Imagine a gas engine that produces power not just in drive to the wheels, but also the heat released was used to generate energy for an electric motor.\n\nAlso would make cars like Chevy's Volt concept which use the idea of the gas motor just generating electricity twice as good. The motor would not only generate electricity from being a generator, but also the heat released would generate additional energy. Even things like regular generators would benefit from this.\n\nYou'd be using the power of the explosion of the gas in the chamber to generate power but also the resulting heat.\n\nquote: Recent\n\nI have perhaps missed something but for me, he is just emphasing this point.\n\nThe stability control systems have made them much better, you almost have to try to spin them out. AWD makes it easier to get around in bad weather but of course stopping is the one you have to worry about and AWD doesn't help there.\n\nOutside of that RWD is better from a performance/handling standpoint and makes for easier packaging. Plus the cool Dukes of Hazard maneuvers you can pull!\n\nBetter performance? WTF does that have to do with the drive wheels. Last I checked a 500 hp engine had 500 hp regardless if it were FWD, RWD, or AWD. That's like saying \"My dad's Camaro at 60 mph is so much faster than your mom's minivan at 60 mph.\"\n\nAlso majority of high performance AWD vehicles don't have a 50/50 split power. Usually 40/60 or 30/70. You still get the drifting nature of a RWD, while actually having the ability to regain traction at a moment's notice. STIs have an adjustment knob allowing you to change it from 50/50 to 40/60.\n\nUntrue. RWD distributes the weight of the vehicle better, and performs better under fast acceleration. Cars with RWD tend to turn better also, as you don't have a massive drive shaft assembly attached to your turning wheels.\n\nOn wet or icy roads, FWD has better traction however, and its slightly cheaper to build a car with FWD.\n\nHave you actually driven a rwd car? My GF has a 335i coupe with stick and I have a 08' Acura TL-S with 6M and I prefer her car to mine when handling at the limit. You can definitely feel that >60% of my car's weight is on it's front wheels. The front suspension also gets upset when I'm taking a long sweeper and hit a rough patch which all too common in socal roads. (Maybe that's why I'm not too sympathetic to snow belters, I can always take my Tacoma with BFG all terrains when I go snowboarding.)\n\nFirst of all, under acceleration, the weight of a vehicle shifts toward the rear of the vehicle, giving more traction to the rear wheels. This is why no racing cars have FWD. The reason why people think that FWD is safer on slippery roads is because when a FWD loses traction it understeers which the is a safer situation than RWD oversteer for the average driver.\n\nRear wheel drive has better weight distribution and places each wheel under more even loads, resulting in better handling and traction on dry roads. The more even weight distribution also improve braking performance as there is less tendency for any wheels to lock up under heavy braking. No front wheel drive car could seriously be considered a performance car. You wont ever see a BMW with FWD.\n\nThe disadvantage of AWD is it's significant weight increase and increased costs in both fuel economy and purchase price. They have more traction under acceleration, but I wouldn't be surprised if accident rates for AWD vehicles were not statistically lower than RWD or FWD vehicles. I have a selectable AWD vehicle, and even during the winter I hardly ever put it in AWD, and I get around just fine. I only put it in AWD after a heavy snowfall, before it is cleared away. I'm not even sure if I would get another AWD.\n\nUmmm...to the article author, if you look at the solar spectrum and the bandgap of silicon or CIGS, you will find out these materials already use some of the infrared radiation emitted by the sun. Both materials (since they have the same bandgap) operate over about 77% of the power spectrum emitted by the sun.\n\nThe thermoelectrics that operate on temperatures of 100 C or less use a completely different part of the 'heat' spectrum. Very far away in wavelength (~8000-12000 nanometers) compared to where the blackbody emission curve of the sun stops (for all practical purposes, this is considered to be 2500 nm).\n\nFormula 1 has changed its rules for the future, banning all engine development and opening up forms of energy recapture on the cars. Kinetic energy recovery systems are coming in 09, with hybrid drives possibly coming as early as 2010.\n\nIf you can get F1 to focus its engineering dollars on thermoelectrics, it will greatly speed the adoption of the technology in roadcars. I know some of the teams are already looking to thermoelectrics as a way to boost the efficiency of charging the battery in a hybrid drive layout. The efficiency possibilities are incredible if that system could be perfected.\n\nThe path from racetracks to the streets is well documented, with everything from fuel injection to composite materials making the jump. Even alternative fuels, in some ways, came from the racing world (American open wheel racing has exclusively used methanol and ethanol for more than 40 years). Probably the most significant leaps have been computerized engine management systems and all forms of traction and stability control.\n\nGet the racing world dumping their hundreds of millions into it, and we will have them a lot faster than if its being widdled away at by a few grad students with a $100k NASA grant.\n\n> \"You'd be using the power of the explosion of the gas in the chamber to generate power but also the resulting heat. \"\n\nIC engines are already heat engines; they use the heat from the explosion to expand a gas, which cools the gas and removes the heat during expansion.\n\nSo if you put a thermoelectric material inside the combustion chamber, you'll reduce overall efficiency, not increase it. These are useful for capturing *waste* heat which has already escaped the chamber itself.\n\nWell I didn't mean put the material inside the chamber. I was more thinking of parts of the block, the headers/exhaust manifolds, etc could be made with this material. That way the heat from say the coolant could be absorbed and made into energy. Heck, just make the radiator out of it and it could not only cool the engine, but produce electricity.\n\nI don't know all the limitations of it, but I'm just throwing ideas off the top of my head.\n\nUnfortunately, these aren't that simple to make, and they certainly aren't cheap (Though, not too terribly expensive either). If they become that much more efficient, then that may change the way many things are made, including air conditioning, refrigerators, even thermoses.\n\nStill, I'd rather use the waste exhaust heat to drive a turbocharger, and increase the efficiency of the engine. Until TECs get a lot more efficient, you'll get better use of that exhaust energy from a turbo.\n\nquote: Still, I'd rather use the waste exhaust heat to drive a turbocharger\n\nWho says you can't? If the inside of the exhaust manifold is made of this material, it will create energy off the heat of the exhaust. The exhaust manifold could still be routed to a turbocharger. Just because the exhaust is cooler doesn't mean it won't spin the turbo. In fact one of the biggest problems with turbo's is heat. With a cooler exhaust temperature, turbo temps would go down a bit (of course the turbo spinning at extremely high rpms will still create heat).\n\nNow obviously you wouldn't want to cool the exhaust gas too much since it'll lower the gas' velocity. But it's not like the entire manifold has to be made of the thermoelectric material.\n\nAll my point was is that there's a lot of heat involved with a combustion engine. If that heat energy can be converted into electrical energy, that'd be great.\n\nHeh. Actually, on the page I linked to, they show that their unit is downstream of a turbo already, so never mind.\n\nOn the exhaust manifold is too far upstream. TEGs only work where there's a delta-T; you need a way to cool the cold side otherwise both sides equalize and electrical output goes to zero.\n\nI Jet-Hot coated my exhaust manifolds to keep the heat in until it reaches the turbo. I guess on my car I could rig up some kind of large aluminum sheet under the body to act as a heat sink for a bunch of TE chips after the cat. But with what's available commercially today, and expecting about 1KW electricity out of it, not sure it's worth the trouble. That's 1.3hp, big deal. Too bad this article doesn't mention how much improvement they're talking about.\n\nRight, but by removing heat from the headers or manifolds (which I think you suggested), reduces temperature at the catalytic converters. That's where optimum heat allows them to work more efficiently.\n\nhmm no, the heat from the explosion heats the gas and the chamber, heating the chamber is of no use so if you use a chamber made of a thermoelectric material the efficiency would go up, more so if you take into account all the energy that is currently used to keep the engine temperature down.\n\nA thermoelectric material converts heat on the hot side to electrical energy. If that hot side is inside the combustion chamber, then you've just removed some heat from it, meaning the gas will be cooler, and less energy can therefore be extracted from it. You can't get something for nothing.\n\nNow if you power the TE with waste heat already escaped from the cylinder, that doesn't apply. But otherwise its going to lower the efficiency of the engine, if only slightly.\n\nWell, from what I understand, the thermoelectric material isn't some sort of heat vacuum that sucks it up, it simply puts the consequence of what heat does to metal matrices to work. In reality, the rate at which heat is lost is controlled by the heat capacity/conductance of a substance. If this thermoelectric material has the same heat conductance as the surrounding metals and materials that make up the cylinder and piston, then no more heat will be lost than normal during combustion. If the thermoelectric stuff has a lower heat conductance, then you'll keep the heat trapped in the cylinder even better than usual and increase efficiency (in ways that probably can't be noticed however, and vice versa). Now, from what the article itself says, good thermoelectric material does not allow heat to pass easily; i.e. has a very low heat conductance. In short, this stuff would be just fine anywhere as long as it can take the stresses, and shouldn't lower efficiency of an engine at all. Now, you wouldn't want to use the stuff in cooling fins however.\n\nWhy would you want that? I mean it's the gas that produces all the work, a perfect chamber would be a chamber that doesn't affect the temperature of the gas at all, since the cooler the gas is the more efficient the engine is.\n\nquote: a perfect chamber would be a chamber that doesn't affect the temperature of the gas at all,\n\nThe word your looking for is adiabatic, meaning no energy transfer from gas to cylinder wall, a perfect insulator.\n\nSince there's no such thing, the closest you can come to it is to have the cylinder wall equal to the temperature of the gas. There is no energy transfer when temperatures of two surfaces are equal.\n\nquote: since the cooler the gas is the more efficient the engine is.\n\nWay wrong. PV=nRT. The higher the temperature, the more volume*pressure or more work done. The hotter the gas, the more energy is output. No way around this. Cooling the cylinders ALWAYS has the effect of reducing efficiency. It's a balance of maintaing the hottest cylinder wall temp as possible, without compromising the material, or the fuel (knock), and ensuring long term reliability. From stock settings, there is quite a bit of performance tuning that can be done to engines, but the tradeoff is always going to be reliability and usability.\n\n\"Since there's no such thing,\" And where did I say it exists? I said a perfect... that already means by itself that is purely theory.\n\nIf you have to heat up and keep the cylinder wall at the gas temperature then it wouldnt be perfect.\n\n\"Way wrong. PV=nRT.\" Dude understand me correctly, PV=nRT, right?\n\nRight.... a couple F1 teams (BMW and Toyota) were using cooler than authorized fuel on their cars, the limit is 10° less than ambient temperature and they were like 13° less.\n\n\"Cooling the cylinders ALWAYS has the effect of reducing efficiency.\" Yes and today you loose on both sides one cause your cylinders will never be at the gas temperature, so basicly they take some energy out of your gas and also cause you have to cool them down to avoid any kind of problems. My point was why cooling it down using air, water and what not and instead use a thermoelectric material that would cool it down to the wanted temperature and at the same time produce some energy out of it, has it is now it's all waste.\n\nBecause that's the proper term, and anyone commenting on something technical with a percieved understanding would know what that word is, and not have to look for it.\n\nquote: And where did I say it exists? I said a perfect... that already means by itself that is purely theory.\n\nI never implied that you did say it exists. Your just reading more into my reply and perhaps getting a little defensive.\n\nquote: Dude understand me correctly, PV=nRT, right?\n\nErrr, yeah.....what are you even trying to say?\n\nquote: Right\n\nWhat you are talking about is intake air, which was NOT what you originally stated. You originally stated:\n\nquote: a perfect chamber would be a chamber that doesn't affect the temperature of the gas at all, since the cooler the gas is the more efficient the engine is.\n\nPerhaps you worded it wrong, but in that context it reads that the lower the combustion gas temperature, the more efficient the engine is. I'll absolutely agree that lower intake temps produce more power due to the higher density of the air. On a strict technicality, you don't want the largest Volume change, you want the largest PV change, which equates directly to work on the cylinder. Because you can increase volume while decreasing pressure for a net effect of zero work.\n\nWhile a perfect cylinder wall doesn't exist, they are pretty close at full operational temperature. With the issues of cylinder robustness, and extream cost differential, I doubt you'll ever see any thermoelectric coolers added to internal engine components ever. Now, I could certainly see benefits for these to be placed external and in radiators.\n\n\"Because that's the proper term, and anyone commenting on something technical with a percieved understanding would know what that word is, and not have to look for it.\" Maybe they would but what's the point of using a not so common word around here to express an idea, when a few more words do the same job while being understood by most?\n\nI'm not reading into anything, it's you said it doesn't exist, I was speaking \"in theory\" and you come around and say it doesn't exist like if it was some kind of news...\n\n\"I'll absolutely agree that lower intake temps produce more power due to the higher density of the air.\"\n\nYes but you insert the gas when the piston is going down in the cylinder, if this cylinder and piston are burning hot then the gas will expand opposing the piston when he moves up, this works against you and that's why I was speaking of a material is less thermal conductor if any, to influence the least the gas temperature, that said a material that would get hot and cold at the right moment would work to.\n\nSomething is wrong there. Part of the reason there was consideration for developing a ceramic based engine is that the ceramic material did not absorb thermal energy like materials used now, making the engine far more efficient since more of the thermal energy created during combustion was used to drive the engine. Ceramic engines absorbed so little heat they didn't need a cooling system. This isn't theory, they existed. Also, the ceramic material had such a low coefficient of friction that lubrication needs were greatly reduced and in some cases developers said they could eliminate the need for lubrication all together. What killed ceramic engine development though was the extreme cost of the material.\n\nCeramic coatings are used in dragsters, they ceramic coat the top of the pistons so that they don't melt for one thing, but also to keep the thermal energy in the cylinder for more horsepower. Do a Google on ceramic coatings to find a myriad of uses.\n\nI hope your not trying to contradict my original post, because that is exactly what I stated from the beginning. A perfect combustion engine would have zero heat transfer from the cylinder walls and have the highest cylinder temperature possible.\n\nbut you would need the processor to be chewing a certain amount of electricity constantly or to maintain a certain \"load\", otherwise theres the risk of underpowering devices. Try this idea with an older P4, a GPU, or my RD600 northbridge (yow!)\n\n(btw, try to use energy-reclaiming or energy-recycling, as energy-producing is somewhat... misleading :D)\n\nWith the waste heat generating electricity to drive elec traction motors on each wheel, the Internal Combustion motor can be reduced in size and yet maintain vehicle power to weight ratio.\n\nNot mentioned in the article, but if the heat is absorbed and producing energy, wouldn't this also reduce the cooling requirements of the engine/Turbo charger? If so, would this promote further development of higher combustion chamber and Turbo charge, thus also leading to cleaner burning engines?\n\nUnfortunately, they are being used as the exact opposite, as a thermal interface material that allows for better heat transfer than normal metals. If one could come up with a way to arrange them to do the exact opposite well, then that would truly be a testament to their versatility.\n\nWhat we need is a toxic free lightweight kinetic energy gel that can be put used in various parts of the car. It could provide safety padding for occupants while still producing energy from all the vibrations and bumps the car endures. You could even use it under the seats as a personal shock absorber. Wire it all up and you've got extra power for your electric motor. Does anyone know if anyone is working on something like this?\n\nI wonder if the advancements in \"solar paint\" or solar sheeting combined with ideas like these will ever provide us with 50mph fuel-free vehicles. I still contend that what we need is a solar panel topped monorail. I'd love to come home in fast moving automated pod. The commute would be short and I could check my email while zipping home. Large freight shipments could use the same rail. All kinds of safety features could be implemented to test for rail breaks and so on. The long-term cost of this versus what we spend on the HTS each year in this nation would be a lot lower. We just need a large company to begin implementing the idea anytime already.\n\nThis would be a phenomenal evolution in technology. If it could be translated into a textile, you could theoretically have a suit that actually repels heat. 'Air conditioners' could actually be placed into the skin of a house while powering devices in the house. It would be interesting to read a detailed analysis.\n\n\"Spreading the rumors, it's very easy because the people who write about Apple want that story, and you can claim its credible because you spoke to someone at Apple.\" -- Investment guru Jim Cramer"

      "text": "According to MIT News research scientist in the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms, Andreas Mershin, has built upon previous work by Shuguang Zhang, a principal research scientist and associate director at MIT's Center for Biomedical Engineering, to develop this new type of solar cell. Mershin's work has been published in Nature.com's Scientifi Reports.\n\nZhang's earlier research was able to take \"photosystem-I (PS-I), the tiny structures within plant cells that carry out photosynthesis\", stabilized it, and applied it to a glass substrate to create a very weak solar cell. It was so weak as to be useless.\n\nMershin claims that he has simplified the process so that even high school labs could create solar cells from PS-I molecules derived from plants. The resulting solar panels, while 10,000 more efficient than Zhang's earlier ones would still be too weak to be useless. They would need to improve in efficiency by 10 times to make them useable. Which is why Mershin wants to get researchers around the world to help improve the process.\n\nThe simplified process required that rather a flat coating on glass, the PS-I molecules had to achieve a three dimensional structure similar to pine trees in a forest where the majority of a pine tree's canopy is at the top with smaller limbs down the trunk to catch sunlight that leaked through.\n\nTurning that insight into a practical device took years of work, but in the end Mershin was able to create a tiny forest of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires as well as a sponge-like titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanostructure coated with the light-collecting material derived from bacteria. The nanowires not only served as a supporting structure for the material, but also as wires to carry the flow of electrons generated by the molecules down to the supporting layer of material, from which it could be connected to a circuit. \"It's like an electric nanoforest,\" he says.\n\nThe zinc oxide and titanium dioxide also absorb ultraviolet light that would damage the PS-I molecules. Both ZnO and TiO2 are found in sunscreen lotions so they are fairly cheap and plentiful.\n\nThe source of the PS-I is also cheap and plentiful. You can use simple grass or other plant clippings that are normally considered trash. While MIT does use a centrifuge to separate the PS-I from other element of the plant, using a filter would do the same thing eliminating the need for expensive equipment.\n\nWhile improvements still need to be made to the system, Mershin sees the final process as simple enough that a single sheet of illustrations would be enough to teach anyone how to do it. The only ingredient that would need to be purchased would be a bag of chemicals to stabilize the PS-1 filtered from plants. It would be cheap and simple enough that anyone in the most remote parts of the world would be able to construct their own functional solar cells.\n\nMeanwhile, Mershin and colleagues are continuing to work on improving the efficiency of the final solar cells and are hoping that the recently published paper will entice other researchers to help find improvements.\n\nOne day we may all be able to make our own solar cells out of whatever plant material we find and trash pieces of metal or glass as substrates.

Now, Penn State researchers have found a way to replace the platinum catalyst in their hydrogen generating microbial electrolysis cells with stainless steel brushes without losing efficiency.\n\n\"Stainless steel brush cathodes can produce hydrogen at rates and efficiencies similar to those we have achieved with platinum-catalyzed carbon cloth,\" says Bruce E. Logan, Kappe professor of environmental engineering.\n\nThe brushes used were made of 304 stainless steel, had a twisted stainless steel core and were manufactured on an industrial brush manufacturing machine. At an inch in length and an inch in diameter, the brushes had 48 square inches of surface area.\n\nIn order to produce hydrogen from microbial electrolysis cells that use organic materials, a small amount of electrical energy is needed. While the electrolysis cells will produce more energy than required to force the reaction, without the added energy they will not produce hydrogen. The researchers, who also include Douglas F. Call, graduate student in environmental engineering and Matthew D. Merrill, postdoctoral researcher in environmental engineering, also found that the stainless steel brush cathode needed to be placed very close to the graphite fiber brush anode for optimum effect.\n\nAt an applied voltage of 0.6 volts, the researchers produced about 5.5 amps per cubic foot using the stainless steel cathodes. This was achieved using both anode and cathode brushes cut in half and placed back to back. The researchers reported their work in a recent issue of Environmental Science and Technology.\n\n\"Stainless steel brushes show great promise in that they have high current densities and high energy recovery,\" says Logan. He notes however, \"one problem might be the stainless steel brushes' tendency to trap hydrogen bubbles which decreases the active area of the brush. The trapped hydrogen also remains in the reactor longer and is therefore available to microbes that consume hydrogen.\"\n\nWhile more stainless steel is required to manufacture the stainless steel brushes than the platinum used as a catalyst in the carbon cloth cathodes, because of the great difference in costs between platinum and stainless steel, the stainless steel brushes are five times less expensive than the platinum catalyzed cathodes"

Hematite (α-Fe2O3) has emerged as a promising photo-electrode material due to its significant light absorption, chemical stability in aqueous environments, and ample abundance. However, its performance as a water-oxidizing photoanode has been crucially limited by poor optoelectronic properties that lead to both low light harvesting efficiencies and a large requisite overpotential for photoassisted water oxidation. Recently, the application of nanostructuring techniques and advanced interfacial engineering has afforded landmark improvements in the performance of hematite photoanodes. In this review, new insights into the basic material properties, the attractive aspects, and the challenges in using hematite for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting are first examined. Next, recent progress enhancing the photocurrent by precise morphology control and reducing the overpotential with surface treatments are critically detailed and compared. The latest efforts using advanced characterization techniques, particularly electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, are finally presented. These methods help to define the obstacles that remain to be surmounted in order to fully exploit the potential of this promising material for solar energy conversion."

So we are changing this,\" says Mr Ngigi.\n\nOne comment\n\nGreat idea, Anthony!! I think we have ways to work together if you like…my patented PortaPocket works symbiotically with many new tech devices… esp for things which need cell phone in close proximity (like Pebble, etc). If people want to charge their phone while in progress, it'd be simple to strap the cell on the ankle right near the shoe so no long cable would be necessary. It's simply the easiest way to hands-free carry the things you need, practically ANYwhere on the body. Detachable & interchangeable pockets allow for enormous versatility and adaptability. Maybe there's a way to incorporate my carrier with your device when clients purchase such that there is an answer already provided for them. Just a thought… See more of what I mean at"

The fuel cell units themselves are incredibly resilient to damage and can continue generating tremendous amounts of electricity hours after they have been cut off from their fuel supply. The report notes that stationary fuel cells are amongst the best UPS power systems currently available.\n\nPike notes that stationary fuel cells are effective energy systems because they can, essentially, fuel themselves. The fuel cell generates hydrogen through a series of chemical processes. These processes are instigated by a catalyst, usually made of platinum, charged with a gentle electric current. Most fuel cells are fed electricity from a power grid, but stationary fuel cells could power themselves by converting the hydrogen they produce into electricity. The report shows that these fuel cells have been very reliable during natural disasters in Japan and much of Europe.\n\nFuel cells continue to gain momentum in the world of alternative energy, but are still criticized for their expensive nature.

Led by Prof. Kyung-Cheol Choi, the KAIST team discovered a new type of surface plasmon enhanced OLED. KAIST explains their finding thusly: \"For surface plasmon localization, silver nanoparticles were thermally deposited in a high vacuum on cathode. Since plasmons provide a strong oscillator decay channel, time-resolved photoluninescene (PL) results displayed a 1.75-fold increased emission rate.\" In other words, the revamped OLED is 75% more efficient.\n\nOLEDs will always have one thing working against them: limited lifespan. The organic compounds that make up the emissive electroluminescent layer of the LED will degrade over time. HDTV Info Europe notes that, \"OLED technology is in many ways a better technology then LCD technology, but the use of organic materials that degrade gives them a lifespan that's around 40% less than a standard LCD screen.\" Display Search analyzed Sony's XEL-1 OLED TV and determined that, \"Lifetime for white at t50 is calculated to be 5,000 hours with initial luminance of 208 cd/m²,\" while, \"Lifetime for a video image is calculated to be 17,000 hours with initial luminance of 334 cd/m².\" They also noted that, \"There are well documented differential aging situations and after 1,000 hours of displaying a white image, the red luminance degraded by 7%, the green by 8% and the blue by 12%.\"\n\nAdvocates of OLED technology prefer to tout its strengths: larger selection of colors, brightness, contrast, and viewing angle (when compared to the typical LCD). OLEDs also have no need for a backlight, which makes them thinner than an LCD equivalent. Finally, OLEDs have a much faster response time than LCDs. LCDs clock in at around 2 ms, while OLED has <0.01 ms response time. If we take these advantages into account, they nearly make up for OLED's major deficiency. The KAIST discovery is icing on the cake.\n\nHigher efficiency equals lower power consumption. Lower power consumption equals lower electricity bills (how much lower is a matter of debate). This is the same argument made on behalf of nearly every new technology, especially those concerning energy. Will consumers make that initial investment? The best way to sell OLEDs to the public is to tout its aesthetic and technological superiority over what's currently offered. The general public won't care about its environmental benefits. This KAIST discovery is a great boon to OLED advocates."

      "text": "Like batteries, fuel cells produce electrical energy through an electrochemical process. Unlike batteries, fuel cells are \"conversion\" devices that change some kind of chemical fuel into electricity. Like combustion engines, fuel cells \"convert\" fuel into energy, but in this case the energy is electricity, not kinetic (movement) or heat.Fuel cells can't directly store electrical energy, but they may have a great deal of flexibility in fuels. Possible fuels include hydrocarbons like natural gas or alcohol, or even metals like aluminum. Many designs operate best on hydrogen gas; others can operate on utility-grade natural gas or propane.Fuel cell sizes range from tiny portable units that can be held in the hand to massive stacks the size of a two-story building. Smaller fuel cells can be combined into stacks with an effectively unlimited size.This report considers residential, commercial and military medium-sized power generation applications for fuel cells too large to be easily portable and smaller utility-scale units. Fuel cells used to power vehicles or small portable products are not considered. The market is divided into three main categories:\n\nCombined Heating and Power (CHP).\n\nAuxiliary Power Units (APU).\n\nEmergency.\n\nFuel cell types most appropriate for these applications include Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) and Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs), but other types, like molten carbonate, alkaline and phosphoric acid fuel cells, can be used in some specific medium-sized applications.\n\nCHP fuel cells integrate the production of usable heat and power (electricity) in one single, highly efficient process. CHP generates electricity whilst also capturing usable heat that is produced in this process. This contrasts with conventional ways of generating electricity whereby a vast amount of heat is simply wasted. In today's coal- and gas-fired power stations, up to two-thirds of the overall energy consumed is lost in this way—often seen as a cloud of steam rising from cooling towers. Their relative sophistication means that the overall efficiency of CHP plants can reach in excess of 80% at the point of use.\n\nAuxiliary power units (APUs) and emergency power fuel cells only generate electricity (not heat). The distinction between an APU and an emergency power unit depends on the service profile: continuous versus standby/intermittent. Advantages include long service life, ability to operate using a variety of fuels and relatively low cost for the functionality. Specific applications include emergency or backup power for residences or commercial facilities, telecommunications backup power supplies, signage power, recreational vehicle power, aircraft auxiliary power, and anti-idling power for commercial diesel vehicles. Power generators provide off-grid power during a blackout, in emergencies, in remote locations or when vehicles are parked.\n\nREASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY\n\nThis report can also provide valuable information in terms of assessing investment in particular residential, commercial, and military fuel cell market and will be of interest to a variety of current and potential fuel cell users and integrators as well as competing battery, fuel cell and conventional power generation makers.BCC Research wishes to thank those companies, government agencies, and university researchers that contributed information for this report.\n\nSCOPE AND FORMAT\n\nThis report discusses the values of the North American, European, Far Eastern and Rest-of-World markets.

      "text": "Fuel Cell Power has been set up by the family and friends of the late Dr F T Bacon, OBE, FRS, the fuel cell pioneer. We have no commercial interests and provide the facts about all types of fuel cells and their supporting infrastructure.\n\nTom Bacon developed the first practical working fuel cell and was delighted when his design was used successfully in the Apollo Space project. The next stage was to encourage the widespread application of fuel cells. The basic difficulty is that existing technologies are refined through practical experience and the long development times make it more difficult to introduce and fund new, more effective methods.\n\nHe believed that local fuel cells could be introduced to provide a clean, efficient source of electricity, independent of the national grid.\n\nHis vision extended far into the future and he was concerned about the effects of burning fossil fuels and discharging the products of combustion into the atmosphere. Apart from the damage caused to our cities and countryside by air pollution, climate change could pose a danger for future generations and contribute to the loss of many species.\n\nTo the end of his life in 1992, Tom Bacon actively supported the developers of fuel cell technologies and passed on to those entering the field his 60 years of expertise. His big ambition was to develop the fuel cell to power transport and he was excited to see the first prototype hydrogen fuel cell powered buses coming into operation in Europe and Canada.\n\nTom Bacon's family and friends continue his promotional work through Fuel Cell Power's efforts to provide full and accurate information about all types of fuel cells.\n\nFuel Cell Power is promoting the implementation of hydrogen fuel cells, particularly in conjunction with renewable energy sources. The burning of fossil fuels must be superseded by this new clean and efficient method of electrochemical conversion of fuel.\n\nThe daughter of Tom Bacon, Daphne Vivian-Neal is seen here on the fuel cell powered Palcan scooter at the recent Grove Symposium. Jean Aldous, who set up Fuel Cell Power with help from Daphne and her brother Edward Bacon, is seen in the background discussing the merits of the scooter."

More particularly, an aspect of an embodiment of the\ninvention relates to use of solar receivers focusing solar power on a\nunit containing a chemical reactor to heat gas up to temperatures such,\nas 1500 degrees Celsius or lower as an upper temperature limit, in order\nto form a hydrocarbon fuel, such as methanol, and possibly drive a\nBrayton turbine engine.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0004]Carbon dioxide may be put to use in beneficial applications such as\ngeneration of a hydrocarbon fuel including methanol and gasoline.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0005]In general, various methods, apparatuses, and systems are described\nto use products from a solar assisted Reverse-water-gas-shift reaction\n(RWGS) the hydrogen molecules from the water splitter or\nthe RWGS reaction and the resultant stabilized carbon monoxide molecules\nfrom the RWGS reaction in the hydrocarbon fuel synthesis process to\ncreate a liquid hydrocarbon fuel.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0006]The drawings refer to embodiments of the invention in which:\n\n[0007]FIG. 1 illustrates an embodiment of a solar assisted process to\ncreate a liquid fuel;\n\n[0013]While the invention is subject to various modifications and\nalternative forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of\nexample in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. The\ninvention should be understood to not be limited to the particular forms\ndisclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all\nmodifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit\nand scope of the invention.\n\nDETAILED DISCUSSION\n\n[0014]In the following description, numerous specific details are set\nforth, such as examples of named components, connections, types of\ncatalyst, etc., in order to provide a thorough understanding of the\npresent invention. It will be apparent, however, to one of ordinary skill\nin the art that the present invention may be practiced without these\nspecific details. In other instances, well known components or methods\nhave not been described in detail but rather in a block diagram in order\nto avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. Further specific\nnumeric references such as first portion of gas, may be made. However,\nthe specific numeric reference should not be interpreted as a literal\nsequential order but rather interpreted that the first portion of gas is\ndifferent than a second portion of gas. Thus, the specific details set\nforth are merely exemplary. The specific details may be varied from and\nstill be contemplated to be within the spirit and scope of the present\ninvention.\n\n[0015]In general, a method, apparatus, and system are described in which\nproducts from a solar assisted reverse-water-gas-shift reaction are used\nin a hydrocarbon fuel synthesis process to create a liquid hydrocarbon\nfuel. An array of heliostats focuses solar energy to a\nsolar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchanger to heat the carbon dioxide gas. A\nwater splitter with one or more electrolysis cells splits water molecules\ninto hydrogen molecules and oxygen molecules via the addition of the\nsolar energy also directed from either 1) the same array of heliostats\nvia a beam splitter off a common receiving tower redirecting a portion of\nthe electromagnetic spectrum, 2) a separate heliostat field dedicated for\nthe water splitter, or 3) from its own parabolic trough. A chemical\nreactor chamber mixes the heated carbon dioxide gas with all or just a\nportion of the hydrogen molecules generated from the water splitter in a\nreverse-water-gas-shift reaction to produce resultant carbon monoxide. A\nhydrocarbon liquid fuel synthesis reactor receives and uses the hydrogen\nmolecules and the resultant stabilized carbon monoxide molecules from the\nreverse-water-gas-shift reaction in the hydrocarbon fuel synthesis\nprocess to create a liquid hydrocarbon fuel.\n\n[0016]Essentially, two main embodiments, as well as a couple of other\nembodiments, are described.\n\n[0017]The first solar assisted embodiment has all of the moles of hydrogen\ngenerated from the water splitter being heated up and run through the\nreverse water gas shift reaction. The heated hydrogen gas, carbon dioxide\ngas, and resultant carbon monoxide will then be cooled by exchanging\ntheir energy to preheat the feed gases. The unconsumed hydrogen from the\nRWGS is routed in whole to the fuel synthesis process and during the\nrouting is used in a recuperator to preheat new feed gases for the RWGS\nreaction.\n\n[0018]The second solar assisted embodiment merely heats up a portion of\nthe moles of hydrogen generated from the water splitter and then sends\nthe other portion of the non-superheated moles of hydrogen to the fuel\nsynthesis process. The unconsumed hydrogen from the RWGS along with any\nunconsumed carbon dioxide may be recycled back into the RWGS to preheat\nnew feed gases for the RWGS reaction. Therefore, merely the heated carbon\nmonoxide from the RWGS needs to be cooled enough to be sent to the fuel\nsynthesis process while the non-superheated moles of hydrogen may already\nbe close to the right temperature.\n\n[0019]In both of these embodiments, more moles of hydrogen are supplied to\nthe RWGS reaction than is needed for equilibrium in order to overdrive\nthe reaction to maximize the carbon monoxide production. In both of these\nembodiments, a variety of solar receivers can be used to direct the solar\nenergy and a variety of electrolysis cells may be used to generate\nhydrogen. In both embodiments, a small percentage of the carbon dioxide\nmay be sent along with the carbon monoxide and hydrogen to the fuel\nsynthesis process. The small percentage, such as between 0.1% to 3% by\nvolume of carbon dioxide, helps the fuel synthesis process.\n\n[0020]Thus, the water splitting process and the reverse-water-gas-shift\nreaction process produce synthesis gas (a gas combination including\ncarbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2)) via the addition of solar energy.\nThe resultant synthesis gas from the RWGS reaction may be used to create\nany number of hydrocarbon liquid fuels, such as methanol, ethanol, diesel\nfuel, gasoline and crude oil.\n\n[0021]The Sun's energy may be concentrated by solar receivers, via one or\nmore arrays of heliostats, a parabolic trough or dish, etc., to provide\nthe energy needed for the chemical transformations to occur in the RWGS\nunit and be concentrated via one of the three example methods above for\nthe H2O splitting process. The Sun's energy may be also coupled to a\nprocess for driving a Brayton turbine engine or photovoltaic solar cells\nfor generating electricity.\n\nOperation of the Reactor\n\n[0022]FIG. 1 illustrates solar assisted processes of water splitting and a\nRWGS reaction to supply a synthesis gas to a liquid fuel synthesis\nprocess to create a liquid fuel. Water is supplied to a water (H2O)\nsplitter 02 that uses the energy of the sun to disassociate the H2O into\nH2 and O2 molecules. The produced hydrogen gas is supplied to the RWGS\nunit 04. The RWGS unit 04 also receives a supply of carbon dioxide (CO2).\nThe RWGS unit 04 heats both the hydrogen and carbon dioxide with the\nenergy of the Sun and then uses the heated gases in a RWGS reaction to\nproduce synthesis gas. The synthesis gas from the RWGS reaction may be\nused in a recuperator 05 to preheat the incoming feed gases of hydrogen\nand carbon dioxide. The synthesis gas is supplied to a liquid fuel\nsynthesizer 08. The liquid fuel synthesizer 08 converts the synthesis gas\nto liquid fuel. The liquid fuel synthesizer 08 may produce fuel and have\nleft over carbon dioxide, and any imbalance of carbon monoxide or\nhydrogen left from the synthesis process. All three of these gases can be\nrecycled back to the CO2 recirculation point back into the RWGS unit 04.\n\n[0024]Referring to FIG. 1a, a water splitter 102a that uses one or more\nelectrolysis cells 180, including photoelectrolysis cells, high\ntemperature electrolysis cells, and similar cells, can be used to supply\nhydrogen gas into a unit 104 that generates synthesis gas for a fuel\nproduction unit 108 to generate a hydrocarbon liquid fuel, such as\nmethanol.\n\n[0025]The RWGS unit 104 may also contain sections such as a\nsolar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchanger 122, a chemical reactor 106a, a H2 gas\nsupply line 124, which can be supplied by the water splitter or other H2\nsources, the carbon dioxide gas supply line 126, and other gas supply\nlines 128, a quenching unit 130, a heat recuperator 105a, and other\nsimilar components. This solar assisted embodiment may have substantially\nall of the moles of hydrogen generated from the water splitter 102a being\nheated up and run through the RWGS reaction in the chemical reaction\nchamber 106a.\n\n[0026]Referring to FIG. 1b, the unit 104 may also include a H2\nrecirculation loop 110, a carbon monoxide (CO) recirculation loop 112,\nand a carbon dioxide recirculation loop 114 and could be either discrete\nloops or combined. The RWGS unit 104 may also contain sections such as a\nwater condenser/separator 120, and other similar components. The Sun's\nenergy may also be stored within the RWGS unit 104 in a storage unit 116\nfor continued operations at night, or may be stored directly in a solar\nreceiver. The RWGS unit 104 may also have an alternative supply of energy\n118 for supplemental power or primary power in times of inadequate solar\npower or maintenance. This solar assisted embodiment may merely heat up a\nportion of the moles of hydrogen generated from the water splitter 102b\nin the RWGS reaction and send the remaining portion of the\nnon-superheated moles directly to the fuel synthesis process 108.\n\n[0027]In both of these solar assisted embodiments, more moles of hydrogen\nare supplied to the RWGS reaction than needed for equilibrium in order to\noverdrive the reaction to maximize the carbon monoxide production.\n\n[0028]The Chemical Operation may be Summed:\n\n[0029]1. Water (H2O) is split into Hydrogen (H2) molecules and Oxygen (O2)\nmolecules (2 H2O+energy→H2+O2) via the addition of solar power in\ncombination with standard H2O cleaving techniques, water splitting with a\nTitanium based alloy, high temperature electrolysis, or other similar\ntechniques. The water splitter 102 may be a tower mounted device that\ncontains clear tubes, such as quartz or borosilicate, that are filled\nwith water in the form of gas or liquid reacting with the titanium.\nAnother example form the water splitter 102 may take is a parabolic\ntrough system.\n\n[0030]2. The carbon dioxide gas is heated by the solar receivers, such as\nheliostats 134, directing the rays of the Sun to the\nsolar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchanger 122 to a steady state temperature\nbetween 200-1000 degrees Celsius as the gas exits the heat exchanger area\n122. Complete conversion of carbon dioxide may occur around 900 degrees\nCelsius without a catalyst. The hot carbon dioxide gas is mixed with the\nother gases for the reverse-water-gas-shift reaction. However, in an\nembodiment, the carbon dioxide is heated by the Sun to the steady state\ntemperature at the same time while the hydrogen is being heated up. A\ntemperature, such as 1500 degrees Celsius (C.) or lower, may be\nestablished as an upper temperature limit for the reverse-water-gas-shift\nreaction. Also, both the carbon dioxide gas, from the CO2 supply 126 in a\nfirst outer pipe 176, and the feed hydrogen gas, from the H2 supply 124\nin a second outer pipe 175, may be additionally pre-heated using the\nenergy of the recycled gases and/or waste gases exiting the RWGS reactor\n106 in one or more inner pipes 170 located in the recuperator 105.\n\n[0031]3. Next, the solar-assisted endothermic RWGS produces the resultant\ncarbon monoxide molecules for the synthesis gas. The heated carbon\ndioxide and hydrogen mixture may be supplied to a Nickel alloy RWGS\nreactor 106, such as an Inconel 600® reactor, Ni/Al2O3 reactor, etc.\nIn the RWGS reaction, the heated CO2, from step 2 above, is combined with\nthe hydrogen molecules, from step 1 above, in a ratio such as one mole of\ncarbon dioxide per three moles of hydrogen, in potentially the presence\nof a catalyst, plus the heat from the Sun to yield in the reaction at\nleast produced carbon monoxide plus water plus unconsumed two moles of\nhydrogen. The flow rate of each gas, hydrogen and heated carbon dioxide,\nmay be controlled to maximize the yield of carbon monoxide produced based\nupon the supplied hydrogen.\n\n[0032]4. A portion of the exit gases from the RWGS reactor chamber may\nthen be immediately cooled/quenched by the quencher 130 to stabilize or\notherwise capture at least the carbon monoxide molecule. The resultant\ncarbon monoxide plus 1) the unconsumed hydrogen molecules from the RWGS\nreaction or 2) the non-superheated hydrogen supplied directly from the\nwater splitter 102 are used in the methanol synthesis step (5) below.\nReferring to FIG. 1b, 2/3rds of the hydrogen generated is supplied\ndirectly from the water splitter 102b to the fuel production unit 108\nwhile the other portion of the hydrogen, such as the remaining third, is\nmainly consumed in the RWGS reaction in reactor 106b and any unconsumed\nhydrogen is recycled back into the RWGS synthesis gas production of step\n3. Accordingly, the heated carbon dioxide gas and hydrogen gas would be\nseparated from the resultant carbon monoxide and water.\n\n[0033]In an embodiment, substantially all of the moles of hydrogen\nmolecules 1) generated from the water splitter 102a and 2) passed through\nthe chemical reactor chamber 106a, which are not consumed in the reverse\nwater gas shift reaction are sent with the resultant carbon monoxide from\nthe reverse water gas shift reaction and between 0.1% to 3% by volume of\ncarbon dioxide in the inner pipe 170 to the hydrocarbon fuel synthesis\n108 process to create the liquid hydrocarbon fuel.\n\n[0034]5. Thru standard chemical processes, either on-site or off-site,\nhydrocarbon fuel synthesis occurs. A properly blended form of synthesis\ngas that includes (at least two moles of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and\ncarbon dioxide) reacts with a catalyst to yield >CH3OH ΔrH\n(methanol)+heat, or another desired hydrocarbon fuel.\n\n[0036]Referring to FIG. 1a, as discussed in step 4, there can be three\nmoles of hydrogen for every one mole of carbon dioxide initially, and\nthen one mole of hydrogen is compromised to make carbon monoxide.\nHowever, all three moles of hydrogen may be mixed with or heated by waste\ncarbon dioxide gas before doing the RWGS. The elevated temperature makes\nit easier to move the reaction toward completion. Accordingly, as\ndiscussed in step 2, the recuperator 105a plumbs pipes to the feed gases\ninput ports 124, 126 and exhaust gases output ports from the quencher\n130. The recuperator 105a passes the exhaust gases from the chemical\nreaction chamber 106a in an inner pipe 170 in order to pre-heat the feed\ncarbon dioxide and hydrogen gases passed through a larger outer pipe\ncarrying the feed carbon dioxide and hydrogen gases. The pipes 175 and\n176 for the feed carbon dioxide and hydrogen gases may be combined or\nkept separate during this pre-heating process.\n\n[0038]Similarly, the recuperator 105a cools the unconsumed portions of the\ncarbon dioxide gas and the hydrogen molecules from the reverse water gas\nshift reaction and the resultant carbon monoxide and water molecules to\npreheat at least the hydrogen molecules from the water splitter and the\nfeed carbon dioxide.\n\n[0039]The cooled hydrogen molecules, the carbon monoxide, and a small\npercentage of the carbon dioxide from the reverse water gas shift\nreaction are sent to the hydrocarbon fuel synthesis process to create a\nliquid hydrocarbon fuel.\n\n[0040]Gas flow in the recuperator 105a is in the direction of the\ntemperature gradient of the heat-exchanging surface. This minimizes\nentropy production in the process. Thus, the feed gas flow starts flowing\nalong the inner pipe at its relative lowest temperature area and flows\nalong the inner pipe 170 to the recuperator's 105a relative highest\ntemperature area. Filters in the recuperator 105a remove a portion of the\ncarbon dioxide once it has given up a majority of its heat to the feed\ngases. The condenser 120 couples to the recuperator 105a at its cooler\nend portion to remove the water gases from the produced synthesis gas.\nAlso, the filtered out carbon dioxide can be recycled back in with new\nfeed carbon dioxide feed gas 126.\n\n[0041]Thus, the reverse water gas shift reaction can be driven to maximize\nproduction of carbon monoxide for a subsequent exothermic reaction in the\ngeneration of methanol as the hydrocarbon fuel, by, supplying at least\nfifty percent more moles of heated hydrogen molecules relative to an\namount of carbon dioxide present in the chemical reactor chamber 106 than\nnecessary to achieve equilibrium in the reverse water gas shift reaction\nto force maximum production of the resultant carbon monoxide.\n\n[0042]Referring to FIG. 1b, as discussed in step 4, the chemical reactor\nchamber 106b mixes the heated carbon dioxide gas with a first portion of\nthe hydrogen molecules from the water splitter 102b in the form of gas in\nthe reverse water gas shift reaction in order to produce resultant carbon\nmonoxide and water molecules. One or more filters 127 then separate out\nthe heated unconsumed carbon dioxide gas and hydrogen gas from the\nresultant carbon monoxide and water produced in the reverse water gas\nshift reaction. One or more recycle pipes 110, 112, 114 recycle both the\nseparated out carbon dioxide back to the\nsolar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchanger area 122 and recycle at least a\nportion of the separated out hydrogen gas back to the into the\nhydrogen-carbon dioxide mixing area.\n\n[0043]Thus, the reverse water gas shift reaction is driven to maximize\nproduction of carbon monoxide for the subsequent exothermic reaction in\nthe generation of the hydrocarbon fuel, including methanol, by\noverloading an initial amount of hydrogen molecules relative to an amount\nof carbon dioxide present in the chemical reactor chamber during the\nreverse water gas shift reaction. The excess hydrogen from the initial\nbatch (and subsequent batches) is both continuously recycled to 1)\npreheat incoming feed gases as well as 2) ensure that RWGS reaction is\noverdriven with hydrogen molecules. However, in this embodiment, the\nremainder of the hydrogen produced from the water splitter 102b is sent\ndirectly to the fuel production 108 eliminating a need to cool the\nhydrogen gas for the fuel synthesis process.\n\n[0044]The quenching unit 130 immediately cools at least a portion of exit\ngases from the chemical reactor chamber 106 in which the\nreverse-water-gas-shift reaction occurs, in order to stabilize at least\nthe carbon monoxide molecule and potentially the carbon monoxide\nmolecules in the exit gases. In an embodiment, the quenching unit 130 is\na heat exchanger placed immediately downstream of the chemical reactor\n106 to cool the gas below degrees 700 Celsius, where radicals involved in\nthe back reaction are favored, and the heat exchanger moves the resultant\ncarbon monoxide away from a catalyst located in the chemical reactor 106,\nwhich then also raises an activation energy of the carbon monoxide to\nrevert back to carbon dioxide.\n\n[0045]The RWGS unit 104 has a gas supply output to supply at least the\nresultant stabilized carbon monoxide molecules from the\nreverse-water-gas-shift reaction to a hydrocarbon liquid fuel synthesis\nreactor 108. The hydrocarbon liquid fuel synthesis reactor 108 also\nreceives and uses a second portion of the hydrogen molecules from the\nwater splitter 102 and the resultant stabilized carbon monoxide molecules\nfrom the reverse-water-gas-shift reaction in the hydrocarbon fuel\nsynthesis process to create the liquid hydrocarbon fuel. For example, a\nmethanol synthesis reactor may mix a second portion of the hydrogen\nmolecules from the water splitter and the resultant stabilized carbon\nmonoxide molecules from the reverse-water-gas-shift reaction in a\nmethanol synthesis process to create methanol.\n\n[0046]In an embodiment, the carbon dioxide in step 2 may be heated high\nenough such as 900 Celsius to 2300 degrees Celsius for solar assisted\nreduction of carbon dioxide to occur. The heated carbon dioxide is\nreduced to carbon monoxide molecules and oxygen molecules. The oxygen\nfrom the carbon dioxide reduction and the water splitting may be cooled\nand stored as a liquid fuel or a portion may be used as a catalyst in the\nRWGS discussed later. This process will cause a lot of waste heat for use\nin other processes such as the synthesis gas generation and the heated\ncarbon dioxide may also be used as an energy source to drive a Brayton\nturbine engine 132.\n\n[0047]As shown in figure la, there may be a first field of heliostat\narrays and a discrete second field of heliostat arrays. The first array\nof heliostats 143 focuses the Sun's rays from their mirrors onto a dish\non a first tower portion of the water splitter 102 which is coated with\nan optical filter to pass a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum\nincluding the UV ray range from the Sun towards into the water splitter\n102 at around 20-50 sun concentration units. The water splitter 102 is\nlocated within the first tower and the visible light and UV rays pass\nthrough the optical filter. A second array of heliostats 147 focuses the\nSun's rays from their mirrors onto a dish on a second tower that contains\nthe solar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchanger 122. These power tower systems use\nan array of large individually tracking mirrors, known as heliostats. The\nheliostats use a two axis tracking of the sun to focus light rays onto a\ncentral receiver mounted near the top of a tower. Very high temperatures\nup to 1500° Celsius can be achieved at concentration ratios around\n1500× sun concentration units.\n\n[0048]Alternatively, the heliostats may focus their rays on a single dish\non the single tower which is coated with an optical beam splitter for\nbeam splitting to direct a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum\nincluding the UV ray range from the Sun's rays towards the water splitter\nat around 20-50 sun concentration units while directing the remaining\noptical spectrum to the RWGS unit using around 800-1200 sun concentration\nunits. The water splitter may be located within the tower and the visible\nlight and UV rays pass through the beam splitter and the beam splitter\nreflects the other wavelengths to the solar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchanger.\n\n[0049]Instead of a second field of heliostat arrays 143 there may be\nanother solar receiver such as a parabolic trough. As discussed in step\n1, water may be split in hydrogen molecules and oxygen molecules in the\nwater splitter 124 via the addition of solar power in combination with\nstandard water cleaving techniques, water splitting with titanium, or\nother similar techniques. In an embodiment, the water splitter 124 via\nthe addition of solar power from the heliostats 134 or parabolic trough\nmay use photo catalytic splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen in an\nelectrolysis cell. For example, Titanium oxide nanotubes coated with\ntungsten oxide can be prepared to harvest hydrogen and oxygen with solar\nlight. The tungsten trioxide coatings on the nanotubes can significantly\nenhance the visible spectrum absorption of the titanium dioxide nanotube\narray, as well as their solar-spectrum induced photocurrents. The\ncatalytic Titanium dioxide materials use sunlight to split water on the\nspot50]FIGS. 2a and 2b illustrate perspective views of embodiments of a\nparabolic trough system used with the water splitter.\n\n[0051]In an embodiment, the parabolic trough 243 contains a set of\nparabolic mirrors 251. Each mirror 251 connects to a tracking actuator\n253 to rotate that mirror in both the azimuth and elevation axis. Each\nparabolic mirror 251 reflects sunlight upwards in a frame of the\nparabolic trough at a focal line of the parabolic trough onto small areas\nof an associated light receiver 255 that contains glass or similar clear\ntubes coated with a titanium based element or compound catalyst in an\nelectrolyte. The light receiver 255 and frame in the parabolic trough may\nbe tilted at a slight upward angle to allow disassociated gases of\nhydrogen and oxygen from the water splitting process to naturally float\nupward and be collected/harvest for future use.\n\n[0052]An electronic controller 261 couples to the tracking actuator 253\nand feedback limit switches 259 to controlled positioning of each mirror\nto concentrate the sun's rays on the light receiver 255.\n\n[0053]The mirror 251 can be held in its parabolic shape by stamped tab\nribs 257 at either end of the mirror. The ribs 257 are trimmed just above\nthe stamped tabs so that they cause minimal shading, and fixed from below\nto receiver support brackets.\n\n[0054]FIG. 3 illustrates a top down view of an embodiment of a parabolic\ntrough system used with the water splitter. The exterior casing of the\nframe of the parabolic trough is cut away in this view to reveal the\nlight receivers 355 and tubes forming the electrolysis cells located in\neach light receiver 355.\n\n[0055]As discussed, the parabolic trough 343 can use multiple mirrors 351.\nEach mirror has two axis of rotation frame construction and couples to\nthe tracking actuator. In this embodiment, the long trough of the\nparabolic trough 343 is composed of multiple individual mirrors connected\ntogether to form the trough and a series of the associated light\nreceivers 355 are ganged together in a frame of the parabolic trough 343.\nThus, all of the TiO2 tubes can be in the same frame containing light\nreceivers that can be put at a slight upward incline to assist in\ncollection of hydrogen and oxygen gases by the bubbles of gas traveling\nup the incline.\n\n[0056]The parabolic-trough water-splitter has one or more light receivers\nwith tubes that use titanium based catalyst, which form the electrolysis\ncells that receive UV rays and visible light from the mirrors to split\nwater into hydrogen and oxygen via the titanium based catalyst that\nabsorbs both the UV rays and a portion of the visible light directed from\nthe heliostats. One electrode draws the hydrogen gas and the other\nelectrode draws the oxygen gas.\n\n[0057]In an embodiment, the parabolic trough concentrator uses two-axis\ntracking, and aluminum reflectors with the use of anti-corrosive\nadditives on the reflectors.\n\n[0058]Referring to FIGS. 2a and 2b, the parabolic trough concentrator's\ntwo-axis tracking system may be based on a `daisy wheel` arrangement. The\nmirrors are supported by metal frames, which in turn are mounted on a\n2-axis tracking mechanical structure. The tracking system reliably and\naccurately tracks the sun. Each mirror may rotate in both the azimuth\n(side to side) axis of rotation as well as the elevation (top to bottom)\nrotation. The azimuth tracking is achieved by rotation on a ring mounted\nflush to a ground. The second elevation axis of rotation was along the\nedge of the mirror, allowing each trough to roll to the correct elevation\nzenith angle. A microprocessor electronic controller cooperating with a\nlinear actuator positions the troughs pointing towards the sun, even\nduring cloudy weather. The troughs `roll` from east to west each day and\nthe long central support tilts the troughs to adjust for seasonal\nvariation. This is called `two-axis` tracking. The microprocessor\npositions a linear actuator and reads encoders for feedback in order to\nmove the mirrors a precise amount. The linear actuator causes rotation of\nthe main beam through cables and a pulley. Stepper motors can be an\nalternative to the linear actuator.\n\n[0059]Parabolic trough tracking and calibration requirements are lower\nthan for a heliostat array. Power output can be increased by 40% compared\nto fixed array, by tracking the Sun along the north-south and the\neast-west axes.\n\n[0060]Referring to FIG. 3, the front surface of the reflective mirror\nportion of the parabolic trough (or tower dish) may be formed by a\nreflective metal such as aluminum and chrome, which are actually better\nat reflecting lower electromagnetic spectrum rays, such as UV rays, than\ntypical glass mirrors which absorb a greater percentage of waves in this\nportion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Further, a coating may be\nstretched across either the mirror and/or the aperture of the light\nreceiver in which the sun's rays are being focused into in order to\nassist in controlling the passing or deflecting different wavelength\nbands in the electromagnetic spectrum. An essentially transparent polymer\nor acrylic, such as ETFE, may also be placed across or adhered to the\nsurface of the mirrors, which is transparent in the electromagnetic\nwavelength bands of desire, in order to protect the mirror from\nenvironmental damage such as acid rain, chipping etc. Thus, a polymer or\nacrylic coating on top of the front surface of the reflective metal\nmirror, which is optically transmissive in passing wavelength bands in\nthe electromagnetic spectrum below infra red is on top of the front\nsurface of the reflective mirror to maximize the amount of Sun being\nconcentrated into the light receivers in the desired UV and visible light\nspectrum while limiting generation of waste heat, and the hydrogen\nsplitting via tubes with a titanium based catalyst in the light receiver\nto occur at 50-80 degrees low temperature, 30-50 sun concentration units.\n\n[0061]Note, electromagnetic radiation can be classified by wavelength into\nradio, microwave, infrared, the visible region we perceive as visible\nlight, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays.\n\n[0062]The polymer or acrylic coating on top of the front surface of the\nreflective metal mirror can be highly scratch resistant and resistant to\nsignificant deterioration. Each mirror can deliver a concentration ratio\nof about 20 to 1.\n\n[0063]The temperature of the process in the light receiver can be\ncontrolled with passive heat sinks such as aluminum fins or active\ncooling flow of air/water to the receiver. In an embodiment, each solar\nlight receiver has an integrated passive heat sink to maintain the cells\nat a moderate temperature.\n\n[0064]Referring to FIG. 1, the water splitter generates commercial\nquantities of hydrogen gas on site as a feed gas to produce both\nsynthesis gas in a reverse-water-gas-shift reaction and then combined\nwith resultant carbon monoxide from the RWGS to produce a hydrocarbon\nliquid fuel. The hydrogen gas generated on site as a feed gas is\ngenerated on site via a low/zero carbon emission process. The water\nsplitter can generate hydrogen gas from water splitting with titanium or\nhigh temperature water splitting via electrolysis and the electrical\npower for the water splitting is generated via a Brayton engine or\nphotovoltaic electrical power generation mechanism. This also allows the\nhydrocarbon liquid fuel to be generated in geographic areas not located\nnear the public utility grid.\n\n[0065]Electrolysis cells 180 consisting of dye-sensitized solar cells\nusing a TiO2 thin film electrode may also be used to harvest hydrogen and\noxygen with solar light.\n\n[0066]The catalytic Titanium dioxide materials use sunlight to split water\non the spot67]A titanium di-silicide catalyst can also be used with focused\nsunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The heliostats supply\nthe energy to drive the water to hydrogen and oxygen. Titania is used to\ncapture energy from sunlight. The absorbed energy releases electrons,\nwhich split water to make hydrogen. The Titania material may be strained\nso that its atoms are slightly pressed together or pulled apart to alter\nthe material's electronic properties. In an embodiment, a coating of\nTitania may be physically stretched and deposited on dome-like\nnanostructures that cause the atoms to be slightly pulled apart. The TiO2\nmay be physically stressed by creating a substrate with ripples in the\nsubstrate that have a visible light wavelength spacing and when the TiO2\nthin film is stretched over the rippled substrate, the TiO2 essentially\ninherits a stressed band gap to absorb visible light. By pulling the\natoms apart, less energy is required to knock the electrons out of orbit.\nThus, light with lower energy can be used to split water, which means\nboth visible light and ultraviolet light can be used. Similarly, when\ndopants are added in the dye sensitized solar cells, the coating of\nTitania absorbs a greater spectrum of light waves than in its native\nunstressed state.\n\n[0068]Generally, electromagnetic radiation is classified by wavelength\ninto radio, microwave, infrared, the visible region we perceive as light,\nultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. EM radiation with a wavelength\nbetween approximately 400 nm and 700 nm is detected by the human eye and\nperceived as visible light. Ultraviolet (shorter than 400 nm to about 1\nnm) are also sometimes referred to as light. Being very energetic, UV\nrays can break chemical bonds, making molecules unusually reactive or\nionizing them, in general changing their mutual behavior.\n\n[0069]Note, the strain on the atoms also affects the way that electrons\nmove through the material. Too much strain, and the electrons tend to be\nreabsorbed by the material before they split water. Thus, a balance\nbetween absorbing more sunlight and allowing the electrons to move freely\nout of the material is attempted to be achieved with the strain applied.\nOverall, the Titania (TiO2) can be stressed to lengthen the band gap by\nmechanical and/or chemical means.\n\n[0070]FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional drawing of a photoelectrolysis cell\ndevice for dissociation and production of hydrogen gas from an aqueous\nsolution when illuminated. The water splitter may contain a\nphotoelectrolysis cell device 580. The photoelectrolysis cell 580 employs\nan electrode made of a titanium-based element or compound with a\nstress-induced band-gap shifted and broadened to be active at light\nwavelengths more prevalent in sunlight. The photoelectrolysis cell device\nmay include some or all of the following: a first working electrode that\nhas thin layers of adhesion and/or conductivity promoting materials and a\nTitania semiconductor photocatalyst coated on top of the rippled surface\nof a polycarbonate substrate(s) 585, housing, aqueous electrolyte,\nseparation membrane 586, second electrode 588, bias voltage source 590,\ntanks for collecting and storing the hydrogen gas 592 and oxygen gas 594.\nAn enlarged view of the rippled surface of a polycarbonate substrate(s)\n585 with the Titania semiconductor photocatalyst coated on top is shown\nat the top of FIG. 5.\n\n[0071]The rays of solar energy from the solar receivers 534 illuminate the\npolycarbonate substrate that also comprises one side of the cell. The\npolycarbonate 585 has a distal surface that has been embossed with\nripples, and coated with Titania. Nanoscale ripples are present in the\nsubstrate 585 such that stress is induced in the thin film of Titania by\nforming local high-stress bending radii.\n\n[0072]A high stress-bending radius depends on the two materials involved,\nspecifically these materials Young's moduli, and how the covering layer\nis formed relative to the ripple/wave on the other layer. Titania in an\nunstressed state has a maximum band gap of about 3.4 eV, and a more\ntypical band gap of about 3.2 eV. The bandgap of Titania thin film being\nstressed is a shifted and broadened to a bandgap of 3.0 eV or lower. The\nTitania semiconductor film 585 has a native bandgap that does not support\nspontaneous photoelectrolysis of water in visible light wavelengths\npresent in sunlight.\n\n[0073]The electrode contains a substrate that has surface ripples with a\nsub-visible-light-wavelength spatial period that causes stress in the\ntitanium based element or compound semiconductor thin film on the\nsubstrate 585 and thereby shifts the bandgap of the titanium based\nelement or compound to support spontaneous photoelectrolysis of water in\nvisible light. The shift in the band gap increases the absorption of\nphotons and light beyond ultra-violet and well into the visible, abundant\npart of the solar spectrum. (=the bandgap of Titania is too large to\nabsorb in the visible region. The substrate 585 has surface ripples with\na sub-visible-light spatial pitch and hence the thin film stretched over\nthe substrate inherits these ripples with a sub-visible-light spatial\npitch. The pitches among the linear irregularities or recesses in the\nripples in the thin film are not necessary uniform but stay within the\nrange on the substrate. The substrate 585 has surface ripples in a\nwaveform shape that have a spacing/pitch between 20 nm to 350 nm. Note\nvisible light at the low end is waves greater than 400 nm. Thus, the\nsubstrate 585 has ripples on a surface thereof, the ripples having a\nspatial period smaller than a light wavelength in the visible spectrum.\nThe semiconductor film can be grown onto the rippled substrate 585. The\nripples are substantially cylindrical, hemispherical, or sinusoidal in\nprofile and shape (=sinusoidal). Thus, the semiconductor thin film is\nstressed to shift the bandgap therein to support spontaneous\nphotoelectrolysis of water in visible light.\n\n[0074]The second half of the cell is provided by membrane 586, which may\nalso be polycarbonate but can be other materials as well. The second\nelectrode 588 is aluminum, platinum, or aluminized thin film coating on a\nsubstrate, for example. An aqueous electrolyte, such as seawater,\nsulfuric acid, etc, is in contact with the semiconductor film. A\nseparator membrane allows the hydrogen and oxygen gasses released in\nphotoelectrolysis to be collected separately. Further, this controls the\namount of dissolved oxygen that is present in the water, to make the\nphotoelectrolysis reaction more efficient and predictable.\n\n[0075]Upon exposure of the semiconductor Titania film to an aqueous\nsolution and illumination of the semiconductor film with sunlight, the\nsemiconductor film will split the aqueous solution into hydrogen and\noxygen. Gaseous oxygen collects at the semiconductor Titania electrode\ncathode 585 and gaseous hydrogen collects at the conducting anode 588,\nwith the membrane 586 preventing their recombining. The Titania electrode\ncan also be formed to be an anode rather than a cathode. An optional bias\nvoltage source 590 is shown connected to the electrodes to adjust the\nelectric potential for best electrolysis efficiency, but a\nredox-mediating electrolyte can also be used to reduce hole/electron\nrecombination if necessary. Each gas displaces water and collects at the\ntop of the two outer tubes, where it can be drawn off with a stopcock.\nReservoirs 592 and 594 collect the separated hydrogen and oxygen gases.\nThe titania-coated substrates can be stacked in layers to increase the\ntotal absorption of the UV and visible light over a given illumination\narea. The shape of the ripples can be concave or convex or a mix of both.\n\n[0076]The stress-induced bandgap-shifted semiconductor may have its stress\nis induced by some or all of the following ways: controlling the shape of\nand thickness of said semiconductor thin film; tuning the film coating\nparameters to optimize stress; forming nanoscale ripples in the substrate\nto cause local high-stress bending radii; controlling the pitch and depth\nof said ripples; controlling the mismatch in Young's modulus between the\ncoating and the substrate; inducing photon stress by self-focusing of the\nillumination; inducing electron stress by adding a layer such as gold in\ncontact with the semiconductor and in between the semiconductor and the\nsubstrate.\n\n[0077]The stress-induced bandgap-shifted semiconductor may include\nmaterials such as titanium, Titania, compounds of Titania, and doped\nTitania. The bandgap of the known chemically-inert photocatalyst titania\n(TiO2) is shifted and broadened to be active at wavelengths more\nprevalent in sunlight and artificial light by inducing and managing\nsufficiently high stress in titania by vacuum coating a thin film of\ntitania onto a substrate, preferably of a different Young's modulus, with\nbending ripples on the surface of a spatial radius similar to the film\nthickness. The rippled coating also serves to self-focus and concentrate\nthe incident light required for the process, increase photocatalytic\nsurface area, and prevent delamination of the film from the substrate.\nThe electrical activity so induced in the band-shifted Titania\nsubsequently by visible light is applied to photoelectrolysis (hydrogen\nproduction from water and light).\n\n[0078]When tensile stress is applied to or caused in a semiconductor, the\ninter-atomic spacing increases directly. An increased inter-atomic\nspacing decreases the potential seen by the electrons in the material,\nwhich in turn reduces the size of the energy bandgap. The same effect\noccurs with increased temperature, because the amplitude of the atomic\nvibrations increases with the increased thermal energy, thereby causing\nincreased inter-atomic spacing. The stress can be carefully controlled to\nachieve the desired bandgap shift, and further managed to prevent\ndelamination, by introducing periodic three-dimensional nano-scale\nsurface features into or onto the substrate. These features act as a\ntemplate such that the film that is grown onto the template takes on a\nsimilar shape. The Titania film grown onto the polycarbonate template has\na three dimensional sinusoid surface, much like an egg carton, with a\nspatial period of 300 nanometers (nm) or 0.3 microns.\n\n[0079]Note, the photoelectrolysis cell device for dissociation and\nproduction of hydrogen gas from an aqueous solution when illuminated\ncould also could substitute chemically induced stress via dopants and use\na dye sensitive solar cell. The cell uses a semi conductive metal oxide\nlayer on a conductive substrate, sensitized by at least one chromophoric\nsubstance. The nanocrystalline semi conductive metal oxide, in particular\nTiO2, is in polycrystalline form with a granulometry of the order of\nseveral nanometers, for example 10 to 50 nanometers. A chromophoric\nsubstance, often called photosensitizer or photosensitizing dye, forms a\nsubstantially monomolecular layer attached to the semi conductive metal\noxide layer. The chromophoric substance may be bound to the metal oxide\nlayer by means of anchoring groups like carboxylate or phosphonate or\ncyano groups or chelating groups with conducting character like oxymes,\ndioxymes, hydroxyquinolines, salicylates and keto-enolates. Several\ntransition metal complexes, in particular ruthenium complexes, but also\nosmium or iron complexes, with heterocyclic ligands like bidentate,\ntridentate or polydentate polypyridil compounds, have been shown to be\nefficient photosensitizing dyes.\n\n[0080]The photo-catalytic nano-crystalline thin films may even include use\nof iron oxide-based materials.\n\n[0081]Further, the photoelectrolysis cell device for dissociation and\nproduction of hydrogen gas from an aqueous solution when illuminated\ncould also be a thin film semiconductor device with multiple junctions.\nThe semiconductor includes a substrate; a solid-state semiconductor layer\ndisposed on the substrate; a photoactive semiconductor top layer further\ncomprising a photo electrochemical electrode junction; and an interface\nlayer disposed between the solid-state semiconductor layer and the\nphotoactive semiconductor top layer. The multiple junctions create more\ncurrent or electrons available to react with a liquid electrolyte. A\nsurface of the photoactive semiconductor top layer is exposed to both a\nsource of light such as the sun and to the liquid electrolyte.\n\n[0082]Another method to generate hydrogen via the addition of solar energy\nis high-temperature electrolysis. The water splitter contains a\nhigh-temperature, 280-320 degree Celsius, electrolysis cell device for\nwater electrolysis to decompose water (H2O) into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen\ngas (H2) due to an electric current being passed through the water with\nmost of the energy causing the high temperature above 280 degrees Celsius\nsupplied as heat from the Sun, which is cheaper than electricity, and\nbecause the electrolysis reaction is more efficient at higher\ntemperatures. An electrical power source is connected to two electrodes\nto pass the electricity and the oxygen gas gathers at a first electrode\nand the hydrogen gas gathers at a second electrode. The electrolysis cell\ndevice functions similar to the catalyst cell discussed above. The\nhydrogen gas gathers at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode,\nwhere electrons are pumped into the water), and the oxygen gas gathers at\nthe anode (the positively charged electrode). The generated amount of\nhydrogen is twice the amount of oxygen, and both are proportional to the\ntotal electrical charge that was sent through the water. Electrolysis of\nwater is sped up dramatically by adding an electrolyte (such as a salt,\nan acid or a base).\n\n[0083]In the water at the negatively charged cathode, a reduction reaction\ntakes place, with electrons (e-) from the cathode being given to hydrogen\ncat ions to form hydrogen gas (the half reaction balanced with acid):\n\n[0084]Cathode (reduction): 2H+(aq)+2e-→H2(g).\n\n[0085]At the positively charged anode, an oxidation reaction occurs,\ngenerating oxygen gas and giving electrons to the anode to complete the\ncircuit:\n\n[0086]Anode (oxidation): 2H2O(l)→O2(g)+4H+(aq)+4e-.\n\n[0087]The same half reactions can also be balanced with base as listed\nbelow. Not all half reactions must be balanced with acid or base. Many do\nlike the oxidation or reduction of water listed here. To add half\nreactions they must both be balanced with either acid or base.\n\n[0088]Cathode (reduction): 2H2O(l)+2e-→H2(g)+2OH-(aq);\n\n[0089]Anode (oxidation): 4OH-(aq)→O2(g)+2H2O(l)+4e-;\n\n[0090]Combining either half reaction pair yields the same overall\ndecomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen:\n\n[0091]Overall reaction: 2H2O(l)→2H2(g)+O2(g).\n\n[0092]The number of electrons pushed through the water is twice the number\nof generated hydrogen molecules and four times the number of generated\noxygen molecules. If a water-soluble electrolyte is added, the\nconductivity of the water rises considerably. The electrolyte\ndisassociates into cat ions and anions; the anions rush towards the anode\nand neutralize the buildup of positively charged H+ there; similarly, the\ncat ions rush towards the cathode and neutralize the buildup of\nnegatively charged OH- there. This allows the continued flow of\nelectricity.\n\n[0093]Care should be taken in choosing an electrolyte, since an anion from\nthe electrolyte is in competition with the hydroxide ions to give up an\nelectron. An electrolyte anion with less standard electrode potential\nthan hydroxide will be oxidized instead of the hydroxide, and no oxygen\ngas will be produced. A cat ion with a greater standard electrode\npotential than a hydrogen ion will be reduced in its stead, and no\nhydrogen gas will be produced.\n\n[0094]The following cat ions have lower electrode potential than H+ and\nare therefore suitable for use as electrolyte cat ions: Li+, Rb+, K+,\nCs+, Ba2+, Sr2+, Ca2+, Na+, and Mg2+. Sodium and lithium are frequently\nused, as they form inexpensive, soluble salts.\n\n[0095]If an acid is used as the electrolyte, the cat ion is H+, and there\nis no competitor for the H+ created by disassociating water. The most\ncommonly used anion is sulfate (SO42-), as it is very difficult to\noxidize, with the standard potential for oxidation of this ion to the\nperoxydisulfate ion being -0.22 volts.\n\n[0096]Strong acids such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and strong bases such as\npotassium hydroxide (KOH), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) are frequently\nused as electrolytes.\n\n[0097]Solar photovoltaic cells are used to convert solar energy directly\ninto electricity and may be used as the voltage source for the Ti based\nand high temperature based electrolysis cell devices discussed above. The\nsolar cells maybe based on the photovoltaic (PV) effect in which light\nfalling on a two layer semi-conductor device produces a photovoltage or\npotential difference between the layers. The solar photovoltaic cells can\nbe used as a voltage source for the photoelectrolysis cell device that\nemploys an electrode made of a titanium based element or compound with a\nstress-induced band-gap.\n\n[0098]In an embodiment, the carbon dioxide in step 2 may be heated high\nenough such as 900 Celsius to 2300 Celsius for solar assisted reduction\nof carbon dioxide to occur and the heated carbon dioxide is reduced to\ncarbon monoxide molecules and oxygen molecules. The oxygen from the\ncarbon dioxide reduction and the water splitting may be cooled and stored\nas a liquid fuel or a portion may be used as a catalyst discussed later.\nThis process will cause a lot of waste heat for use in other processes\nsuch as the synthesis gas generation and the heated carbon dioxide may be\nused to drive a Brayton engine, which supplies the voltage source for the\nTi based and high temperature based electrolysis cell devices discussed\nabove\n\n[0099]After the carbon dioxide is converted to carbon monoxide and water\nby the reverse-water-gas-shift reaction in the RWGS reactor, the exiting\nwater from that chemical transformation is removed by the condenser 120\nbefore the methanol is synthesized. With the elimination of water by\nRWGS, the purge gas volume is minimized as the recycle gas volume\ndecreased. Because of the minimum purge gas loss by the pretreatment of\nRWGS reactor 106, the overall methanol yield may be increased. Also, the\nremoval of water vapor from the reactor 106 via the condenser 120 can\ndrive the equilibrium of the RWGS reaction to the right to increase the\nyield of carbon monoxide produced per inputted heated carbon dioxide. The\ncondensed water from the condenser 120 can be recycled to the water\nsplitter 102. The condenser 120 for water removal could either be a\ndesiccant bed or cooling condensing apparatus.\n\n[0100]On cloudy days, use an alternative heat source to keep the hydrogen\nfeedstock coming in or large storage tanks may be used to keep the flow\nof hydrogen feedstock steady to the RWGS unit. This minimizes the\ntransient start up and shut down operations on the RWGS unit.\n\n[0102]In block 402, the process uses solar receivers, such as heliostats,\nto focus the solar energy power of the Sun on a unit containing a\nchemical reactor to heat gas to provide energy needed for chemical\ntransformations to occur.\n\n[0103]In block 404, the process splits water molecules into hydrogen\nmolecules and oxygen molecules via 1) the addition of the solar power\ndirected from the solar receivers (heliostats, parabolic trough, etc.)\nand 2) use of a titanium based catalyst in the water splitting process\nthat absorbs at least the UV rays directed from the solar receivers or a\nhigh-temperature electrolysis that absorbs rays directed from the solar\nreceivers.\n\n[0104]In block 406, the process heats a solar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchanger\nand the carbon dioxide gas via the addition of solar power directed from\nthe solar receivers and potentially pre-heating the feed gases with\nrecycled and/or waste gas.\n\n[0105]In block 408, the process mixes the heated carbon dioxide gas with a\nfirst portion of the hydrogen gas from the water splitting process in the\nsolar-assisted endothermic reverse-water-gas-shift-reaction to produce\nresultant carbon monoxide and water molecules.\n\n[0106]In block 410, the process drives the RWGS reaction to maximize the\nproduction of carbon monoxide for the subsequent exothermic reaction in\nthe generation of a hydrocarbon fuel including methanol. As discussed\nabove, one of the ways would be to remove water vapor from the chemical\nreactor chamber in which the reverse water gas shift reaction occurs and\noverload the input of carbon dioxide for maximum hydrogen consumption.\nAnother method is to overload an amount of moles of heated hydrogen\nmolecules relative to an amount of carbon dioxide present in the chemical\nreactor chamber than necessary to achieve equilibrium in the reverse\nwater gas shift reaction to force maximum production of the resultant\ncarbon monoxide.\n\n[0107]In block 412, the process separates the heated carbon dioxide gas\nand hydrogen gas from the resultant carbon monoxide and water molecules\nand recycles these back to RWGS step 408 or the preheating step 406.\nAlternatively, the process uses all four of the above chemical compounds\nto initially preheat feed gases and then removes the water and some of\nthe now cooled carbon dioxide gas in order to create the synthesis gas\nsent to the Hydrocarbon Fuel synthesis process in step 418.\n\n[0108]Thus, the process recycles the separated out carbon dioxide after\nits been used in the recuperator back to the\nsolar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchanger area. The process may also recycle\nnone of the hydrogen if it is all being sent through the RWGS reaction\nand then the unconsumed hydrogen is sent onto the fuel process. The\nprocess may recycle a portion of the unconsumed hydrogen gas if that\nportion is being used to initially overload the hydrogen concentration\nand then recycled to preheat feed gas and reused in the RWGS reaction.\n\n[0109]In block 416, the process quenches a portion of the exit gases from\na chemical reactor chamber in which the reverse water gas shift reaction\noccurs, to stabilize at least the carbon monoxide molecule.\n\n[0110]In block 418, the process mixes the hydrogen molecules from the\nwater splitting process or RWGS reaction and the resultant carbon\nmonoxide from the reverse water gas shift reaction in hydrocarbon fuel\nsynthesis process to create a liquid hydrocarbon fuel. The process may\nmix all of the unconsumed hydrogen molecules, the resultant carbon\nmonoxide and a small percentage of the unconsumed carbon dioxide from the\nreverse-water-gas-shift reaction in hydrocarbon fuel synthesis process to\ncreate a liquid hydrocarbon fuel. The process also may mix a remaining\nportion of the hydrogen molecules from the water splitting process and\nthe resultant carbon monoxide from the reverse-water-gas-shift reaction\nin hydrocarbon fuel synthesis process to create a liquid hydrocarbon\nfuel.\n\n[0111]In block 420, the carbon dioxide may be heated high enough such as\n900 Celsius to 2100 Celsius for solar reduction of carbon dioxide to\noccur and the heated carbon dioxide is reduced to carbon monoxide and\noxygen. The intense solar energy from a well-focused heliostat array\nsuper-heats and dissociates the carbon dioxide. Some of the carbon\ndioxide becomes carbon monoxide and oxygen. Then the reaction is\n\"quenched\" by fast cooling, preserving the products from back-reaction\n(recombination). Thus, the dissociation reaction can be cooled to prevent\nback-reaction. The resulting mix of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and\noxygen gas is separated into its three components. The carbon dioxide is\nrecycled back into the process. The oxygen can be used for many valuable\npurposes. The carbon monoxide, an energy-rich molecule, carries the\ncaptured solar energy in its bonds. Waste heat from the process generates\nhigh quality steam to potentially turn an electricity-producing turbine.\n\n[0112]In block 422, the small mirrors in heliostats array are used to heat\nthe carbon dioxide gas. A technique that allows the mirrors to be\ncalibrated in groups is used. The smaller mirrors require less support\nstructure since the wind loads are much lower. Also, by spacing the\nmirrors in a regular pattern, the support structure carrying the\nheliostats can be a standardized frame easily installed in the field. The\nmirrored arrays use this carriage linkage to tie them together and\ncommunally use a shared camera tracking system and periodic calibration.\n\n[0113]As discussed, the process allows for a high enough volume of hot\ncarbon dioxide gas for commercial quantities of carbon monoxide for\nhydrocarbon based fuel generation, such as via methanol synthesis, and\nmay even allow for a higher volume of hot gas for operation of the\nBrayton cycle turbine engine.\n\nOperation of the Brayton Cycle Turbine Engine\n\n[0114]The Brayton cycle turbine engine 132 receives a portion of the\ncarbon dioxide gas from the solar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchanger. The high\nquality heat from the carbon dioxide gas is transferred from the carbon\ndioxide gas to steam to run a turbine portion of the turbine engine that\ngenerates electricity. The heated carbon dioxide gas is heated to a\nsteady state temperature between 800 and 1000 degrees Celsius. The\nquantity of excess heat is used to generate power through the traditional\nBrayton cycle, using microturbine-generators.\n\n[0115]Thus, the Brayton engine 132 is driven with gas heated from the\nsolar energy and that same solar energy is a heat source for the\ntransforming carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide in the RWGS. The Brayton\nengine 132 is configured with a higher throughput, lower entropy\nproduction design, which is more advantageous for heating at up to 900 C.\nThe same solar energy is doing twice the work, resulting in much more\nefficient power production. The Brayton turbine engine 132 unit can\nproduce electrical power.\n\n[0116]In one embodiment, the software used to facilitate the processes\ndiscussed above can be embodied onto a machine-readable medium. A\nmachine-readable medium includes any mechanism that provides (e.g.,\nstores and/or transmits) information in a form readable by a machine\n(e.g., a computer). For example, a machine-readable medium includes read\nonly memory (ROM); random access memory (RAM); magnetic disk storage\nmedia; optical storage media; flash memory devices; Digital VideoDisc\n(DVD's), EPROMs, EEPROMs, FLASH memory, magnetic or optical cards, or any\ntype of media suitable for storing electronic instructions. The software\nmay be written in any number of programming languages such as C, etc.\n\n[0117]While some specific embodiments of the invention have been shown the\ninvention is not to be limited to these embodiments. For example, most\nfunctions performed by electronic hardware components may be duplicated\nby software emulation. Thus, a software program written to accomplish\nthose same functions may emulate the functionality of the hardware\ncomponents in input-output circuitry. The reverse-water-gas-shift-reactor\nand the methanol synthesis reactor can be part of two separate units\nlocated in relatively close proximity of each other, such as both being\non the same production facility site. The hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and\ncarbon dioxide recirculation loops may be combined. For example, the\nhydrogen, carbon monoxide may be combined when sent to the methanol\nsynthesis reactor. The hydrogen and carbon dioxide may be combined when\nrecirculated back to the RWGS process. The system may use two or more\ndiscrete solar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchangers. The array of heliostats may\nbe formed in two or more sets of heliostats. The solar energy receiver\nmay be heliostats or other devices such as solar collector mirrors,\nparabolic troughs, or any number of other apparatus to focus the rays of\nthe sun. The invention is to be understood as not limited by the specific\nembodiments described herein, but only by scope of the appended claims."

      "text": "Nov 09, 2012\n\n(Phys.org)—Engineering researchers at the University of Arkansas have developed a thermal energy storage system that will work as a viable alternative to current methods used for storing energy collected from solar panels. Incorporating the researchers' design into the operation of a concentrated solar power plant will dramatically increase annual energy production while significantly decreasing production costs.\n\nCurrent storage methods use molten salts, oils or beds of packed rock as media to conduct heat inside thermal energy storage tanks. Although these methods do not lose much of the energy collected by the panels, they are either expensive or cause damage to tanks. Specifically, the use of a packed rock, currently the most efficient and least expensive method, leads to thermal \"ratcheting,\" which is the stress caused to tank walls because of the expansion and contraction of storage tanks due to thermal cycling.\n\n\"The most efficient, conventional method of storing energy from solar collectors satisfies the U.S. Department of Energy's goal for system efficiency,\" said Panneer Selvam, professor of civil engineering. \"But there are problems associated with this method. Filler material used in the conventional method stresses and degrades the walls of storage tanks. This creates inefficiencies that aren't calculated and, more importantly, could lead to catastrophic rupture of a tank.\"\n\nAs an alternative to conventional methods, Selvam and doctoral student Matt Strasser designed and tested a structured thermocline system that uses parallel concrete plates instead of packed rock inside a single storage tank. Thermocline systems are units – bodies of water, such as oceans and lakes, for example, but also smaller units that contain fluids or gas – with distinct boundaries separating layers that have different temperatures. The plates were made from a special mixture of concrete developed by Micah Hale, associate professor of civil engineering. The mixture has survived temperatures of up to 600 degrees Celsius, or 1,112 degrees Fahrenheit. The storage process takes heat, collected in solar panels, and then transfers the heat through steel pipes into the concrete, which absorbs the heat and stores it until it can be transferred to a generator.\n\nModeling results showed the concrete plates conducted heat with an efficiency of 93.9 percent, which is higher than the Department of Energy's goal and only slightly less than the efficiency of the packed-bed method. Tests also confirmed that the concrete layers conducted heat without causing damage to materials used for storage. In addition, energy storage using the concrete method cost only $0.78 per kilowatt-hour, far below the Department of Energy's goal of achieving thermal energy storage at a cost of $15 per kilowatt-hour.\n\n\"Our work demonstrates that concrete is comparable to the packed-bed thermocline system in terms of energy efficiency,\" Selvam said. \"But the real benefit of the concrete layers is that they do not cost a lot to produce compared to other media, and they have the unique ability to conduct and store heat without damaging tanks. This factor alone will increase production and decrease operating expenses for concentrated solar power plants.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Engineering researchers at the University of Arkansas are developing an anti-icing system that could make airport runways safer and less expensive to maintain during winter months.

This means that alcohol fuel cells and palladium will bring a more economical product to the market.\n\nFuel cells can create electricity that produces very little or even no pollution.

      "text": "PETE\nA small PETE device made with cesium-coated gallium nitride glows while being tested inside an ultra-high vacuum chamber. The tests proved that the process simultaneously converted light and heat energy into electrical current. Stanford University\n\nCalled \"photon enhanced thermionic emission,\" or PETE, the process uses cesium to more than double existing systems' efficiency levels. PETE devices could be easily incorporated into existing solar collection systems, and they're cheap to boot.\n\nPhotovoltaic (PV) cells get less efficient as they get hot, which is one of the biggest problems in solar efficiency. What's worse, silicon -- used in most PV cells -- can only absorb energy from certain parts of the light spectrum. Ultimately, more than half the solar energy hitting each cell is wasted.\n\nTags\n\nThe Stanford system exploits the excess heat, turning it into extra electricity.\n\nResearchers led by Nick Melosh, an associate professor of materials science and engineering, coated a piece of semiconducting material with a thin layer of cesium. This allowed the cell to use both light and heat to generate electricity, Melosh says.\n\nThe team used gallium nitride in the tests because it can withstand high temperatures, but PETE systems of the future would likely include gallium arsenide, commonly used in household electronics.\n\nThe system has to get extremely hot in order to work -- the hotter the better, Melosh says -- so new PETE systems will be a better fit for huge solar farms than rooftop arrays. They will need to include solar concentrators, but that creates another layer of efficiency, because less semiconducting material will be needed. Melosh says each device would require about a six-inch wafer of semiconducting material.\n\nWhen used with the heat-conversion process, PETE devices could reach 60 percent efficiency, Melosh says. But as Stanford's news release points out, even 30 percent efficiency would bring solar power in line with the price of oil.\n\n25 Comments\n\nInteresting, interesting. Has some potential? Sure. Will it happen? Probably not. Dont get me wrong, I do like to hear about the progress of solar cell technology and this is good to hear but I do not like how the constraints are not mentioned in this article. Are the materials cheap? What are some operational costs? You get my point. All in all, it has to do with the economics these days, rather than the beneficial global impact.\n\ncould we get these put onto those big giant wind turbines? that way they can actually be really competitive against fossil fuels! and not only that we could probably put them on the fields below the wind turbines and get even more done! hooray!\n\nWell, why not build into rail lines? There are millions of miles of rail lines in America. They don't get the wear and tear that roads do. The trains run on the rails not on the areas between the rails. Coat them with solar cells!\n\nIt matters not if or when any of this comes to actually exist in a form we may benefit from. The powers that be will not ever allow us to be independent from their grasp. Current dependence on oil is to their advantage so until we vote out all incumbents and at some point in time gain some tiny control over the congress and the white house(notice no capitalization of them...they do not warrant respect) we can expect to whine like a dry bearing forever. We as a nation are either too lazy to vote or too apathetic to care until it rubs us raw. I can name four inventions of the last 7 years that have vanished....at least from the media. The media, ha what a damned bad joke.........Either vote 'em out or shut up whining. No reason for optimism here.\n\nI know it is easy to be skeptical about new technologies but I feel like this one has a strong chance to succeed because it is being marketed as an ad on. I feel like most people are inherently put out by having to get rid of infrastructure they already have. In this case, this piece of technology is simply and upgrade and America loves upgrades! THe battle towards solar energy dominance needs to be viewed as a team potato sack race. The advancements in technology all have a leg in each others success and need to cross the finish line together to truly succeed. So this new PETE system coupled with a new breakthrough in solar cell technology such as this one seen in the video link below, which is not only flexible and cheap but 10,000 times more efficient than our solar standard, could be our green energy future.\n\n@two:\nVote with your own money and do the research and then invest in the solar technology that works for you. Do not wait for \"the powers that be\" to do it for you.\n\nI have been researching and taking classes in solar technologies for several years and built a solar heating system with 3 solar hot air panels that have reduced my heating oil consumption by over 400 gallons per year. This past winter was the third year that they have been working for me and the savings payoff has surpassed their $3000 cost. From here on out it is like getting at least 400 gallons of heating oil free each year.\n\nSolar Hot Water is another technology that is worth the $4,000 - $6,000 investment with a 5 to 7 year savings payback.\n\nGranted, solar electricity is still too expensive for many people, but the price is steadily declining. It will probably be another 4 or 5 years to make it really attractive for home owners to invest in Solar Electricity.\n\nWhat the hell? Cesium isn't cheap nor abundant and only recently has Gallium Nitride become economical to produce (ONE company found a way to synthesize macro-scale crystals). Also, unless that Cesium is sheltered from water at the molecular level, none of this technology is going to be waterproof. -__-\n\nThat being said, this is a pretty remarkable concept. It wasn't too long ago that nanomaterials were developed to convert thermal energy into electrical energy and combining these two concepts is a HUGE stride towards a renewable energy future. :)\n\nno price is a high price when mere availability is at stake. All new technologies in the beginning look costly, dangerous etc and only in usage they have become over time safe and affordable. So called non conventional energy would be conventional one day, too sooner than anticipated\n\nChaolin-- Cesium is more abundant than tin & tungtsen; all of which are used freely in manufacturing. As the article said, gallium nitride is being used ONLY for the testing, gallium arsenide would be the production level component; it is used in infrared LEDs and other moderately common applications. Cesium costs about $30 per gram, which is fairly pricey, but less than gold, which we use for a number of industrial processes. True, cesium is highly reactive with water, however, when combined with other elements, such as copper, it is not soluble in water.\n\nWe need to see how this process can be switched to production before coming to any conclusions about its feasibility or profitability. It may be expensive to produce, however, it may well not be once a procedure is developed. At 30% to 60% efficiency it may well be economically competitive. If silicon solar cells are competitive in some applications, then these would be cost effective even at several times silicon cells, simply due to higher efficiency.\n\nAs this is an industrial type of application, due to the need for a concentrator and high temperature, environmental protection for the cesium would be easier. Also, due to the concentrator, relatively small amounts would be necessary. As noted in the article, a six inch disk would be effective, so comparatively small amounts of cesium would be needed.\n\nWhether this pans out or not is more a matter of how it can be ramped up to production, than the process itself, it appears.\n\nGreat News Stanford !!!! Now comes the hard Part. Swear to Me you will Patent this and Exploit it to it's further reaches and Make Stanford Quadzillions of $$$ Dollars for the University Endowment. Oh and 1 more thing... Promise me you will NOT sell the Rights/Designs/Patents ETC... to The Energy Companies whom would like to Place Said Drawings/Technology into a big File Cabinet to be Conveniently \"Forgotten\" So they May Continue to Burn Fuels and COAL as they currently are.\n\nPLEASE Prove Me Wrong and get this technology into the Hands and on the Roofs of the PUBLIC. !!!!!!!\n\nAssuming it works, is the technology funded by grant money and, if so, does that mean that private patents won't drive the price up to a level that's not economically feasible. I think the invention fall under the ownership of the public domain if financed by grants, though not sure of the details.\n\nuntil efficiency reachs to the greater of 70% all bets are off that this is feasable and beneficiary to the world....i do like the fact that we have institues looking into various ways to produce insignificant amounts of power when compared to consumption. get on with the stupid races i want to see a finished product....and the weinner is Nuclear.\n\n@ Dan Jenkins: My mistake, I was not aware that such alloys were inert with water. And yes, while Cesium is more common than about half the metals on the periodic table, the scale of materials needed for such a solar infrastructure would outstrip the rate at which Cesium is obtained. Then again, you could be right and the actual amount of Cesium could be much less than anticipated. Regardless, I just hope this research gets applied in the future.\n\n@ender7718: Oil is ridiculously cheap when you consider the amount of energy produced compared to the price we pay for it. The following analogy is taken from  :\n\n\"And how much 'work' is embodied in a gallon of gasoline, our most favorite substance of them all? Well, if you put a single gallon in a car, drove it until it ran out, and then turned around and pushed the car home, you'd find out. It turns out that a gallon of gas has the equivalent energy of 500 hours of hard human labor, or 12-1/2 forty-hour work weeks.\n\nSo how much is a gallon of gas worth? $4? $10? If you wanted to pay this poor man $15 an hour to push your car home, then we might value a gallon of gas at $7,500.\"\n\nI think you can make the assumption that this advance will make solar power a competitive alternative to oil.\n\nIts interesting to hear peoples comments. Energy costs have increased so much over the years and yet people cant see whats happening. They are obsessed with oil as an energy source. I work in the energy conservation field designing ultra effecient homes, hvac, appliances etc and incorporate solar and wind projects in my jobs. When your electric bill goes to several hundred dollars a month,, will you say,,, we really need this ??? or will you say,,,it wont work.\n\nVery interesting. The brightest point in its favour is the spread between the efficiency that can be achieved (60%) with that necessary to be price competitive with oil (30%). If that is really the case, we may be able to get off our petroleum addiction sooner than expected.\n\nA promising development for large scale solar installations, but not the one I am most hoping to see work out. I mean, I will be happy if it works ... but ...\n\nIdaho National Labs made a major step forward in capturing electromagnetic waves in the infrared spectrum and converting them to electrical energy. They did this by advancing antenna theory into nano engineered structures and by finding ways to cheaply produce millions of nano-scale antennas on an inexpensive and flexible substrate.\n\nThe remaining problem will take time to solve, and a number of labs are working on it. The issue is converting the Tera Hertz AC voltages from these nano-scale antennas into DC to charge batteries, or into 60 Hertz AC. No one has yet come up with a rectifier that is cheap and efficient at those frequencies.\n\nWhen they do make that break trough in rectifier technology we will suddenly have a very high efficiency \"Solar Panel\" that works day or night. The reasons are simple enough - the Sun emits far more electromagnetic energy in the IR spectrum than it does in the visible light spectrum.\n\nBut of course it is not all about the Sun. Any heated object emits some of its energy as EM waves, or \"Radiant Heat\". The Earth does this all night long, releasing the heat gained during the day. So flip the panels over at night and you are still gaining energy from them.\n\nOr use them to capture radiant heat from engines of all types.\n\nThey have the solution to capturing the energy with antennas, if they can find the solution to converting it into DC we will have an instant energy revolution on our hands.\n\nI figure the last problems should be worked out sometime between lunchtime yesterday and a hundred years from now.\n\nOne point that seems to be underestimated is that this technology works best as the temperature rises. With any given rate of conversion of light to electricity, an increase in light might be expected to give an increase in electricity. So it would appear that using mirrors to concentrate additional light on a given solar cell should increase electricity. But of course the reflected sun light includes reflected heat which decreases the efficiency of the whole setup. The greatest benefit for small solar systems may not be the ability to convert heat to electricity but the ability to concentrate more light onto a smaller, less expensive, solar"

      "text": "Jan 08, 2008\n\nIn the race to make solar cells cheaper and more efficient, many researchers and start-up companies are betting on new designs that exploit nanostructures--materials engineered on the scale of a billionth of a meter. Using nanotechnology, researchers can experiment with and control how a material generates, captures, transports, and stores free electrons--properties that are important for the conversion of sunlight into electricity.\n\nCombining these two approaches appears to yield better solar cell materials than either one alone does, according to Jin Zhang, professor of chemistry at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Zhang led a team of researchers from California, Mexico, and China that created a thin film doped with nitrogen and sensitized with quantum dots. When tested, the new nanocomposite material performed better than predicted--as if the functioning of the whole material was greater than the sum of its two individual components.\n\n\"We have discovered a new strategy that could be very useful for enhancing the photo response and conversion efficiency of solar cells based on nanomaterials,\" said Zhang.\n\n\"We initially thought that the best we might do is get results as good as the sum of the two, and maybe if we didn't make this right, we'd get something worse. But surprisingly, these materials were much better.\"\n\nThe group's findings were reported in the Journal of Physical Chemistry in a paper posted online on January 4. Lead author of the paper was Tzarara Lopez-Luke, a graduate student visiting in Zheng's lab who is now at the Instituto de Investigaciones Metalurgicas, UMSNH, Morelia, Mexico.\n\nZhang's team characterized the new nanocomposite material using a broad range of tools, including atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and photoelectrochemistry techniques. They prepared films with thicknesses between 150 and 1100 nanometers, with titanium dioxide particles that had an average size of 100 nanometers. They doped the titanium dioxide lattice with nitrogen atoms. To this thin film, they chemically linked quantum dots made of cadmium selenide for sensitization.\n\nThe resulting hybrid material offered a combination of advantages. Nitrogen doping allowed the material to absorb a broad range of light energy, including energy from the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The quantum dots also enhanced visible light absorption and boosted the photocurrent and power conversion of the material.\n\nWhen compared with materials that were just doped with nitrogen or just embedded with cadmium selenide quantum dots, the nanocomposite showed higher performance, as measured by the \"incident photon to current conversion efficiency\" (IPCE), the team reported. The nanocomposite's IPCE was as much as three times greater than the sum of the IPCEs for the two other materials, Zhang said.\n\n\"We think what's happening is that it's easier for the charge to hop around in the material,\" he explained. \"That can only happen if you have both the quantum dot sensitizing and the nitrogen doping at the same time.\"\n\nThe nanocomposite material could be used not only to enhance solar cells, but also to serve as part of other energy technologies. One of Zhang's long-term goals is to marry a highly efficient solar cell with a state-of-the-art photoelectrochemical cell. Such a device could, in theory, use energy generated from sunlight to split water and produce hydrogen fuel. The nanocomposite material could also potentially be useful in devices for converting carbon dioxide into hydrocarbon fuels, such as methane.\n\nThe new strategy for engineering solar cell materials offers a promising path for Zhang's lab to explore for years to come.\n\n\"I'm very excited because this work is preliminary and there's a lot of optimizing we can do now,\" Zhang noted. \"We have three materials--or three parameters--that we can play with to make the energy levels just right.\"\n\nIn essence, the team has been trying to manipulate materials so that when sunlight strikes them, the free electrons generated can easily move from one energy level to another--or jump across the different materials--and be efficiently converted to electricity.\n\n\"What we're doing is essentially 'band-gap engineering.' We're manipulating the energy levels of the nanocomposite material so the electrons can work more efficiently for electricity generation,\" Zhang said. \"If our model is correct, we're making a good case for this kind of strategy.\" transform"

      "text": "Artificial Photosynthesis: Machines that Mimic Natural Processes\n\nMimicking natural processes in nature has been one of the most elusive pursuits in technology, since it almost breaks the unseen barrier that separates what is artificial and what is natural. The field of nanotechnology for example, is an attempt to recreate the smallest units of natural life (bacteria, viruses, and organic cells) with the objective of artificially modifying it to perform a specific task.\n\nBut perhaps one of the most important natural processes that are being researched today is the \"magical\" energy-producing capabilities of photosynthesis. As we have first known it in the concept of ecological food chains, plants hold the highest energy yield within the entire system, because it obtains and converts energy very efficiently from its surroundings.\n\nStudying photosynthesis to create an artificial machine that mimics the process is no easy task. However we have already gone quite far into its research, and in fact we could even say that we are already quite near into unlocking its secrets.\n\nThe \"Greenest\" Alternative Energy Source\n\nThere are two important sub-processes in photosynthesis that should be properly recreated before the energy-producing cycle of the artificial version can be made, and these are:\n\nThe oxidization of water to produce oxygen and extra protons via sunlight. This would be the most important first step to efficiently produce hydrogen.\n\nThe reduction and simplification of carbon dioxide via carbon fixation. This is a crucial process that would enable an artificial photosynthetic system to produce biofuel.\n\nIn artificial photosynthesis, most of the compounds naturally used by plants as reaction catalysts are replaced with other compounds to improve and enhance the chemical reactions. For example, the \"blue dimer\" oxidation catalyst is widely used as a substitute to the natural catalysts used when plants synthesize water, sunlight and carbon dioxide.\n\nArtificial photosynthesis is completely different from photovoltaics because the processes do not necessarily directly produce usable energy. They can, like what the hybrid photoelectrochemical cell does, but they are usually designed NOT to for maximum energy transfer efficiency. It instead focuses on the creation of a usable product that can be used to produce energy.\n\nIn a sense, artificial photosynthesis aims to manufacture a type of \"solar fuel\", be it hydrogen and/or biofuels, depending on the reactions that it would mimic and recreate.\n\nWhy it is Difficult to Mimic Photosynthesis\n\nThe primary reason why it is very difficult to mimic photosynthesis is that you simply can't use the exact same catalysts used naturally by plants. As mentioned, earlier, scientists have to use other catalysts that could imitate the chemical reactions made by the original catalysts. In fact, the research in finding usable catalysts for a specific part of the photosynthetic process has led the field NOT to have that many real significant breakthroughs in almost 30 years.\n\nAnother reason for the apparent difficulty in recreating this natural process is that even if they found the proper substitute catalyst, the reaction was usually a lot slower than what could be done naturally. In energy production terms, this a big disadvantage, since energy produced over a unit length of time is one of the most important criteria that determines the efficiency of an alternative energy source.\n\nCurrent Status of Artificial Photosynthesis Research\n\nAs of 2012, the search for the proper system and catalyst that would perfectly recreate the natural process is still on. A major breakthrough however, happened just recently that promises to accelerate artificial photosynthesis to speeds almost equal of its natural counterpart.\n\nResearchers at the Department of Chemistry at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden have successfully developed a fast molecular catalyzer that enabled their artificial photosynthetic system to achieve process cycle speeds of about 300 turnovers per second (natural photosynthesis is set at 100-400 turnovers per second.). The announcement was made last April 12, 2012, in an official news article that provides the details of the breakthrough.\n\nThe most important use of artificial photosynthesis today is the (economically) efficient production of hydrogen. With a properly developed artificial photosynthetic system, all the raw materials that you'll ever need to create hydrogen would be water and sunlight (CO2 can be easily found in ordinary air), and the system would provide itself with the energy needed to keep it operationalVery informative and educational post you have here. It gets me very curious, this artificial photosynthesis. Yes, it is difficult to mimic but do you think, there could be an alternative component (artificially-made) that could make the process successful?\n\nChristianCrisostomo\n\nThis might not be based on any current scientific research, but as I see it from the development curve of artificial photosynthesis over the past decades, I believe that scientists would eventually develop and discover a new set of artificial compounds that combines all of the basic processes photosynthesis have.\n(Since most research organizations today focus only on one or two of its processes)\n\nThe time frame for that achievement to happen could very well take a few decades of research again though"

Our challenge lies in understanding and developing new mechanisms and materials for storing and transporting energy safely. At present, our primary work on energy storage focuses on two directions: materials for hydrogen storage and materials for direct sunlight-to-chemical storage.\n\nIdeally hydrogen will be stored in a lightweight and compact manner for mobile applications. Apart from the often-cited weight percent of hydrogen that a material can store, a number of other criteria are important. One of these is the amount of energy required to get the hydrogen out of the storage material. Our effort in this area is aimed at understanding and optimizing both the storage weight as well as the desorption temperature general, which is quite challenging as these two properties are often inversely related in bulk materials.\n\nOur work in the area of solar fuels is focused on a class of molecules that can convert sunlight directly into \"stored heat\" in the form of chemical bonds. These molecules undergo a reaction upon exposure to light that is reversible with either a catalyst or heat. In some cases a considerable amount of energy can be stored. While there are many examples of molecules that can do this once or perhaps several times, only one case has been shown to date to be able to do this reversibly many times, with no degradation: a di-ruthenium fulvalene complex. In this case, the mechanism shown in the figure, the Ru-Ru bond and the C-C bond are broken upon light exposure, and the molecule effectively \"flips\". This stored chemical energy is highly stable, with a large back-reaction barrier, and can then be released in a very straightforward manner. In addition to understanding and predicting the details of both the forward photoisomerization step as well as the back-reaction heat release step, we are more broadly interested in identifying new classes of molecules (based on cheaper, more abundant materials) that can undergo the same kind of reaction as robustly."

Early in his career, he began working with proteins that can do photochemistry, drawing his inspiration from natural photosynthesis.\n\n\"Ultimately, plants are taking light and storing it as chemical energy,\" Dyer explains. \"The elegance of some of these reactions is astounding. It's an incredibly complex process, done with a series of proteins that are highly optimized for a specific function, such as light harvesting and water oxidation. The proteins are like tiny machines. A good analogy is an internal combustion engine, where you actually have integrated, working parts.\"\n\nArtificial photosynthesis In recent years, science and industry have started searching for ways to develop systems of artificial photosynthesis, to help solve the energy shortage and reduce carbon emissions. So far, man's attempts at tapping the sun's power have fallen far short of Mother Nature's.\n\nWhile living in Los Alamos, located at 7,500 feet above sea level on the Pajarito Plateau, Dyer installed solar panels on his family home. \"I wanted to understand the issues of solar energy at the practical level of a home owner,\" he says. Even with 320 days a year of New Mexico sunshine, he found conventional solar panels to be inefficient and not cost effective.\n\n\"An even bigger problem is the batteries required to store the intermittent solar flux,\" Dyer says. \"Their storage capacity is limited and their lifetime is short. They also contain hazardous chemicals, like lead and sulfuric acid.\"\n\nMimicking Mother Nature Dyer is focused on solving this solar energy storage problem. He wants to covert solar energy to fuel, using a particular protein to develop a photocatalyst for solar hydrogen production — which brings up the swamp bugs.\n\nA type of anaerobic bacteria that lives deep in the mud of swamps, where there is little oxygen, survives by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. While humans need to use expensive systems to perform this process on a large scale, the bacteria does it naturally by generating the protein hydrogenase — the most efficient catalyst known for making hydrogen.\n\nBy studying the biological system, Dyer hopes to find ways to adapt the microbial catalysis of hydrogenase so that it can be harnessed for solar hydrogen production.\n\n\"You can trick bugs to make lots of certain kinds of proteins, like a little factory,\" Dyer explains. \"It's called 'directed evolution,' where you push bacteria a certain way, forcing it to adapt and to produce an evolved protein that has the properties you need.\"\n\nHis goal is to generate hydrogenase in a form that allows the protein to bind to quantum dots, which are good at absorbing light and could provide the energy to drive the reaction.\n\n\"We envision producing hydrogen in a photochemically driven process, where the electrons and protons needed to produce the hydrogen are furnished by water,\" Dyer explains. \"You could then burn the hydrogen as fuel and get water back. It would be a perfectly clean cycle.\"\n\nRenewable energy center At Emory, Dyer is teamed with other scientists in his experiments, including Tim Lian, William Henry Emerson Professor of Chemistry and a leader in quantum dot technology, and Stefan Lutz, an associate professor of biomolecular chemistry who specializes in protein engineering.\n\nDyer will also serve as the director of a renewable energy center on campus, to launch this fall. The aim is to further integrate ongoing energy research among chemists, physicists, biologists and computer scientists.\n\n\"The energy field has suffered from 30 years of people saying that the search for more energy is an engineering problem,\" Dyer says. \"Actually, it's primarily a science problem. Emory has a good track record of bringing together interdisciplinary teams, and tremendous strengths in the bio-sciences, as well as the physical sciences. Most of the advances in renewable energy are going to be made at that interface.\""

But in many countries, especially when disaster strikes a rural area, there are often no opportunities to use life saving technologies, because there are no sources of power.\n\nVladimir Leonov, a senior research scientist at IMEC, a Dutch research center in nanoelectronics and nano-technology, has developed two life-saving medical devices - an electroencephalograph (EEG) and and an electrocardiograph (ECG) that are powered by renewable sources of energy - the sun and body heat.\n\n\"You have a disaster,\" says Leonov. \"Airport closed, port\nclosed.

Even if the ambient and surface temperature of the skin stays the same, a small variation in wind or light can generate electricity.\n\nThough the prices of Leonov's miniature devices are too high to achieve widespread use, the technology to produce them is established by Leonov; it's the price of the parts that's keeping them from production. Nevertheless, Leonov projects that in the future these self-sustaining devices will even replace the big devices now used in hospitals"

Cui says the electrode is a first step toward a new type of low-cost battery suitable for storing large amounts of electricity within the power grid.\n\nCui's new battery chemistry uses inexpensive, abundant materials. It relies on the same principle employed in lithium-ion batteries—moving sodium or potassium ions between electrodes during charging and discharging—but does it much more cheaply. \"For grid storage, the battery can be huge, and using sodium and potassium is very attractive because they are so abundant and cheap,\" Cui says. These batteries will use water-based electrolytes that are cheaper and easier to use than organic solvent-based electrolytes used in lithium-ion batteries.\n\nThe new electrodes, demonstrated in a paper posted online today in the journal Nature Communications, are also based on commonly available materials. The researchers start with the pigment Prussian Blue, an iron and cyanide compound. They replace half the iron with copper, and make crystalline nanoparticles of the resulting compound, which they coat on a cloth-like carbon substrate. Then they immerse this electrode in a potassium nitrate electrolyte solution.\n\nThe electrodes maintain 83 percent of their charge capacity after 40,000 cycles—in comparison, lead-acid batteries last a few hundred cycles, while lithium-ion batteries typically last for 1,000. The electrodes also show 99 percent energy efficiency. \"You want the voltage you put in during charging and the voltage you take out during discharge to be same,\" Cui says. \"Compared to any other battery material, this is absolutely the best.\"\n\nJay Whitacre, a professor of materials science and engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and founder of the sodium-ion battery startup Aquion Energy in Pittsburgh, says that the electrodes show good cycle life, but notes that their charge capacity is relatively low: 60 milliampere-hours per gram of material, compared to 100 for Aquion's manganese oxide cathode. Besides, he says, \"it's based on copper, which is actually pretty expensive these days.\"\n\nHowever, the most important metric for large-scale grid storage is price per unit of energy per cycle, says Donald Sadoway, a materials science and engineering professor at MIT. In that respect, the new material, with its tens of thousands of cycles, could have an edge over other batteries. \"In the end, it comes down to the cost,\" he says. \"If they can deliver this performance at a cost that's substantially lower than sodium-sulfur, they've got a winner here.\"\n\nOther than cost and cycle life, \"round-trip energy efficiency is also very important for grid energy storage so that you're not wasting energy during recharging,\" says Christopher Johnson, a battery researcher at Argonne National Laboratory. While the cost of the new electrode isn't known, its efficiency and cycle life \"are impressive,\" he says. The researchers still need to demonstrate a full battery cell with two electrodes, though, which could change the numbers, Johnson adds.\n\nThe electrode made so far acts as a cathode. Cui says his team is tuning the chemistry of the material to make an anode and is working on making prototype batteries.\n\nAn energy solution. This may be the last time we hear reports on this technology. Label me a skeptic, but the energy |&or| Auto czars will either discredit this or buy it and hide it in a safe place. It's all about money, not about doing the right thing!\n\nHow many times do I see articles similar to this, that just disappear. We seem to have very few breakthroughs! Hum . . makes me wonder!\n\nRight now, dispatchers at electric companies all over the world are trying to figure out how to keep YOUR lights on for the least cost.\n\nAnd a really cheap to use storage system would make their jobs ever so much easier, and actually reduces costs and increase profits by absorbing excess low-cost power when available and releasing it when needed.\n\nWhat shadowy forces do you think are OPPOSED to the cheap and reliable storage of power? It's not the power companies.\n\nThis logic is tiresome. I hear it about every possible advance involving energy. You point to profit motive but fail to see that any incremental advantage in efficiency of process or delivery involved in energy represents profit. In short, if it is real, the big boys will be all over it. There are no magical technologies. No magic bullets and no free lunch. Most of these advances are academic in nature. Perhaps this technology has something to contribute. Perhaps it doesn't.\n\nThis will have no effect on the auto industry, so why bring them into it. As for the energy industry, they can't afford the cost/publicity of grabbing every new technology that comes out. They also can't predict any better than others which will succeed and which won't.\n\nAt 60 milliampere-hours per gram for just the cathode makes it utterly worthless for an Electric Vehicle (EV). If the both the electrolyte and anode each weighed the same as the cathode, and the produced 1.5V per cell, then 1 ton of batteries made from this stuff could only store 30 kilowatt hours. It waste too much energy to hall several tons of these batteries to only drive a few miles. Do not forget the extra weight of a beefed up frame designed to carry enough of these batteries in an electric vehicle.\n\nIt may have potential as a grid storage battery, if after finding a suitable anode that also last 40,000 cycles the cost per kilowatt per kilocycle is lower then competing technologies.\n\nYou may have seen many different stories on new battery electrodes while not seeing a lot of them in production because of weight, material cost, and where an electrode may last many cycles, its counter electrode may not.\n\nSomething like that could be good enough to be used in short haul ferry boats and diesel/electric freight trains. You could retrofit a diesel ferry boat with an electric motor and at every stop drive a small truck inside with a fully charged battery on the trunk that would be connected to the ferry. On the way back you drive the truck out and recharge it while you have another charged truck entering the boat. The same can be applied in freight trains. The batteries can be stored in container wagons that are directly connected to the electric motor of the locomotives. It would certainly cut costs for freight companies. CP Rail spend 500 million dollars a year in diesel alone. And talking about CO2, you can always use wind to charge those batteries on off peak time.\n\nthis stuff would not work in either application because of weight. A one ton battery (composed of an electrolyte, anode and this stuff as its cathode), may produce only 30 kilowatt hours or 40 horse power for an hour. That is barely enough HP to drive my little ford ranger that incidentally could not carry a 2,000 load.\n\nOk, so you could add more batteries. 150 tons of batteries could give you the needed 6,000 hp for an hour or 300 tons for two hours. 150 tons of batteries could be split over 5 40' shipping containers with 30 tons to each container. Each container adds 7,800 lbs and totals another 19.5 tons not counting the rail carts weight, just to go an hour.\n\n...or use wind power to pump water into an elevated reservoir, then just tap it hydroelectrically. Doesn't even have to be freshwater. If you close the system you could use the same water indefinitely. Don't have to worry about friction, etc.\n\nThe team at Stanford have achieved an impressive result: 40,000 recharge cycles, much more than existing technology. However, we are unconvinced that grid energy storage is the best application for their work. Instead, we suggest they turn their attention to energy harvesting, where the life of the rechargeable battery is often the limiting factor in the lifetime of the device that uses the harvested energy. Using their technology for energy harvesters could enable wireless sensors to operate autonomously for decades, leading to far wider sensor deployment in industry, in cities, in healthcare, and potentially many other sectors.

      "text": "February 3, 2011 -- Going wireless in applications such as sensor nodes or PC peripherals requires not only wireless communication but also an alternative energy source to an ac wall plug. It makes little sense to eliminate wired communication if your design still requires a power cord. Harvesting the ambient energy, which can be solar or artificial lighting or mechanical energy, such as equipment vibration, provides an energy source for ultra-low-power devices. Devices such as wireless sensor nodes conform to their ultra-low-power budget by spending most of their time asleep, waking up briefly to take a sensor reading and transmit it in a burst to their node network.\n\nHowever, the burst of power necessary for communication, although brief, requires more energy than ambient sources can provide, so some form of energy reservoir must provide this short, intense burst, making energy storage the other side of the coin for energy harvesting. Capacitors, including supercapacitors, and batteries are the main forms of electrical energy storage for energy harvesting. Both device types have constraints that energy-harvesting circuits for wireless sensor networks must accommodate to make wireless nodes practical. Those constraints are high leakage current for supercapacitors and charge/ discharge-cycle lifetimes for batteries. New lithium-ion technologies promise to expand the scope of both supercapacitors and batteries.\n\nBy Margery Conner, EDN Magazine Technical Editor.\n\nThis brief introduction has been excerpted from the original copyrighted article."

      "text": "images\n\nadditional resources\n\nMIT research signals a better way to harness waste heat\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — New MIT research points the way to a technology that might make it possible to harvest much of the wasted heat produced by everything from computer processor chips to car engines to electric powerplants, and turn it into usable electricity.\n\nMore than half of the energy consumed worldwide is wasted, most of it in the form of excess heat. This new technology would allow conversion of waste heat into electricity with an efficiency several times greater than existing devices. That kind of waste-energy harvesting might, for example, lead to cellphones with double the talk time, laptop computers that can operate twice as long before needing to be plugged in, or power plants that put out more electricity for a given amount of fuel.\n\nTheory says that conversion of heat into electricity can never exceed a specific value called the Carnot Limit, based on a 19th-century formula for determining the maximum efficiency that any device can achieve in converting heat into work. But current commercial thermoelectric devices only achieve about one-tenth of that limit, says Peter Hagelstein, associate professor of electrical engineering. In experiments involving a different new technology, thermal diodes, Hagelstein worked with Yan Kucherov, a consultant for the Naval Research Laboratory, and coworkers to demonstrate efficiency as high as 40 percent of the Carnot Limit. The calculations show that this new kind of system could ultimately reach as much as 90 percent of that ceiling.\n\nHow they did it: Hagelstein and his team started from scratch rather than trying to improve the performance of existing devices. They carried out their analysis using a very simple system in which power was generated by a single quantum-dot device — a type of semiconductor in which the electrons and holes, which carry the electrical charges in the device, are very tightly confined in all three dimensions. By controlling all aspects of the device, they hoped to better understand how to design the ideal thermal-to-electric converter.\n\nHagelstein says that with present systems it's possible to efficiently convert heat into electricity, but with very little power. It's also possible to get plenty of electrical power — what is known as high-throughput power — from a less efficient, and therefore larger and more expensive system. \"It's a tradeoff. You either get high efficiency or high throughput,\" says Hagelstein. But the team found that using their new system, it would be possible to get both at once, he says. Next steps: The new technology depends on quantum dot devices, a specialized kind of chip in which charged particles are very narrowly confined to a very small region. Such devices are under development, but still a few years away from commercial availability."

Credit: Beverly Barrett, UT Engineering Public Affairs\n\nSolar cells could soon be produced more cheaply using nanoparticle \"inks\" that allow them to be printed like newspaper or painted onto the sides of buildings or rooftops to absorb electricity-producing sunlight.\n\nBrian Korgel, a University of Texas at Austin chemical engineer, is hoping to cut costs to one-tenth of their current price by replacing the standard manufacturing process for solar cells - gas-phase deposition in a vacuum chamber, which requires high temperatures and is relatively expensive.\n\nFor the past two years, Korgel and his team have been working on this low-cost, nanomaterials solution to photovoltaics - or solar cell - manufacturing. Korgel is collaborating with professors Al Bard and Paul Barbara, both of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Professor Ananth Dodabalapur of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. They recently showed proof-of-concept in an issue of Journal of the American Chemical Society.\n\nThe inks could be printed on a roll-to-roll printing process on a plastic substrate or stainless steel. And the prospect of being able to paint the \"inks\" onto a rooftop or building is not far-fetched.\n\n\"You'd have to paint the light-absorbing material and a few other layers as well,\" Korgel said. \"This is one step in the direction towards paintable solar cells.\"\n\nKorgel uses the light-absorbing nanomaterials, which are 10,000 times thinner than a strand of hair, because their microscopic size allows for new physical properties that can help enable higher-efficiency devices.\n\nIn 2002, he co-founded a company called Innovalight, based in California, which is producing inks using silicon as the basis. This time, Korgel and his team are using copper indium gallium selenide or CIGS, which is both cheaper and benign in terms of environmental impact.\n\nResearchers apply the nanoparticle \"inks\" as a spray on the solar cells. Credit: Beverly Barrett, UT Engineering Public Affairs\n\n\"CIGS has some potential advantages over silicon,\" Korgel said. \"It's a direct band gap semiconductor, which means that you need much less material to make a solar cell, and that's one of the biggest potential advantages.\"\n\nHis team has developed solar-cell prototypes with efficiencies at one percent; however, they need to be about 10 percent.\n\n\"If we get to 10 percent, then there's real potential for commercialization,\" Korgel said. \"If it works, I think you could see it being used in three to five years.\"\n\nHe also said that the inks, which are semi-transparent, could help realize the prospect of having windows that double as solar cells. Korgel said his work has attracted the interest of industrial partners.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nThough the solar industry today predominately produces solar panels made from crystalline silicon, they remain relatively expensive to make.

But imagine how much power that huge unit is using to generate those radio waves. now imagine how much energy ( in the form of heat ) is coming from the flame out of the test tube.\n\nBasically...Alot of energy is going into the unit. And the burning of the gas is quite small compared to the input energy.\n\naka: Waste of energy. We could use the energy instead to say....get the salt out of the water via desalinization, or distillation.\n\nits a cool side-effect. I'll admit that. But it in no way is going to even help us with our energy problems.\n\nEdit: I'd also like to add, if one is thinking of using this idea to take electricity run it through this machine and burn the salt water for heat, that would be petty useless. Honestly, one can just use a electric heater instead. Like the kind at walmart that you use to heat a small room, or a bigger type, such as a electric stove. Those are highly efficient at turning the electricity into heat. Thus, using this to generate heat would most likely prove pointlessAll these devices that use water as fuel take more energy than is extracted from the water unfortunately. However, the nano-metal flakes being used to attach themselves to cancer cells and heat up sound extremely promising.\n\n__________________ sig deleted by muddocktor-take it up with the Adminsnothing is impossible right?\n\nimo only big oil can stop this from becoming a solution at some point in the future since water can burn or so it appears why cant we invent the perfect low power frq generator?\nthat will allow it to be utilized, I mean right now there using bio fuel which is basically a beer type solution fermented and the final product is an alcohol based fuel and that whole process isint exactly efficient either, even now there trying to produce bacteria that will speed the process instead of using the yeast process...\n\nThere has got to be a better mouse trap and the whole hydrogen fuel thing looks the best especially now that passing some radio frequency through water releases the hydrogen to burn freely ??? come on lets start re inventing the wheel already !!!\n\nEvery super brain on the planet should be getting together day in & day out and having think tank sessions till they make it work seriously if a layman can see the potential...Naturally, a year ago, no one would have guessed that you could burn salt water. But remember one thing. Just because you can do something, that doesn't make doing it worth-while.\n\n2nd. Lets say for arguments sake that they can get the power consumption on the radio wave generator down. and while their at it, they find a way to burn the salt water more efficiently ( i'd assume they'd do this, by \"fine tuning\" the radio frequency/amplitude to break down the water molecules better/faster ).\n\nSo lets say that they get the efficiency up to 90%. which honeslty, is a high end guess. Well guess what? Electric heaters ( aka: the type i mentioned before. Better known as \"space heaters\", also are used in electric range stoves..etc.. ) run at pretty much 100% efficiency.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by answers.com\n\nHeaters of this kind have an inherent efficiency of 100% in converting electric energy into heat. Devices such as electric ranges, ovens, hot-water heaters, sterilizers, stills, baths, furnaces, and space heaters are part of the long list of resistance heating equipment.\n\nNow, the use of this wave generator and salt burning, is to produce heat. They take electricity, run the wave generator, stick salt-water in the machine, and ignite the salt-water. Generating heat.\n\nthe simple problem is that we already have a way of converting electricity into heat, at 100% efficiency. ( yes, i know nothing is 100% efficient, because of resistance, in one form or another. BUT electric heats use this resistance to turn the electricity into heat. Because NORMALLY heat is the byproduct of INEFFICIENCY. But since we WANT heat, more heat = efficiency ).\n\nAlso, we can take electricity, and turn it into mechanical power, via Motors. If there was a way to put this salt-water and machine into a car, and find a way to get the water to combust, then that could help with the oil problem...BUT we'd be taking electricity, turning it into radio waves. Then taking the radio waves, and using them to turn salt-water into a heat source. Which, the salt water will NOT all burn off. ( aka: there would be quite a bit of salt residue left ). which, if it all doesn't burn...thats inefficiency. Which would damage vehicles over time.\n\nSo...if we created a new car engine to utilize this...we'd still have to find a way of transferring the heat generated to turn the wheels. Which, the collection of the heat will also be inefficient.\n\nall of that would have to be done, and solved before this could be used in a viable, and economical way. When we can just take electricity, and send it into a motor, or generate heat via electric heaters.\n\nAs i said, just because something is new, or cool, doesn't always make it viable in the real world, or economical__________________ sig deleted by muddocktor-take it up with the AdminsHonestly...i don't see how this will be utilized. Whats the overall benefit of this? Maybe we can find a way to use this technology to split water into oxygen and hydrogen better than electrolysis. Though i doubt that, simply because we use electricity to DIRECTLY split water, when this would require us to transform the electricity into radio waves, THEN split the water. And when it comes to efficiency...the less steps that are taken, the higher the efficiency. The more steps you take, the less efficient you get.\n\nThats why i say that i honestly don't see this becoming much of a use. We can already do almost everything this machine does, with electricity directly, without having to transform it into another form of energy. ( in this case, radio waves ).\n\nSomeone may have an idea, but that doesn't mean its a GOOD idea. An example is Thomas Edison. He filed over 1,000 patents ( 1,093 to be exact ), but not all of them were GOOD idea.\n\nwe have millions of patents filed all the time. But only a small handful is actually good enough to be used in every day life.\n\nNot all idea's, are good idea's. Which explains this device perfectly. Its an idea. Hell, its a COOL idea! it BURNS salt water! but it doesn't make itWhat is happening is the radio waves are causing the hydrogen molecules to separate and that is what he is burning. Which we already knew was possible. We already knew how to separate hydrogen from water, the most common way being electrolysis, which is more efficient then the way this guy is doing it with radio waves.\n\nNow all power to him, its from people like him that we get the most unusual breakthroughs. The more people try new things the further we advance in technology, lets hope others realized this, by checking out the article and video's on this topic themselfs. But for those who havn't...thats exactly what is happening.\n\nBut lets not get anal retentive. If we did, we'd have to point out every time someone burns a candle wick. Because the candle wick isn't burning, its the fuel that the wick absorbs that is burning. etc..etc.. It just causes threads to go astray. ( not nit-picking at you, you brought up a important fact, that may not have been known by those who only watched a few short clips on this ).\n\nBut as you said, we knew about splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen a LONG time ago. this guy just found another method of doing so. And sadly, his method is less efficient than the ways we do it now. As i said, This may be cool...but its not practical.\n\nedit: But i'd like to add onto what shelnutt2 said. People like him helps. Sure, hey may have an idea that isn't practical. But the data they accumulate could lead to other advances using radio waves. Maybe they could use this idea to split other liquids, that are much harder, or more costly to separate. Maybe they will find other practical ways to use high frequency radio waves that they didn't think about before. I'm just saying that this specific use of this technology isn'tHis Project had nothing to do with Burning Salt water, this guy was working on a way to isolate cancer cells in the body and Kill them with Radio waves with out killing the healthy cells like Kemo does.\n\nthis \"Burning water\" was an accident, lots of talk has swirled about using it for power generation, but really the only useful place for this as power generation is in Tanker ships or other large vessels traveling over saltwater. but much work would have to be done. and this guy is still after a cancer treatment so I don't think anyone will be working on this too much in the near futureYa we all knew or I assumed that it was known that the hydrogen is what is being burned...\n\nMarquies right now we have hydro electric dams which produce the electricity to power the space heater you speak of. There are also Steam Power Plants that generate electricity using coal or other fossil fuel to boil water to create steam which spins a turbine that moves a magnetic field through copper windings and produces allot of electricity why couldn't some of that electricity be used to power the wave generator that allows the hydrogen to burn so freely, I just don't see how or why having the ability to burn saltwater {hydrogen} which doesn't pollute and is giving off a 3000 degree flame etc cant be somehow involved in changing the future of how we derive our energy including generating electricity.\n\nI'm not talking about perpetual motion right, but nature has perpetual energy or so it seems where does the lightning keep coming from? Its involved in a never ending cycle that involves evaporation, wind, rain, even the magma in the earth's core is involved in one way or another so its not impossible ps its not never ending cuz one day it will end but thats probably not any time soon or we can hope not lol"

      "text": "Crystals + sound + water = clean hydrogen fuel\n\nEvery drop of water is stuffed with the greenest of fuels, hydrogen, but getting it out is a challenge. A new material raises the prospect of doing so using noise pollution – from major roads, for example.\n\nA team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison made crystals of zinc oxide that, when immersed in water, absorb vibrations and develop areas of strong negative and positive charge. These charges rip apart nearby water molecules, releasing hydrogen and oxygen gas.\n\n\"This is like a free lunch,\" says lead researcher Huifang Xu. \"You are getting energy from the environment just like solar cells capture energy from the sun.\"\n\nUnderwater operator\n\nXu and colleagues generate hydrogen using a new variation on piezoelectric crystals – materials that generate a voltage when strained and which are being investigated as a way to generate electricity from movement.\n\nThe new crystals, however, are designed to be submerged, so the charge they generate instead pulls apart water molecules to release hydrogen and oxygen gas, a mechanism Xu's team calls the piezoelectrochemical effect.\n\nXu and colleagues grew thin microfibers of highly flexible zinc oxide crystals that flex when subjected to vibration, for example due to sound waves. They showed that ultrasonic vibrations under water cause the fibres to bend between 5 and 10 degrees at each end, creating an electrical field with a high enough voltage to split water and release oxygen and hydrogen.\n\nGrowing fibres with different dimensions changes the type of vibration they absorb best. For instance, it should be possible to tune them to maximise energy production from the vibrations caused by water flowing past or any other sound, say Xu.\n\nEfficiency issue\n\nXu says that lab tests suggested the material can convert 18 per cent of the energy it absorbs from vibration into energy locked up in hydrogen gas, which can be released by burning.\n\nConventional piezoelectric materials are not as efficient at converting vibrations into electricity, and typically achieve around a 10 percent conversion rate. Using the charge a material generates indirectly, to split water, instead of directly to drive current, accounts for the difference, says Xu. The new materials could be used to develop systems that generate hydrogen from the noise of anything from machinery to crashing waves, he adds.\n\n\"It's a good idea,\" says Jinhui Song of Georgia Tech University, Atlanta. Because there is no need to create a circuit, devices based on the new crystals could be simpler than those based on conventional dry piezoelectrics, he points out. \"They can reduce the complexity of the device.\"\n\nHowever, he's sceptical that the wet devices should necessarily be more efficient. In principle, says Song, the energy generated by a material should be the same however it is deployed Ironic. . .\n\nHow Ironic. . .\n\nThu Mar 18 16:10:33 GMT 2010 by Eric Kvaalen\n\nI think this idea is about as daft as the other crystal vibrations.\n\nSound, at least at levels that are encountered in everyday life, has very little power. For instance, a chain saw gives off about 0.1 watts of sound. If you put a surface of 1 square metre at a distance of 10 metres, it would receive less than a thousandth of that power. See \n\nMaybe they should put one of these beside the space shuttle when it takes off. That gives off around a megawatt of sound!\n\nHow Ironic. . .\n\nWed Mar 24 20:57:13 GMT 2010 by sheesh\n\nSorry the first thing I thought was \" Give me a lever long enough and a firm enough place to stand and I will move the world\" this may only create tiny amounts of energy but if it can be done on a scale that makes it comercialy viable whats to stop them fitting a box full of crystals under every manhole cover let this feed the hydrogen into a thin pipe inside the water main (thus helping neutralise any danger from leaks) the oxygen could be released improving air quality as well.\n\nIf the boxes cost £20 to make and install and make £10 of hydrogen a year then you could make a million of them and make a real difference.\n\nAs for the low energy consider the amount of noise pollution in your average city? a main road can produce a near constant 60 decibels, add in a local school half a dozen houses with TV's, just like solar panels these would have to be sited in the right place to maximise efficiency, and maybe make them a mixture so they have a broad range of working frequencies. Perhaps improve the efficiency by designing accoustic amplifiers.\n\nImagine if this as being to sound what solar cells are to light and the potential is obvious for the future.\n\nHow Ironic. . .\n\nThu Mar 25 06:26:49 GMT 2010 by Eric Kvaalen\n\nTo generate £10 worth of hydrogen takes, grosso modo, about 100,000 Wh. That's like capturing ALL the sound coming from a chain saw for 100 years, or all the sound coming from it and hitting a square metre 10 metres away for 100,000 years.\n\n60 decibel traffic has 10,000 times less energy per square metre per second than 100 decibels (my guess for the chain saw at a reasonable distance).\n\nHow Ironic. . .\n\nThu Mar 25 15:18:01 GMT 2010 by John\n\nThere was an engineer who ran a car on water alone... The late Stan Meyers. The Water Molecule is semi-ionic in nature due to the stronger pull of the oxygen vs the hydrogens and due to the angle of the bond between the three atoms. Now if you pulse a frequency across the molecule at the resonant frequency of the bond it will split, like a wine glass and the singer. The energy is much lower than that needed for constant current.

You can drop this thing into some water and take it outside, and it'll happily bubble away, giving off pure oxygen from one side and pure hydrogen from another.\n\nThis is not the first artificial leaf, but what makes it special is that it's much, much cheaper than anything that's been produced so far. Instead of using platinum as a catalyst to split off hydrogen, the MIT leaf uses a nickel-molybdenum-zinc compound, with cobalt on the other side to produce oxygen, all of which are metals that are fairly common on Earth.\n\nThe MIT researchers say that this could be a great way to deliver inexpensive and self-contained sources of energy to the developing world, but to get all selfish for a second, we're excited that this may provide a way to make hydrogen a viable fuel for everything from next-gen cars to fuel cell electronics.

Specifically, while bulk silicon reflects over 30% of light across the spectrum (at normal incidence) and PV manufacturers are able to reduce this to 5-8% with anti-reflection coatings and surface texturing, nano-silicon can reflect less than 1% of incoming light. This leads to more of the light being absorbed in the solar cell and more electricity for the end-user.\n\nIn addition, while the effectivenes of most anti-reflection coatings declines at non-normal incidence, Bandgap's nano-silicon retains reflection below 4% for angles up to 70 degrees, yielding more KWh per KW installed than traditional silicon-based PV products."

Antonio is looking to use graphene (above) as a cheaper alternative in the manufacture of solar cells.\n\nGoing green is the in thing these days.\n\nWhether it is through recycling our trash, conserving our resources, or pursuing renewable energy, everyone -- from large multinational companies to your average Filipino -- is being asked to chip in to help save the state of our environment.\n\nBut it isn't always easy going green. Sometimes, price can be prohibitive, as in the case of solar cells. While a great option for those looking to get into renewable energy, prices for solar cells on buy and sell site Sulit.com.ph range from P3,500 to P8,000 -- far from the reach of most Filipinos.\n\nThat may not soon be the case if Napoleon Salvador B. Antonio, a BS Chemistry with Materials Science and Engineering student at the Ateneo de Manila University, has anything to say about it.\n\nAntonio won third place at the BPI-DOST Best Project of the Year Awards for his research titled \"Towards Affordable Solar Cells: Fabrication of Photovoltaic Devices Incorporating Doped Graphene from Graphite and Doped Carbon from Pyrolyzed Glycerol.\" The project aims to lower the cost of making solar cells by replacing the gold used in its manufacturing with the cheaper graphene.\n\nBecause of his work, Antonio was awarded P10,000 in addition to the P25,000 he received by being one of the competition's 30 finalists.\n\n\"During the event and presentation itself, at first, I was a bit nervous but eventually I got my momentum. My mindset was simply to share and discuss my study,\" he says. \"I personally want my research to grow and be utilized, whether or not I win the event. Winning was not my first priority.\"\n\nCREATING SOMETHING NEW\n\nAntonio says that he was curious even as a young child, and his fascination with the way the world works would often lead to \"experiments\" in the bathroom.\n\n\"I often read about 'How stuff works' books or the mechanisms behind the everyday things we observe. That curiosity paved the way into exploring different concepts, whether they were new or odd ideas,\" he recalls. \"I do remember clearly when I was a toddler that I often mix shampoos, conditioners, soaps, or anything I find in the bathroom; mixed them together and then used them.\"\n\nThis interest in creating something new would stay with Antonio, which is how he found himself trying to find a way to create cheaper solar cells as his research project for his BS Chemistry course.\n\n\"Although I really like fabricating and inventing stuff, this topic posed as a challenge because this material, graphene, was difficult to handle, and the methodologies for fabricating this carbon-based cell utilizes very advanced instruments, which our laboratory does not have,\" he says.\n\nAside from the lack of advanced instruments, Antonio says there were other difficulties he had to contend with, such as the limited time with which to do the research, the different environmental conditions here in the country that were far from those prescribed, balancing this project with extracurricular activities, and the lack of some materials and chemicals. Fighting for the spot to represent Ateneo at the BPI-DOST Science Awards would prove to be equally demanding work.\n\n\"In my university, each department nominated their candidates, which would be screened by the professors. Since this happened early in the school year, I spent days and nights -- including my weekends -- in order to produce results. I had to work around my class schedule and sacrificed a lot of extra-curricular activities,\" he recalls.\n\nCHEAPER AND CLEANER\n\nAfter his win, Antonio says he continued working on the project, or had other people work on it with him.\n\n\"I am very willing to continue my project; in fact, I am inclined to share my ideas so that people realize the opportunity and possibility of having affordable and cleaner solar cells,\" he says. \"I am willing for other people to look into my research. The input of other people -- from chemists to engineers, from businessmen to economists -- all contribute to the same advocacy of providing access to a cheaper and cleaner energy resource.\"\n\nAntonio hopes that competitions like the BPI-DOST Best Project of the Year Awards continue to fan the flames of curiosity in young Filipinos' minds, cash prize or not.\n\n\"This competition provided opportunities for young scientists to share their ideas and to make an impression in the community; but this, honestly, does not limit Filipinos in conducting research for the prize, pride, or fame,\" he says. \"A competition is important for awareness; it is not to prove your research is better than the other. Research should be oriented towards the hunger of curiosity, the call of need of the society – it should basically answer a certain question.\""

Benton Professor Ralph Yang of the Department of Chemical Engineering, will receive more than $5 million to develop new materials for storing large amounts of hydrogen at normally encountered temperatures and pressures.\n\nThe Yaghi group has created materials called metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), sometimes referred to as crystal sponges. MOFs are essentially scaffolds made up of linked rods, a structure that maximizes surface area. Just one gram of a MOF, in fact, has the surface area of a football field. The researchers found that they can increase the material's storage capacity by modifying the rods in various ways, making it possible to stuff more hydrogen molecules into a small area without resorting to high pressure or low temperature.\n\nMOFs can be made from low-cost ingredients, such as zinc oxide—a common ingredient of sunscreen—and terephthalate, which is used in plastic soda bottles. \"More than 500 MOFs have been synthesized and are being investigated,\" Yaghi said.\n\nMatzger added: \"One thing we want to know is, why are these things so good at what they do, and how can they be made better.\"\n\nThe Yang group has been investigating the storage of hydrogen with a new type of materials called carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Carbon nanotubes are tiny tubes made of carbon that are about 10,000 times smaller than human hair. These tubes are made up by rolled-up sheets of graphite. Yang's group is also interested in hydrogen storage in a specific type of carbon nanotubes called graphite nanofibers (GNFs). These new materials have unique adsorption properties, according to Yang, including their large hydrogen storage capacities at ambient temperature. Now Yang and his coworkers will try to figure out how to maximize the storage capacity of these new materials and also to get a fundamental understanding of the reasons for this unique property.\n\nMatzger and Yaghi's efforts to understand exactly how MOFs work, as well as the work by Yang's group, will be funded through a grant to a National Renewable Energy Laboratory carbon center. In other work, focusing on new materials, the Matzger-Yahgi team will collaborate with researchers at Northwestern University. \"In that work, we're asking what's the next generation of materials that could perhaps exceed what's possible with present MOFs,\" said Matzger.\n\nThe grants, announced April 27 by Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham, are part of President George W. Bush's Hydrogen Research Initiative, a $1.2 billion commitment in research funding to bring hydrogen and fuel cell technology from the laboratory to the showroom.\n\nSelected through a merit-reviewed, competitive process, the projects involve 30 lead organizations and more than 100 partners. Recipients include universities, industry and Department of Energy national laboratories.\n\n\"President Bush's administration recognizes that a hydrogen economy has the long-term potential to deliver greater energy independence by reducing America's dependence on foreign sources of energy,\" said Abraham. \"It offers immense environmental benefits that current energy technologies cannot meet. This multi-million dollar commitment to research is a down payment on a more energy- and environmentally-secure future.\""

Their report appears in the journal ACS Nano.\n\nYang Yang, Rui Zhu, Paul S. Weiss and colleagues explain that there has been intense world-wide interest in so-called polymer solar cells (PSCs), which are made from plastic-like materials. PSCs are lightweight and flexible and can be produced in high volume at low cost. That interest extends to producing transparent PSCs. However, previous versions of transparent PSCs have had many disadvantages, which the team set out to correct.\n\nThey describe a new kind of PSC that produces energy by absorbing mainly infrared light, not visible light, making the cells 66 percent transparent to the human eye. They made the device from a photoactive plastic that converts infrared light into an electrical current. Another breakthrough is the transparent conductor made of a mixture of silver nanowire and titanium dioxide nanoparticles, which was able to replace the opaque metal electrode used in the past. This composite electrode also allowed the solar cell to be fabricated economically by solution processing. The authors suggest the panels could be used in smart windows or portable electronics.\n\nAbstract Visibly transparent photovoltaic devices can open photovoltaic applications in many areas, such as building-integrated photovoltaics or integrated photovoltaic chargers for portable electronics. We demonstrate high-performance, visibly transparent polymer solar cells fabricated via solution processing. The photoactive layer of these visibly transparent polymer solar cells harvests solar energy from the near-infrared region while being less sensitive to visible photons. The top transparent electrode employs a highly transparent silver nanowire–metal oxide composite conducting film, which is coated through mild solution processes. With this combination, we have achieved 4% power-conversion efficiency for solution-processed and visibly transparent polymer solar cells. The optimized devices have a maximum transparency of 66% at 550 nm.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(Phys.org) -- UCLA researchers have developed a new transparent solar cell that is an advance toward giving windows in homes and other buildings the ability to generate electricity while still allowing peopleResearchers in California are reporting an advance toward the long-sought goal of \"invisible electronics\" and transparent displays, which can be highly desirable for heads-up displays, wind-shield displays, and electronic ...\n\nSolar energy is one of the most promising forms of renewable energy, but the high cost of conventional solar cells has so far limited its popularity.

Good for commercial buildings only. 4% efficiency, how do you expect this technology to be viable worth it, and at only 66% transparency. It would have to be 8% efficient, 85% transparent and cheap as hell. This technology is strictly a research project.\n\nTo quote the full paper: \"The optical transmittance measurement in this plot shows that the sample with fabricated transparent SN-TFTs with ITO electrodes had a transmittance 85% over the visible light regime (380780 nm).

The 'eel,' which is actually a knifefish, can discharge an electric current of about 500 volts at 1 Ampere (500 watts). That's not far from the shock you'd get from making contact with a wall circuit. It's impressive enough that scientists have wondered for a long time if an artificial means couldn't be developed from the eel's form of bioelectrogenesis.\n\nFour-fifths of an electric eel's body is, in a sense, a battery. This 'battery' is composed of cells, called electrocytes. The cells contain ions (electrically charged particles) that build up from metabolic chemical processes. A fully-charged cell has only about 0.15 volt, but the cells are arranged in rows. When the eel decides to use is electric charge for hunting or defense, it opens a flow of positively charged sodium ions over the electrocytes, which attracts and conducts the electric charge within the cells to discharge points. This process is what a research team in Maryland (USA) set out to reproduce.\n\nDavid LaVan of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Maryland and his colleagues wanted to study the operation of living cell membranes and their proteins. They began by experimenting on artificial \"protocells\". These, like real cells, were surrounded by membranes made of fatty molecules. Proteins \"floating\" in the membranes would let only certain ions pass. Using this system, the researchers realised that they might be able to copy the eel's electricity-generation mechanism.\n\nThe team fused two protocells together, so that they shared part of their respective membranes. They then added a dilute concentration of potassium chloride to one protocell and a more concentrated solution to the other. The difference in concentrations of potassium and chloride ions would normally cause ions to move from the less concentrated protocell to the more concentrated one. In this case, however, the membrane between the protocells was too thick to permit much of this kind of movement.\n\nNext, Dr LaVan and his colleagues installed a protein called alpha-hemolysin into the protocell membrane. This functioned as a selective bridge, permitting the passage of positively charged sodium ions, but not negatively charged chloride ions. As the selected ions moved in one direction, electrons (which are negatively charged) flowed in the opposite direction. To make use of this electrical current, the team connected tiny electrodes to the protocells.\n\nThe lab results were encouraging, producing a useable and sustainable current. Of course, this is lab work – a long way from practical testing, and even longer from commercial application. It is indicative, however, of the many approaches being taken to one of the most stubborn and important requirements for new technology – the better battery."

When light falls on the outer material, a process begins due to the interaction of the core with the shell layers, leading to the creation of electrical charges.\n\nThe work was described in the Oct. 18 issue of the journal Nature.\n\nThe idea of creating nanoscale photovoltaics is not new, Lieber said, but prior efforts used organic compounds in combination with semiconductor nanostructures that had lower efficiency and that degraded under concentrated sunlight. Lieber's materials have several advantages, he said. The materials are more efficient, converting 3.4 percent of the sunlight into electricity; they can withstand concentrated light without deteriorating, gaining efficiency up to about 5 percent; and they're as cheap to make as other related nanoscale photovoltaic devices.\n\n\"The real [question] is whether there's a new geometry that will lead to better photovoltaic technology,\" Lieber said. \"We worked on coaxial geometry.\"\n\nThe most recent development builds on Lieber's considerable prior work on nanoscale devices. He has developed sensors with potential bioterrorism applications that can detect a single virus or other particle, nanowire arrays that can detect signals in individual neurons, and a cracker-sized detector for cancer.\n\nA cheap nanoscale power source broadens the potential applications of such nanoscale devices. Though the tiny photovoltaic cells can generate enough electricity to power a similarly tiny circuit, Lieber said they're not yet efficient enough to have applications on the scale of commercial power generation.\n\nCommercial solar cells, he said, have efficiencies around 20 percent, compared with 3.4 percent for his nano-solar cells. One avenue of future research, Lieber said, will be to explore ways to boost efficiency of the nanowire photovoltaics. If they can reach 10 to 15 percent, he said, their lower cost of production — they can be made from relatively inexpensive materials and don't require clean rooms to produce — may make them useful in larger-scale applications.\n\n\"There's no physical reason it couldn't be higher,\" Lieber said. \"I'm pretty optimistic that we'll be able to track down the efficiency issue.\"\n\nUntil then, Lieber sees a future for the nanowire photovoltaics in niche applications, such as multiple distributed sensors or durable, flexible devices, possibly sewn into clothing or worn as a patch.\n\n\"It will have to be unique to be an economically viable application, some place where you want durability and flexibility, where if it gets destroyed, people don't care,\" Lieber said.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nScientists are one step closer to a revolution in DNA sequencing, following the development in a Harvard lab of a tiny device designed to read the minute electrical changes produced when DNA strands are passed ...Conventional electronics could in the future tap into the computational power of ultrahigh-density nanowire circuits via novel linking devices under development at university and corporate labs across the nation, experts ...\n\nArrays of silicon nanowires with biomolecular coatings can spot molecular traces of cancer far more accurately, quickly and specifically than technology currently available to doctors, experts told"

For the first time, a silicon-based optical fiber with the ability to be used as a solar cell has been created, and is scalable to a usable size. The new research brings the possibility of flexible, irregular, cloth-like solar cells (woven from the fibers) nearly within reach.\n\n\"The team's new findings build on earlier work addressing the challenge of merging optical fibers with electronic chips — silicon-based integrated circuits that serve as the building blocks for most semiconductor electronic devices such as solar cells, computers and cellphones. Rather than merge a flat chip with a round optical fiber, the team found a way to build a new kind of optical fiber — which is thinner than the width of a human hair — with its own integrated electronic component, thereby bypassing the need to integrate fiber-optics with chips. To do this, they used high-pressure chemistry techniques to deposit semiconducting materials directly, layer by layer, into tiny holes in optical fibers.\"\n\nFor the new research the same techniques were used to create a crystalline silicon semiconductor fiber that is able to work as a solar cell, which essentially means a fiber that can create electricity from sunlight.\n\n\"Our goal is to extend high-performance electronic and solar-cell function to longer lengths and to more flexible forms. We already have made meters-long fibers but, in principle, our team's new method could be used to create bendable silicon solar-cell fibers of over 10 meters in length,\" Badding said. \"Long, fiber-based solar cells give us the potential to do something we couldn't really do before: We can take the silicon fibers and weave them together into a fabric with a wide range of applications such as power generation, battery charging, chemical sensing and biomedical devices.\"\n\nElectricity-generating fabrics obviously have an enormous number of possible applications, allowing much greater autonomy from centralized power sources.\n\n\"A solar cell is usually made from a glass or plastic substrate onto which hydrogenated amorphous silicon has been grown,\" Badding explained. \"Such a solar cell is created using an expensive piece of equipment called a PECVD (plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition) reactor and the end result is something flat with little flexibility. But woven, fiber-based solar cells would be lightweight, flexible configurations that are portable, foldable and even wearable.\"\n\nThe woven fibers could simply be connected to electronic devices, easily charging them on the go. \"The military especially is interested in designing wearable power sources for soldiers in the field,\" Badding added.\n\nAnother major advantage of such fabrics would be their ability to use light simultaneously from various different angles, thanks to their flexible nature.\n\n\"A typical solar cell has only one flat surface,\" Badding said. \"But a flexible, curved solar-cell fabric would not be as dependent upon where the light is coming from or where the sun is in the horizon and the time of day.\"\n\nPier J. A. Sazio of the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom and one of the team's leaders added, \"Another intriguing property of these silicon-fiber devices is that as they are so compact, they can have a very fast response to visible laser light. In fact, we fabricated fiber-based photodetectors with a bandwidth of over 1.8 GHz.\"\n\nThe findings were just published in the online edition of the journal Advanced Materials on December 6th"

Despite relevant PV technologies being available for more than half a century, the production of solar energy remains costly, largely owing to low power conversion efficiencies of solar cells. The main difficulty in improving the efficiency of PV energy conversion lies in the spectral mismatch between the energy distribution of photons in the incident solar spectrum and the bandgap of a semiconductor material. In recent years, luminescent materials, which are capable of converting a broad spectrum of light into photons of a particular wavelength, have been synthesized and used to minimize the losses in the solar-cell-based energy conversion process. In this review, we will survey recent progress in the development of spectral converters, with a particular emphasis on lanthanide-based upconversion, quantum-cutting and down-shifting materials, for PV applications. In addition, we will also present technical challenges that arise in developing cost-effective high-performance solar cells based on these luminescent materials."

She will receive the 2002 Francis P. Garvan-John M. Olin Medal from the American Chemical Society at its national meeting in Orlando, Fla.\n\nThurnauers insights into plants and chlorophyll, the light-absorbing molecule that makes vegetation green, has potential impact on research as diverse as breaking down hazardous waste into harmless compounds and perhaps even repairing faulty DNA.\n\nThe key is keeping the energy transfer moving forward, said Thurnauer, who is a biophysical chemist at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. Her work focuses on the earliest steps of photosynthesis, the process that converts light into chemical energy to drive the growth, repair and reproduction of plants.\n\nThe first reaction to take place is a separation of electrical charge, she said. Light is absorbed, the energy excites the chlorophyll molecules, and a fast electron transfer sets up the charge separation.\n\nIntrigued, Thurnauer and her team then made a laboratory version of the energy pump that keeps the negatively charged electrons away from the positively charged holes they leave behind. Moving electrons in a controlled manner can be a way to chemically neutralize toxic compounds, for example.\n\nTheir laboratory system uses nanocrystalline particles of metal oxides. As light pumps energy into a particle, electrons from molecules attached to the surface of the particle can move into the particle.

Since the conversion of the fuel to energy takes place via an electrochemical process (not combustion) the process is clean, quiet and highly efficient--two to three times more efficient than fuel burning.[1]\n\nOf course there are other types of fuel cells besides PEM, including direct methanol, alkaline, phosphoric acid, molten carbonate and solid oxide.

In addition, tests have shown they hold the majority of their charge over 3,000 charge cycles, many more than today's smartphone batteries. Magnesium is also cheap and abundant. However, the technology is still unproven. To be truly useful, researchers need to find a suitable cathode, something that has held back previous efforts. And this is where his computational approach comes in.\n\nProf Ceder and his colleagues have virtually screened more than 12,000 materials. Those that show potential are synthesized and tested. At least four materials are now being studied in detail. He claims that one cathode material has already demonstrated performance that would create batteries with greater energy density than today's lithium ion technology. He will not reveal more details, but it is enough to have attracted significant interest from investors and the US military. He has also established a start-up called Pellion Technologies to exploit the technology, initially for use in cars. However, if he is successful the technology could trickle down to mobile phones in years to come.\n\nApple juice\n\nIf and when it does, it may have to compete with another powerful contender for your future phone – the fuel cell. Like batteries, these convert chemical energy into electricity through a chemical reaction. However, these work more like tiny engines, converting the chemical energy from a fuel – an alcohol, say - into electricity through a chemical reaction with oxygen. And like an engine, they continue to run providing there is enough fuel and oxygen flowing through them.\n\nThey are an old technology dating back to the 19th Century and were successfully used to power elements of the early Gemini and Apollo space missions, for example. But they have now caught the attention of phone manufacturers because they have a high energy density. Simply put, fuels contain lots of energy. For example, hydrogen contains nearly 150 times the energy of an equivalent weight of lithium. However, to be workable they need to be small and have an easily rechargeable reservoir for fuel.\n\nTo build these, researchers are focusing on so-called MEMs technology - miniaturized mechanical devices and structures built using the patterning and etching techniques pioneered to build early computer chips. These are already used to make everything from solar cells to flat-screen TVs. Crucially, these techniques have advanced to the point where they can now be used to construct complex 3D structures – such as the networks of channels and pipes necessary for a tiny fuel cell.\n\nThe technology can be expensive, with precious metals such as platinum and palladium used to speed up chemical reactions, and hydrogen sources, even when compressed or in liquid form, taking up a lot of space. There are also the practicalities of having to moving and storing the fuel necessary to charge your phone on the go, not to mention the potential problems of handling potentially toxic fuels to make a phone call.\n\nHowever, companies such as NEC and Toshiba have already shown off prototype fuel cells for mobiles. And in December 2011, news that Apple had filed two more patent applications for fuel cells for portable electronic devices reignited interest. The applications showed the company is proposing the use of reducing agent sodium borohydride, which when mixed with water generates pure hydrogen, and that they would be used alongside a battery to cut down on size, weight and cost. The documents suggest the technology could power devices for \"days or even weeks\".\n\nBut, according to St Andrew's Prof Bruce, we should not get too excited yet. \"In the longer term there are these radical technologies which could transform energy storage for consumer electronics applications,\" he says. But, for the next few years, he believes, lithium-ion batteries are here to stay. Better remember to pack that charger"

      "text": "The plasma used in fusion reactors holds great potential in terms of bringing down costs of this energy source. Over the past few years, researchers have been exploring ways to contain and stabilize this plasma.\n\nDuring the International Atomic Energy Association's 24th annual Fusion Energy Conference, held in San Diego this week, the team led by Thomas Jarboe, Proffesor of aeronautics and astronautics at University of Washington, presented a method that uses around 1% of the energy required by existing methods, to contain the material.\n\nThe shape of the new tool resembles a handles on a coffee mug. It is attached to a vessel filled with plasma heated to 1 million degrees. The process of nuclear fission, where nuclear power is generated from splitting of an atom, is known to many, however nuclear fusion, where two atoms are smashed together, is still under research. It is established that during this process, energy is released without generating radioactive waste, or using rare elements.\n\nMost people know about nuclear fission, the commercial type of nuclear power generated from splitting large atoms in two. Still under research is nuclear fusion, which smashes two small atoms together, releasing energy without requiring rare elements or generating radioactive waste.\n\nThe main limitation of this process is the amount of energy needed in order to bring the atoms together. The focus of current studies is directed towards finding a way to produce more energy that the amount put in.\n\nJarboe commented on the method used in a big international project, based in France, where the teams are constructing a huge fusion reactor in order to generate fusion power. This reactor is designed to inject high-frequency electromagnetic waves, together with high-speed hydrogen ions to sustain the plasma. These two components should keep the operation temperature at a million degrees and enclose it with magnetic fields.\n\nAccording to the Professor from Washington University, however, the method is inefficient and too expensive. Therefore, together with his team, he has worked on finding better alternatives. They have investigated helicity injection, where spirals in the plasma produce asymmetric currents. These produce electric and magnetic fields that do similar job in heating and preserving the contents.\n\nThe high temperature of the plasma causes electrons to separate from the nuclei and keep it away from any contact with the walls, allowing it to be contained by a magnetic bottle.\n\nThe team found that although the required input energy is still high, it is a lot less than what is used in other existing methods. The system, however, was still vulnerable and any small twist in the plasma could disturb the equilibrium of the system and shutdown the reactor.\n\nThis presented a major challenge. The team's initial concern was leakage during a distortion of the bottle. They wanted to stabilize the equilibrium, so small shifts would go back to their original state. To do this, they imposed the asymmetric field, which stabilized the plasma and driving of the current was possible, allowing the bottle to hold more plasma.\n\nThe equipment that they developed has two coils in the shape of handles. They follow the so-called method of imposed dynamo current drive, where the \"handles\" generate currents on either side of the central core alternately. The plasma remains stable, the method is energy-efficient, however the reactor used in their study is too small to contain all plasma and gas still manages to escape. Whether a larger reactor would be able to maintain a sufficiently tight magnetic bottle, we will find out from the team's next publication"

The company has developed a cathode material based on inexpensive metals (including manganese) that stores more energy per unit of weight than anything else in use today – twice the energy density of lithium cobalt oxide. Because of the material's stability at higher voltages, it is able to access high capacities with long cycle life. The combination of high capacity and low cost metals helps to significantly lower the price per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy storage. By putting more energy in each battery, the number of batteries required decreases – by 50% in Envia's case, dramatically reducing the overall cost of the application. Its proprietary nano-coating process and high voltage electrolyte and electrolyte additive technology enables high cycle life and long calendar life.\n\nOne of the main barriers to mass EV adoption is range anxiety. Most electric vehicles have an 80-100 mile range. The key factor in determining the vehicle's electric range is the energy density of the battery. Current technologies max out at 180 Wh/kg. Envia's technology enables a 2-3X improvement in vehicle range compared to other Lithium cell chemistries.\n\nAnother barrier to EV adoption is the perceived safety risk of lithium batteries resulting from recent post-crash fires of some electric vehicles. Thermal runaway in a lithium battery occurs when the cell exceeds the critical temperature above which an increase of the cell temperature is irreversible due to the exothermic heat associated with structural changes of the anode, cathode and the electrolyte. Although the thermal reactions are associated with solid electrolyte interface (SEI) decomposition at the anode¹, progressive reactions, which cause the cells to catch fire, are associated with the cathode.\n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is one of the techniques used to evaluate the heat associated with various components of the Li-ion battery. DSC is used to analyze the onset of the reaction, which is shown by an increase in an exotherm.\n\nLayered cathode chemistries such as NCA have high specific capacities (although not quite as high as that of Envia's HCMR cathode). As we shall see in the following discussion, the thermal stability of NCA is not as good as Envia's cathode either.\n\nThe chart to the right shows the results of a DSC study² comparing NCA and a manganese-rich layered-layered cathode very similar to Envia's cathode. Please note that the NCA material was only charged to 4.2V whereas the manganese-rich cathode was charged to 4.6V (for higher specific capacities).\n\nIn the DSC study, NCA shows one major exothermic peak around 275ºC followed by smaller complex exothermic peaks. However the major exothermic peak starts around 200ºC and\nreaches its maximum at 275ºC. This is associated with structural changes in association with the oxygen loss. The following multiple peaks are associated with progressive decomposition of the cathode. However in case of the cathode material similar to Envia's, only one major peak is observed around 275ºC with an onset temperature around 260ºC.\n\nThe higher onset temperature implies a higher thermal stability of the Envia-like cathode compared to NCA. The sharper peak in the manganese-rich cathode also implies the lack of a continuous reaction thereby reducing the amount of heat produced during any event and lessening the likelihood of a thermal runaway.\n\nEnvia conducted its own nail penetration testing using 20Ah and 40Ah cells per USABC test protocols to validate its material. Cells made with Envia's HCMR™ cathode passed the nail penetration test while cells with other layered chemistries did not perform well."

Invent a better battery. The tech world is crying out for more efficient ways to store electrical energy. Whether it's to make electric vehicles go further, or mobile phones charge more quickly, or to store grid energy from renewables, the market awaits. Here are five of the brightest sparks in development.\n\nLiquid metal, Donald Sadoway, MIT Made of molten layers of magnesium and antimony, these cells are more reminiscent of an industrial smelter than a battery. Even so, when separated by a layer of molten salt, the liquid metal layers behave like electrodes, storing up to 20 times more charge than traditional solid electrodes. Future applications: The shot-glasssized prototype is now being scaled it up as part of a US Department of Energy project.\n\nCarbon cells, Emile Greenhalgh, Imperial College, London Combining structural form with electrical function, carbon composite cells will bring us vehicles that store electrical energy in the roof, bonnet and other parts of the car's bodywork. In 15 years' time, this could reduce the weight of cars by up to 40 per cent. Future applications: He's currently working with Volvo -- the current target is to reduce a car's weight by 15 per cent within three years.\n\nUltrafast nanoballs, Gerbrand Ceder, MIT These lithium-ion batteries would make it possible to charge a mobile phone in just 30 seconds. Coating nanoballs in an additional thin layer of lithium phosphate speeds up the rate at which ions flow to and from electrodes. This reduces the charging time for a battery by a factor of 100. Future applications: Despite the lifestylechanging capabilities of this kind of battery, significant investment would be needed to build charging devices.\n\nAir breathing, Peter Bruce, St Andrews University Normally the storage capacity of Li-ion batteries is limited by a bulky oxide material used to bind the lithium ions to the positive electrode. With Bruce's batteries air floods into the electrolyte solution, where it reacts with the lithium ions to bind directly to the electrodes. Future applications: Bruce says it should be possible to make batteries with ten times the traditional Li-ion power for mobile gadgets.\n\nRobotic batteries, Better Place, Palo Alto, California Not a new battery technology, but it could make electric vehicles more appealing. Instead of waiting for your car to recharge, an automated robotic platform replaces a depleted battery with a charged one. A station will launch in Denmark this year. Future applications: Already on its way. Renault will be releasing electric cars equipped with switchable batteries in 2011."

Real-time measurements show silicon nanoparticles inside carbon shells before (left) and after (right) lithiation.\n\n(Phys.org) -- Lithium ion batteries drive devices from electric cars to smartphones. And society is demanding more batteries with more capacity from each battery.\n\nTo help meet this demand, EMSL users and researchers put their energy behind a clever new idea that, literally, gives batteries a bit of room to grow. Lithium ion batteries generate electricity by shuttling lithium ions through an electrolyte. In a fully charged battery, lithium ions are stored in a cathode, such as lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2).\n\nWhen in use, lithium ions flow from the cathode through an electrolyte into the anode, most commonly made of carbon. During recharging, the ions are pushed back to the cathode where they started. Researchers built upon current technology by making a new type of anode that consists of single silicon nanoparticles inside carbon shells, much like yolks inside eggs.\n\nIn this new design, lithium ions flow from the cathode through the electrolyte, diffuse through the carbon shells, and enter the silicon—which can hold ten times as many lithium ions as carbon alone.\n\nBy leaving just the right amount of space, the lithiated silicon nanoparticles swell to fill, but not burst, the carbon shell.\n\nThe result?\n\nA lithium ion battery system that compared to commercial batteries holds seven times more energy and can be discharged and recharged five times as many times before it wears out.

Moreover, the team's manufacturing process is affordable, efficient, and can be readily scaled up. Researchers at MIT have designed a new battery that can recharge devices about 100 times faster than conventional lithium ion batteries. The design could lead to electric car batteries thatGerman researchers have developed a new concept for rechargeable batteries.

Image credit: pdphoto.org\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Natural leaves constantly lose water through evaporation, as the water in their veins is pumped up to the top of the tree. This process, called transpiration, could also create a mechanical water pump effect in synthetic leaves, and be used to generate power.\n\nResearchers from the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Michigan, and MIT have constructed leaves out of glass wafers with tiny veins through which water can flow. The veins open at the tips of the glass \"leaves,\" where evaporation draws water out of the veins at a rate of about 1.5 cm/sec.\n\nThen, the researchers wired the leaves by adding metal plates to the walls of the central stems and connecting them to a circuit. By charging the metal plates, the researchers created a capacitor made from the two conducting plates separated by an insulating layer.\n\nNext the researchers added air bubbles into the leaf veins to periodically interrupt the flow of water. Every time a bubble passed between the metal plates, it changed the capacitance and generated a small current. The current then passed to an external circuit where it increased the voltage on a storage capacitor.\n\nEach bubble could create about 2-5 microvolts, or 2 microwatts per cubic centimeter. The researchers predict that they could easily improve this amount to a few hundred microwatts per cubic centimeter. This power density is still much less than that of batteries or fuel systems, and the power output is still modest compared to solar technology. Still, the researchers hope that, as an energy scavenging system, the synthetic leaves might serve as a complementary solar technology, with sunlight driving the transpiration process.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nScientists looked to ferns to create a novel energy scavenging device that uses the power of evaporation to move itself -- materials that could provide a method for powering micro and nano devices with just ...A new grocery store in the UK opening today will generate energy every time a customer drives into the parking lot.

The advantage of a multi-layer generator is that it produces a higher power than a single-layer generator having the same total thickness.

Moreover, the optimum resistive load of a multi-layer generator is much lower than that of a single-layer generator, which makes it easier to couple to the electrical domain. In this work, it was found, experimentally, that a double-layer generator produces 41.5% and 19.4% more power than a singlelayer generator with the same total thickness of PZT and resonant frequency.

To reduce the amount of silicon needed, Twin Creeks Technologies has adapted proton accelerator technology. Protons are fired at ultrathin silicon sheets, tracing a pattern into the silicon. When the material is heated, the silicon where the protons are embedded detaches, which creates the channels needed for semiconductors or solar cells. The result is a very thin, flexible silicon wafer that uses 90% less silicon than those created by traditional processes. According to CEO Siva Sivaram, the company is just about ready to make its product available to solar panel manufacturers."

The main difference between these energy conversion devices is that the fuel cell acccomplishes this directly, without the two additional intermediate steps, heat release and mechanical motion.\n\nA fuel cell has two basic elements: a fuel delivery system and an electro-chemical cell that converts the delivered fuel into useful electricity. It is this unique combination that enables fuel cells to potentially offer the best features of both heat engines and batteries. Like batteries, the cell generates a dc electric output and is quiet, clean, and shape-flexible, and may be manufactured using similar plate and film-rolling processes. By contrast, the fuel delivery system ensures that fuel cells, like heat engines, can be\nquickly refueled and operate for long periods between stoppages."

      "text": "Artificial photosynthesis\n\nPhotosynthesis is the conversion of sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into usable fuel and it is typically discussed in relation to plants where the fuel is carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Using only 3 percent of the sunlight that reaches the planet, plants collectively perform massive energy conversions, converting just over 1,100 billion tons of CO2 into food sources for animals every year.\n\nThis harnessing of the sun represents a virtually untapped potential for generating energy for human use at a time when efforts to commercialize photovoltaic–cell technology are underway. Using a semiconductor–based system, photovoltaic technology converts sunlight to electricity, but in an expensive and somewhat inefficient manner with notable shortcomings related to energy storage and the dynamics of weather and available sunlight. However, recent advances have been made with artificial photosynthesis, which, if perfected, could provide unlimited, relatively inexpensive, and clean electricity, with a storage capability.\n\nTo gain a clearer understanding of artificial photosynthesis, we need to delve deeper into the process that plants have perfected and then relate these concepts to commercial energy applications. Two things occur as plants convert sunlight into energy:\n\nSunlight is harvested using chlorophyll and a collection of proteins and enzymes, and\nWater molecules are split into hydrogen, electrons, and oxygen.\nThese electrons and oxygen then turn the CO2 into carbohydrates, after which oxygen is expelled.\n\nRather than release only oxygen at the end of this reaction, an artificial process designed to produce energy for human use will need to release liquid hydrogen or methanol, which will in turn be used as liquid fuel or channeled into a fuel cell. The processes of producing hydrogen and capturing sunlight are not a problem. The challenge lies in developing a catalyst to split the water molecules and get the electrons that start the chemical process to produce the hydrogen.\n\nThere are a number of promising catalysts available, that, once perfected, could have a profound impact on how we address the energy supply challenge:\n\nThere is general agreement that fossil fuels will eventually disappear from the range of energy sources. While they are providing for the majority of our energy needs today, they significantly impact pollution and climate change. Most of the more traditional sources of renewable energy pose other challenges as well.\n\nWind turbines have a negative impact on picturesque landscapes.\n\nCorn requires an extremely large amount of land to produce energy in an adequate supply, and\n\nTraditional solar technology is quite expensive, still inefficient, and limited in that it depends upon the presence of sunlight.\n\nArtificial Photosynthesis could be a solution:\n\nIt produces stored fuel\n\nIt can produce more than one type of fuel: liquid hydrogen to be used like gasoline in hydrogen-powered engines, incorporated into a fuel-cell-setup and create electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen into water, or methanol as either a gasoline additive or primary fuel source.\n\nIt does not require mining, growing, or drilling. Since artificial photosynthesis involves water and carbon dioxide – neither of which is in short supply – it is virtually limitless, potentially less expensive, and not only does it not emit greenhouse gases but it removes large amounts of CO2 from the environment in the process of producing fuel. However, there are a number of obstacles that thus far preclude this process from being used on a large scale.\n\nTheoretical solutions applied in a lab environment have met with some success. However, artificial photosynthesis is not yet ready for full implementation, primarily because replicating what took plants billions of years to perfect takes a lot of trial and error. Some of the specific challenges include:\n\nThe catalyst for plants, manganese, is unstable, has a relatively short lifespan, and will not dissolve in water, leading to an inefficient and impractical approach.\n\nLike the human body, the molecular makeup of plants is both complex and exact, making it difficult to replicate the overall process at the required level of intricacy.\n\nStability remains an overriding issue as organic catalysts will degree or cause other reactions that can actually cause cell damage. Inorganic catalysts offer a potential solution, but the speed at which they have to work to make efficient use of the chemical reactions can be an issue.\n\nIn the case of state-of-the-art dye sensitized cells, the issue is not with the catalyst (Titanium Dioxide) but rather with the electrolyte solution that is made of solvents that can erode other parts of the system.\n\nProgress has been made in the last few years with the further development of Cobalt Oxide as a stable, fast and abundant catalyst and even with the dye-sensitized cells, solutions have been developed that are less corrosive. Current estimates are that we are 10 years away from full scale implementation, if at all. The development of a comprehensive energy policy will require many dimensions and that the path to success is going to require pursuing a number of possibilities, expecting only a percentage of them to pass the test of time. Artificial photosynthesis should be one of the candidates.\n\nTo recreate the photosynthesis that plants have perfected, an energy conversion system has to be able to do two crucial things (probably inside of some type of nanotube that acts as the structural \"leaf\"): harvest sunlight and split water molecules.\n\nPlants accomplish these tasks using chlorophyll, which captures sunlight, and a collection of proteins and enzymes that use that sunlight to break down H2O molecules into hydrogen, electrons and oxygen (protons). The electrons and hydrogen are then used to turn CO2 into carbohydrates, and the oxygen is expelled.\n\nFor an artificial system to work for human needs, the output has to change. Instead of releasing only oxygen at the end of the reaction, it would have to release liquid hydrogen (or perhaps methanol) as well. That hydrogen could be used directly as liquid fuel or channeled into a fuel cell. Getting the process to produce hydrogen is not a problem, since it's already there in the water molecules. And capturing sunlight is not a problem -- current solar-power systems do that.\n\nThe hard part is splitting the water molecules to get the electrons necessary to facilitate the chemical process that produces the hydrogen. Splitting water requires an energy input of about 2.5 volts [source: Hunter]. This means the process requires a catalyst -- something to get the whole thing moving. The catalyst reacts with the sun's photons to initiate a chemical reaction.\n\nThere have been important advances in this area in the last five or 10 years. A few of the more successful catalysts include:\n\nManganese: Manganese is the catalyst found in the photosynthetic core of plants. A single atom of manganese triggers the natural process that uses sunlight to split water. Using manganese in an artificial system is a biomimetric approach -- it directly mimics the biology found in plants.\n\nDye-sensitized titanium dioxide: Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a stable metal that can act as an efficient catalyst. It's used in a dye-sensitized solar cell, also known as a Graetzel cell, which has been around since the 1990s. In a Graetzel cell, the TiO2 is suspended in a layer of dye particles that capture the sunlight and then expose it to the TiO2 to start the reaction.\n\nCobalt oxide: One of the more recently discovered catalysts, clusters of nano-sized cobalt-oxide molecules (CoO) have been found to be stable and highly efficient triggers in an artificial photosynthesis system. Cobalt oxide is also a very abundant molecule -- it's currently a popular industrial catalyst."

      "text": "Salt Water System Could Generate Hydrogen\n\nMar 18, 2009 by Lisa Zyga\n\nIn this illustration of the system, salt water flows through a rectangular pipe under the influence of a perpendicular magnetic field, B0. The Lorentz force causes the charged sodium and chlorine ions to accumulate near the metal plates on the sides of the pipe, generating a constant electric field, E. Image credit: R. De Luca.\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- The idea of generating hydrogen from salt water has often been claimed to work effectively. However, the systems proposed so far generally require a much greater energy input than the energy they produce, making them impractical for energy generation. Now, a recently revived system may be able to cheaply generate a small amount of power.\n\nIn the proposal, physicist Roberto De Luca from the University of Salerno in Italy has suggested that flowing salt water could generate an electromotive force, which in turn could generate an electric power output. In his theoretical analysis, he considers letting salt water (containing sodium and chlorine ions) run through a rectangular pipe that has two metal electrodes on the sides, under the influence of a perpendicular magnetic field. In this set-up, the Lorentz force acts on the sodium and chlorine ions in the salt water, creating a Faraday voltage across the two electrodes, and producing an electromotive force.\n\n\"I started considering the question Dr. Pasquale Desideri, a Roman chemist, asked,\" De Luca told PhysOrg.com. \"If a transverse magnetic field is applied to salt water flowing in a thin rectangular pipe, would an electromotive force appear at the sides of the pipe itself? This question was interesting both from a didactical and a scientific point of view. Didactically, one could come up with an interdisciplinary lecture, making a comparison between the electrical transport properties of the 'Fermi sea' (the collection of free electrons in a metal) and the 'ordinary sea' (which a physicist could conceive as a collection of rather free Na+ and Cl- ionic charges diluted in water, besides a place to go in summertime).\"\n\nDe Luca discovered that an experiment conducted in 1972 (by Wright and Van Der Beken) had demonstrated that Desideri's hypothesis was true: salt water flowing in a pipe under a transverse magnetic field does show an effect, similar to the Hall effect, in conducting metals. De Luca thought that this simple fact deserved more attention.\n\nAs he showed in his analysis, in order to produce a steady current in this device, the positive and negative electrodes experience different reactions. At one electrode, water is reduced to its components, resulting in oxygen and hydrogen gas. At the other electrode, chlorine ions are oxidized, producing chlorine gas.\n\nDe Luca investigated the minimum concentration of sodium chloride in the water required to maintain a steady current. He calculated that only a small concentration of the ions is needed to establish a potential difference between the electrodes, and normal salt water has a significantly higher concentration than required. (The average salinity of seawater is about 3.5%, and about 78% of these salts is sodium chloride.)\n\nThe technique also requires that the salt water flow through rectangular pipes with a very small height (so that they are nearly one-dimensional). Although the technique wouldn't work in most natural locations, De Luca suggests that some desalination plants - where salt water is forced to run through small ducts - may provide an adequate infrastructure for the system. If so, desalination plants might also function as alternative electric power sources.\n\n\"When I was sure that an electromotive force and hydrogen gas could be obtained from letting salt water circulate in the presence of a transverse magnetic field, I thought about the huge desalination plants, where intake of salt water from the sea is needed. In general, these plants are run by oil, even though they are mostly located in places where solar power is present in abundance. Getting some power out of these plants simply by applying a transverse magnetic field to pipes could mean saving some power. Besides, getting hydrogen gas from sea water could gives us hope that in the future we would not easily run out of fuel.'\"\n\nThere are still some challenges that this scheme faces, but De Luca has showed the potential using this method to produce hydrogen gas in a natural and inexpensive way. Apart from applications, the concept could be used in introductory physics classes to teach students about the transport properties of ionic aqueous solutions and conducting materials.\n\n\"I am now sure that most people will come up saying that these applications are rather difficult to implement and, even though some uses of this simple theoretical analysis can be envisioned, the amount of power one can derive from these systems is rather small,\" he said. \"Scientifically, however, one is mainly concerned with the clear statement of some well-defined facts. In particular, I can say that it can be nowadays stated that hydrogen gas can be cheaply produced by solar energy, as already noticed in a previous paper, and can also be produced by simple electrodynamic effects. How cheaply in the latter case? Consider that seas do not ever stand still and that, luckily enough, there exist so called permanent magnets.\"\n\nMore information: De Luca, R. \"Lorentz force on sodium and chlorine ions in a salt water solution flow under a transverse magnetic field.\" European Journal of Physics, 30 (2009) 459-466.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- In the early 1800s, during the peak of the Industrial Revolution, modern science revolved around steam engines and other coal-powered applications.

There an experimental, \"no moving parts\" drive for submarines (In salt water) based on the same design, but the Inverse of what's being described here. \"Magnetohydrodynamics\" The losses in this system would be mechanical \"pumping\" or fluid friction losses. If the water (Pumping)pressure was \"free\" you wouldn't care.\n\nOr if the costs could be offset by profits from another product. In this case, the desalination plant HAS to pump the water, and if permanent magnets work, this could be a useful byproduct. It wouldn't be \"free\", but it also wouldn't have to bear the full cost of the pumps.\n\nSince the gases are lighter than the water, they will collect at the top of the pipe, so vertical pressure-release pipes should work. By making the water pipe a flattened U shape, you should get mostly chlorine in one set of gas pipes, and mostly hydrox in another. Then you'd probably want to separate the oxygen and hydrogen, unless you're going to burn it all up right away.\n\nPretty neat. I suppose natural movement of seawater (from tidal or wave action) would supply free energy for this system, but in the case of the desalination plant, I would think that the energy you get out of the system would be at the cost of more drag on the water. They would expend more energy in pumping, and get back SOME of it in the form of electricity and usefull by-products.\n\nFazer, exactly my thought, still pretty interesting phenomena, would find niche spots in low current flows where turbine efficiency dont shine, or maybe with advances in nanocapillar materials they can getmore out of it\n\n\"The idea of generating hydrogen from salt water has often been claimed to work effectively. However, the systems proposed so far generally require a much greater energy input than the energy they produce, making them impractical for energy generation. \"\n\nIf the US would build 100 1GW reactors it wouldn't matter how energy intensive electrolysis is.\n\nTrue, you won't get \"something for nothing\", and the energy you get from the hydrogen will be less than the energy required to produce it. But that's the case with any energy-conversion system. If you need portable energy, losing a little electricity or whatever, to produce hydrogen would be worth it. It's easier to transport the hydrogen than the moving water, and it doesn't require wires like electricity.\n\nIf the US would build 100 1GW reactors it wouldn't matter how energy intensive electrolysis is.\n\nGood point, shootist. Maybe instead of spending over 1 trillion in \"stimulus\" we could invest in a real hydrogen economy and accelerate the science. Too bad killing 5 birds with one stone is an idea our politicians cannot grasp.\n\nThis is an interesting effect, but the whole idea of power generation using the thing is flawed. The only way you could actually produce usable energy with this is if you had a spot where salt water was already flowing downhill (due to tides, presumably) and you slowed it down. In a desalination plant, the water is being pumped already, so if you tried to introduce this as a supplement to the plant's power, you'd have to pump the water harder (it will slow down because of this system.) The extra energy input would be greater than the energy output and you'd lose.\n\nNow if the goal was to produce hydrogen and nothing more, then this could be a more efficient way than direct electrolysis (could being the operative word) but they don't give any information about how efficient the process it, so it's hard to tell. How much of the water is converted? Are we talking a cubic meter of hydrogen per meter of tubing per second? Per minute? Per year? Would we have to pump tons of water through it to get a cubic meter of hydrogen? I guess I'd like to know more before I get all hot and bothered about it.\n\nThe pacific region is a verry good place for geothermic energy:\nvolcanism; water from the ocean; old gold mines to get-in the salt, after the destilation, to give more water in thise region!\nBut the trusts in Washington DC dont interessed, there will commercial working with the old technologies!\n\nMaybe, after the climate warming - when the athmosphare is red in the sun all houers of the day, then the politics give a chance to change the way.\nBut than we make a trip of a death planet, to make a new planet, on our old earth.\nWe can wait to 2065 and then we (the commercial interessed groups and patend holder) change the system.\nBut if we work the next ~50years - take it easy - we will have a permanently catastrophe for our followers for more than the rest of the time (before the amargeddon).\n\nThe problems begins in 1750.

They can be manufactured easily and cheaply, they have low environmental impact, and since they are compatible with flexible substrates, they could be used in many applications such as packaging, clothing, flexible screens, or for recharging cell phones and laptops.\n\nTeams at the Université d'Angers and at the Université Strasbourg have recently obtained record conversion efficiency with solar cells based on organic molecules. Their work has been published online on the web site of the Journal of Materials Chemistry.\n\nPhotovoltaic solar energy works by transforming a fraction of solar radiation into electricity by means of solar cells, which are connected together to form a photovoltaic solar cell module. The solar cells currently on the market are made up of inorganic materials such as silicon.\n\nA great deal of international research is aimed at developing solar cells made up of organic (carbon-compound based) semiconductors. Although their performance is still considerably lower than that of cells based on crystalline silicon (around 5% efficiency as compared with 15% for silicon cells), they present numerous advantages. Unlike crystalline silicon, which has to be produced at very high temperatures, they can be manufactured cheaply with low energy cost and environmental impact, arguments which are by no means insignificant when it comes to renewable energy.\n\nMoreover, the fact that they are made using solution processes (for instance from inks or paints) makes it possible to cover large areas and flexible substrates such as films and fabrics.\n\nOrganic solar cells are not intended to compete with silicon, but rather to be used for specific applications, such as packaging, clothing, flexible screens, and recharging cell phones and laptops. However, in the longer term, they could make a significant contribution to the photovoltaic conversion of solar energy, as long as there is major investment in research into new, more efficient and stable materials.\n\nOver the past ten years or so, most research has focused on developing organic cells in which the active light-absorbing material is made up of long conjugated polymer chains. Although these cells are the most efficient yet discovered, the use of polymers poses a certain number of problems: synthesis, purification, control of the molecular structure and mass, and the distribution of different lengths of chain (polydispersity).\n\nIn order to overcome these obstacles, Jean Roncali's team of researchers at the Université d'Angers has developed a novel approach based on replacing polymers by conjugated molecules with a clearly defined structure. Whereas the conversion efficiencies of the initial prototypes published in 2005 were of the order of 0.20%, a collaboration between the Angers team and Raymond Ziessel's team at the Université Strasbourg, supported by CNRS's Energy program, has recently succeeded in reaching conversion efficiencies of 1.70%, which are among the highest known for this type of cell until now.\n\nNew classes of active material specifically adapted to such cells are currently being synthesized in these laboratories. In this way, the researchers are hoping to improve their results very rapidly. Industry will no doubt be keeping close watch on their progress.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nIn a paper published in the journal Nature Materials, EPFL professor Michael Graetzel, Shaik Zakeeruddin and colleagues from the Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have achieved a reco ...\n\nCurrently, solar cells are difficult to handle, expensive to purchase and complicated to install.

Northwestern University researchers have developed a new solar cell that, in principle, will minimize all of these solar energy technology limitations.\n\nIn particular, the device is the first to solve the problem of the Grätzel cell, a promising low-cost and environmentally friendly solar cell with a significant disadvantage: it leaks. The dye-sensitized cell's electrolyte is made of an organic liquid, which can leak and corrode the solar cell itself.\n\nGrätzel cells use a molecular dye to absorb sunlight and convert it to electricity, much like chlorophyll in plants. But the cells typically don't last more than 18 months, making them commercially unviable. Researchers have been searching for an alternative for two decades.\n\nAt Northwestern, where interdisciplinary collaboration is a cornerstone, nanotechnology expert Robert P. H. Chang challenged chemist Mercouri Kanatzidis with the problem of the Grätzel cell. Kanatzidis' solution was a\n\nPostdoctoral fellow In Chung in the Kanatzidis group worked closely with graduate student Byunghong Lee in the Chang group to develop the new cells, achieving performance gains that amounted to approximately 1 percent per month.\n\nIn the Northwestern cell, a thin-film compound made up of cesium, tin and iodine, called CsSnI3, replaces the entire liquid electrolyte of the Grätzel cell. Details of the new solar cell -- an efficient, more stable and longer lasting cell -- will be published May 24 by the journal Nature.\n\nKanatzidis, the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, and Chang, a professor of materials science and engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science, are the two senior authors of the paper.\n\n\"This is the first demonstration of an all solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell system that promises to exceed the performance of the Grätzel cell,\" Chang said. \"Our work opens up the possibility of these materials becoming state of the art with much higher efficiencies than we've seen so far.\"\n\nThe Northwestern cell exhibits the highest conversion efficiency (approximately 10.2 percent) so far reported for a solid-state solar cell equipped with a dye sensitizer. This value is close to the highest reported performance for a Grätzel cell, approximately 11 to 12 percent. (Conventional solar cells made from highly purified silicon can convert roughly 20 percent of incoming sunlight.)\n\nUnlike the Grätzel cell, the new solar cell uses both n-type and p-type semiconductors and a monolayer dye molecule serving as the junction between the two. Each nearly spherical nanoparticle, made of titanium dioxide, is an n-type semiconductor. Kanatzidis' CsSnI3 thin-film material is a new kind of soluble p-type semiconductor.\n\n\"Our inexpensive solar cell uses nanotechnology to the hilt,\" Chang said. \"We have millions and millions of nanoparticles, which gives us a huge effective surface area, and we coat all the particles with light-absorbing dye.\"\n\nA single solar cell measures half a centimeter by half a centimeter and about 10 microns thick. The dye-coated nanoparticles are packed in, and Kanatzidis' new material, which starts as a liquid, is poured in, flowing around the nanoparticles. Much like paint, the solvent evaporates, and a solid mass results. The sunlight-absorbing dye, where photons are converted into electricity, lies right between the two semiconductors.\n\nChang chose to use nanoparticles approximately 20 nanometers in diameter. This size optimizes the device, he said, increasing the surface area and allowing enough space between the particles for Kanatzidis' material to flow through and set.\n\nTechnically, this new cell is not really a Grätzel cell since the hole-conducting material CsSnI3 is itself light absorbing. In fact, the material absorbs more light over a wider range of the visible spectrum than the typical dye used in Grätzel cells. In the Kanatzidis-Chang cell, the CsSnI3 plays an additional role in the operation of the cell that is not played by the liquid electrolyte couple, and that role is light absorption.\n\n\"This is only the beginning,\" Chang said. \"Our concept is applicable to many types of solar cells. There is a lot of room to grow.\"\n\nThe lightweight thin-film structures are compatible with automated manufacturing, the researchers point out.

The research is led by Sossina Haile, a professor of\nmaterials science and chemical engineering.\n\nIt works by taking advantage of the properties of a material\nknown as cerea -- a\nmetal oxide commonly used in the walls of self-cleaning ovens. It\nhas the remarkable ability to \"exhale\"\noxygen atoms at very high temperatures, but \"inhale\" them at\nlow temperatures.\n\n\"What is special about the material is that it doesn't\nrelease all of the oxygen. That helps to leave the framework of the\nmaterial intact as oxygen leaves,\" Haile explains. \"When we cool it\nback down, the material's thermodynamically preferred state is to\npull oxygen back into the structure.\"\n\nThe oxygen is pulled out of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water\n(H2O) gas molecules that get pumped into the reactor, leaving\nbehind carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) molecules. The\nhydrogen can then be extracted to power hydrogen fuel cells, and\nthe carbon monoxide, when combined with hydrogen, can be used to\ncreate syngas,\nwhich is an ingredient in the production of liquid hydrocarbon\nfuels.\n\nBut for it to work, the core of the reactor has to reach around\n1649 celsius -- more than twice the temperature of the surface of\nMercury.\nThat's delivered by a quartz window which focuses the suns rays,\njust like a magnifying glass. So far it hasn't been tested in the\nwild, but in Paul Scherrer Institute's High-Flux Solar\nSimulator in Switzerland, the team managed to attain the best\nrates for dissociation of CO2 ever achieved.\n\nHaile said they were able to attain the impressive results\n\"because we're using the whole solar spectrum, and not\njust particular wavelengths\". However, in its current design, it's\nrelatively ineffiecient due to losses from heat radiation, using\nonly 1 percent of the solar radiation it recieves. The team reckons\nthat with a bit of work, the efficiency of the design could rise to\nas much as 15 percent.\n\nEventually, it's hoped that CO2 emitted from vehicles and\npower plants could be captured, and then turned into fuel. \"You'd\neffectively be using the carbon twice\", said Haile. It could also\nbe used in a fuel cycle where H2O and CO2 are converted to methane,\nwhich is then used to fuel electricity-producing power plants that\ngenerate more CO2 and H2O. We're still a long way from approaching\nthe efficiencies needed for such an approach to be viable,\nhowever."

      "text": "Restoration of Conductivity: Beating E-Waste\n\nElectronic waste, or \"E-waste,\" has emerged as major pollution problem in the 21st century. This waste, from old TV to computers, leeches toxic chemicals and compounds into the land, water supplies, and when disposed of improperly, into the air.\n\nThere seem to be two main drivers behind the build up e-waste: first, many consumer electronics are intended to be replaced quickly; and secondly, we find the relatively difficult task of repairing old electronics, often breaking due to circuits that crack from damage or heat. Influencing business is one thing, but researchers from the University of Illinois have an answer for the problem of cracked circuits: restorative electronics.\n\nSelf-Healing Electronics\n\nTo the team at the University of Illinois, this discovery means reducing waste, building more reliable, dependable electronics, and improving the safety for military and private endeavors. So, these self-healing electronics can meet our normal demands while reserving the ability to fix themselves, but how? The solution rests with reactionary, self-healing polymer materials.\n\nAs the thermomechanical failure of conductive pathways begin to show themselves, micro capsules – as small as 10 microns in diameter, placed on top of the functioning circuit – break open and release their metallic fluid, which restore the flow of electricity in the circuit. (See photo above, click to enlarge).\n\nTo chemistry professor Jeffrey Moore, a co-author of the paper Autonomic Restoration of Electrical Conductivity, \"It simplifies the system. Rather than having to build in redundancies or to build in a sensory diagnostics system, this material is designed to take care of the problem itself.\"\n\nIn addition to improving the existing system, placement of the capsules allows manufactures to focus on localized protection areas, with only specific capsules breaking open to restore specific break points. According to the paper, \"This autonomic healing system shows the potential for more sustainable electronic devices with increased fault-tolerance, improved circuit reliability, and extended service life.\"\n\nWill this Reduce E-Waste?\n\nOn their face, restorative electronic systems seem to be a helpful solution for problems of e-waste. However, it's critical to recognize that this will not end e-waste. For electronic waste to be seriously addressed, consumers need to understand the lifespan and destination of their waste. What's more, consumers must understand their role in e-waste. Rather that ditching that monitor in the trash, consumers should be supplied with information from manufactures on where and how to dispose of electronics.\n\nThis brings us to the next problem: the main driver of e-waste is the acknowledged fact that most electronics are built and phased out quickly. The onward march of technological advancement, which shows no signs of letting up, is at the heart of e-waste. Manufactures must begin to build in biologically inspired system (like restorative electronics), and they must also pursue reclaiming of e-waste more vigorously. How we get at this may be on hold until a new market leader is established. Then, we can vote with our dollars.\n\nselection with.

      "text": "Closed loop thermochemical energy storage system using ammonia\n\nIf solar energy is to become a major contributor to our energy supply, means to store it have to be found. One promising method is \"closed loop thermochemical energy storage using ammonia\".\n\nIn this system, ammonia (NH3) is dissociated in an energy storing (endothermic) chemical reactor as it absorbs solar thermal energy. At a later time and place, the reaction products hydrogen (H2) and nitrogen (N2) react in an energy releasing (exothermic) reactor to resynthesise ammonia.\n\n2 NH3< + head N2 + 3 H2\n\nA fixed amount of reactants (ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen) are contained in a closed loop, and pass alternately between energy storing and energy releasing reactors with provision for storage of reactants in between. Because the solar energy is stored in a chemical form at ambient temperature, there are zero energy losses in the store regardless of the length of time that the reactants remain in storage. The reactors are packed with standard commercial catalyst materials to promote both reactions. Counter-flow heat exchangers transfer heat between in-going and out-going reactants at each reactor to use the energy most effectively.\n\nFeeding the reactors with pure reactants is possible through the natural separation of reactants and products in the storage system: at the pressures applied, ammonia condenses.\n\nBy ensuring that the stuff leaving each reactor transfers its own thermal energy (sensible heat) to the stuff going in – using heat exchangers – most of the solar energy is stored in the change in composition of the chemicals which are kept at ambient temperature.\n\nAdvantages\n\nApart from the ability of the ammonia system to allow for continuous energy supply on a 24-hour basis, other advantages, that are not necessarily shared by other solar thermochemical or photochemical systems, make this process unique:\n\nA high energy storage density, by volume and mass.\nThe reactions are easy to control and to reverse and there are no unwanted side reactions.\n\nAll constituents involved are environmentally benign.\nThere exists a history of industrial application with the associated available expertise and hardware.\n\nA readily achievable turning temperature of 400 °C to 500 °C (depending on the pressure). This helps to reduce thermal losses from dish receivers, avoids some high temperature materials limitations, and allows lower quality (and hence cheaper) dish optics to be used.\n\nAll reactants for transport and handling are in the fluid phase, which provides a convenient means of energy transport without thermal loss. This is an important point, particularly if large arrays of paraboloidal dishes are being considered as the method for solar energy collection.\n\nAt ambient temperature the ammonia component of reactant mixtures condenses to form a liquid, whilst the nitrogen and hydrogen remains as a gas. This means that only one storage vessel is required for reactants and products.\n\nProduction of ammonia is one of the world's largest chemical process industries, with in excess of 100 million tonnes produced annually and about 90,500 tonnes produced in Australia in 2004, the bulk of which is used for fertilizers (~90%). The industry has a 100 year history of operation."

The rumen is essentially a fermentation vat crawling with microorganisms where much of the food that a cow eats is temporarily held and is continuously churned until it can be completely digested.

The cow used in the study ate a normal diet.\n\nThe researchers filled each of two sterilized glass chambers with strained rumen fluid to create the microbial fuel cell. Each chamber was about a foot high and about 6 inches in diameter.\n\nThe chambers were separated by a special material that allowed protons to move from the negative (anode) chamber into the positive (cathode) chamber. This movement of protons, along with the movement of electrons across the resistor and wire that connects the two electrodes, creates electrical current.\n\nThe anode chamber was filled with rumen fluid and cellulose, which served as a food source for the microorganisms. Cellulose is plentiful on most farms, as harvesting usually leaves behind plenty of it in the form of crop residue in the fields.\n\nThe other chamber, the cathode, was filled with potassium ferricyanide, a chemical that acts as an oxidizing agent to round out the electrical circuit.\n\nTwo small pieces of plain graphite served as the fuel cell's electrodes (an electrode draws and emits electrical charge.) A piece of graphite was placed in each chamber. The researchers used a meter to measure the output of the fuel cell.\n\nThat output reached a consistent maximum of 0.58 volts. After about four days, the voltage fell to around 0.2 volts, at which time the researchers added fresh cellulose to bring the voltage back up to a higher level.\n\n\"While that's a very small amount of voltage, the results show that it is possible to create electricity from cow waste,\" Chris"

Credit: phault via flickr\n\nSimulating a century's worth of amped-up wind-energy production suggests that harvesting maximum power from these winds would have dramatic long-term effects on the climate, triggering major shifts in atmospheric circulation.\n\n\"However, it's important to understand that these amounts are far, far bigger than current or projected global energy demand,\" Marvel said.\n\nIn contrast, extracting enough wind energy to satisfy current global power demands would only have minimal climate effects, as long as wind turbines were spread out. Doing so might affect surface temperatures by about 0.1 degree Celsius and affect average precipitation by about 1 percent.\n\nIndependent from Marvel's research, atmospheric scientist Mark Jacobson at Stanford University in Calif. and wind power researcher Cristina Archer at the University of Delaware, in Newark, used a 3-D computer model that analyzed interactions between the atmosphere, land and oceans on a global scale, including factors such as chemistry and water-vapor content. They estimated the amount of energy turbines with hubs located a conventional height of 330 feet off the ground could extract, based on manufacturer data on how turbines convert wind to power. They also simulated turbines 6 miles above the ground, the typical altitude of the jet stream.\n\nThey found the amount of wind power available at the height of most modern wind turbines before the point of diminishing returns is about 80 terawatts on all continents minus Antarctica and near their shores, and more than 250 terawatts if wind turbines could be placed across the entire surface of the planet, including the oceans. At heights of the jet stream, about 380 terawatts appears available.\n\nThe numbers of both teams are not exactly comparable, in part because Jacobson and Archer looked at extracting energy at specific heights in the atmosphere, whereas Marvel and her colleagues looked more at the atmosphere as a whole.\n\n\"The two teams obtained similar conclusions using two different approaches, which gives us even more confidence about our results,\" Archer said.\n\nMore realistically, Jacobson and Archer found that 4 million 5-megawatt turbines operating on the planet's surface could supply as much as 7.5 terawatts of power without significant negative impacts on the climate. This is more than half the world's power demands in 2030, optimistically assuming that all energy is converted to clean energy by then.\n\nThe researchers suggest half these turbines be placed in the ocean, while the others would require a little more than 0.5 percent of the Earth's land surface -- about half the area of Alaska. Virtually none of this area would need to be used solely for wind, but could for instance also serve as farmland, ranchland or wildlife preserves. Spreading out these ground-based turbines in windy locations worldwide such as the American plains and the Sahara would increase efficiency by keeping them from stealing wind energy from each other, and would reduce their overall environmental impact.\n\nBoth these models assume wind turbines can be installed anywhere and everywhere, without regard to social, environmental, or financial considerations, such as how much 4 million wind turbines might cost, or how so many turbines might impact migrating birds.\n\nWhile these researchers focused on the global climate effects of very large-scale wind power, more study is needed. Archer said the findings suggest that even heavy use of wind power is likely a smart, safe and clean way to generate energy.\n\n\"There is still a lot of interesting work to be done on local and regional climatic consequences of wind,\" Marvel said.\n\nI?m a little behind on my reading, so I just noticed that in Sunday?s paper, Judith Shulevitz wrote about a subject that?s near and dear to my heart: epigenetics and fatherhood.

      "text": "Commercialization of new solar technology to boost solar efficiency\n\nNov 09, 2009\n\n\n\"A sabbatical 20 years ago brought me to Houston from France, when at the time Houston was one of few places in the world to find a steady support for solar energy research,\" said Dr. Alex Freundlich, research professor of physics and electrical and computer engineering, Center for Advanced Materials, University of Houston. \"One of the reasons I decided to stay in Houston was the opportunity to work with NASA and to continue my research in high efficiency solar energy materials and devices. Since the early days of the space program solar cells have been the workhorse of space exploration and the need of satellites with more onboard power has fueled high risk research in solar cells. In the past few decades, most major advances in the area of high efficiency solar cells came from space development and exploration.\"\n\nFreundlich met Keith Barnham, co-founder of QuantaSol, a former faculty at Imperial College London, early in his career while working as a staff scientist on solar cells at the French National Scientific Research Laboratory (CNRS).\n\n\"Keith convinced me that low dimensional structures held a promise for great improvements in solar cells. As a physicist these quantum structures opened access to refreshing and sophisticated device physics. I believe that over the years the type of science that Keith and I have dedicated our career to has not only produced remarkable device results but created an excellent opportunity for the intellectual development of students and faculty involved in these project,\" said Freundlich.\n\nSoon after joining the University of Houston, Freundlich and his colleagues were using nanotechnology before it became hip. It allowed for flexibility with making devices that were both efficient and radiation tolerant.\n\n\"Our early investigation of strain-engineered indium phosphide based single junction quantum well cell at the University of Houston demonstrated the possibilities to reduce by over threefold the overall solar cell absorber thickness compared to a conventional counterpart while maintaining the device superior performance. The approach also appeared to be an interesting way to improve the radiation, tolerance of solar cells for space,\" said Freundlich.\n\nFreundlich was even able to test his quantum well solar cell on a space shuttle piggy-backing off the University of Houston Wake Shield Facility Project in 1995, funded by NASA.\n\n\"In collaboration with our colleagues from the Naval Research Laboratories, we demonstrated that the solar cells were superior to their conventional counterparts by a factor of two in terms of space radiation tolerance,\" said Freundlich. \"Usually, you start working two to three years before patents, so with a project that started in 1992, we filed the original patent in 1995, and were awarded the patent in 1998.\"\n\nLater Freundlich expanded the approach to multispectral solar energy conversion and showed that these nanostructures offered the possibility to significantly improve the efficiency of tandem solar cells and was awarded two additional patents for use of quantum-engineered structures for tandem solar cell applications.\n\nTwo years ago, Freundlich published a paper reporting a new generation of solar cells that could more efficiently convert sunlight in a range of wavelength where it was difficult to make efficient cells.\n\n\"Using quantum wells made with dilute nitride III-V semiconductor alloy we have been able to demonstrate key elements necessary to boost efficiencies well beyond the present technology,\" said Freundlich. \"Combined with our initial patents and QuantaSol's technology heritage, this creates the grounds for transformative collaborative research that could lead to game-changing efficiency improvements in solar cells and warrants a rapid transfer of the technology for commercial use. This time the mission is on planet earth and the goal is to develop ultra-efficient solar cells for utility scale concentrator markets.\"\n\nThere are two aspects to the recent licensing agreement and collaboration with the University of Houston and QuantaSol. QuantaSol licensed existing solar cell technology from the University of Houston and will collaborate on advance solar cell technology by adopting dilute nitrides to boost absorption and solar efficiency to create a \"super cell.\" The collaboration with University of Houston and QuantaSol will make the manufacturing process simpler and more cost effective, while further improving solar cell efficiency. The development of efficient and affordable solar cells for clean energy is a major global challenge.\n\n\"We've already tested the benefits of using Houston's dilute nitride materials in the way we engineer quantum wells in our cells,\" said Barnham. \"The exclusive worldwide license is a strategic move to ensure we maintain our performance advantage, and we will work with our colleagues in Houston to develop the techniques further in commercial production in 2010.\"\n\nThe use of dilute nitrides allows QuantaSol, an independent designer and manufacturer of strain-balanced quantum-well solar cells, to reduce the number of quantum well layers it needs to introduce into each junction, while maintaining or increasing solar efficiency. This further reduces the thickness and manufacturing cost of its production devices.\n\n\"This collaboration and commercialization of technology in solar cells from the laboratory to the marketplace in this worldwide license agreement with QuantaSol demonstrates the quality of research conducted at the University of Houston,\" said Donald Birx, vice president for research at University of Houston. \"These joint efforts will advance solar cell technology and help increase our use of renewable resources with breakthroughs at the level of device design, involving novel semi conductor approaches at the nano-material level.\"\n\n\"The sun is the most abundant source of energy available and will be available long after we are gone,\" said Freundlich. \"The sun is going to shine for another five to six billion years. I am very happy to see a breakthrough in solar energy that improves our way of life and quality of life.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nIMEC has realized a single-junction GaAs solar cell on a Ge substrate with a record conversion efficiency of 24.7%.

      "text": "this interesting article in the US Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences US researchers have managed to generate hydrogen by bacterial action without needing an external power source. If correct this is a major breakthrough in practical hydrogen fuel production, though currently cost is too great for commercial use.\nThere's a good article on the paper on the BBC website.\n\nOriginally Posted by Abstract\n\nThere is a tremendous source of entropic energy available from the salinity difference between river water and seawater, but this energy has yet to be efficiently captured and stored. Here we demonstrate that H2 can be produced in a single process by capturing the salinity driven energy along with organic matter degradation using exoelectrogenic bacteria. Only five pairs of seawater and river water cells were sandwiched between an anode, containing exoelectrogenic bacteria, and a cathode, forming a microbial reverse-electrodialysis electrolysis cell. Exoelectrogens added an electrical potential from acetate oxidation and reduced the anode overpotential, while the reverse electrodialysis stack contributed 0.5–0.6 V at a salinity ratio (seawater:river water) of 50. The H2 production rate increased from 0.8 to 1.6 m3-H2/m3-anolyte/day for seawater and river water flow rates ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 mL/ min. H2 recovery, the ratio of electrons used for H2 evolution to electrons released by substrate oxidation, ranged from 72% to 86%. Energy efficiencies, calculated from changes in salinities and the loss of organic matter, were 58% to 64%. By using a relatively small reverse electrodialysis stack (11 membranes), only ∼1% of the produced energy was needed for pumping water. Although Pt was used on the cathode in these tests, additional tests with a nonprecious metal catalyst (MoS2) demonstrated H2 production at a rate of 0.8 m3/m3/d and an energy efficiency of 51%. These results show that pure H2 gas can efficiently be produced from virtually limitless supplies of seawater and river water, and biodegradable organic matter.\n\nBy not requiring an external power source they are meaning that they don't need to apply a current across the cells to generate the hydrogen. There will still be a requirement to run pumps, cultivate, and maintain the organisms, etc.\n\nI didn't quite understand the sciencey bit. Where does the energy come from?Yes there will be extraction/containment/cultivation energy costs. The process is analogous to fermentation of sugar to alcohols, provide feedstock and the micro-organisms will produce the hydrogen; the output gas will need to be pumped and compressed. With development the process should be cheaper than current methods for hydrogen production, steam reforming requires fossil fuels and heat and electrolysis is very energy intensive.\nIt's a start, not a solutionPart of it could I suppose be easily linked to a large freshwater pump system containing degredable organic matter present in all large cities (ie, the sewer system)\nThe sewage would provide the energy for the bacteria to grow and produce H2.\nThe salt water is harder. For seaside cities this could quite conceivably be a process with a net energy gain, but I suspect that pumping seawater any real distance negates such a gain.\nOf course if treating sewage in seaside cities becomes an energy producer rather than consumer this would in the long run benefit any city hooked up to the same gridNothing here has shown what they eat.\n\nOf course they don't live on nothing Ben, the paper apparently suggests wastewater as the organic material source. The BBC link in the OP has a quote from the authors.\n\nBasically, when you dissolve something in water, energy is either used or released. So when you put two volumes of water with different concentration next to each other you get an energy gradient, and like any gradient it can be exploited to do work, at least in theory. It's essentially the same principle as two different metals producing a voltage when put together.\n\nFrom the Wiki article, it appears this principle is already being looked into as a means of producing electricity. This new research is instead looking at using it to produce hydrogen directly, without the inefficiencies that would be present from first making electricity and then using that for electrolysis. The main question is likely to be how efficient this method actually is, and whether it would actually be better than just producing electricity without the bacteria getting involved.\n\nOf course they don't live on nothing Ben, the paper apparently suggests wastewater as the organic material source. The BBC link in the OP has a quote from the authorsThere's a partial answer in the quoted abstract:\n\nQuote:\n\nBy using a relatively small reverse electrodialysis stack (11 membranes), only ∼1% of the produced energy was needed for pumping water.\n\n__________________ Simple probability tells us that we should expect coincidences, and simple psychology tells us that we'll remember the ones we notice...\n\nPretty much. It's the same basic principle as putting salt on a slug to kill it, or why salt and sugar work as preservatives - water will tend to flow through a membrane from high concentration to low concentration, even when there are other pressures trying to stop it. The slug keeps its water inside just fine, but put salt on it and the osmotic pressure is enough to suck it out. The same sucking can be harnessed to produce electricity or, in this case, to directly produce hydrogen, or in other ways such as simply acting as a water pump.\n\nOk, so it ultimately runs on fresh water. Glad to hear we have an energy supply that uses an inexhaustible, infinite sourceQuote:\n\nBenBurchCity sewages wouldn't be the only domestic source, farm wastes, household organic wastes, heck all kinds of organic material is wasted by human civilisation and would be relatively easy to recover if sufficiently valued. I'm sure they'll expand potential biological agents using all kinds of neat byproducts as nutrient sources. Genetic engineering could provide some novel solutions too.\n\nThis is not the solution to our energy issues, and won't be for decades even if it can be appropriately scaled for large loads. That said, we could be looking at a large and untapped energy source and given the situation humanity finds itself in, it would be quite wise to invest in such ideasDon't get me wrong; I'm glad to hear that there is another source of energy that we can add to the mix in the future. We should be cautious not to assume that the magic bullet for our increasing energy demands has been foundA lot of sewage plants capture methane produced by anaerobic digesters and use it to power generators. In most cases, I don't believe this produces as much energy as the sewage plant uses."

The path of least resistance: Which is the path that the water takes on each time we drain the tub. It is a spiral. This biomimicry is the art of mimicking natures efficiency, and joining it to our purpose. And for the purpose of collecting energy from the sun via heat & light as well as the four cornered wind more efficiently; scientific developers are using the natural spirals inherent in the universe: Spirals that are the shape of things from subplank-length, and beyond the spiral path of the solar system running around the sun as it glides in southward motion throughout the cosmos. The spiral is found in all things in nature, including trees. This is the rational behind the nanoleaf as the portal for piezovoltaic, nanophotovoltaic, nanothermalvoltaic energies, as well as facilitated transport cleaning the air.\n\nThe companies like Solar Botanic are making great headway by combining piezovoltaic, nanophotovoltaic,and nanothermovoltaic receptors in the leaves of artificial trees that catch, heat, light, and wind to create electricity for communities in the United States and the world.\n\nStated simply: Rather than creating solar panels that are flat, only taking in light from one direction; developers feel that trees with leaves take in more light because trees have a spiral design aimed in more directions. Tree leaves are exposed to more light on every angle. The hard math supports this concept.\n\nTrees also are more vulnerable to wind pressures due to there smallish size. The spiral shape of the tree follows the path of least resistance. The tree can take a glancing blow, rather than a direct blow. Just like a boxer rolling with a punch, just enough and not too much.\n\nThe shape of trees seems to be able to absorb more of the winds force than previous human models of wind turbines.\n\nThe motion of the trees petiole, twigs, and branches being moved about creates energy.\n\nFor the space taken up by current human design models for solar panels, and wind mills; biomimicry of trees can collect three sources of energy, much more efficiently in any of the categories in the same space than current human designs can alone.\n\nWe will get into Facilitated Transport a little further on. Briefly: It is an amazing aspect of biomimicry that is part of the nanoleaf synergistic model. Facilitated Transport does not produce electricity, it produces and puts out clean air; and removes carbon dioxide from the air.\n\nLooking at the technology behind green energy biomimicry:\n\nClear of the inherent recurring theme of spirals in every aspect of nature; one fractal course of practical logic leads us to, for the sake of explanation of the next process in how this biomimicry is put to everyday use, is the ways in which nanoleaves acting together as a whole, true to shape energy tree, captures power.\n\nThe nanoleaf works with three types of energy conversion: Thermal, wind, and solar: Then air purification.\n\nNanophotovoltaic: The only spectrumof light that is not absorbed according to the developers is the reflected green spectrum.\n\nAbsolutely every other spectrum, both visible and invisible is absorbed by the nanophotovoltaic receptors of the nanoleaf. Yes this means infrared radiation is completely converted.\n\nNanothermovoltaic: Converting this warm radiation is where the nanothermalvoltaic receptors in the nanoleaf/ nanoleaves are the function of this technology. This infrared radiation permeates the air, warming it.\n\nHours after the sun has set, the nanothermovoltaic component of each nanoleaf is still absorbing radiation (heat) in the infrared spectrum. The rest of the radiating spectrum, not just this side shy of the duo tone can be plausibly utilized in the design of the tree.\n\nLongwave radiation and shortwave radiation are also absorbed.\n\nPiezovoltaic: When hundreds or thousands of nanoleaves are blow by the wind. This moves piezo-electric elements built into the petioles that connect leaves to twigs and branches. In affect acting as a windfarm as the leaves flutter back and forth.\n\nThe developers of this concept say, on their website,that in the average biomimiced tree branch, piezo-electric system produces millions upon millions of Pico watts; when thousands of nanoleaves flutter blown in a small wind.\n\nThe amazing effects of stronger winds generating wattage (from greater flap frequency) in this system are exponentially quantifiable and accounted for.\n\nFacilitated Transport: This system uses a fixed agent that bonds with CO2. This keeps CO2 from being breathed back out of the leaves.\n\nThis process was created by creating a tangent process from a technology process developed and discovered originally by a Norwegian team of researchers.\n\nThe original Norwegian discovery modeled the breathing process after the human lung.\n\nThe model has room in the concept design for absorbing heat from evaporation and advection from the ground.\n\nIt is reasonable to picture how geothermal radiation reception can be added to absorb efficiently through a spiraling root system.\n\nThe current is transmitted from the petiole down to the base.\n\nThe base of the tree sends out all the DC current that had been created in different ways by converters located in the branches of the tree.\n\nThese trees are designed to beautify the landscape of Americas here and there: Through biomimicry by means of the nanoleaf, on through the piezovoltaic conversion of solar light, solar thermal, and wind energy. All this,while clearing the air of CO2; sending electricity to our homes, businesses, and community resources both near and far.\n\nThis audio book is great for the do it yourselfer who needs to learn on the run; or those of us who are sight impaired, and prefer to listen to books at our own leisure.\n\nThe book covers the basics of what anyone needs to know to put together a solar system for there home.\n\nFrom beginning to the end of the audio tape, the auditory listener will find this lecture series helpful on completing a project they have set out to install as a functioning part of there home.\n\nSolar Panels: How to Build Your Own audio book is making photovoltaic information accessible to people on a tight schedule, those who drive for a living, those who can speak English but cannot read it yet, or otherwise cannot stop working to read, people who already have a host of other books on their reading lists, and the visually impaired Do It Yourselfers across this great country."

They both take inspiration from butterfly wings.\n\nHydrogen fuel could be the ultimate renewable — it's a clean-burning fuel made from sunlight and water, and it doesn't get much greener than that. But to be practical, it requires really efficient solar power (the solar energy is used to split water molecules to produce the fuel). Researcher Tongxiang Fan and his team think they've developed a solar collector that will more than double the speed of hydrogen gas production, and they did it by looking at pretty butterflies.\n\nSee, the black part of butterfly wings are amazingly good at absorbing light without reflecting it. It's like, how much more black could you be? And the answer is none. None more black. As Fan and his team discovered, this absorption power comes down to the structure of wing scales — their ridged arrangement actually helps funnel light down to a deeper layer.\n\nThe researchers used a process called dip-calcining – it's sort of like petrifying a tree, as far as I can tell – to actually turn the wings into titanium dioxide, which is used as a catalyst to convert water into hydrogen fuel. They found the process worked more than twice as fast using the wing-shaped catalyst as it did with just a lump of titanium dioxide.\n\nDoes this mean you can look forward to a butterfly-powered car? Well, not in the absence of a fairy godmother. But it's cool to see that nature can provide us inspiration for how to stop completely fucking up nature"

But research unveiled today at the National Meeting of the American Chemical Society has defined the mechanism by which water vapor in the air become charged, a discovery which could lead to devices capable of creating electricity from the atmosphere's own charges.\n\nTags.\n\nUsing small particles of aluminum phosphate and silica -- two particles found commonly in the atmosphere -- they showed that in the presence of water vapor silica particles become more negatively charged. Aluminum phosphate grows slightly more positively charged. This building of charges in humid air can accumulate and be transferred to other objects, explaining phenomena like the charge buildup where steam escapes from boilers that had baffled scientists for centuries.\n\nGalembeck and company call the quality \"hygroelectricity,\" meaning \"humid electricity.\" The property could lead to generators that pull charge right out of humid air to power buildings, as well as to panels that prevent lightning from striking in certain areas.\n\n11 Comments\n\nImagine building a tall 5000 foot tower and hanging 'seeds' from it to force electricity to 'flow' in the form of lighting to ultra capacitors on the ground to store it. Wow wouldn't that be something huh? And with Colorado is 'lightning alley' I bet we could power the lions share of things with that! Oh dream on people!\n\nI'snt this the same exact thing Nikola Tesla was doing in the early 1900's before Edison killed his funding to build his wardenclyffe tower in Colorado? Tesla was truly a genius and a electrical wizard!\n\nHe didn't try this EXACT thing. In fact, he tried the opposite- he had a vision of using a monsterous Tasla Coil to put electricity INTO the air. From there, we could harness the energy radiating from the coil, not so much the elements in the air.\n\nlightning discharges carry an insignificant amount of energy (high voltage, but a very small interval). So it seems unlikely that the energy of ambient atmospheric polarization would amount to much. They should've cited an optimum projection, because 'the benefits...could be substantial. A million volts and 1 Amp is a mega watt. You would have a hard time running a CFL on that sort of energy, let alone using it as a power source\n\nWhile burning everything we can get our grubby hands on is not a great idea (yes, its fire and fire is cool but still its rather pre-stone age). I happen to like electricity better and getting it from wind and sun as I've been doing for 38 years now.\nI think ideas like this one are good, BUT, not without substantial research first!\nWe still know very little about the workings of this planet, but enough to know its magnetic field is what is keeping life here without the solar winds stripping off the water, most of the atmosphere and keeping out radiation that would otherwise likely fry all of us.\nI dont think it wise to mess with what could effect the earths magnetic field, until we are certain we wouldn't have an impact on it, short or long term.\n\nthe earths magnetic field is created by its motlen iron magnma core and the its rotation! This article presents a good idea, however gilje03 has a point it would be extremely difficult to extract any amount of useful voltage out of sparcley strewn about electrons on microscopic water droplets in the atmosphere, why do you think the milisecond of a charge (lightining) that does form only happens during very dense ocurrenses of atmospheric pressure, chalk this one up with physical matter teleportation and traveling to other galaxies, all good ideas but very veeery far down the road :)-\n\nThey say at the end, \"panels that keep lightning from striking buildings\". But, don't we already have lightning rods for that? Also, this is a great idea, it would be much like putting a lightning rod in the middle of a thunderstorm. by the way, it does not matter the size of the machine, for in electric storms there is not as much silica and aluminum phosphate as there could be in a generator that is designed specifically for this.

Credit: Mark Shwartz / Stanford University\n\nStanford University scientists have built the first solar cell made entirely of carbon, a promising alternative to the expensive materials used in photovoltaic devices today.\n\nThe results are published in the Oct. 31 online edition of the journalACS Nano.\n\n\"Carbon has the potential to deliver high performance at a low cost,\" said study senior author Zhenan Bao, a professor of chemical engineering at Stanford. \"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a working solar cell that has all of the components made of carbon. This study builds on previous work done in our lab.\"\n\n Bao said.\n\nThe coating technique also has the potential to reduce manufacturing costs, said Stanford graduate student Michael Vosgueritchian, co-lead author of the study with postdoctoral researcher Marc Ramuz.\n\nThe Bao group's experimental solar cell consists of a photoactive layer, which absorbs sunlight, sandwiched between two electrodes. In a typical thin film solar cell, the electrodes are made of conductive metals and indium tin oxide (ITO). \"Materials like indium are scarce and becoming more expensive as the demand for solar cells, touchscreen panels and other electronic devices grows,\" Bao said. \"Carbon, on the other hand, is low cost and Earth-abundant.\"\n\nFor the study, Bao and her colleagues replaced the silver and ITO used in conventional electrodes with graphene – sheets of carbon that are one atom thick –and single-walled carbon nanotubes that are 10,000 times narrower than a human hair. \"Carbon nanotubes have extraordinary electrical conductivity and light-absorption properties,\" Bao said.\n\nFor the active layer, the scientists used material made of carbon nanotubes and \"buckyballs\" – soccer ball-shaped carbon molecules just one nanometer in diameter. The research team recently filed a patent for the entire device.\n\n\"Every component in our solar cell, from top to bottom, is made of carbon materials,\" Vosgueritchian said. \"Other groups have reported making all-carbon solar cells, but they were referring to just the active layer in the middle, not the electrodes.\"\n\nOne drawback of the all-carbon prototype is that it primarily absorbs near-infrared wavelengths of light, contributing to a laboratory efficiency of less than 1 percent – much lower than commercially available solar cells. \"We clearly have a long way to go on efficiency,\" Bao said. \"But with better materials and better processing techniques, we expect that the efficiency will go up quite dramatically.\"\n\nImproving efficiency\n\nThe Stanford team is looking at a variety of ways to improve efficiency. \"Roughness can short-circuit the device and make it hard to collect the current,\" Bao said. \"We have to figure out how to make each layer very smooth by stacking the nanomaterials really well.\"\n\nThe researchers are also experimenting with carbon nanomaterials that can absorb more light in a broader range of wavelengths, including the visible spectrum.\n\n\"Materials made of carbon are very robust,\" Bao said. \"They remain stable in air temperatures of nearly 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit.\"\n\nThe ability of carbon solar cells to out-perform conventional devices under extreme conditions could overcome the need for greater efficiency, according to Vosgueritchian. \"We believe that all-carbon solar cells could be used in extreme environments, such as at high temperatures or at high physical stress,\" he said. \"But obviously we want the highest efficiency possible and are working on ways to improve our device.\"\n\n\"Photovoltaics will definitely be a very important source of power that we will tap into in the future,\" Bao said. \"We have a lot of available sunlight.

It traces the PV operating voltage corresponding to the maximum power point (MPP) and operates the panel at MPP. However, if a PV array is partially shaded, the conventional MPPT techniques track local MPP and fail to track global MPP. Also, if modules with different optimal currents are connected in series—parallel local MPPs occur in the P-V curves and conventional MPPT techniques fail to search global maxima. A lot of literature is available on global MPPT techniques to increase overall system efficiency. The power conditioning unit should, therefore, be capable of searching global maximum power point also. This paper aims at presenting a number of conventional and global MPPT techniques; these methods are discussed in detail on the basis of certain performance parameters.\n\nDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with different thickness TiO2 nanoparticle films and a \"double-layer\" working electrode of TiO2 nanoparticle/TiO2 nanowire are fabricated. The influence of the TiO2 nanoparticle films thickness and of a light-scattering layer of TiO2 nanowire on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs are investigated. The transport and interfacial transfer of electrons in DSSCs are investigated using intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS), intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to determine the lifetime, diffusion coefficient, and diffusion length of the electrons. The results indicate that the optimum TiO2 nanoparticle films' thickness for DSSCs is about 14 μm. The introduction of the light-scattering layer leads to an obvious enhancement of the power conversion efficiency. This can mainly be attributed to the superior light-scattering ability, fast electron transport, and long electron lifetime, resulting in a larger electron diffusion coefficient and a higher charge collection efficiency, which are confirmed by IMPS, IMVS, and EIS.\n\nSince large-scale and cheap energy storage is an unsolved problem, the main difficulty of using wind and solar electricity is caused by their intermittent nature. It is a widespread belief that the combination of the two renewable technologies generally improves the reliability and supply quality of electricity generation. Indeed, there are some locations where wind speeds are definitely larger during the nights because of the increased stability of the atmospheric boundary layer. However, a proper decision making requires to study the supposed benefits at the very location of designed installations. Here, we report on a model study, where the whole area of Hungary is evenly covered by wind generators and solar photovoltaic units of various composition and total rated power. The combined model output is compared to the recorded electricity consumption in Hungary. Our results indicate that the integrated output of combined renewable production can be definitely lower than the output of \"pure\" (either solar or wind) resource network of the same rated power. The main reasons are the lack of daily cycle of wind strength and the strong annual seasonality of insolation in the Carpathian basin. Benefits of combined production show up at unrealistically high rated power values which is a consequence of limited capacity factors of both renewable sources around Hungary.\n\nIn this article, an endeavor has been made to assess the operating characteristics of a diesel engine fuelled with methyl esters of pungamia, ethyl esters of pungamia, and ethyl esters of neem, added to diesel by percentage volume ranging from B20 to B80. The test runs on diesel fuel in the first phase of work were carried out under standard injection timing of 23° before top dead center (BTDC), so as to establish baseline for other parameters. The similar test procedures were repeated with an advanced injection timings of 26° BTDC and 28° BTDC fuelled with diesel and biodiesel–diesel blends varying from B20 to B100. Experimental results proved that the 3° advancement of injection timing from the standard injection timing proved promising outcomes for biodiesel operated engine, whereas 5° BTDC crank angle degree produced a higher exhaust gas temperature and higher levels of NOx formation.\n\nOptimization studies on fermentative hydrogen production were investigated using a facultative bacteria namely, Enterobacter species (MTCC 7104). The present study emphasizes the application of mathematical tools such as response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the maximum yield of hydrogen from the optimized carbon and nitrogen source. The key components such as glucose, initial pH, xylose, tryptone, yeast extract, sucrose, and peptone were screened using the Plackett-Burman design. Furthermore, rotatable central composite design and analysis of variance were adopted to investigate the interactive effect of the significant variables (xylose concentration, initial pH, and peptone concentration). Maximum experimental hydrogen yield of 1.94 mol H2/mol xylose was achieved at the optimal points predicted by the RSM. Modeling ability of ANN and RSM has also been evaluated on predicting the maximum hydrogen yield with the estimated values of root mean square error (RMSE), multiple correlation coefficients (R2), and standard error of prediction (SEP). The estimated values of RMSE, R2, and SEP for ANN model and RSM model confirm that fitness and prediction accuracy of ANN model were higher when compared to RSM model. Energy conversion efficiency and energy recovery analysis were performed for hydrogen production process using xylose as the source material.\n\nTo extract maximum output power from a solar cell, it is essential to know the solar cell parameters such as the photo-current (Iph), the series resistance (Rse), the shunt resistance (Rsh), the reverse saturation current (I0), and the diode ideality factor (n). This paper presents new and simple methods for estimating the cell parameters. First, Rse and Rsh are estimated from the intercepts of the linear slope equations dV/dI and dI/dV at the open circuit voltage (Voc) and the short circuit current (Isc) regions, respectively. The slopes of these equations also give I0 and n, known as method-1. In method-2, using Rse and Rsh obtained by method-1, I0 and n are estimated using Newton-Raphson technique. The methods presented here are applied to the illuminated I-V characteristics of silicon solar cells, an organic solar cell, and a dye sensitized solar cell previously reported in the literatures. The studies show that method-1 is more suitable for the solar cells with 70% or above fill factor whereas method-2 is suitable for all kinds of solar cells irrespective of fill factor.\n\nThis is a parametric study on how blade and tower loads for a prototypical downwind offshore wind turbine are affected as the tower geometry and blade properties are changed. Downwind turbines have the potential to reduce the cost of energy, as blades can be more flexible and lighter, but the tower shadow induces additional structural vibrations. In order to reduce the latter, a fairing around the tower has been introduced. The length of the fairing is varied, adjusting the rotor overhang accordingly. Additionally, the blade weight and stiffness are adjusted. The blade and tower fatigue loads are, thereby, significantly decreased. In the first case, a maximum reduction of 8% and 28% (for the blade root bending and tower bottom moment, respectively) was achieved, compared to a downwind version of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 5 MW reference wind turbine on a monopile tower. Using softer and lighter blades resulted in loads even lower than for the conventional upwind rotor of the NREL turbine, up to 5% and 13% less for the blade and tower fatigue loads, respectively. The increased overhang increased the mean tower bending moments, suggesting that an optimal downwind turbine needs to be designed with a compromise between these fatigue and ultimate loads. The power production stayed approximately the same as that of a conventional wind turbine or was slightly higher.\n\nHybrid solar cells consisting of a composite of poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT), and cadmium selenide/zinc sulphide (CdSe/ZnS) coreshell quantum dots (QDs) have been fabricated in the present work. The bulk hetrojunction has been formed from the bilayer of P3HT:SWCNT composite and QDs using inter-diffusion process. Due to low percolation limit and high conductivity of SWCNT, the photo-generated electrons are collected at the electrode very fast (within few femto-seconds) enhancing the efficiency of the solar cell. The absorption measurements on the composite film show that the addition of SWCNT in the hybrid structure increases the absorption coefficient in the near infrared region and also makes the spectrum wider as compared to that of P3HT. The photoluminescence (PL) measurements show that the PL of hybrid P3HT, SWCNT, and QDs is quenched about ∼15 times as compared to that of P3HT film. This shows that a significant charge transfer of electrons occurs through SWCNT to the electrode. The morphology of P3HT:SWCNT:CdSe/ZnS was observed using atomic force microscopy. With this approach, we have been able to achieve power conversion efficiency of 5.4% using a standard solar simulator with an irradiance of 100 mW/cm2.\n\nA novel alumina (Al2O3) reduction technique for a renewable energy cycling system based on aluminum is proposed. Al2O3 powder was fed into laser-sustained plasma and thermally dissociated. The produced Al was expanded to supersonic speeds through a nozzle. From the Al and argon line distributions in the flow direction, it was found that Al remained in the dissociated state. A water-cooled copper tube was inserted in the flow to collect Al. X-ray analysis indicated that elemental Al was observed on the surface of the tube. The maximum value of the estimated reduction efficiency was 5%."

In a piece published in the November 18 edition of Science, Gogotsi, who is the head of the A.J. Drexel Nanotechnology Institute, calls for a new, standardized gauge of performance measurement for energy storage devices that are as small as those used in cell phones to as large as those used in the national energy grid.\n\nGogotsi is one of the featured experts, along with Bill Gates, tapped by Science to address problems that must be solved en route to the widespread use of renewable energy. His piece, co-authored with Dr. Patrice Simon of the Université Paul Sabatier in Toulouse, France, is entitled \"True Performance Metrics in Electrochemical Energy Storage.\"\n\n\"A dramatic expansion of research in the area of electrochemical energy storage has occurred over the past due to an ever increasing variety of handheld electronic devices that we all use,\" Gogotsi said. \"This has expanded use of electrical energy in transportation, and the need to store renewable energy efficiently at the grid level. This process has been accompanied by the chase for glory with the arrival of new materials and technologies that leads to unrealistic expectations for batteries and supercapacitors and may hurt the entire energy storage field.\"\n\nThe main type of energy storage device addressed in the article is the supercapacitor. Supercapacators, which are built from relatively inexpensive natural materials such as carbon, aluminum and polymers, are found in devices, ranging from mobile phones and laptop batteries to trams, buses and solar cells. While supercapacitors tend to store less energy compared to standard lithium-ion batteries, they have the ability to charge and discharge energy more quickly than batteries and can be recharged a near infinite number of times, and operate in a wider temperature range with a high efficiency.\n\nTypically, the performance of both, batteries and supercapacitors, is presented using Ragone plots, graphs that show a relation between the energy density and the power density. For example, a Rangone plot for the battery used in an electric car shows both how far it can travel on a single charge –energy density- and how fast the car can travel –power density. An ideal energy storage device is expected to store plenty of energy and do it quickly.\n\nThe issue that Gogotsi and Simon bring to light is the idea that current metrics for grading energy storage devices, including the Ragone plot, may not provide a complete picture of the devices' capability. According to the researchers, other metrics, such as a device's cycle lifetime, energy efficiency, self-discharge, temperature range of operation and cost, must also be reported.\n\n\"This paper calls upon the community of scientists and engineers who work on supercapacitors to present data on material performance using metrics beyond the traditional Ragone plot,\" Simon said. \"Although such plots are useful for comparing fully packaged commercial devices, they might predict unrealistic performance for packaged cells from extrapolation of small amounts of materials.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- A Berkeley Lab scientist was a key member of a team that developed a unique new technique for integrating high performance micro-sized supercapacitors into a variety of portable electronic In order to save money and energy, many people are purchasing hybrid electric cars or installing solar panels on the roofs of their homes.

      "text": "Researchers adapt classic antennas to harness more power from the sun\n\nNov 10, 2011\n\nSome solar devices, like calculators, only need a small panel of solar cells to function. But supplying enough power to meet all our daily needs would require enormous solar panels. And solar-powered energy collected by panels made of silicon, a semiconductor material, is limited -- contemporary panel technology can only convert approximately seven percent of optical solar waves into electric current.\n\nProfs. Koby Scheuer, Yael Hanin and Amir Boag of Tel Aviv University's Department of Physical Electronics and its innovative new Renewable Energy Center are now developing a solar panel composed of nano-antennas instead of semiconductors. By adapting classic metallic antennas to absorb light waves at optical frequencies, a much higher conversion rate from light into useable energy could be achieved. Such efficiency, combined with a lower material cost, would mean a cost-effective way to harvest and utilize \"green\" energy.\n\nThe technology was recently presented at Photonics West in San Francisco and published in the conference proceedings.\n\nReceiving and transmitting green energy\n\nBoth radio and optical waves are electromagnetic energy, Prof. Scheuer explains. When these waves are harvested, electrons are generated that can be converted into electric current. Traditionally, detectors based on semiconducting materials like silicon are used to interface with light, while radio waves are captured by antenna.\n\nFor optimal absorption, the antenna dimensions must correspond to the light's very short wavelength -- a challenge in optical frequencies that plagued engineers in the past, but now we are able to fabricate antennas less than a micron in length. To test the efficacy of their antennas, Prof. Scheuer and his colleagues measured their ability to absorb and remit energy. \"In order to function, an antenna must form a circuit, receiving and transmitting,\" says Prof. Scheuer, who points to the example of a cell phone, whose small, hidden antenna both receives and transmits radio waves in order to complete a call or send a message.\n\nBy illuminating the antennas, the researchers were able to measure the antennas' ability to re-emit radiation efficiently, and determine how much power is lost in the circuit -- a simple matter of measuring the wattage going in and coming back out. Initial tests indicate that 95 percent of the wattage going into the antenna comes out, meaning that only five percent is wasted.\n\nAccording to Prof. Scheuer, these \"old school\" antennas also have greater potential for solar energy because they can collect wavelengths across a much broader spectrum of light. The solar spectrum is very broad, he explains, with UV or infrared rays ranging from ten microns to less than two hundred nanometers. No semiconductor can handle this broad a spectrum, and they absorb only a fraction of the available energy. A group of antennas, however, can be manufactured in different lengths with the same materials and process, exploiting the entire available spectrum of light.\n\nWhen finished, the team's new solar panels will be large sheets of plastic which, with the use of a nano- imprinting lithography machine, will be imprinted with varying lengths and shapes of metallic antennas.\n\nImproving solar power's bottom line\n\nThe researchers have already constructed a model of a possible solar panel. The next step, says Prof. Scheuer, is to focus on the conversion process -- how electromagnetic energy becomes electric current, and how the process can be improved.\n\nThe goal is not only to improve the efficiency of solar panels, but also to make the technology a viable option in terms of cost. Silicon is a relatively inexpensive semiconductor, but in order to obtain sufficient power from antennas, you need a very large panel -- which becomes expensive. Green energy sources need to be evaluated not only by what they can contribute environmentally, but also the return on every dollar invested, Prof. Scheuer notes. \"Our antenna is based on metal -- aluminium and gold -- in very small quantities. It has the potential to be more efficient and less expensive.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Basic scientific curiosity paid off in unexpected ways when Rice University researchers investigating the fundamental physics of nanomaterials discovered a new technology that could dramaticallyIn recent years, developers have been investigating light-harvesting thin film solar panels made from nanotechnology -- and promoting efficiency metrics to make the technology marketable.

Scientists at the University of Michigan may have discovered a breakthrough in solar power technology that could drastically reduce the cost of solar power. It was once believed that the effects of light's magnetic field were so weak they were irrelevant when it came to solar power. However, according to physics professor Stephen Rand, that is not true.\n\nIt was discovered that if light is intense enough, it can generate voltage from magnetic effects 100 million times stronger than earlier predicted when traveling through nonconductive material. These magnetic effects can be bound for electric power production. Stephen Rand states:\n\n\"This could lead to a new kind of solar cell without semiconductors and without absorption to produce charge separation inSo what does this mean? It will be difficult to make this a low cost power producer because the intensity of the light must be 10 million watts per square centimeter. For comparison, ordinary sunlight produces less than one watt per square centimeter. However, William Fisher believes new materials such as transparent ceramics combined with focused sunlight could work at lower intensities of light greatly reducing the cost of solar power and becoming a reliable energy producer. This breakthrough could have a major impact in the heating and cooling industry!"

In theory, their invention could be far more energy efficient than thermal desalination or reverse osmosis. This would cut the cost of using salt water for drinking or irrigation. It could also be used to make compact desalination systems for boats and life rafts, or crops. Each battery is made with manganese oxide nanorod electrodes, which absorb sodium when an electrical current passes through them. When the current is reversed, they dump the sodium ions out into waste water.\"\n\nInteresting, but how much energy does it take to run this thing? (they call it a 'battery', but I don't think it actually generates electricity). Many of the places that are short on fresh water are also short on electricity (especially \"green\" energy), so this may not be as helpful as it sounds.\n\nWhat I'd really want to know is if it is more efficient to use a solar panel to charge the battery to then separate the salt or simply to use the sun to desalinate the water using the tradition process.\n\nYou might be right that the place for this tech is a pre-treatment for an RO process, but it isn't mentioned in the article and the researchers appear to be looking for a gadget \"where you put saltwater in one side and delicious drinking water comes out the other\":\n\nThe desalinated water that comes from the battery still contains too much salt for drinking, La Mantia says: \"We removed up to 50% of the original salt, but we need to arrive at 98%.\"\n\nDoing several cycles of ion removal with the battery would further desalinate the water, but those extra cycles cost energy, so La Mantia hopes to improve the efficiency enough so that the battery can remove the salt in a single pass.\n\nI'd be dubious about the efficiency of doing this electrochemical desalinization to remove so much of the salt, I would think that the resistance of the water is going to rise substantially as salt leaves so it seems like more and more electrical energy will be required per mole of salt ions as the concentration drops.\n\nSo by pre-treating water to remove much of the salt before sending it to RO the membranes will last longer before replacement? How much of the operating cost of an RO plant is determined by this? Would there be an impact on the RO process energy consumption?"

Electrochemical Printing (EcP) is a software reconfigurable electrodeposition tool that relies on microfluidic print nozzles that directs the local growth of materials. By rastering the print nozzle (or parallel array of microfabricated print nozzles) across a surface, while locally electroplating materials of choice (metals, semiconductors, polymers or insulators).\n\nThe way EcP works, an input drawing of the object to be built is provided to a computer, which converts the file into tool movements and electrodeposition actions. In the end, a custom object is produced, and custom items can usually fetch a high price.This new manufacturing processes is much like inkjet printing, except the object is made from metal, semiconductor, polymer or insulator; it takes place at room temperature and pressure from an aqueous electrolyte, with little waste.\n\nAt the same time, it is often hard to make high quality materials without using elevated temperatures and pressures. So, simply using EcP to make low quality materials and devices will not let one fetch a high price. To address this, a team of students are exploring the use of protein-aided manufacturing methods, where the proteins help drive the growth of high quality nanomaterials from complex electrolytes.

It gives the leaf the ability to self-heal damage that occurs during production of energy. Daniel G. Nocera, Ph.D., described the advance during the \"Kavli Foundation Innovations in Chemistry Lecture\" at the 245th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society.\n\nNocera, leader of the research team, explained that the \"leaf\" mimics the ability of real leaves to produce energy from sunlight and water. The device, however, actually is a simple catalyst-coated wafer of silicon, rather than a complicated reproduction of the photosynthesis mechanism in real leaves. Dropped into a jar of water and exposed to sunlight, catalysts in the device break water down into its components, hydrogen and oxygen. Those gases bubble up and can be collected and used as fuel to produce electricity in fuel cells.\n\n\"Surprisingly, some of the catalysts we've developed for use in the artificial leaf device actually heal themselves,\" Nocera said. \"They are a kind of 'living catalyst.' This is an important innovation that eases one of the concerns about initial use of the leaf in developing countries and other remote areas.\"\n\nNocera, who is the Patterson Rockwood Professor of Energy at Harvard University, explained that the artificial leaf likely would find its first uses in providing \"personalized\" electricity to individual homes in areas that lack traditional electric power generating stations and electric transmission lines. Less than one quart of drinking water, for instance, would be enough to provide about 100 watts of electricity 24 hours a day.

      "text": "Researchers make a significant discovery regarding solar cells\n\nThe sun produces enough energy to power the planet many many times over. The issue is how to harness it. The current solar solutions are fairly inefficient at producing electricity and are stiff and heavy which makes them impractical for some uses. The rigidity also makes them fragile which further limits the applications in which they can be used.\n\nBut, researchers from the University of Austria and the University of Tokyo have made a pretty significant advancement in the technology of solar cells. They were able to create an ultra-thin solar cell which measures a minuscule 1.9 micrometers thick. This is roughly one-tenth the size of the next smallest device.\n\nIt's flexibility comes from the fact that it is composed of electrodes mounted on plastic foil, rather than glass. This allows it to be wrapped around a human hair which is nearly 20 times thicker. It could be ready for use in as little as 5 years. There's a plethora of information available at the source below."

      "text": "A team of researchers from Drexel University's College of Engineering has developed a new method for quickly and efficiently storing large amounts of electrical energy. The researchers are putting forward a plan to integrate into the grid an electrochemical storage system that combines principles behind the flow batteries and supercapacitors. The team's research yielded a novel solution that combines the strengths of batteries and supercapacitors while also negating the scalability problem. The \"electrochemical flow capacitor\" consists of an electrochemical cell connected to two external electrolyte reservoirs—a design similar to existing redox flow batteries that are used in electrical vehicles. This technology is unique because it uses small carbon particles suspended in the electrolyte liquid to create a slurry of particles that can carry an electric charge. Uncharged slurry is pumped from its tanks through a flow cell, where energy stored in the cell is then transferred to the carbon particles. The charged slurry can then be stored in reservoirs until the energy is needed, at which time the entire process is reversed in order to discharge the EFC. The main advantage of the EFC is that its design allows it to be constructed on a scale large enough to store large amounts of energy, while also allowing for rapid disbursal of the energy when the demand dictates it. \"By using a slurry of carbon particles as the active material of supercapacitors, we are able to adopt the system architecture from redox flow batteries and address issues of cost and scalability,\" says Yury Gogotsi, director of the A.J. Drexel Nanotechnology Institute and the lead researcher on the project. \"A liquid storage system, the capacity of which is limited only by the tank size, can be cost-effective and scalable. …However, we will need to increase the energy density per unit of slurry volume by an order of magnitude, and achieve it using very inexpensive carbon and salt solutions to make the technology practical.\"\n\n(PNAS) Compressed sensing is a method that allows a significant reduction in the number of samples required for accurate measurements in many applications in experimental sciences and engineering. In this work, we show that compressed sensing can also be used to speed up numerical simulations. We apply compressed sensing to extract information from the real-time simulation of atomic and molecular systems, including electronic and nuclear dynamics. We find that, compared to the standard discrete Fourier transform approach, for the calculation of vibrational and optical spectra the total propagation time, and hence the computational cost, can be reduced by approximately a factor of five. Researchers at University of Pennsylvania have developed and validated a new technology in which composite nanofibrous scaffolds provide a loose enough structure for cells to colonize without impediment, but still can instruct cells how to lay down new tissue. Via electrospinning, the team made composites containing two distinct fiber types: a slow-degrading polymer and a water-soluble polymer that can be selectively removed to increase or decrease the spacing between fibers. Increasing the proportion of the dissolving fibers enhanced the ability of host cells to colonize the nanofiber mesh and eventually migrate to achieve a uniform distribution and form a truly three-dimensional tissue. The team is currently testing these novel materials in a large animal model of meniscus repair and for other orthopedic applications.\n\n(Gizmag) A solution containing skin cells and proteins has been shown to speed the healing of venous leg ulcers. While the ulcers can be quite resistant to treatment, a team of scientists is now reporting success in using a sort of \"spray-on skin\" to heal them. Developed by Texas-based Healthpoint Biotherapeutics, the spray-on solution consists of neonatal keratinocytes and fibroblasts (skin cells), which are suspended in a liquid made up of various proteins associated with blood clotting. It was tested using a group of 228 patients afflicted with the ulcers, all of whom were also treated with compression bandages. It was found that when compared that control group, patients receiving the optimum dosage experienced a 16 percent greater reduction in wound area after seven days. After 12 weeks, they were 52 percent more likely to have achieved wound closure. Not only were the ulcers on patients receiving the optimum dosage more likely to heal, but they also healed quicker - in the control group, ulcers that did heal took an average of 21 days longer to do so. It has been suggested that the spray-on solution may also be useful in treating other types of chronic wounds, such as ischemic and diabetic foot ulcers.\n\n(Tech Beat) A recent paper from the National Institute of Standards and Technology argues that before lab-on-a-chip technology can be fully commercialized, testing standards need to be developed and implemented. Standardized testing and measurement methods, paper author Samuel Stavis writes, will enable MEMS LOC manufacturers at all stages of production-from processing of raw materials to final rollout of products-to accurately determine important physical characteristics of LOC devices such as dimensions, electrical surface properties, and fluid flow rates and temperatures. To make his case for testing standards, Stavis focuses on autofluorescence. Stavis states that multiple factors must be considered in the development of a testing standard for autofluorescence, including: the materials used in the device, the measurement methods used to test the device and how the measurements are interpreted. \"All of these factors must be rigorously controlled for, or appropriately excluded from, a meaningful measurement of autofluorescence,\" Stavis writes.\n\nNASA's Space Technology Program has selected Deployable Space Systems\n\nResearchers from the University of Toronto have invented a new device that may allow for the uniform, large-scale engineering of tissue. Scientists manipulate biomaterials into the microdevice through several channels. The biomaterials are then mixed, causing a chemical reaction that forms a \"mosaic hydrogel\"—a sheet-like substance compatible with the growth of cells into living tissues, into which different types of cells can be seeded in very precise and controlled placements. Unique to this new approach to tissue engineering, however, and unlike more typical methods (for instance, scaffolding), cells planted onto the mosaic hydrogel sheets are precisely incorporated into the mosaic hydrogel sheet just at the time it's being created, generating the perfect conditions for cells to grow. The placement of the cells is so precise can precisely mimic the natural placement of cells in living tissues. And, by collecting these sheets around a drum, the machine is able to collect layers of cells in thicknesses made to measure: in essence, three dimensional, functional tissues."

In fact, the pair tested the material against two other contenders to replace platinum and found the nanorods' performance consistently superior over a six-month period.\n\nThe nanorods have been proved stable and are scalable, says Chen, but more investigation is needed to determine how easily they can be mass-produced. More study is also required to determine the exact interaction responsible for the nanorods' performance.\n\nThe work was published in March in the journal Advanced Materials (\"Nitrogen-Enriched Core-Shell Structured Fe/Fe3C-C Nanorods as Advanced Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction\").\n\nThe right recipe\n\nMFCs generate electricity while removing organic contaminants from wastewater. On the anode electrode of an MFC, colonies of bacteria feed on organic matter, releasing electrons that create a current as they break down the waste.\n\nOn the cathode side, the most important reaction in MFCs is the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Platinum speeds this slow reaction, increasing efficiency of the cell, but it is expensive.\n\nMicrobial electrolysis cells (MECs) are related to MFCs. However, instead of electricity, MECs produce hydrogen. In addition to harnessing microorganisms at the anode, MECS also use decomposition of organic matter and platinum in a catalytic process at their cathodes.\n\nChen and He's nanorods incorporate the best characteristics of other reactive materials, with nitrogen attached to the surface of the carbon rod and a core of iron carbide. Nitrogen's effectiveness at improving the carbon catalyst is already well known. Iron carbide, also known for its catalytic capabilities, interacts with the carbon on the rod surface, providing \"communication\" with the core. Also, the material's unique structure is optimal for electron transport, which is necessary for ORR.\n\nWhen the nanorods were tested for potential use in MECs, the material did a better job than the graphene-based catalyst material, but it was still not as efficient as platinum.\n\n\"But it shows that there could be more diverse applications for this material, compared to graphene,\" says He. \"And it gave us clues for why the nanorods performed differently in MECs.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nCatalysts made of carbon nanotubes dipped in a polymer solution equal the energy output and otherwise outperform platinum catalysts in fuel cells, a team of Case Western Reserve University engineers has found.\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- As fuel cells are becoming more popular due to their potential use in applications such as hydrogen-powered vehicles, auxiliary power systems, and electronic devices, the need for the precious(PhysOrg.com) -- Los Alamos National Laboratory scientists have developed a way to avoid the use of expensive platinum in hydrogen fuel cells, the environmentally friendly devices that might replace current"

Voyager 1 is the most far-away of any Earth probe, at around 11 billion miles.\n\nThe calculations are based partly on information received from Voyager about the speed of the solar wind (the charged particles coming from the Sun). In 2007 it was around 209,000kph, but after dropping to zero in April 2010, it hasn't picked up since. The solar wind is now instead being blown sideways by a powerful interstellar wind, which was an unexpected twist for most researchers, who hadn't predicted that wind.\n\nThe team calculated that interstellar space likely begins about 11.3 billion miles (18.2 billion km) from Earth. So Voyager 1 appears to be almost there. Since the probe covers about 330 million miles (531 million km) every year, it could pop out of the solar system as early as next year — a surprise, since previous estimates had pegged the probe's exit at 2015 or so.\n\nThat's not a sure thing, however; the calculation has some uncertainty attached to it.

(Photo courtesy of Oregon State University)\n\nEngineersThe findings have just been published in Energy and Environmental Science, a professional journal, in work funded by the National Science Foundation\n\nExperts estimate that about 3 percent of the electrical energy consumed in the United States and other developed countries is used to treat wastewater, and a majority of that electricity is produced by fossil fuels that contribute to global warming.\n\nBut the biodegradable characteristics of wastewater, if tapped to their full potential, could theoretically provide many times the energy that is now being used to process them, with no additional greenhouse emissions.\n\nOSU researchers reported several years ago on the promise of this technology, but at that time the systems in use produced far less electrical power. With new concepts – reduced anode-cathode spacing, evolved microbes and new separator materials – the technology can now produce more than two kilowatts per cubic meter of liquid reactor volume. This amount of power density far exceeds anything else done with microbial fuel cells.\n\nThe system also works better than an alternative approach to creating electricity from wastewater, based on anaerobic digestion that produces methane. It treats the wastewater more effectively, and doesn't have any of the environmental drawbacks of that technology, such as production of unwanted hydrogen sulfide or possible release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.\n\nThe OSU system has now been proven at a substantial scale in the laboratory, Liu said, and the next step would be a pilot study. Funding is now being sought for such a test. A good candidate, she said, might initially be a food processing plant, which is a contained system that produces a steady supply of certain types of wastewater that would provide significant amounts of electricity.\n\nContinued research should also find even more optimal use of necessary microbes, reduced material costs and improved function of the technology at commercial scales, OSU scientists said.\n\nOnce advances are made to reduce high initial costs, researchers estimate that the capital construction costs of this new technology should be comparable to that of the activated sludge systems now in widespread use today – and even less expensive when future sales of excess electricity are factored in.\n\nThis technology cleans sewage by a very different approach than the aerobic bacteria used in the past. Bacteria oxidize the organic matter and, in the process, produce electrons that run from the anode to the cathode within the fuel cell, creating an electrical current. Almost any type of organic waste material can be used to produce electricity – not only wastewater, but also grass straw, animal waste, and byproducts from such operations as the wine, beer or dairy industries.\n\nThe approach may also have special value in developing nations, where access to electricity is limited and sewage treatment at remote sites is difficult or impossible as a result.\n\nThe ability of microbes to produce electricity has been known for decades, but only recently have technological advances made their production of electricity high enough to be of commercial use.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nEngineers at Oregon State University have made a significant advance toward producing electricity from sewage, by the use of new coatings on the anodes of microbial electrochemical cells that increased the electricity production Yanbiao Liu and his colleagues from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, have succeeded in building a device capable of both cleaning wastewater and producing electricity from it.

Radioactivity is a physics effect - not a chemistry effect. Bacteria can't affect the half life of radioactive material.\n\nWhat bacteria can do is e.g. show an ability to concentrate certain atom types (much like your liver tends to concentrate toxic stuff like mercury). This doesn't render the radioactive material any less radioactive, but it may allow it to be more easily extracted afterwards.\n\nThere are bacteria that do live off of radioactivity created by radioactive material  But that doesn't mean they 'eat' radioactivity - rather they use this source of radiation and not the source of radioactivity most other plants use (the sun).\n\nThe entrepreneur in me wakes up - so you have a large block of apartments (flats) - and each time someone uses the bathroom - they get a 5 cent credit towards their rent. The apartment complex has a small power plant - that in conjunction with solar panels on the roof - generates enough power run the complex. They save money because they don't have to pay a sewer fee to the local city, and they sell bags of compost to a local nursery store - sounds like win/win/win.\n\nthat in conjunction with solar panels on the roof - generates enough power run the complex.\n\nNot sure the wastewater of one appartment would render THAT much electricity. 5 cents per use is most certainly a pretty bad deal for you. (and also pretty sure that the roof area of a block of flats won't generate enough electricity with PV to make a big dent in your electricity bill - much less power the complex in a stand-alone fashion. Unless you already have built zero-energy-appartments )\n\n..and you'll have to pay the sewer fee anyhow since the stuff doesn't go away. Occasionally you'll have to flush the remainder - including the bacteria that lived and died.\n\nFor such local use these microreactors are probably not worth the investment (yet)\n\nand also pretty sure that the roof area of a block of flats won't generate enough electricity with PV to make a big dent in your electricity bill - much less power the complex in a stand-alone fashion.\n\nThat would depend on the density of the apartments. Here in the U.S. many apartments are pretty spread out - and just 2 or 3 levels - so solar panels would have enough area. In a larger block - you are probably right - and often the roofs are used for other purposes such as sitting areas - or satellite dishes. But it would help - and probably in the future we will be increasing the efficiency of all or our buildings - so they can be run on a much smaller set of panels. We have some zero energy homes here now - that use a very small set of panels - I think just 2KW - but are super insulated - and use super high efficiency appliances"

      "text": "Fuel cells, energy conversion and mathematics\n\nJul 24, 2009\n\nConcerns about dwindling fossil fuel resources, current levels of petroleum consumption, and growing pressure to shift to more sustainable energy sources are among the many factors prompting the transition from our current energy infrastructure to one that uses less carbon and requires the efficient conversion of energy. This necessitates collecting energy from ambient sources including wind, solar, and geothermal power, and converting it into appropriate forms for distributing electricity. While it is possible for this electric power to be distributed efficiently, conversion is necessary for use in automobiles and large-scale storage is problematic.\n\nPEM Fuel Cells\n\nFuel cells are highly effective devices for converting energy from one form to another, they are more energy-efficient than combustion engines, and a variety of sources can be used to power them. In particular, Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells, also called Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cells, take hydrogen and oxygen from the air to create electricity. They are typically used in automobiles. When pure hydrogen is used as a fuel, these fuel cells emit only heat and water as byproducts, eliminating concerns about air pollutants and greenhouse gases.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy, fuel cells have the potential to replace the internal combustion engine in vehicles and provide power in stationary and portable power applications as they are energy-efficient, clean, and fuel-flexible. The paper PEM Fuel Cells: A Mathematical Overview published on July 17 in the SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics: Special Issue on Fuel Cells examines the mathematical issues that arise when modeling PEM fuel cells.\n\nMath and PEM Fuel Cells\n\nPEM fuel cells are good examples of energy conversion systems that have several levels of interacting functional structures. The interactions range from proton exchange at the nanoscale level to interactions at the macroscale level among the layered media of which the cells are made. Accurately simulating the resulting multiscale interactions requires carefully constructed mathematical models that faithfully represent the physics at the various scales. Modeling and analysis of PEM fuel cell structures, their construction, performance, and degradation also requires the development of new mathematical solutions and highly structured and highly adaptive numerical techniques. Mathematical analysis and scientific computation will play a large role in the resolution of these important issues and as a result will affect the progress of PEM fuel cell research and development.\n\nMore information:\n\nThe paper PEM Fuel Cells: A Mathematical Overview is co-authored by Keith Promislow of the Michigan State University and Brian Wetton of the University of Vancouver.

These properties determine two types of nanotubes: metallic and\n\nsemiconducting.Metallic nanotubes, the researchers found, are 50 times more effective than semicon- ducting ones when used as transparent conductors in organic solar cells.\n\n\"We have now identified precisely the type of car- bon nanotube that should be used in this applica- tion,\" Hersam said.\n\nBecause carbon nanotubes are flexible, as opposed to the brittle indium tin oxide, the researchers' fin- dings could pave the way for many new applications in solar cells. For example, the military could incor- porate the flexible solar cells into tent material to provide solar power directly to soldiers in the field, or the cells could be integrated into clothing, back- packs, or purses for wearable electronics."

The Materials Research Institute, which McGrath headed for 17 years, also received a two-year $600,000 grant in 2001 to develop efficient inexpensive fuel cell materials. \"This time, the National Science Foundation wants to see the new science and technology more widely applied,\" McGrath said. \"Our proposal outlined a plan for that next step. Virginia Tech will work with Battelle, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology, several companies, and Virginia Commonwealth University to bridge gaps in materials, processes, and test methodologies.\"\n\nBattelle, which manages several Department of Energy national laboratories, including Los Alamos National Laboratory, Pacific Northwest, and Oak Ridge, has an exclusive option from Virginia Tech Intellectual Properties Inc. to identify potential national and international markets for new fuel cell membrane technologies.\n\nFaculty members and students in Virginia Tech's Materials Research Institute have developed and patented new inexpensive, efficient co-polymeric materials for use in fuel cells and processes for creating the materials. Fuel cells have the potential to supply clean energy for cars, homes, and portable electronics. A limiting features are the characteristics of polymeric materials used in the proton exchange membrane (PEM) film. The PEM allows hydrogen protons (H+ ions) to pass through to the oxygen side of the fuel cell, where it can release electrochemical energy by reaction with the oxygen. The McGrath group has developed polymeric films that are viable in high heat environments, conductive, and strong enough to be used as advanced materials in fuel cells. They have created a process that incorporates the ion conductor at the monomer level (initial stage of synthesis) rather than after the polymer has been formed, making the materials more durable and easier to create in a scaled-up manufacturing setting. Battelle has extended its option on the patents until March 2005.\n\nThe PFI plan also calls for sharing information on the transition from the laboratory to full-scale production of the fuel cell materials. There have already been discussions with the GM fuel cell materials group in Rochester, N.Y., Motorola in Tempe, Ariz., United Technologies Fuel Cells of Hartford, Conn., and Teledyne Energy Systems of Los Angeles, which have shared testing protocols for automotive, portable, and stationary power applications. \"Our plan is, with Battelle's guidance, to interact with small and large companies which are interested in our film forming materials, and then follow up on their suggestions and requests,\" McGrath said.\n\nThe Center for Innovative Technology will promote workforce development in Virginia by increasing the Virginia technology community's awareness of the fuel cell PFI, and by identifying opportunities for partnering with existing and start-up corporations within the state. Hydrosize Technologies Inc. of Raleigh, N.C., has already scaled up production of several of the PEM materials to kilogram quantities and the Polymer Technology Group Inc. group in Berkeley, Calif., has successfully developed continuous film casting capabilities. Nanosonic Inc. of Blacksburg is investigating some portable power applications of the new PEM material.\n\nIn his role as co-principal investigator on the grant, McNamee will provide leadership in organizing an annual open forum highlighting progress in the National Science Foundation fuel cell PFI effort as part of the Virginia universities' role in economic development. It is planned that the audience will include members of the Virginia General Assembly, Virginia members of Congress, large and start-up corporations in the commonwealth, and the investment community.\n\nOther Virginia Tech researchers who will be active in the PFI are Michael von Spakovsky of Blacksburg, professor of mechanical engineering and director of the Center for Energy Systems Research, and Judy Riffle of Blacksburg, professor of chemistry and director of the Macromolecular Science and Engineering graduate degree program.\n\nThe researchers expect they will have a National Science Foundation research experience for undergraduates (REU) program as part of the PFI by next summer. \"We were able to have an REU as part of the previous PFI,\" McGrathIf the current national challenge to make solar energy cost competitive with other forms of energy by the end of this decade is met, Ranga Pitchumani, the John R.

      "text": "One of the major stumbling blocks of hydrogen cars (fuel cell or otherwise) involves the storage of hydrogen on board. Hydrogen is very combustible and poses an extreme fire/explosion danger, especially when stored as a highly compressed gas.\n\nBut Dutch researcher Robin Gremaud has found that storing the hydrogen in his metal alloy \"nano-sponge\" can drastically reduce the danger of explosion. The metal alloy can absorb the hydrogen and render it relatively inert until needed. According to Gremaud's press release, however, the \"drawback of this approach is that it makes the hydrogen 'tanks' somewhat cumbersome.\"\n\nHydrogen cars are one of those future technologies that perpetually seem to be \"on the horizon.\" Although the research is in a constant chug — bringing it a bit closer with every year — the reality of a \"hydrogen economy\" seems as far away today as it did when I was in 8th grade and read an article in Popular Mechanics that claimed it was a decade away — that was 20 years ago.\n\nSo, although research like this is always incredibly interesting, there's a part of my brain that writes it off as a pipe-dream. The idea of a hydrogen economy makes for a great story, but the reality of getting there may be too much for us to handle, at least in the short term. What do you think?

      "text": "Thermoelectric materials convert temperature gradients into voltages and vice versa. If one end of such a material is hot and the other is cold, a\nvoltage is generated, which can then be used to create electrical power.\n\nFor a material to have good thermoelectric properties, however, it must be a good electrical conductor and a poor thermal conductor. Because bulk\nsilicon is good at conducting both electricity and heat, scientists had ruled it out as a possible thermoelectric material. Two teams have now\nindependently discovered that by nanostructuring silicon, they can reduce its thermal conductivity, making the material promising for thermoelectric\napplications (Nature 2008, 451, 163 and 168).\n\n(*snip!*)\n\n\"It confirms a growing sense in the science community that proper nanostructuring of materials will yield very significant enhancements in\nthermoelectric performance,\" he says.\n\nThe ability to convert heat directly into usable energy is significant. Imagine the possibilities relative to circuitry. Heat is the biggest\nobstacle with faster computing. Being able to rapidly dissipate this heat (and convert it back to electricity) would be a big step forward in\nprocessing speed.\n\nOr electric automobiles, converting tire heat back into electricity. How about putting shingles on your roof that turn the ambient and solar heat\ninto electricity to help power your home?\n\nATSers, there ARE solutions out there. I have shown you quite a few already. Our \"energy woes\" are either going to be shortlived, or we are being\nscrewed over. One way or another, the gig is up.\n\nOver the next several days i will begin to chronicle some materials science breakthroughs that can, to be honest, completely mind blowing. Everything\nfrom new superconductors at room temperature to the conversion of light directly to electricity (and vice versa).\n\nNext Step: Although the cells' electron transport was better, their overall light conversion efficiency was low compared to that of some\nnanoparticle-based solar cells (which have achieved efficiencies of up to 10 percent). Zinc oxide harvests electrons from the dye less efficiently\nthan does titanium dioxide -- a material more commonly used in nano solar cells. The researchers are now making their nanowires out of titanium\ndioxide, a more challenging manufacturing process. The nanowires also have a smaller surface area than a network of nanoparticles, so they carry less\nlight-absorbing dye. The researchers are consequently shrinking their nanowires to 10 nanometers in diameter so that they can fit more nanowires onto\ntheir arrays and increase the total surface area. Yang predicts that with thinner and more numerous titanium wires, his team will be able to achieve a\nconversion efficiency of 10 percent or more, which could make these nano solar cells a viable source of energy.\n\nPhotovoltaics are quite different from thermoelectric. However, given the recent finds from the cloaking piece, the field of photovoltaics is poised\nto really take off.\n\nThe key here is that we are finding new uses for old materials. We have discovered that there are REAL reasons behind the properties of materials.\nFor example, why gold looks the way it does. Why it is the color it is, how brilliant it is. There is something to say about how it is polished, how\nit is formed. This is all done on a macro scale. Perhaps, with polishing, you can change it on a microscale. however, take it down another step or\ntwo, get down to the nanoscale, and if you can make changes to the material you can further change other properties it exhibits.\n\nIn the same way a large lump of gold has the property that it exerts greater force (due to the force=mass*acceleration concept) when dropped on your\nfoot. On the nanoscale such changes in size, shape, contour...they all have further affects on the overall material. This is how you turn paper into\na superconductor. Or how you make silicone have thermoelectric properties.\n\nI am willing to bet that if we controlled design on even smaller scales, we could further create unkown, fantastic properties within the same old\nmaterials that litter the universe.\n\nIn the \"big picture\" there are countless ways to capitalize on energy that was once unrecoverable.\n\nI will be launching a new thread in the next day or two dealing with a completely new form of energy generation from the world of nanotechnology.\n\nCombine it with this, and the new superconductor materials that are available, and it is easy to see how you could build a house that was capable of\nsustaining all your energy needs.\n\nThere are also new materials that provide superconducting batteries which provide a very promising future for electric cars. Of course, the same\ntechnology that can run your home can also run your car (but repair costs would be almost prohibitive, even under ideal conditions).\n\nJust about anything you can imagine is awaiting us at the end of our next breath.\n\nResearchers at McMaster University, in Ontario, say that they have grown light-absorbing nanowires made of high-performance photovoltaic materials on\nthin but highly durable carbon-nanotube fabric. They've also harvested similar nanowires from reusable substrates and embedded the tiny particles in\nflexible polyester film. Both approaches, they argue, could lead to solar cells that are both flexible and cheaper than today's photovoltaics.\n\nThe material being used has historically been prohibitively expensive. However, with the advent of the ability to \"grow\" it in nanoscale formats,\nthe material being used is in much smaller amounts:\n\nSolar proponents love to boast that just a few hundred square kilometers' worth of photovoltaic solar panels installed in Southwestern deserts could\npower the United States. Their schemes come with a caveat, of course: without backup power plants or expensive investments in giant batteries,\nflywheels, or other energy-storage systems, this solar-power supply would fluctuate wildly with each passing cloud (not to mention with the sun's\ndaily rise and fall and seasonal ebbs and flows). Solar-power startup Ausra, based in Palo Alto, thinks it has the solution: solar-thermal-power\nplants that turn sunlight into steam and efficiently store heat for cloudy days.\n\n\"Fossil-fuel proponents often say that solar can't do the job, that solar can't run at night, solar can't run the economy,\" says David Mills,\nAusra's founder and chairman. \"That's true if you don't have storage.\" He says that solar-thermal plants are the solution because storing heat is\nmuch easier than storing electricity. Mills estimates that, thanks to that advantage, solar-thermal plants capable of storing 16 hours' worth of heat\ncould provide more than 90 percent of current U.S. power demand at prices competitive with coal and natural gas. \"There's almost no limit to how\nmuch you can put into the grid,\" he says.\n\nThis is what is being done in Australia. I would honestly have to say that, if Spain doesn't do it, Australia will. This great nation is\nresearching highly out of the box concepts, and then putting the money into their development.\n\nTurning Waste Heat into Power Research shows that silicon is as efficient as pricier materials.\n\nSilicon, in the form of photovoltaic cells, is good at generating electricity from sunlight. New research shows that it could also make a good\nthermoelectric: a material that converts heat into electricity and vice versa. Since silicon is more abundant than the leading thermoelectric\nmaterials and has a vast manufacturing infrastructure behind it, it could eventually yield cheap devices for generating power from engines' waste\nheat or from solar heat.\n\nIn this week's Nature, University of California, Berkeley, chemistry professor Peid ong Yang and his colleagues report having fabricated silicon\nnanowires that generate electricity when a temperature differential is applied across them. Until now, silicon has been considered a bad\nthermoelectric material. But according to Yang, \"the performance of the nanowires is already comparable to the best existing thermoelectric\nmaterial.\"\n\nCool customer: This image, produced by a scanning electron microscope, shows a rough silicon nanowire bridging two heating pads--one serving as a\nheat source and the other as a sensor. Researchers have found that 50-nanometer-wide silicon nanowires have drastically lower heat conductivity than\nbulk silicon but retain their electrical conductivity. Thus the nanowires show potential as thermoelectric materials--ones that convert heat into\nelectricity and vice versa.\n\nI love it when you see technological breakthroughs start seeing applications so quickly.\n\nThe use of thermoelectric materials could revolutionize transportation.

      "text": "Chemical energy is stored and released by the making and breaking of bonds between atoms. It is typically released when bonds are formed, and it is required to break them. Sometimes, however, compounds can be formed that store energy and release it later by undergoing chemical reactions, or rearranging themselves into molecules that, together, have less energy. These compounds can be created by natural processes, and by man. It is also possible to produce electricity chemically. There are many examples of chemical energy in action, both natural and man-made, including photosynthesis, respiration, combustion, explosives and batteries.\n\nChemical Reactions\n\nA chemical reaction will take place when the atoms involved can reach a lower energy state by rearranging themselves in a different way. For example, two hydrogen molecules can combine with one of oxygen to produce two water molecules. Some energy — such as a naked flame or spark — is required to break the bonds within the existing molecules, but much more is released by the formation of the new bonds. The hydrogen and oxygen molecules can be regarded as storing energy that can be released under the right circumstances. The opposite reaction, splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen, takes a great deal of energy, which is why water is very stable.\n\nPhotosynthesis\n\nUnder the right circumstances, it is possible to create molecules that can store a lot of energy, but this must first be supplied from somewhere. One of the best examples of chemical energy storage is photosynthesis by green plants. In this case, sunlight provides the power to combine carbon dioxide from the atmosphere with water to produce sugar molecules, which the plant uses as food. Since sugar has more energy than carbon dioxide and water, they cannot combine directly. Photosynthesis, however, is a complex process that creates the sugar indirectly in a series of steps, using the power of the Sun.\n\nRespiration\n\nCellular respiration can be viewed as the opposite of photosynthesis. When a person or other animal eats plant material, the sugar molecules are broken down, producing carbon dioxide and water. Since these, together, have less energy than the sugar, some is released. This is stored in a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by adding a phosphate group to another molecule called adenosine diphosphate (ADP). It can be released again, when required, by the removal of this phosphate group; although some energy is required to do this, much more is released by the new bonds that the unattached phosphate group forms.\n\nCombustion and Fuels\n\nOne of the most familiar examples of chemical energy is combustion. This is usually a reaction in which carbon and hydrogen in organic substances, such as wood or oil, combine with oxygen in the air to produce carbon dioxide, water, light and heat. It can also involve other elements, however. Combustion drives the motor car, powers the majority of electricity generating stations, and provides heat and cooking facilities for many homes.\n\nThe fuels used for combustion processes can be regarded as chemical stores of energy, much of which has ultimately come from the Sun. Coal, oil and natural gas come from the remains of ancient plants and animals that got their energy from photosynthesis or by eating plants that did so. These organic materials became buried in mud and silt, eventually forming the deposits that are exploited today.\n\nExplosives\n\nThese substances are also energy stores. Their molecules consist of atoms that can rearrange themselves into other molecules that have far less energy, and when this happens, the difference is released as light and heat. Modern explosives are typically nitrated organic compounds, which means that they are carbon-hydrogen compounds that have had nitrogen-oxygen groups added to them. This is usually a relatively unstable formation: with quite a small stimulus, the existing bonds will break, and the atoms will regroup into molecules with much lower energy, such as carbon dioxide, water and nitrogen. The light and heat released, combined with the extremely fast transformation of a solid or liquid into gases, produces a violent explosion.\n\nBatteries: Electricity from Chemicals\n\nChemical reactions can also be used to produce electricity. Atoms of some elements can easily give out electrons, while others like to gain electrons. Batteries exploit this fact by arranging two different elements or compounds in such a way that electrons can flow from one to the other when they are connected in a circuit, forming an electric current. A wide variety of different substances can be used to convert chemical energy to electricity in this way, and so there are many different types of battery that can be used to power phones, small computers, and electric circuitry in cars, among other things.\n\nDiscuss this Article\n\nclintflint Post 8\n\n@pastanaga - Wind turbines aren't perfect though. They aren't welcome in many areas because of the noise pollution they generate and they take up a lot of space.\n\nI think that some of our energy is going to come from a compromise between types of renewable energy and current non-renewable energy sources. For example, biofuel is used in basically the same way as petrol, but is made from plant and animal products and so it's a renewable chemical energy source. Not ideal, maybe, but at least it's an option.\n\npastanaga Post 7\n\n@BabyBoomer67 - Well, that's true of any new energy type. The good thing about wind turbines is that they don't require a finite resource in order to produce energy. No matter how long you think the fossil fuels will last, everyone has to admit they must be finite.\n\nBut the wind is infinite.\n\nWind turbines do use chemical energy in one way though. They generally charge banks of batteries, which, as it says in the article, store energy with chemicals. They are one of the many renewable sources of energy which should be exploited as much as possible.\n\nBabyBoomer67 Post 4\n\ngreenrings- Exactly how do these wind turbines work and are they a good substitution? I've heard investing in their stock is looking good and also wanting to learn more about wind energy.\n\nBut I also read that due to our economic status that the turbine production could stall and bring the values down sharply. I am concerned from both an economical and financial standpoint.\n\ngreenrings Post 3\n\nI read that China surpassed the United States for how much money we invested in wind energy in 2009, but we still have the greatest number of turbines in the world. I know we are heavily dependent on fossil fuels for our main source of energy, and therefore depend on other nations to supply our growing demand. But I really hope we can find renewable energy and become self dependent in the near future.\n\nclarinetist Post 2\n\nPeople need plants and trees to live more than they realize. I asked my teacher why the polar ice caps are melting and she told me to look it up online with my parents.

The newly designed, cheap, flexible plastic device more than triples the efficiency of organic solar cells.\n\nThe new device is essentially a 'sandwich' of nanostructured metal and plastic that is able to trap light, increasing solar cell efficiency by 175 percent. According to the researchers, the device will also work to increase the efficiency of inorganic solar cells, but that side of things hasn't been tested yet.\n\nThe device works by addressing two of the main causes of inefficiency in solar cells, light being reflected by the cell surface, and the lack of an ability to fully capture the light that does enter the cell.\n\nPrinceton University writes: \"With their new metallic sandwich, the researchers were able to address both problems. The sandwich — called a subwavelength plasmonic cavity — has an extraordinary ability to dampen reflection and trap light.

To create enough voltage, the cells layered and combined in series and parallel circuits to form a fuel cell stack. The number of cells varies with design as different systems using the fulel cell need different values of voltage. However, problems will occur when any of the cells is not functioning as expected since the channels are clogged by the reacting remainders which may cause the whole fuel cell stack faulty.

      "text": "Monday, July 2, 2012\n\nLike Magic: Cleaning With SunlightSummer is just around the corner and it's time to dust off the garden tables and chairs. But garden furniture that has been left in the shade too long is often covered with a slimy film of algae, moss, bacteria and fungi which is difficult or even impossible to remove. Scientists are now hoping that they can solve this problem by incorporating titanium dioxide molecules in the plastic used to make the garden chair and adding a little bit of sunlight.\n\nWhen these titanium dioxide molecules are 'activated' by the UV light in the sun's rays, they act as a kind of catalyst, triggering an electrochemical reaction which produces free radicals. These and other active molecules strike a fatal blow to bacteria, fungi and similar organisms, first destroying the cell walls and then penetrating the cytoplasm – the substance that fills the cell – and damaging the bacteria's DNA. As a result, the organic substances are destroyed instead of remaining stuck to the surface.\n\nBut just how well do these photocatalytic coatings work? What organic elements do they destroy, and what are they powerless against? These two questions have been the subject of investigation by researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB in Stuttgart. \"For example, we ran some outdoor tests on garden chair armrests with photocatalytic coatings and compared them to ones made from conventional plastic,\" says Dr. Iris Trick, group manager at the IGB. Dr. Trick and her team sprayed the coated and uncoated armrests with a mixture of various bacteria, mosses, algae and fungi and then left them exposed to the weather for two years.\n\nAt the end of the test, it was almost impossible to remove the layer of dirt from the normal armrests – yet the armrests made from photocatalytic plastics were still almost completely clean and white, even after spending two years outside. The researchers also tested the effectiveness of their special coatings on armrests and a range of other surfaces in the lab. To do this, they applied up to 30 different kinds of fungal, bacterial and algal cultures to coated and uncoated surfaces and compared how the cultures evolved. In addition, they analyzed the degradation products generated on the self-cleaning surfaces by the electrochemical reaction. Self-cleaning walls and displays\n\nThe opportunities offered by titanium dioxide molecules extend far beyond armrests. For example, researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation IPA in Stuttgart are working on paints for building façades which contain titanium dioxide particles. If the wall gets dirty, the photocatalysis degrades the organic contaminants and the paint stays reasonably clean.\n\nThe scientists have even developed a self-cleaning coating for glass surfaces: \"If you apply a thin coating of titanium dioxide to a glass surface such as a smartphone screen, the skin oils and fingerprints gradually disappear from the display by themselves,\" says Dr. Michael Vergöhl, head of department at the Fraunhofer Institute for Surface Engineering and Thin Films IST in Braunschweig and head of the Fraunhofer Photocatalysis Alliance.\n\nAll that is needed is one hour of sunlight – unlike previous photocatalytic surfaces, which would have required the smartphone to be left in the sun for three days. The next step is to develop new materials that can also be activated by artificial light. The Fraunhofer Photocatalysis Alliance is a group of ten Fraunhofer institutes which have decided to combine their expertise in this field. It covers the full spectrum of photocatalytic surface development and offers considerable know-how from a single source"

      "text": "French scientists have transformed the chemical energy generated by photosynthesis into electrical energy. They thus propose a new strategy to convert solar energy into electrical energy in an environmentally-friendly and renewable manner. The biofuel cell thus developed could also have medical applications. These findings have just been published in the journal Analytical Chemistry.\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which plants convert solar energy into chemical energy. In the presence of visible light, carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H20) are transformed into glucose and O2 during a complex series of chemical reactions. Researchers at the Centre de Recherche Paul Pascal (CNRS) developed a biofuel cell that functions using the products of photosynthesis (glucose and O2) and is made up of two enzyme-modified electrodes.\n\nThe cell was then inserted in a living plant, in this case a cactus. Once the electrodes, highly sensitive to O2 and glucose, had been implanted in the cactus leaf, the scientists succeeded in monitoring the real-time course of photosynthesis in vivo. They were able to observe an increase in electrical current when a desk lamp was switched on, and a reduction when it was switched off. During these experiments, the scientists were also able to make the first ever observation of the real-time course of glucose levels during photosynthesis. This method could offer a new means of better understanding the mechanisms of photosynthesis.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers showed that a biofuel cell inserted in a cactus leaf could generate power of 9 W per cm2. Because this yield was proportional to light intensity, stronger illumination accelerated the production of glucose and O2 (photosynthesis), so more fuel was available to operate the cell. In the future, this system could ultimately form the basis for a new strategy for the environmentally-friendly and renewable transformation of solar energy into electrical energy.\n\nAlongside these results, the initial objective of this work was to develop a biofuel cell for medical applications. This could then function autonomously under the skin (in vivo), drawing chemical energy from the oxygen-glucose couple that is naturally present in physiological fluids. It could thus provide power for implanted medical devices such as, for example, autonomous subcutaneous sensors to measure glucose levels in diabetic patients.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nLeading experts in photosynthesis research will discuss tomorrow how understanding the fundamental processes that plants use to turn light into energy is a key way of securing cheap, emission-free energy in the future.\n\nNew scientific discoveries are moving society toward the era of \"personalized solar energy,\" in which the focus of electricity production shifts from huge central generating stations to individuals in their ...\n\nScientists at Michigan State University have identified a new protein necessary for chloroplast development.

      "text": "IBM develops promising contender for cheaper solar cells\n\nFeb 11, 2010 by Lin Edwards\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Solar cells could make fossil fuels virtually redundant if they were cheaper, but their use of rare elements and complex manufacturing processes makes them expensive. Now IBM Research has developed a prototype solar cell that solves both problems, using common, cheap elements and using an inexpensive manufacturing process. Their paper is published in the Advanced Materials journal.\n\nThe new photovoltaic cells are known as \"kesterite\" cells, which are produced using a printing technology in which a solution containing nanoparticles is spin-coated onto a glass substrate. According to IBM their efficiency is close to that of established solar cells.\n\nIBM researcher David Mitzi, who is also manager of the company's photovoltaic science and technology department, said they wanted to reduce the cost and use more abundant elements for thin-film photovoltaic cells. The current technology uses the rare elements indium and tellurium. Indium is in particularly short supply because it is also used in the manufacture of transparent transistors and is in high demand for flat panel display systems. By contrast IBM's kesterite cells uses the common elements tin (Sn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), selenium (Se), and sulfur (S).\n\nThe new solar cells are also cheaper to manufacture, using a \"printing\" technique that uses a hydrazine solution containing copper and tin with nanoparticles of zinc dispersed within it. The solution is then spin-coated and heat treated in the presence of selenium or sulfur vapor. This process is much cheaper than the traditional manufacturing process, which uses an expensive vacuum-based technique.\n\nA team at the Nagaoka National College of Technology in Japan produced a thin-film kesterite cell in 2009, which had an efficiency of 6.8 per cent. IBM's kesterite cell has increased the efficiency by 40 per cent. Mitzi said they are planning to increase the efficiency above 11 per cent, which is equal to or better than the traditional solar cells.\n\nSolar cells contribute under 0.1 per cent of the Earth's electricity supply at the moment, largely due to their expense and the rarity of their key elements. The IBM solar cell could change all of that. IBM will patent and license the technology and says it is open to partnerships with existing photovoltaic cell manufacturers to bring it to the market. little problem - hydrazine is extremely toxic, even in aqueous solution.\n\nFrom  Hydrazine is highly toxic and dangerously unstable with autoignition temperature 24-270 C. It means, it can be easily ignited even at room temperature or a bit higher.\n\nAlso wrom Wiki: \"On February 21, 2008, the United States government destroyed the disabled spy satellite USA 193 with a sea-launched missile, reportedly due to the potential danger of a hydrazine release if it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere intact\"\n\nThey even destroy satellites, containing hydrazine fuel, before they reach the Earth atmosphere. How can solar cell, containig such material, be called a \"green tech\"? Pb and Cd are a way less dangerous but they aren't used in modern electronics due to RoHS requirements (at least in EU).Do you understand anything about the manufacturing of semiconductors as is done today, all over the world, Zarp? Some of the chemical compounds located in fabrications are deadly at 1:1000000 concentrations to large amounts of people if dispersed into a local water supply.\n\nThey know what they're doing in these places. OSHA and other regulations make sure that containment and transportation of these chemicals happens in redundantly safe manners. You on the other hand, obviously have no clue.At the risk of sounding foolish, toxicity is overrated IMHO. Develop an effective containment plan and stick to it. Screen workers. Move forward.\n\nOr HF acids, sulphuric acid, pure arsenic, phosphorus, and the like used in ion implanters as dopants? I know those very well, I spent 20 years as an ion implant field service engineer. I'll take my chances with the hydrazine. Or how about the gold deposition process using cyanide?\n\nThanks for the interest in this work! If anyone would like to know more about the science behind this story (and it sounds like a lot of you might do!) we've set the original research paper as free to access; you can find it here: \n\n\"They even destroy satellites, containing hydrazine fuel, before they reach the Earth atmosphere.\"\n\nActually, the US destroyed the spy satellite because it was a BRAND-NEW SPY SATELLITE, not because it contained hydrazine. There was no way they could risk a foreign government getting their hands on any part of it...\n\nHydrazine is used in the on board power units of the F-16....how many hundreds of those would you say are scattered around the world these days? How often are you hearing horror tales of dozens, hundreds or thousands mained or killed by hydrazine accidents daily...oh thats right...it isnt happening that often is it...\n\nThat sattilite would have never reached ground with any hydrazine left...That could not have been the reason for destroying it...but was a convienent cover story wasnt it?\n\nPoint, hydrazine has it's dangers, but when used under proper conditions by trained personnel it presents minimal risk. Any good safety officer could set up the operation to minimize those risks and have approperate emergency response in place to deal with the situation when things go all pear shaped.\n\nWow, a exceptional achievement. With other manufacturers claiming $1 a watt soon, This may drive solar panels to $.5 a watt. I'll be energy self sufficient (as long as I have nano-technology to store energy doing the day).\n\nHydrazine is safely used in closed production cycle and most of residue will decompose during subsequent thermal treatment. In life environment hydrazine is oxidized rapidly to harmless nitrogen. In fact it's quite environmentally clean fuel and reducing agent, commonly used as oxygen scavenger in boiler feedwater to inhibit corrosion. A huge amount of hydrazine is used in semiconductor industry already and nobody cares about"

Its aim is to master the basic science involved, and develop applications that can be scaled up for commercial use.\n\n\"The sun is by far the largest source of energy available to man, but we must find a way to cheaply capture, convert and store its energy if we are to build a complete clean energy system,\" said Nathan Lewis, a Caltech chemist who will serve as director of the sun-to-energy research collaboration, called the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis.\n\nScientists acknowledge the formidable challenge of creating tiny devices that will mimic the microscopic inner workings of one of nature's more intricate processes — photosynthesis. Plants are able to absorb sunlight, water and carbon dioxide, and in a marvel of nature's ingenuity, yield oxygen and carbohydrates that fuel most life on Earth.\n\nBut instead of yielding a simple carbohydrate, artificial photosynthesis would be designed to create oxygen and liquid fuels such as hydrocarbons or alcohols that could be directly pumped into\n\nvehicles, without additional, costly refinement.\n\nIt's not a new quest, but the modest successes thus far have been confined to basic research labs, many steps from practical applications. The techniques also sometimes have required rare, expensive materials that would make any ultimate commercial scale-up impractical. But advances in nanotechnology, a field in which the Berkeley lab excels, make the development of artificial photosynthesis far more realistic.\n\nPhotosynthesis \"happens on the nano scale,\" said Paul Alivisatos, director of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. \"There's really a new environment with all the nanotechnology that's been developed.\"\n\nWith nanotechnology, scientists can create \"nanowires\" that are one-1,000th the size of a human hair, along with elements like nanocrystals. These tiny machine parts are designed to replicate photosynthesis on a scale closer to what happens inside a leaf.\n\nCan human ingenuity finally master this complex process?\n\n\"Oh yes, totally. This is doable,\" Alivisatos said. \"The problems that we face are really specific technical ones that can be worked out.\"\n\nThe Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis is one of three \"Energy Innovation Hubs\" funded by the Department of Energy to develop breakthrough technologies in energy production and efficiency. In May, the Energy Department announced the selection of Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee as a hub for developing breakthroughs in nuclear power. A third hub, which hasn't been selected, will work on innovations in energy-efficient buildings.\n\nThe five-year artificial photosynthesis project will get $22 million in funding this fiscal year, and $25 million per year for the remaining four years, subject to Congressional approval.\n\nRep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, said that it would create 100 new jobs, not including construction and other contract jobs. It also engages the work of an estimated 200 scientists statewide. Other universities involved in the artificial photosynthesis hub include SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory at Stanford, UC Berkeley, UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine and UC San Diego.\n\nThat joint effort among researchers around the state is critical to the project's success, Alivisatos said.\n\n\"I think it's essential really, because it's a very complex process with many, many parts to it,\" he said. \"It's a classic example of a problem that needs to have a team approach to it"

They could boost the efficiency of display screens and lead to decorative solar panels or energy-efficient billboards. Credit: Jay Guo\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- A new kind of screen pixel doubles as a solar cell and could boost the energy efficiency of cell phones and e-readers. The technology could also potentially be used in larger displays to make energy-harvesting billboards or decorative solar panels.\n\nJay Guo, a professor in the University of Michigan's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, has developed the reflective photovoltaic color filter device that can convert absorbed light to electricity. The research is newly published in the current print edition of ACS Nano.\n\nIn traditional LCDs, less than 8 percent of the backlight actually reaches a viewer's eyes. The rest is absorbed by color filters and polarizers, Guo says.\n\n\"This absorbed light is totally wasted,\" he said. \"It becomes heat. You can feel it if you put your hand close to a monitor. Why not try to harvest some of this energy?\"\n\nThat's just what he has done. Guo's new filter can convert to power about 2 percent of the light that would otherwise be wasted. This could add up to a significant amount in small electronics, he says.\n\nThe researchers created the new filter by adding organic semiconductor solar cells to an elegant and ultra-thin color filter, similar to what Guo's lab had created over a year ago. That filter is composed of nano-thin sheets of metal with precisely spaced gratings that act as resonators, trapping and reflecting light of a particular color. The color depends only on the amount of space between the slits.\n\nAt just 200 nanometers thick, the new filter is 100 times thinner than traditional colorant-based filters—a feature that would be attractive for use in future ultrathin colored display devices.\n\nThe paper is titled, \"Photonic Color Filters Integrated with Organic Solar Cells for Energy Harvesting.\" The university is pursuing patent protection for the intellectual property.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nIn a step toward more efficient, smaller and higher-definition display screens, a University of Michigan professor has developed a new type of color filter made of nano-thin sheets of metal with precisely ...\n\nUniversity of Michigan scientists have created the smallest pixels available that will enable LED, projected and wearable displays to be more energy efficient with more light manipulation possible and all ...\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- We've all worried about the charge on our smartphone or laptop running down when we have no access to an electrical outlet.

      "text": "(Phys.org)—It may sound counterintuitive that replacing one of the most photosensitive solar cell materials with a material with less desirable photosensitive properties can improve the solar cell's efficiency, but that's what scientists have shown in a new study. By replacing the highly photosensitive titanium dioxide (TiO2) with alumina (Al2O3) in a solution-processable solar cell, the researchers have achieved a record power conversion efficiency of 10.9%. They attribute this high efficiency to the Al2O3 acting as an inert scaffold, forcing the electrons to remain within and be transported through an extremely thin absorber (ETA) layer.\n\nThe researchers, led by Henry J. Snaith at the University of Oxford in the UK, with coauthors from the University of Oxford, Toin University of Yokohama in Japan, and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Ibaraki, Japan, have published their study on the highly efficient solar cells in a recent issue of Science.\n\n\"This is a new technology, so in essence a new record,\" Snaith told Phys.org. \"All solar cell technologies have different efficiencies, with GaAs being the highest at over 28%. This is not an absolute world record, but probably the highest for a solution-processable solid-state solar cell. And the real excitement is where it may reach over the next few years; it should have a steep improvement curve.\"\n\nThe choice of electrode material in a solar cell is one of the most important factors contributing to solar cell efficiency, and TiO2 is often used as an electrode material in solution-processable solar cells due to its good ability for photoexcitation, or converting photons into electrons, as well as its strong electron-accepting properties when photosensitized with a dye or absorber.\n\nBut in order to improve solar cell efficiency, the scientists here addressed the fundamental energy losses that arise throughout the photovoltaic process of absorbing photons and generating electrons. As they explain, energy is lost during the photogeneration of electron-hole pairs (excitons), the separation of tightly bound excitons, and the extraction of free electrons from highly disordered networks.\n\nIn attempts to overcome these losses, previous research has investigated the use of coating an ETA layer, 2 to 10 nm in thickness, on the internal surface of the TiO2 electrode in order to increase the current density and voltage. So far, solar cells with ETA layers have achieved power conversion efficiencies of up to 6.3%.\n\nHere, the researchers have investigated the possibility that TiO2 may be hindering the effectiveness of the ETA layer due to its electronic disorder and low mobility. Because Al2O3 is a wide band gap insulator, the researchers found that, when it's used as the electrode, the photoexcited electrons remain in the ETA layer and do not drop to lower energy levels in the oxide as they do in the TiO2 electrode.\n\nThis difference offers several advantages. For instance, the researchers found that using Al2O3 significantly speeds up the electron transport process, forcing electrons to quickly travel through a perovskite ETA layer, and also increases the voltage. These improvements increased the power conversion efficiency from 8% with the TiO2 electrode to 10.9% with the Al2O3 electrode. Because the Al2O3 is mainly acting as a meso-scale scaffold, and does not play a role in photoexcitation, the researchers call this device a \"meso-superstructured solar cell\" (MSSC).\n\n\"The alumina is acting as a scaffold for the perovskite layer, and subsequently the hole-conductor which is coated on top of the perovskite layer,\" Snaith said. \"It is not electronically active, but purely acting as a physical support.\n\n\"It is very surprising and would not have been predicted,\" he added. \"However, in hindsight we can see where the efficiency gains come from. The real surprise is that the perovskite layer is so effective at transporting charge and generating high photovoltage in the solar cell.\"\n\nThe scientists expect that the efficiency can be further improved in the future by various means, such as experimenting with new perovskites, using other semiconductors, and extending the absorption range.\n\n\"This work moves low-cost solution-processable solar cells significantly closer to the performance of perfectly crystalline semiconductors, while at the same time opening extensive possibilities for future research and development,\" Snaith said.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nSolar energy is one of the most promising forms of renewable energy, but the high cost of conventional solar cells has so far limited its popularity.

From what I can tell, even though it cannot be used as a reliable constant baseload energy source, it works on a domestic level for individual homes. To boo it altogether seems as little Luddite-ish. I would have edited my previous comment but I ran out of time.\n\nIf they increase solar cell 300% they will be close to a coal power plant.\n\nComparing this efficiency to burning a lump of coal does no good for the point you are trying to make. That is everyone should want energy to be relatively cheap. Like many \"green\" sources, solar PV is more expensive than conventional existing electricity production for most cases, especially in dealing with the nagging problems of night and shortened winter or cloudy days. Yet better & cheaper solar is a needed part of an overall energy plan, even if this one finds it's home primarily in our electronic \"toys\".\n\nNot to worry - in a few years, there will be so much demand for graphene that there will be a carbon shortage. Coal-fired power plants will be selling their exhaust to the highest bidder, the climate will change back(??), and the AGW crowd will need to find a new God to worship have"

People in the scientific community aren't sure this group of Nigerian teenage girls will be the next laureates, though. They're also pretty suspicious that the magical mystery fuel that will save planet Earth is urine.\n\nLet's back up a second. This week a group of Nigerian teens unveiled a urine-powered generator at Maker Faire Africa in Lagos. (Maker Faire Africa is kind of like a science fair but hipper. They even have a hacking category.) But seriously, these girls say they've found a way to turn pee into electricity. Made of a store-bought generator, a makeshift battery, a couple of water purifiers, a rusty old propane tank and a lightbulb, their invention can evidently provide six hours of electricity with only a liter of urine. It's unclear if other liquids will do the job, but clearly these girls know how to win some headlines. There's nothing like human excrement to get the blogosphere's attention!\n\nUnfortunately for the girls, the attention they've attracted is not very positive. Put simply, a lot of folks think the pee-powered generator is bunk. On one hand, this is what you get for inventing an unbelievable invention. On the other hand, it sort of sounds like the critics are right. Strikingly little is known about the pee-powered generator beyond what Maker Faire Africa has published on its website and without a video, seeing the thing in action is something that's left to our imaginations. From the photos of the device, though, one commentator broke down the process and pointed out some problems.\n\nThe machine is supposed work by filtering urine into water pure enough for the hydrogen to be extracted. That hydrogen is what powers the internal combustion engine in the generator that produces electricity. The only problem with this workflow is that it's been widely proven that it takes more energy to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen atoms than the resultant hydrogen fuel is able to produce. This is why the fabled water-powered car project never really got off the ground. The choice of urine as a fuel, as we said before, seems a bit arbitrary, since urine is 95 percent water and the remaining ingredients are just a mixture of urea and minerals that don't really have any of the properties of a useful fuel. Furthermore, if these teenage girls were even able to extract the hydrogen using spare parts, the machine itself would be incredibly explosive and unsafe. Maker Faire Africa actually admitted that this is the case. For more details on what's wrong with the machine, just check out the comments on their website. They're remarkably thorough.\n\nSo maybe urine isn't the fossil fuel replacement we've been waiting for. But we should at least give these girls a hand for building something so sophisticated for the science fair. Even if it doesn't work, it sure looks impressive! And if it doesn't work, they can always just drink their extra fuel. That definitely works."

These groundbreaking new battery technologies have many excited about what's in store for the battery industry in the years ahead, clearly evidenced by this article found on CNN's home page.\n\nOf note in the CNN article is the work of Angela Belcher of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This past April, Dr. Belcher and her team of scientists released a study showing that they could genetically engineer viruses to build both the positively and negatively charged ends of a lithium-ion battery.The new type of battery would come in the form of a thin film, and would be capable of charging anything from hybrid electric videos to laptops, iPods, and cellular phones. Not only would the bio-virus battery perform equal to or better than the standard lithium-ion batteries available on the market today, they would also be a much more environmentally friendly alternative.\n\n\"We're letting biology help us work on solving those problems, solving what the next-next generation batteries are going to be,\" said Dr. Belcher. \"Because the viruses are living organisms, we had to use only water-based solvents, no high pressures and no high temperatures…..We're using a biological template that's already on the nanoscale.\"\n\nThe future is bright for nanotechnology an the battery industry as a whole.

Credit: Pacific Northwest National Laboratory\n\nTwo core technologies developed at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory - a fuel desulfurization system and a fuel reforming system - were instrumental in the demonstration of an electric power system operating on JP-8, a fuel commonly used in military operations.\n\nPortable fuel cell power units are quieter, more efficient and have lower emissions than standard diesel generators, but are challenged when used with JP-8 fuel because of its sulfur content. The fuel desulfurization and reforming systems developed at PNNL reduce the sulfur content of JP-8 and generate a hydrogen stream compatible with an integrated fuel cell.\n\n\"Running a noisy, hot generator in a war zone is inefficient and can give away your position,\" said Dale King, project manager at PNNL. \"Not running it can leave you without power for communications and other critical systems.\"\n\nAlthough currently under development for military use, the desulfurization and reforming technologies can be used with different liquid fuels to provide portable power almost anywhere that small size and high performance are important. Researchers at PNNL are also extending the desulfurization technology for use with diesel fuel.\n\nThe fuel cell-centric auxiliary power unit is modular and can be reconfigured for a wide range of uses. Researchers envision the technology being used to supply auxiliary power and heat for long-haul commercial trucks, which would replace the need to run less efficient internal combustion engines while the vehicle is stopped. Battelle, which operates PNNL for DOE, operated a prototype system demonstrating these technologies during the three-day 2007 Fuel Cell Seminar this fall. During the demonstration, an integrated 5-kilowatt electric power system successfully powered area lights and a commercial refrigerator.\n\nA unique catalytic hydrodesulfurization process developed by PNNL removes sulfur from the JP-8 fuel using syngas as the co-reactant in place of hydrogen. Gas phase operation of the process allows for a significant increase in throughput and decrease in operating pressure compared with conventional technology. The process doesn't require consumables or periodic regeneration. The system was developed with funding from the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center.\n\nFuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce electrical energy with water and heat as by-products. The process is clean, quiet and highly efficient - potentially up to three times more efficient than internal combustion engines. Envisioned benefits include reduced emissions, increased reliability, multi-fuel capability, durability and ease of maintenance"

Credit: Zhi Wei She, Stanford\n\n(Phys.org)— The cathode also maintained a high level of performance after 1,000 charge/discharge cycles, paving the way for new generations of lighter, longer-lasting batteries for use in portable electronics and electric vehicles.\n\nThe research was led by Yi Cui, a Stanford associate professor of materials science and engineering and a member of the Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Sciences, a SLAC/Stanford joint institute. The team reported its results Jan. 8 in Nature Communications.\n\nLithium-ion batteries work by moving lithium ions back and forth between two electrodes, the cathode and anode. Charging the battery forces the ions and electrons into the anode, creating an electrical potential that can power a wide range of devices. Discharging the battery – using it to do work – moves the ions and electrons to the cathode.\n\nPrevious attempts to make sulfur cathodes using bare sulfur or simply coated particles could not prevent the dramatic reduction of energy-storage capacity as the lithium-sulfur intermediate compounds (polysulfides) created during charging broke free and dissolved away.\n\nFor some 20 years, researchers have known that sulfur could theoretically store more lithium ions, and thus much more energy, than today's cathode materials. But two critical disadvantages prevented its commercial use: When lithium ions enter a sulfur cathode during discharging, they bond with sulfur atoms to create an intermediate compound that's important for the cathode's performance; but this compound kept dissolving, limiting the cathode's energy-storage capacity. At the same time, the influx of ions caused the cathode to expand by about 80 percent. When scientists applied protective coatings to keep the intermediate compound from dissolving, the cathode would expand and crack the coating, rendering it useless.\n\nCui's innovation is a cathode made of nanoparticles, each a tiny sulfur nugget surrounded by a hard shell of porous titanium-oxide, like an egg yolk in an eggshell. Between the yolk and shell, where the egg white would be, is an empty space into which the sulfur can expand. During discharging, lithium ions pass through the shell and bind to the sulfur, which expands to fill the void but not so much as to break the shell. The shell, meanwhile, protects the sulfur-lithium intermediate compound from electrolyte solvent that would dissolve it.\n\nEach cathode particle is only 800 nanometers in diameter, about one-hundredth the diameter of a human hair.\n\n\"It basically worked the first time we tried it,\" Cui said. \"The sulfur cathode stored up to five times more energy per sulfur weight than today's commercial materials.,\" he said. \"Even without optimizing the design, this cathode cycle life is already on par with commercial performance. This is a very important achievement for the future of rechargeable batteries.\"\n\nFunding for the project came from the DOE Office of Basic Energy Sciences through SLAC's Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program, which directs a percentage of the lab's funding to high-risk, high-payoff research that, if successful, can lead to future program opportunities. Researchers have found a way to incorporate silicon into the structure of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which are used to power a wide variety of portable electronic devices, including"

You may have seen it before, whether you knew it or not, as it can grow on every continent but Antarctica and flourishes in drought and rocky terrain. That makes it an ideal candidate for cheap, locally-available dyes for solar cells. That's why researchers at Wake Forest University believe this hearty little berry may be the secret to affordable solar power in the developing world – -regions often rife with drought and lack of fertile land for agriculture.\n\nIn a new variant of dye-sensitized solar cells, researchers at WFU's Center for Nanotechnology and Molecular Materials found that applying a layer of pokeberry dye to their fiber-based solar cells increased light absorption and subsequently improved cell performance. The group wants to ship their fiber substrate to parts of Africa, Asia and other poor areas. There, pokeberries could easily be grown and harvested for use, and local workers could apply the dye themselves. Shipping without the dye saves money on materials and labor here, where it is expensive, and provides jobs and cheaper solar power there, where both are much needed.\n\nThe Wake researchers are the first ever to apply for a patent on fiber-based solar cells. The cells are created by stamping plastic fibers onto long, plastic sheets, forming millions of minuscule plastic \"cans\" that trap light and convert it to electricity. These \"canny\" fibers can produce up to twice as much power as current flat-cell technology and work even more efficiently when a purple pokeberry dye is added. Because the \"canny\" fibers create more surface area than flat solar cells, they can absorb light at any angle, from sunrise to sunset, further increasing electricity production.\n\nFiberCell Inc., a spin-off company created by those involved at Wake Forest, has already been given license to develop manufacturing methods for producing this new solar cell. The plastic sheets the cells are stamped onto are light and flexible, providing easy production and even easier shipping, as the solar cells could simply be rolled up and shipped to developing nations. Workers at local plants would spray on the cheap, abundant dye and prepare the cells for installation.\n\nThe word is still out on numbers like conversion efficiency, degradation and other important data."

Credit: California Institute of Technology\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- New scheme would use only sunlight, air and water to supply energy for cars, laptops, GPS systems.\n\n\"At the California Institute of Technology, they're developing a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars.\"--President Barack Obama, Jan. 25, 2011\n\nThe Sun is Earth's primary energy source and harnessing its abundant light is the Holy Grail of renewable energy\n\nNow, a group of scientists has demonstrated a new way to use sunlight, water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2)--some of the cheapest and most commonplace stuff on Earth--to make unlimited amounts of fuel to power almost anything, anywhere.\n\nThe method uses concentrated heat from the sun to convert water and carbon dioxide into hydrogen (H2) or carbon monoxide (CO). Large amounts of these two gases could be combined to make liquid fuel that fits into America's existing energy economy.\n\n\"Alternatively, you could use the H2 and CO to make methane (natural gas) for a gas-fired electricity generator,\" said Sossina Haile, professor of Materials Science and of Chemical Engineering at California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \"Or, because the fuels we produce are so pure, they could be easily used to run fuel cells, which generate power very efficiently.\"\n\nThe ETH-Caltech solar reactor for producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide from water and carbon dioxide via the two-step thermochemical cycle with ceria. Credit: California Institute of Technology\n\nThe researchers say one of the most exciting things about the discovery is its versatility. \"We are not dictating to the user what the energy infrastructure should be,\" Haile said. \"We are making solar energy easy to use by putting it into a form that our industry is used to seeing and making it available on demand.\"\n\nDoing the two-step\n\nScientists have long known how to convert water and carbon dioxide into hydrogen and carbon monoxide. But to do it cheaply and efficiently enough to make the process affordable on a wide scale has been the issue. Part of the problem was the need for expensive and rare elements, such as platinum or iridium, to act as catalysts that encourage the conversion to happen.\n\nSo Haile and her team took a novel approach; they tried ceria, a material used in the walls of self-cleaning ovens. Ceria is the oxidized or \"rust\" form of the element cerium, which is more abundant, and therefore cheaper, than other metals that could do the same job.\n\nThe new method requires two steps, the first at high temperature using concentrated heat from the sun (about 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit), and the second at a much lower temperature.\n\nHaile describes the process this way, \"If we heat ceria up, the material 'naturally' releases some oxygen from its structure. If we then cool it back down, those oxygen vacancies want to be refilled. In other words, the ceria 'exhales' oxygen at high temperature and then 'inhales' it back when the temperature is lowered.\"\n\nTo make fuel, the second step requires the presence of water and carbon dioxide gases. \"At lower temperatures, the cerium, the hydrogen and the carbon all want the oxygen, but the cerium wants it most,\" Haile said. \"So the oxygen vacancies in the ceria are filled by stripping oxygen from H2O and CO2, leaving H2 and CO.\"\n\nAn international collaboration\n\nHaile and her Caltech team, supported by an award from the National Science Foundation, recently published a paper describing the breakthrough in the journal Science. For this project, they collaborated with researchers led by Aldo Steinfeld, a renewable energy technology professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, also called ETH Zürich, in Switzerland. Steinfeld also leads the Solar Technology Laboratory at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.\n\nThe ETH-Caltech solar fuel reactor uses concentrated heat from the sun to create fuel from water and carbon dioxide. Credit: California Institute of Technology (Caltech) Jointly owned by California Institute of Technology and ETH Zurich\n\nTwo pieces of equipment were needed for the experiment. The first piece, built at Caltech, is a reactor \"just a bit smaller than a gallon-jug,\" Haile said. The reactor is basically a cylindrical container lined with ceria that has input and output lines for the gases.\n\nThe second piece is a solar concentrator, which is the most difficult part to build. The concentrator is basically a set of giant curved mirrors that gather sunlight from a wide area. For this experiment, the researchers were able to use an existing solar concentrator located at the Paul Scherrer Institute.\n\nThe Caltech scientists took their reactor to Switzerland and attached it to the bottom of the concentrator, allowing the sunlight to heat up the ceria inside. Then they piped steam and carbon dioxide into the reactor and measured the hydrogen and carbon monoxide gases flowing out.\n\nCheaper and more efficient\n\nHow far reaching could this new technology be and how much oil, gas or coal could it replace?\n\n\"The abundance of cerium means that this approach could have a significant impact on our national energy budget,\" Haile said. Because cerium is 100,000 times more abundant than the precious metal platinum, she said, the cost would be many orders of magnitude smaller.\n\nFor this experiment, the efficiency of the reactor at converting sunlight to usable energy measured just under one percent, which Haile said is comparable to other methods. However, this was a first cut, aimed at simply proving that the process is practical and could be done economically.\n\nBefore bringing the technology to market, Haile said, the reactor design needs to be much tighter to get better efficiency.\n\n\"As a second step, it will be important to develop materials with even better characteristics than ceria,\" she added.\n\n\"Ideally, one wants a material with a smaller temperature swing required as this will also increase efficiency,\" Haile said. \"In addition, if both the high and low temperatures can be lowered, the overall system lifetime will be improved. Better materials could result in a better process.\"\n\nRelated StoriesResearchers at the California Institute of Technology have discovered that ceria (or cerium dioxide) is an excellent catalyst for fuel cell anodes.

An internal reaction in those tanks would create hydrogen from water and 350 pounds worth of special pellets.\n\n\"No extra room would be needed,\" Woodall said, \"and the added weight would be the equivalent of an extra passenger, albeit a pretty large extra passenger.\"\n\nThe hydrogen would then power an internal combustion engine or a fuel cell stack.\n\n\"It's a simple matter to convert ordinary internal combustion engines to run on hydrogen,\" Woodall said. \"All you have to do is replace the gasoline fuel injector with a hydrogen injector.\"\n\nHow it works\n\nHere's how it all happens: Hydrogen is generated spontaneously when water is added to pellets of the alloy, which is made of aluminum and a metal called gallium.\n\n\"When water is added to the pellets, the aluminum in the solid alloy reacts because it has a strong attraction to the oxygen in the water,\" Woodall said. \"No toxic fumes are produced.\"\n\nThis reaction splits the oxygen and hydrogen contained in water, releasing hydrogen in the process.\n\nAn electrical and computer engineering professor, Woodall first discovered the basic process while working as a researcher in the semiconductor industry in 1967.\n\n\"I was cleaning a crucible containing liquid alloys of gallium and aluminum,\" Woodall said. \"When I added water to this alloy — talk about a discovery — there was a violent poof. I went to my office and worked out the reaction in a couple of hours to figure out what had happened. When aluminum atoms in the liquid alloy come into contact with water, they react, splitting the water and producing hydrogen and aluminum oxide.\"\n\nThat research led to advances in cell phones, solar cells, optical-fiber communications and light-emitting diodes, and earned Woodall the 2001 National Medal of Technology from President Bush.\n\nIn recent years, Woodall built a team of Purdue electrical, mechanical, chemical and aeronautical engineering students to fine-tune the process.\n\nCost speed bumps\n\nThe Purdue Research Foundation holds title to the primary patent. And a startup company, AlGalCo LLC, has received a license for the exclusive right to commercialize the process.\n\nBut there are some speed bumps on the highway to hydrogen.\n\nWith internal combustion engines, the cost of recycling the aluminum oxide must be reduced to make the process competitive with gasoline at $3 a gallon.\n\n\"Right now it costs more than $1 a pound to buy aluminum, and, at that price, you can't deliver a product at the equivalent of $3 per gallon of gasoline,\" Woodall said.\n\nThat cost could come way down, he figures, if the recycling is done with electricity from nuclear power plants, wind turbines or even solar power plants if economically viable. The aluminum oxide and gallium would be shipped to such plants, using electrolysis to break the oxide back down to aluminum, Woodall said, \"and we start the cycle all over again.\"\n\nIf used in fuel cells, the process would be economically competitive with gasoline, Woodall noted. \"Using pure hydrogen, fuel cell systems run at an overall efficiency of 75 percent, compared to 40 percent using hydrogen extracted from fossil fuels and with 25 percent for internal combustion engines,\" Woodall said.\n\nBut the fuel cell systems themselves are still much more expensive and less reliable than internal combustion engines. \"When and if fuel cells become economically viable, our method would compete with gasoline at $3 per gallon even if aluminum costs more than a dollar per pound,\" Woodall said.\n\nFunding speed bump\n\nFor Woodall, the biggest speed bump lies elsewhere. \"The egos of program managers at DOE are holding up the revolution,\" he told MSNBC.com.\n\n\"Remember that Einstein was a patent examiner and had no funding for his 1905 miracle year,\" Woodall added. \"He did it on his own time. If he had been a professor at a university in the U.S. today and put in a proposal to develop the theory of special relativity it would have been summarily rejected.\n\n\"Likewise, since I won my National Medal of Technology for compound semiconductors and not making hydrogen, DOE does not recognize me as a member of the club.\" As evidence, Woodall said DOE last summer rejected two \"pre-proposals\" for funding, \"i.e., I was not invited to send in full proposals on my work.\"\n\nPatrick Davis, who heads the DOE hydrogen program, said he could not immediately comment. \"We are in the middle of our annual program review (offsite, with 1000 attendees), so a vetted response through our press office is not possible until next week,\" he told msnbc.com in an e-mail remove an article we posted with the same title; which tells us he may have something to hide.

That is to say, in order to build H2 fuel cells for electric vehicles, or other such applications, scientists have to first purify the chemical, which takes a lot of time and money to do at the moment. Now, researchers at the Northwestern University (NU) have managed to create a new class of porous materials, capable of separating hydrogen from the most complex gas mixtures, which ensures a faster production speed and a better quality.\n\nThe new device is shaped like a honeycomb, and has the best possible effectiveness in separating H2 from carbon dioxide and methane researchers have ever seen. Chemist Mercouri G. Kanatzidis and postdoctoral research associate Gerasimos S. Armatas, both from the NU, have basically developed a totally new way of obtaining hydrogen from various mixtures, while at the same time skipping numerous side-steps that conventional chemical processes require.\n\n\"A more selective process means fewer cycles to produce pure hydrogen, increasing efficiency. Our materials could be used very effectively as membranes for gas separation. We have demonstrated their superior performance,\" Kanatzidis, who is the senior author of the new research and also the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry at the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, explains.\n\n\"We are taking advantage of what we call 'soft' atoms, which form the membrane's walls. These soft-wall atoms like to interact with other soft molecules passing by, slowing them down as they pass through the membrane. Hydrogen, the smallest element, is a 'hard' molecule. It zips right through while softer molecules, like carbon dioxide and methane, take more time,\" the researcher adds.\n\nThe study, published online in the February 15th issue of the journal Nature Materials, also shows that the new device has the potential to successfully separate hydrogen from a mixture composing three other gases, namely carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane. This brings hope that filters made by this new blueprint could one day be installed at smokestacks used by coal- and oil-powered electrical plants, in a bid to reuse as much energy as possible."

      "text": "Stretchable Batteries Could Power Devices Embedded In The Body [Video] — March 1, 2013\n\nTwo years ago, Nokia made waves when it displayed a concept phone using a flexible OLED display. Samsung and Ericsson have shown similar prototypes. So flexible devices and displays are on the market horizon. But they're still just a first step toward a new class of future devices that can not just flex, but actually stretch – so they can be safely and comfortably implanted in the body, for example.\n\nSo what is the prognosis for these \"stretchable\" devices? One piece of the puzzle has recently been developed in a partnership between Northwestern University and the University of Illinois: a stretchable lithium-ion battery.\n\nThe \"Stretch Armstrong\" of Batteries\n\nIt took Yonggang Huang and John A. Rogers, from Northwestern and University of Illinois, respectively, six years to develop a cordless power supply that was versatile enough to be used in stretchable electronics, particularly devices used inside the human body.\n\nFinally, they were able to come up with \"pop-up\" technology that allows the circuits to bend and twist. Typically, circuits inside of batteries are rigid, but creating bridges using metal wiring to connect the elements gives the circuits the ability to stretch and flex along with any device. The power in the metal bridges works its way through the circuits to power the battery.\n\nIn a video (below), Huang and Rogers demo the battery by hooking it up to an LED light and slowly stretching it out. The battery was able to reach about 300% of its original size and still provide power. Once stretched, the battery can regain its original size without damage to the circuits.\n\nIts life span is about 20 charging cycles – and it can be recycled just like any other lithium-ion battery. Due to its small size, it can hold a charge for only eight to nine hours, but the battery charges wirelessly using coils that induce charging through an external source. This makes it ideal for use in medical devices embedded in the body.\n\n'Flexible' And 'Stretchable' Are Distant Cousins\n\nIt seems like a stretchable battery would be attractive for the flexible device market, but Huang says the two aren't as alike as one would think. In an email to ReadWrite, Huang said that while the OLED displays from Nokia and Samsung are flexible, they aren't stretchable.\n\n\"Flexible means the device could be bent or twisted, which essentially requires the device to be very thin. Stretchable represents a more challenging type of mechanics, which requires that the device must accommodate a large strain deformation, including not only bending, twisting, but also stretching and compressing.\"\n\nThe two could possibly go hand in hand, say in a nifty new watch design from a well known tech giant, but successful flexible devices will require more than mere flexibility. As mobile devices become more and more like physical attachments, they will have to move like our own skin, stretchy and flexible.\n\nA report from Bloomberg News about the possible Apple iWatch says that it may take about three years to be able to develop glass flexible enough to curve or even wrap around someone's wrist. While Apple and others work on making flexible mobile devices a reality, they may also want to take a look at adding some stretchiness to the product development."

      "text": "Hydrogen combined with oxygen creates chemical reactions producing thermal (direct combustion reaction, ex.: in the endothermic motors) or electrical energy (electrochemical reaction, ex.: fuel cell).\nIn both processes the reaction rejects are exclusively steam and heat.\nThe fuel cell is an electrochemical device combining a fuel (hydrogen) and an oxidant (oxygen) to generate electrical energy, having as by-products demineralised water (steam) and heat (60- 80°C ).\nThe first person who experimented with a primordial structure of fuel cell was William Robert Grove (1811-1896), professor of physics, who demonstrated that it was possible to extract electrical energy from two electrodes (anode and cathode) separated by an electrolyte in which hydrogen and oxygen circulate.\n\nW.R Grove, father of the fuel cell\n\nCELL TYPE \"PEM\" (SPFC – PEFC) PEM cell (Proton Exchange Membrane) is also called SPFC (Solid Polymer Fuel Cell) or PEFC (Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell) and it is composed by a proton membrane and two carbon electrodes where a catalyst is sedimented (platinum or its alloys).\n\nIt is widely used for small systems and it is the easiest type, however it is very delicate and hydrogen has to be pure at 99%, a quantity of carbon monoxide of more than 1% would damage the catalyst in a permanent way.\n\nThis type of cells works at a temperature from 60 and 100°C , a characteristic which facilitates its use compared to other available technologies.\n\nPEM cells were experimented for the first time during the first space programmes in the sixties and nowadays they are preferred in electric tractions applications (cars and buses), thanks to their high power density, the absence of corrosion problems, the speed of cold start (less than 1 minute).\n\nAnother application of the PEM cells is the stationary systems for the energy production.\n\nCELL TYPE \"PAFC\" PAFC cell (Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell) uses a liquid electrolyte composed mainly by sulphuric acid soaked in an amorphous matrix in silicon carbide. Electrodes can be in gold, titanium and carbon while platinum is used for the catalyst.\n\nHere are the main characteristics of PAFC cell:\n\n• Temperature between 150 and 220°C ;\n• 40% of efficiency;\n• Cogeneration possibility (for no industrial uses);\n• Ripe technology for the development of small and medium systems for the electrical generation and cogeneration;\n• High tolerance to CO2. This is why it is possible to supply the cell with impure hydrogen and no purified reforming gases.\n\nPAFC technology has the same problems of some other technologies of liquid electrolyte cell: corrosion and evaporation of the electrolyte. However, thanks to the research on the materials, PAFC cells are very promising for their use in medium systems supplied by natural gas. In fact, in those systems where a high efficiency but also a low environmental impact are important (commercial buildings, big hotels, hospitals, telecommunication plants), PAFC cell is at the moment an optimum solution.\n\nElectrodes are in nickel: the cathode is in lithium nickel oxide and the anode is formed by nickel and a small percentage of chrome.\n\nThe cells type MFC have the following characteristics:\n\n• No need of precious metals as catalysts, thanks to quicker reaction kinetics;\n\n• More flexibility in the use of more fuels thanks to the possibility of supply the cell directly through natural gas or light distillates without external reforming process;\n\n• possibility of cogeneration thanks to the high functioning temperature, proper to industry\n\n• the efficiency can reach: > 45% or 60-70% in combined cycles with turbine.\n\nThe high temperatures and the high corrosivity of the electrolyte create some problems of structural stability to the components of the cell.\n\nThis is why MCFC technology has some difficulties to be spread. However, the most promising use of MCFC cells are the electrical energy generation and cogeneration systems with sizes from 250kW to 20 – 30MW.\n\nFunctioning of MCFC cell\n\nCella tipo \"SOFC\" In the SOFC technology (Solid Oxide Fuel Cell) the electrolyte is in ceramic material (stabilized zirconia with yttrium oxide), the cathode is in lanthanum manganite doped with strontium and the anode is a cermet in nickel oxide and zirconia.\n\nHere are the main characteristics of SOFC cells:\n\n• all the components are of solid state, this is why there are no corrosion and evaporation problems;\n\n• high efficiency, 50% for small systems and 70% for systems with turbines application exploiting the high functioning heat of the cells to produce energy;\n\n• no need of external reforming process, SOFC cells can be supplied with natural gas, carbon gas and all the oil derivatives;\n\nThe start up time is quite long, some minutes, so that SOFC cells are interesting for applications where the functioning is continuous.This technology too has some problems: the deterioration of the materials and their assembling. However, it is the only technology which can be highly competitive in the market both for small (2kW) and big plant (15 – 20 MW).\n\nCELL TYPE \"DMFC\" DMFC cell (Direct Methanol Fuel Cell) is similar to PEM cell as both technologies use polymeric membranes as electrolyte and porous electrodes with catalyst in platinum or in its own alloys.\n\nDMFC cells work at high temperatures between 70 and 100°C having an electrical efficiency of about 35%.\n\nThe main characteristic of DMFC technology is that the cell can be supplied directly by pure methanol, without reforming processes."

      "text": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel combustion are major contributors to global warming. Since CO2 comes from fuel, why can't we recycle it back into fuel rather than releasing it into the atmosphere? An economical way to synthesize liquid fuel from CO2 would help mitigate global warming while reducing our need to burn fossil fuels. Catalysts that induce chemical reactions could be the key to recycling carbon dioxide, but they need to have just the right activity level—too much, and the wrong chemicals are produced; too little, and they don't do their job at all.\n\nRecycling CO2 into alcohols such as methanol (CH3OH) or ethanol (C2H5OH) by adding hydrogen would be sustainable if the hydrogen were produced by a renewable technology such as solar-thermal water splitting, which separates the hydrogen and oxygen in water. But synthesizing fuel by CO2 hydrogenation requires a catalyst, and the most successful catalysts so far have been rhodium compounds. With a spot price averaging more than $4000 an ounce over the last five years, rhodium is too expensive to be practical on a large scale.\n\nMolybdenum (\"moly\") sulfide is a more affordable catalyst, and experiments have identified it as a possible candidate for CO2 hydrogenation; but bulk moly disulfide (MoS2) only produces methane. Other metals can be added to the catalyst to produce alcohols, but even then, the output is too low to make the process commercially viable.\n\nNanoparticles, however, often have higher catalytic activity than bulk chemicals. Designing moly sulfide nanoparticles optimized for alcohol synthesis would depend on finding answers to basic questions about the chemical reaction mechanisms.\n\nMany of those questions were answered in a paper featured on the cover of the March 25, 2010 special issue of the Journal of Physical Chemistry A devoted to \"Green Chemistry in Energy Production\" (Figure 1). In this paper, Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) chemist Ping Liu, with collaborators YongMan Choi, Yixiong Yang, and Michael G. White from BNL and the State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook, used density functional theory (DFT) calculations conducted at BNL and NERSC to investigate methanol synthesis using a moly sulfide nanocluster (Mo6S8) as the catalyst instead of the bulk moly sulfide powder used in previous experiments.1\n\n\"This study might seem like pure research, but it has significant implications for real catalysis,\" Liu says. \"If you can recycle CO2 and produce some useful fuels, that would be very significant. And that's what DOE has always asked people to do, to find some new alternatives for future fuel that will eliminate the environmental footprint.\"\n\nThe reason bulk moly disulfide only produces methane (CH4) is, ironically, that it is too active a catalyst. \"Catalysts are very tricky materials,\" Liu says. \"You don't want it too active, which will break the CO bond and only form methane, an undesired product for liquid fuel production. If the catalyst is too inert, it can't dissociate CO2 or H2, and do the trick. So a good catalyst should have the right activity to do this catalysis.\"\n\nFrom DFT calculations run using the VASP code on 16 to 32 cores of NERSC's Franklin system, Liu and colleagues discovered that the Mo6S8 nanocluster has catalytic properties very different from bulk MoS2. This is not surprising, given the different geometries of the molecules: the cluster has a more complex, cagelike structure (Figure 2). The cluster is not as reactive as the bulk—it cannot break the carbon–oxygen bond in CO2—and therefore it cannot produce methane. But, using a completely different reaction pathway (Figure 3), the cluster does have the ability to produce methanol.\n\n\"In this case, the nanocluster is not as active as the bulk in terms of bonding; but it has higher activity, or you could say higher selectivity, to synthesize methanol from CO2 and H2,\" Liu explains.\n\nFigure 3. Optimized potential energy diagram for methanol synthesis from CO2 and H2 on a Mo6S8 cluster. Thin bars represent the reactants, products, and intermediates; thick bars stand for the transition states. The geometries of the transition states involved in the reaction are also included (Mo = cyan, S = yellow, C = gray, O = red, H = white).\n\nFigure 3 shows the details of the reaction pathway from carbon dioxide and hydrogen to methanol and water, as catalyzed by the Mo6S8 cluster, including the intermediate states, energetics, and geometries of the transition states—all of which were revealed for the first time by this research.\n\nThis detailed understanding is important for optimizing the catalyst's efficiency. For example, lowering the energy barrier in the CO to HCO reaction would allow increased production of methanol. Adding a C–C bond could result in synthesis of ethanol, which is usable in many existing engines. Both of these improvements might be achieved by adding another metal to the cluster, a possibility that Liu and her theorist colleagues are currently working on in collaboration with Mike White, an experimentalist.\n\nThe goal of catalyst research is to find a \"Goldilocks\" catalyst—one that does neither too much nor too little, but is \"just right\" for a particular application. By revealing why a specific catalyst enables a specific reaction, studies like this one proved the basic understanding needed to design the catalysts we need for sustainable energy production.\n\nFor more information about computing sciences at Berkeley Lab, please visit: \n———————————"

      "text": "Feb 19, 2008\n\nPurdue University engineers have developed a new aluminum-rich alloy that produces hydrogen by splitting water and is economically competitive with conventional fuels for transportation and power generation.\n\nThe researchers had earlier discovered that slow-cooling and fast-cooling the new 95/5 aluminum alloy produced drastically different versions. The fast-cooled alloy contained aluminum and the gallium-indium-tin alloy apparently as a single phase. In order for it to produce hydrogen, it had to be in contact with a puddle of the liquid gallium-indium-tin alloy.\n\n\"That was a very exciting finding because it showed that the alloy would react with water at room temperature to produce hydrogen until all of the aluminum was used up,\" Woodall said.\n\nThe engineers were surprised to learn late last year, however, that slow-cooling formed a two-phase solid alloy, meaning solid pieces of the 95/5 aluminum alloy react with water to produce hydrogen, eliminating the need for the liquid gallium-indium-tin alloy.\n\n\"That was a fantastic discovery,\" Woodall said. \"What used to be a curiosity is now a real alternative energy technology.\"\n\nThe research is partially funded by Purdue's Energy Center at the university's Discovery Park.\n\n\"This technology has exciting potential, and I hope that it receives a fair and detailed evaluation and consideration from the scientific, government and business communities,\" said Jay Gore, the Vincent P. Reilly Professor of Mechanical Engineering and interim director of the Energy Center.\n\nThe slow-cooling technique made it possible to create forms of the alloy containing higher concentrations of aluminum.\n\nThe Purdue researchers are developing a method to create briquettes of the alloy that could be placed in a tank to react with water and produce hydrogen on-demand. Such a technology would eliminate the need to store and transport hydrogen, two potential stumbling blocks in developing a hydrogen economy, Woodall said.\n\nThe gallium-indium-tin alloy component is inert, which means it can be recovered and reused at an efficiency approaching 100 percent, he said\n\n\"The aluminum oxide is recycled back into aluminum using the currently preferred industrial process called the Hall-Héroult process, which produces one-third as much carbon dioxide as combusting gasoline in an engine,\" Woodall said.\n\nThe aluminum splits water by reacting with the oxygen atoms in water molecules, liberating hydrogen in the process. The gallium-indium-tin alloy is a critical component because it hinders the formation of a \"passivating\" aluminum oxide skin normally created on pure aluminum's surface after bonding with oxygen, a process called oxidation. This skin usually acts as a barrier and prevents oxygen from reacting with bulk aluminum. Reducing the skin's protective properties allows the reaction to continue until all of the aluminum is used to generate hydrogen, Woodall said.\n\n\"This skin is like an eggshell,\" he said. \"Think of trying to fry an egg without breaking the shell.\"\n\nThe researchers developed the new alloy in late 2007 and are reporting about it for the first time during the conference.\n\n\"We now have a simple process for making 95/5, and we know the process splits water and produces hydrogen until all of the aluminum alloy is used up,\" Woodall said.\n\nFor the technology to be used in major applications such as cars and trucks or for power plants, however, a large-scale recycling program would be required to turn the alumina back into aluminum and to recover the gallium-indium-tin alloy.

But a team of scientists at UCLA has come up with a new spin on the practice, using a branch of applied physics that didn't even exist 40 years ago.\n\nOne of the main obstacles to greater use of renewables is the fact that the cheapest forms of renewable energy, solar and wind, don't offer power 24/7.

      "text": "Semprius, a startup company manufacturing tiny concentrated solar cells that forgo any cooling systems has achieved a truly amazing leap in solar cell efficiency. The company was able to hit 33.9 percent efficiency with their solar panel, the first time a commercially-viable solar technology has passed the one-third mark.\n\nSemprius's solar cells use gallium arsenide, rather than silicon, which is able to absorb sunlight and dissipate heat far better. The solar panel that scored this major efficiency record is made up of hundreds of these tiny cells that are about the width of a pen-drawn line. Lenses atop the cells concentrate sunlight 1,000 times.\n\nTo capture a better chunk of the solar spectrum, Semprius uses three layers of gallium arsenide, each one tweaked to convert a different part of the spectrum into electricity. Silicon solar cells, by contrast, only absorb a narrow band of sunlight and have efficiency rates that typically fall somewhere in the sub-15 percent area. The record for silicon cell efficiency is 22.9 percent and the previous record for commercial-level solar technology was 32 percent.\n\nPossibly the greatest thing about the Semprius solar panel is that it's not some far distant future technology. It's been designed to be commercially produced and a factory opens this summer to start manufacturing the cells.\n\nStanford University researchers are working on a wireless EV charging technology that could eventually lead to highways that automatically charge vehicles as they drive over them. Such a technology could lead to a basically infinite range for EVs.\n\nThe wireless power transfer that the scientists are working on uses magnetic resonance coupling. Two copper coils are placed a few feet apart and tuned to resonate at the same frequency. One coil is connected to an electric current that generates a magnetic field that causes the other coil to resonate. This process leads to an electric current being transferred invisibly from the first coil to the second.\n\nPrevious studies have found the technology to be safe. The current is only transferred between the two in-tune resonators. People or objects standing near or between the coils would not be affected at all and even with obstacles in between, the two coils will still transfer the current without interruption.\n\nMIT researchers have already been working on a stationary version of this technology for EV charging that transfers 3 kW to a parked car, but the Stanford researchers are taking the concept and modifying it to transfer 10 kW over a distance of 6.5 feet, or enough to charge an EV cruising down the highway. A series of coils connected to a current would be embedded in the highway with a receiving coil installed on the bottom of an EV. The receiving coils would resonate as the car drove along the road, continuously feeding the battery.\n\nAfter running different mathematical models, the researchers figured out that a coil bent at 90 degrees and attached to a metal plate can transfer 10 kW to a twin coil 6.5 feet away. They say the efficiency of this wireless power transfer is 97 percent!\n\nThe researchers have filed a patent and will now move on to testing it in labs and then in real-world driving conditions to make sure it's completely safe and doesn't have any negative affects on other cars or drivers. Check out a video explaing the technology above.\n\nRising temperatures around the world are affecting many food crops and according to a new study done by a Stanford University scientist, wheat will be particularly vulnerable.\n\nDavid Lobell looked at nine years-worth of images captured by the MODIS Earth-observation satellite to analyze the growing season of wheat in the Ganges plain of India. What he found was that in the years with higher average temperatures, the wheat fields turned brown earlier meaning that they were no longer growing.\n\nPrevious studies have predicted that wheat yields would fall by about 30 percent by 2050 in places like India, but Lobell thinks that realistic yield losses could be about 50 percent greater than existing models show. That's a scary figure since other studies have shown a need for wheat yields to increase by 50 percent in order to feed a growing global population.\n\nOne solution is breeding for wheat plants that have bigger roots and are less stressed by dryer and warmer conditions. Another option is to breed for plants that are slower growing and can be planted earlier in the season. That way the wheat could be harvested before the high spring temperatures while retaining its hardiness. Scientists are already working on these solutions, but either approach will need to have a breakthrough soon to keep up with growing demand and warming temperatures.\n\nLast year was the ninth warmest year on record (since 1880). Global average surface temperatures has continually risen since 1950, when the average global temperature was 0.92 degrees F (0.51 C) cooler than in 2011.\n\nAn updated video compiled by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies illustrates this warming trend in colorful detail. Red in the video represents temperatures higher than the average during the 1950 - 1981 baseline period while blue represents temperatures lower than that average.\n\nWhile 2011 was the ninth warmest year, 2010 was the warmest year on record. The difference in average temperature between 2010 and 2011 was 0.22 degrees F (0.12 C). Temperatures may fluctuate slightly from year to year, but, as this analysis shows, the overall trend of rapid warming continues.\n\nThe DOE plans to release additional resource assessments for ocean current, ocean thermal gradients, and new hydropower resources later in the year so that we'll have a full picture of the water power potential in the U.S.\n\nJAN 27\n\nTesla won't be producing its all-electric SUV until 2014, but luckily we'll get a look at the design far sooner than that, though later than originally announced. Tesla is set to unveil the Model X prototype on February 9 at its design studio in California, just a few short days away.\n\nIn a filing with the SEC, Tesla said that it was \"designing the Model X to incorporate the functionality of a minivan with the consumer appeal of a sports-utility vehicle.\" This leaves quite a bit of room to imagine its design. With both the Roadster and the soon-to-be-launched Model S, the carmaker pulled right from the luxury car style sheets. No doubt that the Model X will have that luxury feel too, but it will be very interesting to see what details Tesla will add to set it apart.\n\nEven more importantly, what new performance specs will we get when the prototype is revealed? Check back on February 9 to see what we learn.\n\nNew radar facilities are being installed in Great Britain in order to \"unlock\" large sections of potential wind farm area for development. Because of potential interference, dozens of wind farm projects have been blocked by the Ministry of Defence (MOD). But now, the MOD has tested these new radar systems, and is satisfied that they will not suffer adverse effects from wind turbines.\n\nOne recent installation of a new Lockheed Martin air defense radar has let to the Ministry withdrawing its objection to five offshore wind farms that had been stalled over the issue. Wind farm developers are underwriting the cost of these new radar systems, but that investment could allow them to build as many as 4 gigawatts of additional wind farms.\n\nJapanese home and business owners with solar power installations sold 2,150 GWh of electricity back to their power utilities last year, a huge 50 percent increase over the amount sold back to the grid in 2010. The sellers collectively made a nice $1.2 billion off their surplus electricity.\n\nThe Japanese government has a feed-in-tariff scheme that requires the utilities to purchase the extra power which was small beans compared to the average 884,000 GWh of electricity that those utilities sell to customers per year.\n\nThe government is set to introduce even more subsidies for domestic renewable energy power developers. The new scheme will include electricity from solar, wind, small hydroelectric, biomass and geothermal plants, but only solar panel owners with systems of 10 kW or less will still be able to sell their excess power.\n\nThe study found that the sun's output is likely to decrease until 2100, but that decrease will only lead to a global temperature reduction of 0.08 °C. Compared to the forecasted warming of at least 2.5 °C over the same period from greenhouse gases, a solar activity decline doesn't get us very far.\n\nThe study found that even if the sun's output fell to it's lowest known levels that occurred between 1645 and 1715, global temperatures would still only be reduced by 0.13 °C.\n\nWhile the study's authors concede that their model doesn't fully capture all of the uncertainties in the climate system and solar output, the results do certainly let us know that a decline in solar activity is no match for greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWe love seeing the world's architectural icons retrofitted to become more energy efficient, especially when they're major energy hogs like skyscrapers and huge bridges. Now we have another icon to add to that list.\n\nAs part of GE's Ecomagination initiative and in time for this summer's Olympic games, London's Tower Bridge will be given a green lighting makeover, switching out the street and artistic lighting for more efficient LEDs.\n\nGE is teaming up with London's City Hall, City of London Corporation and EDF to complete the new installations. GE is replacing the existing street lighting with LEDs and more efficient floodlights, which will result in a 45 percent decrease in energy use. For the artistic lighting on the upper level of the bridge, GE is replacing the current neon lighting with its more energy efficient Tetra Contour Cable to light up the towers in multiple colors for the games. LED projector lights will also be installed.\n\nThe new artistic lighting system willl use 40 percent less energy than the previous lighting system."

      "text": "Researchers look towards microbes for renewable energy generation\n\nFinally, after increased utilization of machines and fossil fuels, mankind is slowly getting prepared to face the bare fact that the best remedy lies in nature's lap. Scientists and researchers at the University of East Anglia have figured out that microbes are a source of energy and can be used for producing electricity. They are on the verge of creating power stations wherein bacteria would be tethered to electrodes and harvested for power.\n\nThe team of scientists has proved that bacteria discharge tiny electrical currents from their cells as a by product of the process of converting food into energy. Bacteria could also be subsequently used to convert industrial waste, sewage and uranium waste into electricity because of their nature to degrade waste and pollution.\n\nMicrobes would be an alternative source of energy along the same lines as wind and solar panels, said Dr. Clarke, the researcher behind the concept. He also added that the bio-batteries would give a continuous flow of electricity unlike wind or solar energy, which are dependent on climatic conditions. Two years ago, Dr. Clarke and his colleagues had proved that bacteria survive in anaerobic environments by constructing electrical wires that extend through the cell wall and make contact with a mineral.\n\nAt present, the current generated by tethering bacteria directly to electrodes are too weak to be useful. In their latest research the team has used a technique known as x-ray crystallography, which reveals the molecular structure of the proteins attached to the surface of microbe. These structures, once clearly understood, would be helpful in tethering the microbes more efficiently to the electrodes.\n\nConsidering today's threatening scenario of acute energy crisis and an obtuse amount of pollution, going the green way would obviously be an optimistic thing to opt for. Besides, bacteria were the first ever forms of life to appear on earth. Oxygen or no oxygen, icy chill or fiery heat, they manage their lives well in all conditions. Dr. Clarke and his team has found out the best way to put these magical organisms to the best use ever"

      "text": "Tag Archives: Solar Power\n\nWhat comes to mind when you picture a battery? The familiar Duracell Coppertop AA battery? A clunky automotive battery? The small rectangular battery in your cell phone? Researchers at Rice University are reinventing the concept of batteries and battery packaging by creating a lithium-ion battery with spray paint. That's right, your local neighborhood hoodlum taggers can now be more energy forward than you sitting at home watching Cops.\n\nA team of researchers from Rice University have demonstrated in a paper in Nature Scientific Reports that special \"spray paints\" can be used sequentially to build up the layers needed to form a lithium-ion battery. A spray-on battery could be used on a variety of materials, both rigid and flexible. They point out that the technology could be coupled to energy conversion devices such as solar cells.\n\nSimply put, a lithium-ion battery is created by tightly layering cathodes and anodes like in the image shown below. The researchers at Rice University replicate this cylindrical design in a customizable form using the spray coatings that they developed. They applied the battery painting process to a variety of materials including stainless steel, glass, ceramic tile, and flexible polymer sheets. An SEM image of a cross section of the battery is shown below. Each of the spray painted batteries performed as a typical battery. They even applied the spray paint to a coffee mug to spell out the name of their Alma mater while also storing energy. They added that more complicated surface geometries could be possible using different spray nozzle designs that are tailored to the different viscous properties of the paints.\n\nThe are a few drawbacks to a spray painted lithium-ion battery. For one, the materials are highly toxic, corrosive, and flammable, hence why they are always tightly packaged and hidden away in their conventional form. Secondly, the batteries are highly sensitive to oxygen and moisture. This sensitivity currently restricts their widespread use because they still have to be packaged like their conventional brethren, reducing their novel promise. A spray painted battery is shown below on a glazed ceramic tile alongside its final packaged form. One of the researchers' next steps is to develop a sealing layer to protect the batteries from these elements. Because who wants to paint their electric vehicle with a new battery but then have the painter tell them that they always have to keep the car cover on.\n\nIn one of the most energy rich regions of the world, Abu Dhabi, new energy is being built out for domestic use. However, this oil rich country has been focusing on developing renewable sources of energy. Their new 100MW solar plant will come online this month and electrify up to 20,000 homes in the region. Called Shams 1 after the Arabic word for sun, the project will be the largest solar plant of its type in the world.1\n\nBuilt using a technology called Concentrated Solar Power; this plant uses the sun to super heat liquid to turn steam turbines. Parabolic mirrors focus the sun's light on an oil filled pipe. This super-heated liquid is then passed through water in order to heat and turn into steam. The steam is then passed through a standard turbine with the heated steam being condensed and returned to cycle again. The benefit of this process is the heated oil can be stored in tanks and used when sunlight is not available. This allows for electrical production to be spread out as needed.2\n\nThe solar plant has its own unique complications. Being built in a desert environment, the mirrors accumulate sand and dirt, reducing the ability to produce energy. In order to prevent this from becoming a major issue, automated trucks were developed that cleaned the mirrors and only need one worker walking in front. The truck detects the worker and follows behind cleaning the mirrors. Also taken into consideration is the conservation of water in the dry desert environment. Shams 1 was developed with this in mind with a dry cooling system to prevent water loss. In addition, a good amount of the water used to clean the mirrors is capture and recycled for later use. 3\n\nShams 1 is a joint venture between Total, Abengoa Solar, and Masdar. Developed at a cost of approximately $600M, the plant contains 258,000 mirrors on 768 tracking parabolic troughs. The plant sits on a 2.5 square kilometer field. At full capacity it is expected to power approximately 20,000 homes. The oil rich nation says the cost of the plant will be comparable to electricity generation produced from diesel. The advantage is now that United Arab Emirates is now freed up to sell their natural resources on the international market. This development is part of a larger goal of having 7% of energy production from renewable sources by 2020. The 100 megawatt facility will be approximately 0.5% of the estimated 20 gigawatts of domestic demand in 2020. 1\n\nA recent report by McKinsey & Company, Solar power: Darkest before dawn, is forecasting an annualized drop in the underlying cost of solar PV cells by 10% per year from now through 2020. This continued drop in the cost of solar manufacturing, when combined with a doubling of manufacturing capacity over the next 3 to 5 years, will result in an unprecedented expansion of solar power installation. This mirrors the cost reductions seen over the previous 5 years, where panel prices have declined by approximately 75%, and growth in installed capacity from 4.5 GW in 2005 to 65 GW in 2012.\n\nThis dramatic drop in price has been the result of multiple, incremental improvements in each component of the installed cost of a system [1]:\n\nThis is in striking contrast to the co-incidental drop in the cost of natural gas over the previous decade, where a massive influx of supply due to the breakthrough technologies of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have produced a glut of supply, applying downward pressure on wholesale prices. This precipitous drop in the price of natural gas in North America has led to lower market prices, and lower demand curves for all sources of electricity, including solar.\n\nAs solar continues it's march to grid parity, McKinsey forecasts a price per watt (peak) installed of $1 by 2020. This echos what US Secretary of Energy Stephen Chu has previously predicted:\n\n\"Before maybe the end of this decade, I see wind and solar being cost-competitive without subsidy with new fossil fuel.\"\n\nAdditionally, using a conservative estimate of $2 per watt (peak) installed, McKinsey predicts 400 to 600 GW of capacity installation between 2012 and 2020.\n\nRegardless of the pace of cost reduction, certain applications have reached parity with alternative generation technologies already. For remote installations and isolated grids, solar is already the low-cost option. As prices continue their decline, more and more applications will become attractive, with or without subsidy.\n\nFollowers and investors in one of the world's largest solar panel producers have experienced a continuous stream of bad news since February. First Solar, a global leading producer of thin-film solar cells, has lost nearly half of its market capitalization since the beginning of 2012 and seems to be plumbing new all-time lows every few days [1]. First Solar is not without company in its suffering: its biggest American rival, SunPower Corp, has performed under the S&P 500 for the year as well (though not nearly as badly), and the established solar sector as a whole took a particularly bad tumble in mid-2011 and hasn't yet recovered [1].\n\nMuch of this is likely due to changing market conditions and foreign competition. Over the past few months, much discussion has taken place regarding the Chinese government's role in the selling of solar cells to Western markets, providing subsidies to Chinese manufacturers selling their products abroad in an attempt to undercut Western manufacturers and force them out of business. In late March, the US Commerce Department announced that they had found evidence that the Chinese government had indeed provided impermissible export subsidies to its local manufacturers, and placed small tariffs on solar panels from several Chinese manufacturers in response [2]. There is the possibility for even more punitive tariffs should the Commerce Department decide that Beijing is engaged in dumping practices, which would involve the government heavily subsidizing producers to the degree that they would be able to sell their panels abroad below cost [2].\n\nBut First Solar seems to have special problems, beyond the market conditions that would be affecting its competitors as well. Unfortunately, most of the company's unique problems likely stem from its technology. First Solar is the leading producer of thin-film solar panels using cadmium telluride (CdTe) as its semiconductor material, and produces the most efficient CdTe panels available [3]. CdTe panels, while having less sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiency than some other materials like crystalline silicon, are particularly cheap to manufacture, with First Solar's solar panels being the first to fall below a dollar per watt [4]. This cost advantge has been a boon to First Solar during its life, but some troubling news arose out of its 2011 10-K filing and annual earnings report. In the company's earnings conference call, its then-CEO noted that it had used more money than originally predicted in fulfilling product warranties in 2011 and had alloted additional money to its warranty reserve [5].\n\nThe 10-K filing also noted that the company believed its higher rates of product are failure can be traced to a potentially increased failure rate of its cells in hot climates. It reached this conclusion \"based on technical literature, data that we have developed internally including through accelerated-life testing, our analysis of modules returned under warranty, and our analysis of performance data from systems that we monitor under O&M agreements\" [6]. It should be noted that, given the short short life span of thin-film technology and First Solar's dominance of the market, this is really the first evidence or investigation towards the potential problems of cadmium telluride solar cells in hot climates. If First Solar's suspicions are correct, we may be finding out for the first time that CdTe has a shorter lifespan in hot, sunny weather (where solar would be most appealing anyway).\n\nThis could be some pretty terrible news for First Solar, since its business strategy now focuses entirely on building utility-scale solar installations. During First Solar's rapid growth in the second half of the 2000s, much of its sales and revenue came from its operations in Germany, where the national government heavily incentivized solar power development through the use of a generous feed-in tariff (a type of production subsidy). In 2010, amid many other austerity measures, the German government slashed this subsidy over the protest of domestic and foreign solar cell producers [7]. First Solar took this as cause to focus on building utility-scale projects in hot climates like the American southwest [8], and recently ceased all German manufacturing operations [9]. It was only after expanding out of temperate climates that First Solar found out about their potential problems in hot climates. This potential shortfall in meeting the company's best market opportunity has gotten many investors spooked and concern about its viability [10].\n\nWill this spell the end for the company? At this point, it doesn't look like it. True to its goals in orienting towards utility-scale solar, First Solar has been able to sell projects in Arizona and California to plant operators like NRG Energy and Berkshire Hathaway's MidAmerican Energy [11,12]. It would seem that these investors, at least, are not as concerned about the technology as the stock market seems to be.\n\nOur political leaders have a huge influence in how our population views technologies. The former statement, while laudable, is distilled to the point of necessitating further analysis. While the goal of ubiquitous carbon-free energy sources is certainly worth pursuing, it is vital that we do not discount the carbon footprint entailed in the adoption of those sources.\n\nLet's just take a look at solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. According to [1] and [2], the energy required to make a solar panel (by Siemens-like processes in 2007) was 4354 MJ/m2, which equates to 1210 kWh/m2 of panel produced. If this panel produces about 168 kWh/m2 in a year, then the estimated energy payback time (EPBT*) is about 2.2 years. This is great news. However, if you then consider the carbon footprint of creating this solar panel and divide it over the panel's lifetime (~30 years), the aggregate carbon emissions amount to 32 g/kWh produced. Fortunately, given improvements in technology, this value was expected to drop to 24 g/kWh by the end of 2011. So even though solar panels do not release CO2 during their normal operation (because they don't need fuel to operate), the manufacture of solar panels does have a nontrivial carbon footprint. The upside of the story is that this footprint is still dwarfed by those of coal, oil, and natural gas (see table III below).\n\nSource: [2]\n\nSo far, I've spoken only of the carbon emissions from the manufacture of PV arrays. This is only one side of the CO2 payback time equation. Another vital consideration is the carbon that is displaced by using solar energy in lieu of dirtier energy sources from the existing energy infrastructure — namely, coal and natural gas. To quantify this carbon offset, one must consider both the energy source that would have been used were it not for the solar panel, as well as the amount of power being displaced by the solar panel. Furthermore, the amount of power provided by a panel is a function of both its efficiency (largely driven by technology) as well as the solar panel's environment. For example, according to [3], it would take twice as much time for a panel in the UK than in California to offset the energy used for its production. This is due to California's favorable sunshine conditions of about 1,700kWh/m2 per year, compared to the UK's less favorable 700-900 KWh/m2 of solar energy per year.\n\nSo, in the end, solar power is a lot cheaper in terms of CO2 emissions and this is why I support their adoption. But it is at times appropriate to recall the famous quip from science fiction author Robert Heinlein: \"there ain't no such thing as a free lunch.\"\n\n*\"EPBT is defined as the number of years a PV system must operate before it generates sufficient energy to equal the amount it consumed in manufacturing\" [1]\n\nSolar power is the poster child of the green energy movement. And why wouldn't it be? Fuel that is entirely free, will be around for billions of years no matter what we as humans do, and doesn't pump out nasty pollutants when used. Also, as a bonus, there is more solar power available than the world could conceivably use, roughly 89 petawatts of power [1], that's 89,000,000,000 megawatts.\n\nHowever, harnessing that power proves to be much more difficult than burning wood for a fire. The most common method used to convert solar radiation to useful energy is the photovoltaic effect, which converts photons from the sun directly to electricity and is utilized by photovoltaic, PV, cells. These cells in general do a fairly poor job of collecting the sun's energy. Typically efficiencies are of the order 20%. In the laboratory, ie highly controlled conditions, PV cells have reached efficiencies of over 40% [2]. While the public may see these efficiencies in the future, they are not currently realistic.\n\nWhat is realistic however, is a drop in price of PV cell technology. Last year, Ramaz Naam blogged for Scientific American about a possible Moore's Law effect for solar PV cells [1]. Moore's law originally applies to the doubling of computing power every 18 months, a trend followed by the computer industry for decades. It appears that solar power follows a similar curve, with dropping prices following a logarithmic curve from the 1980's through 2010. Via Naam's prediction, PV cells would reach $1/W in 2023, and could become cost effective, including installation costs, in 2020 [1].\n\nIt seems though that solar power will beat Moore's Law. Today, 2012, PV cell production costs are already approximately $1/W [3]. That's 11 years sooner than Naam's prediction, made only 1 year ago. In addition to dropping to $1/W, improvements in technology and production methods could lead to costs dropping to 50¢/W in the next 10 years. This would put solar power much ahead of the curve, and into the cost effective region for power generation, poised for rapid entry into the energy market.\n\nIt is very difficult to predict when a technology is on the edge of explosion due to innovation, and so a year ago it would have been exceedingly difficult to guess that solar power would go through a revolutionary shift in production techniques, enabling PV cells to be produced at greatly reduced prices. However, it seems as if PV technologies have experienced a massive innovation spike with such ideas as new ways to manufacture silicon with less waste, improved stability in silicon wafers that allow for less of the material to be used, and new designs for solar cells themselves [3]. These technologies are emergent, and will be improved upon as kinks are worked out. However, these advances represent a boom for solar power, and it will continue to ride that wave for many years to come as technologies are perfected and production grows.\n\nWill solar power be part of the future? Most definitely. The amount of grid-connected PV installations grew 39% in just the 3rd quarter of 2011 with over 1 GW installed in the first 3 quarters of 2011 [4]. This growth will continue, especially with recent price drops for PV cells. Will solar power take over the energy sector, and the world? Maybe. There are still many hurdles for solar power to face, an intermittent source being the most serious. But the hurdle keeping away the most investors and customers has been lowered, reducing one of the barriers to clean, cheap, accessible energy for all.\n\nI was able to volunteer at the Cleantech Forum 2010 in late February. There I became familiar with Masdar, the lead sponsor. Masdar is located in the heart of the global oil and gas industry, Abu Dhabi, but it's all about renewable energy and sustainable technology. In short, their mission is to turn Abu Dhabi in to an international hub for renewable energy and support the development, commercialization and adoption of sustainable technologies. Their four integrated business units (Masdar Institute, Masdar Carbon, Masdar Power and Masdar City) are all cutting edge, but I'd like to focus on what they call the \"physical embodiment of Masdar,\" Masdar City.\n\nThe thought is to create a place for innovators and entrepreneurs to test energy science, city design, sustainable development and environmental architecture. The focus is not only on test and design, but also on making an alluring place to live and work. If your creating the city of the future and money is not an object(budgeted at $22 billion), why not reach for the sky? They have!\n\nMasdar City will be powered by 100% renewables, it will be zero waste, zero carbon and it will have a sustainable water system. Transportation, materials, foods…all sustainable. They are going all out and the level of detail is amazing. From the orientation and width of the streets to the wind cones (shown in the Masdar Headquarters photo above) that naturally ventilate interior spaces to the retractable shades (shown below) covering City Plaza, nothing was overlooked.\n\nTransportation is beneath the city, leaving the ground level open for pedestrians. The transportation system includes a light rail and a Personal Rapid Transport (PRT) system that a transports up to 4 adults to any PRT station at the touch of a button.\n\nThe Masdar Institute of Science and Technology(MIST), developed in cooperation with MIT will be at the heart of the R&D in Masdar City. It will eventually be home to 600 master's and PhD students, with over 100 faculty members. MasDar City with also be the home of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) headquarters and host operations for companies like GE and BASF.\n\nThey are currently in Phase One of seven, which focuses on MIST. This means that first residents will be students testing new technologies, while being test subjects themselves. I would encourage you to learn more about Masdar City.\n\nUsing solar radiation for energy / electricity generation is certainly a great idea. In terms of solving current CO2 production (if current concerns prove true), eliminating environmentally devastating coal mining operations and a dependence upon a depleting supply of raw crude oil, it's almost one of those stupid simple solutions that somehow we've neglected for hundreds of years, even though it was there, shining on us each day. A strong case to support using direct solar energy (versus, say, fossil fuels) can be made quickly and easily, and might go something like this:\n\nSince this number is hard to calculate, lets simplify it to the favor of fossil fuel: E = E_ecosys * E_burning and electrical generation, taking E_ecosys as 2% and E_burn and electrical generation = 60% we find:\n\nE_fossil fuel electrical generation : <<1.2%\n\nSo, use the sun's energy with 15% eff, or 1.2% eff? The choice seems obvious. Best of all, using the direct method is FREE! You don't have to pay to mine, process, transport and burn the fossil fuel, you just have to collect solar radiation! But wait, everyone knows you are not supposed to used the \"F\" word, because the \"F\" word violates one of the few time tested truths of humanity \"there is no such thing as a free lunch\". But what does using the sun cost, and why do some (Ken Zweibel, James Mason and Vasilis Fthenakis) suppose that the US could solely rely on solar electrical generation by as early (or late) as year 2100?\n\nThe cost of solar is land, because the issue at hand is energy density. Though expectantly much less environmentally damaging than say, coal mining, solar harvesting requires an unheard of amount of land for el. gen. Coal and oil mining undoubtedly occupy many thousands of square miles in the U.S. and the world over, but likely less than an equivalent area capable of producing the same energy content via direct solar el. gen. This is a bold statement, solar would use more land than coal and oil mining? But there is so MUCH solar energy, how could this be?! 4500 quadrillion BTU's (4500,000,000,000,000,000) of solar radiation is dumped down on just the southwestern United States every year (Zweibel et. al.)! Or almost 45x MORE energy than the U.S. uses each year! So the answer is simple, just cover 1/45th of the southwest United States with solar technology like PV cells and trough / Rankin systems! And voilà, the world's (or at least the U.S.'s) problems are solved- besides constructing a nation wide grid and the pesky and relentless enormous necessity of land! Complaints aside, how much land will be required for the U.S. to be direct solar dependent? Using a current U.S. energy consumption of 100 quads per year, and a 15% solar to electricity conversion efficiency, and a 6.5 kWh/m^2 / day solar intensity in the southwest we need:\n\nTherefore, at a minimum, we would need something on the order of 33,000 square miles, which is on the order of magnitude of the size of a large state, every square inch of an entire state! Surprisingly, the proponents of the \"Solar Grand Plan\", by Zweibel et. al., determine through presumably more realistic calculations that an overwhelming 165,000 square miles is actually required to support the U.S.'s energy needs. Now like I said at the beginning, solar is very attractive for many reasons, but can we expect it to be feasible to cover 165,000 square miles? That is this big, by the way (orange):\n\nand would be even larger if you wanted the ground to receive sunlight so that plants could grow, or you wanted a city every so often within this massive area for civilization (which the power is for, remember), or you wanted any open space (like a park or forest) to get away from the dense arrays of solar collectors or panels. At any rate, it just intuitively feels infeasible to cover such a vast expanse of land with equipment for solar power electricity generation. Don't get my wrong, I support the use of solar, but I am unsure if it is feasible for the United States to rely 100% on solar energy power production due to the shear square miles required.\n\nLastly, the cost of building something of this magnitude is said to be in the $400B range, and would require national policy, not unlike the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, but maybe more direct in assisting construction. Alternatively, a $.05/kWh tax could pay for the construction says Zweibel et. al., which seems reasonable- and also leading to my conclusion that it's not the cost of building solar facilities, but the cost of land usage that will prevent the \"free\" fuel from succeeding at supplying 100% of the U.S.'s energy needs.\n\n\"The dots to which our energy beams are directed…are cold and hard and human beings like myself live upon their surfaces — many billions of them. Our beams feed these worlds energy drawn from one of those huge incandescent globes that happens to be near us. We call that globe the Sun and it is on the other side of the station where you can't see it.\"\n\nSpeaking to his incredulous robot, the protagonist in the Isaac Asimov story \"Reason\" explains the basic functioning of Solar Station #5, a space-based solar power station in geosynchronous orbit with the Earth. First described by Asimov in 1941, space-based solar power (SBSP) may have moved from the realm of science fiction to reality, receiving interest from government and industry as an emissions-free, renewable energy source with no issues of intermittency or battery storage.\n\nSBSP relies on solar power collection by panels attached to satellites in orbit, from which the energy is wirelessly beamed to the Earth's surface. Since these satellites are stationed outside the atmosphere, virtually uninterrupted collection is possible of a light much more intense than that absorbed on Earth. In the most likely configuration, the host satellite would convert photons into electricity, powering a microwave emitter focused on a collector on the Earth's surface.\n\nSource: NASA\n\nWhile extra-planetary solar arrays and wireless energy transmission have been investigated on an experimental scale, several recent high-profile commitments to SBSP may signal its growing feasibility. In April of 2009, the utility Pacific Gas & Electric contracted with an SBSP provider to buy 200 MW of solar power by 2016. If completed, this project would be the first application of the technology. Last year Japan announced a plan to launch a solar power satellite by 2030, which would transmit power via laser beam. Additionally, in 2007 the US National Security Space Office released a report proclaiming their intention to implement SBSP, referring to it \"as a potential grand opportunity to address not only energy security, but environmental, economic, intellectual, and space security as well.\"\n\nYet since wireless energy transmission from space has never actually been implemented, its viability by 2016 is questionable, hinging on technology constraints and the high cost of rocket launch. High-intensity transmission and terrestrial collection would have to be perfected, and concerns remain about environmental disturbance and safety issues created during transmission, as well as the effects of excessive heat on the solar cells.\n\nIn the prevailing theory, large disassembled solar panel arrays would be launched by heavy-lift rocket to low earth orbit, where they would then be assembled and brought to geostationary orbit by smaller rockets. Even assuming a solar panel mass of 1kg/kW, the minimum cost for a heavy-lift rocket is $11,538/kg, bring the total cost for a 2GW power station upwards of $11.5 billion. Another unlikely option suggested by NASA is to establish a construction site on the moon, where less gravity means cheaper rocket launches (yet initial investment in lunar infrastructure would reached untold billions).\n\nAlthough the near constant stream of high-energy photons available outside the atmosphere is a tantalizing source of energy, the technological impediments and astronomical costs make implementation unlikely, considering the massive risk taken on by any investor. While government and private sector research and funding continues for the technology, SBSP may remain a well-intentioned fantasy."

Even at their small size the tiny cells show the potential to give conventional photovoltaic panels a run for their money. Fabricated from crystalline silicon, the new cells will eventually be less expensive and have greater efficiencies than current photovoltaic collectors that are made with 6-inch-square solar wafers.\n\nThe new cells are fabricated using microelectronic and microelectromechanical systems that give them more applications, improved performance and reduced cost. The team believes that the units could easily be mass-produced using existing fabrication technology and could be used in building integrated photovoltaics, tents, and even clothing. Moreover, these microengineered panels will also have imprinted circuits, intelligent controls, inverters and even storage built at chip level.\n\nWhile the research team has figured out a lot of benefits of these tiny glitter-sized solar cells, the main ones include their ability to continuously generate power if some of the cells in the panel fail. Moreover, since the cells are so small, the shade tolerance of the units to overhead obstructions is better than conventional PV panels since when portions of the new panel are in shade, the other part keeps producing electricity.\n\nThe research team believes that a widely used commercial tool called a pick-and-place machine can be used to assemble up to 130,000 pieces of glitter cells per hour at electrical contact points pre-established on a substrate. To even increase their energy output, low-cost solar concentrators can be placed on top of each cells making these small cells produce more energy at very affordable cost"

      "text": "Semiconductor uses solar power to take H2 from water\n\nIn what is being touted as ''artificial photosynthesis,'' researchers at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) have devised a technique for coating a cuprous oxide semiconductor so that it can use energy from the sun to take hydrogen from water.\n\nAdriana Paracchino and Elijah Thimsen have engineered photoelectrochemical cells that, when exposed to sunlight, can provide the current needed to drive the chemical reactions that separate hydrogen gas (H2) from water.\n\nAt the simplest level, imagine a piece of something, say a spoon, in a glass of water out in the sun. The idea is that the sunlight will hit the spoon which will in turn cause a reaction so that the water molecules will be split, producing hydrogen (H2 gas, a useful way to store energy that can easily be used as fuel) and oxygen.\n\nBut of course in real life it isn't that simple. That hypothetical illustration will, in reality, just cause the water to evaporate.\n\nSo the ''spoon'' needs to be a special spoon that can use energy from the sun that will, instead of making the water molecules evaporate, make the water molecules split - that is, undergo a chemical reaction. This chemical reaction can be achieved using an electric current.\n\nCuprous oxide (Cu2O), can be used to make that special spoon. It is commonly used in paint and fungicide, and is one of the most studied semiconductors around. It has been known to be photosensitive since 1904. It is also inexpensive and abundant, perfect for a potential silver bullet (errr- silver spoon) for the energy crisis.\n\nHowever, when Cu2O isexposed to water and light, it breaks down and loses it's ability to act as the magic spoon. So Paracchino and Thimsen covered Cu2O with atom-thin layers of zinc oxide and titanium oxide using a technique called atomic layer deposition (ALD) that is commonly used for making memory chips for laptop computers and other electronic devices.\n\nWith the protective layer in place, the Cu2O can harness solar energy and convert it to an electric current that can drive the chemical reactions to make H2 separate from water.\n\nPretty cool. The research ''Highly active oxide photocathode for photoelectrochemical water reduction'' is published in the May issue of Nature Materials. News report interpreting the paper say that the next step is to improve the the electrical properties of the protective layer. They also note that the materials used are widely available and the techniques can easily be scaled up for mass production.\n\nIf this alternative energy technology can be made to work on a large scale soon, it could be the answer to the nuclear energy dilemma"

      "text": "Human Energy\n\nWe are constantly in motion. We walk around, we turn around, and we run around. Whenever we move, we exert energy. What if we could harness that energy and turn it into electricity? We'd have a renewable source of energy, one that doesn't pollute the environment. Better yet, we could charge our bodily electronics (e.g., cellphones) at no cost.\n\nDr. Zhong Wang at the School of Materials Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, is leading a research project that could someday harvest mechanical energy from your motions and turn it into electrical energy for small systems. The research project is based on the development of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which creates electric energy from movement.\n\n\"The triboelectric effect has been around for centuries,\" said Dr. Wang in a phone interview last week. The triboelectric effect is based on having friction between two materials. When that occurs, an electrical charge from one material transfers to the other. That's what happens when you walk across a carpet on a dry day. When you move the two layers apart to form a gap, you create a voltage where the charge density is related to the size of the gap. When an electrode is connected to the materials and to a load, current will flow.\n\nFigure 1 shows the sequence. Figure 2 shows that the output can be connected directly to a load or rectified prior to connection to a load.\n\nFigure 1\n\nWhen the materials are compressed and released, they generate a voltage that, when connected to a load, produces current.The TENG device consists of two \"plates.\" The lower plate is made of aluminum while the upper plate consists of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a sheet of Kapton, and a 500nm SiO2 film applied at 250°C. The difference in thermal expansion between the Kapton and the SiO2 film creates an arch when cooled to room temperature. The arch, whose maximum height is about 0.5mm, compresses under mechanical force and then returns to its original shape when the force is removed.\n\nFigure 2\n\nThe output of the triboelectric device can connect directly to a load, or it can be rectified through a diode bridge (a and c). A loss of power to the load occurs because of losses in the rectifying diodes (b and d).Dr. Wang noted that the triboelectric effect has never before been used to create electric energy from human motion. The energy is a few milliwatts, enough to drive several LEDs. It's inexpensive, scaleable, and \"green.\" The latest published paper,\"Nanoscale Triboelectric-Effect-Enabled Energy Conversion for Sustainably Powering Portable Electronics,\" documents 280V at about 130µA, but the research team has now created devices that generate around 1000V. Because the voltage is so high, contact resistance isn't a problem in transferring the energy to a useful load.\n\nI can imagine devices that you can wear, perhaps in your shoes, that can generate electrical energy with every step. \"Give us a couple of months and we'll report that data,\" said Dr. Wang. He has seen in his lab where using footsteps can energize 600 LEDs. That's enough to power a cellphone. You just need a wire from your shoe to your phone.\n\nDeveloping products that use triboelectric motion to generate useful electrical energy will clearly be some years away. More research is needed, followed by the development of manufacturable TENGs into everyday products. Because of the high voltages, these products will need to protect users from possible shock. That may require the same kinds of protection devices used to protect circuits for ESD events.\n\nHi Martin--I agree there may be lots of great applications. My comment is reacting to the use of the term green in the article. I see this tossed around everywhere these days. Thanks for highlighting an interesting technology to watch for.\n\n@eafpres, I don't think anyone would expect these devices to change our overall power consumption or make the world \"greener.\" Rather, they might provide enough power to accomplish a small task like providing some charging capability or lighting some LEDs.\n\nThe energy has to come from somewhere. Further, if you claim \"greenness\" then you need to take the entire product life cycle into account. Already mentioned might be isues with Kapton; that is possibly overcome by engineering. On the other hand, although this could be convenient, and even preferable for some applications, the potential in shoes might be limited. I estimated:\n\nI enjoy writing about research such as this. If you hear of anything else that you think is applicable here, send us a note to editors@theconnectingedge.com and we'll do the digging. If you're a blogger, think about that for an upcoming blog."

      "text": "AS A POWDER, cadmium sulfide (CdS) was used as a pigment almost a hundred years ago to make bright\nyellow or, when mixed with selenide, bright orange paint.\nCadmium, like lead, is a heavy metal, and CdS paint was\neventually shown to be poisonous. Like the brilliant white\npaint based on lead oxide, CdS paint had to be removed\nfrom walls in order not to poison children.\n\nWe continue to use large quantities of lead in car batteries, sealed up so that it creates no biological hazard. Similarly,\na layer of CdS, well encapsulated, improves the efficiency of\nmany types of thin-film solar cells. These cells are cheaper\nthan silicon (Si) cells and can be made in automated factories. They typically are 100 times thinner than Si cells, consume less material\nand energy during the production process and, unlike silicon, do not need a\nhigh degree of purification.\n\nThe most advanced thin-film cells in mass production are based on cadmium telluride (Cd Te). Hundreds of megawatts of Cd Te modules are already\ninstalled on roofs all over the world. Every one of these cells is coated with a\nlayer of CdS that is a hundred times thinner than a human hair. That layer of\nCdS can nearly double the efficiency of a Cd Te module. Without the coating,\nCd Te modules typically show an efficiency of 8 to 10 percent, depending on\nthe method of production. However, with the thin CdS coating, the Cd Te\nmodule's efficiency increases to more than 15 percent.\n\nWhile this phenomenon has been known for almost three decades, no one\nwas able to figure out why it works. Then, a year ago, when Springer Publishing\nasked me to write two books summarizing my CdS research, I reviewed a lot of\nmy early work, along with cutting-edge CdS/Cd Te research, some not yet published, at the University of Delaware's Institute of Energy Conversion. Bringing\nall this together, I could finally make some sense of why CdS works so well.\n\nDirty semiconductors (those with a lot of impurities and crystal defects)\n\nhave many places where electrons get stuck — we call these\n\"traps.\" When an electron is trapped, it produces an electric\nfield (a \"build-in field\"). You cannot measure these fields\nfrom the outside, but they make all the difference. In a silicon\nsemiconductor, the transition region between two layers\nwith different impurities is called a pn-junction, and it's the\nbasic building block of all transistors. But when accidentally\ninduced by thin-film impurities, random pn-junctions make\nthe solar cell \"leaky,\" allowing electrons to move randomly\ninstead of flowing smoothly toward the conductor.\n\nThe CdS layer plugs this leak, and only CdS can do this.\nThe explanation for this is a little involved, but, to put it\nsimply: When some minute amount of copper is incorporated in CdS (we\ncall this doping), its photoconductivity can be reduced (\"quenched\") by a\nsmall electric field, and that limits the further increase of this build-in field long\nbefore it causes the junction to become leaky. Many other compounds can be\nquenched as well, but the concentration of these intentionally incorporated\nimpurities has to be precisely adjusted, to about 100 parts per million (ppm).\nIf there are too many impurities, the field is limited at much higher values and\ncan cause some junction leakage; if there are not enough, their influence is\nnot sufficient. Now, 100 ppm happens to be the natural limit of saturation\nof copper in CdS. So if too much copper is supplied during production, the\nsurplus is just rejected. So, CdS works by automatic self-adjustment. All other\ncompounds have to be doped artificially to that amount. This is not easy to\nachieve over many square feet of solar cells, and it explains the limited success\nof materials other than copper-doped CdS.\n\nThis process works on many other thin-film solar cells, provided the\n\"junction\" is close enough to the interface with CdS. Copper indium dis-elenide, or CIS, solar cells, containing indium or gallium, are thus improved\nin a similar fashion.\n\nBy KARL W. BöER\n\nKarl W.

A 206, 2665.\n\nAfter Copenhagen:Time To Act Locally\n\nIn the wake of COP 15 in Copenhagen, Bill Becker says, the fate of the planet is in our hands. Becker, executive director of the Presidential Climate Action Project and former central regional director for the U.S. Department of Energy, attended the Copenhagen conference. The five-way informal agreement that emerged between China, India, Brazil, South Africa and the United States, he says, was \"halfhearted, with no binding agreements and no targets.\" \"We can't depend on governments to do the job,\" Becker said. \"When governments and legislatures write climate policy, we inevitably get an agreement that serves the lowest common denominator. This throws the problem back upon us, and on what com- munities, states, corporations and regions can do.\" Becker believes that the United Nations will never forge a treaty with 193 signatories. Instead, he now hopes that the largest-emitting nations and regions will forge bilateral and multilateral agreements to cut carbon pollution.\n\n\"We can hope for multinational agreements that are much more concrete, binding and verifiable than this [Copenhagen] three-pager,\" he said. \"This informal agreement may set a useful example, but it's not a good model in terms of completeness.\" Becker is mildly encouraged by progress at city and state levels. \"There's more renew- able energy potential in state and city commitments than in anything done at the national solartoday.org SOLAR TODA Y March 2010 19"

      "text": "A Battery Made From Bugs\n\nMicrobe queen Angela Belcher and a team of MIT researchers have devised a battery in which viruses built the cathode and anode, which potentially will cut costs and the use of chemicals.\n\nMichael Kanellos: March 31, 2009\n\nIn the future, your car could be built with viruses.\n\nScientists at MIT have concocted a lithium-ion battery in which the cathode and the anode, the positive and negative electrodes that swap charges, were partly put together by genetically modified viruses. It works as follows. The viruses are genetically engineered to secrete specific proteins. In turn, these proteins react to other chemicals in their environment to form structures.\n\nFor the cathode, the viruses were able to first attract and bind iron phosphate and then carbon nanotubes to create a network of conductive material. For the anode, the viruses attracted cobalt oxide and then gold particles to form a nanowire. The anode was developed three years ago, but the cathode and whole battery is new. Building the cathode was more difficult because cathodes need to conduct electricity rapidly. The carbon nanotubes, which conduct electricity faster than metals, help in this regard.\n\nThe prototype battery is a coin battery, but conceivably cell and larger batteries for powering cars could be made from this process. Right now, it can go at least 100 charges before performance tapers off, but that number will increase.\n\nThe idea behind industrial bioengineering is that viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms are really microscopic chemical factories. They eat, and through the metabolic process, subsequently secrete things. Wine, cheese, beer and antibiotics are, in that light, really the waste product of selectively fed and bred microbes. Microbes also work in dank environments, can be produced en masse and disposed of after a long work week. Try doing that to your new college hires.\n\nVarious green companies are tinkering with ways to use bugs on the factory floor as a way to replace energy-intensive processes (like cooking chemicals at high temperatures to produce other compounds) or noxious, fossil fuel based substances. Genomatica, for instance, has devised organisms that can produce chemicals like methyl ethyl ketone (see Genomatica: Microbe-Made Chemicals Could Save Empty Ethanol Plants). Several companies want to make ethanol or synthetic petroleum from bugs. More often than not, these researchers use genetically modified forms of e coli because its genome and ways to modify it are well understood. Many call it the workhorse of biotech.\n\nThe leader on the project is Angela Belcher, the Germeshausen Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and Biological Engineering. Belcher has been one of the leading scientists in exploring ways to exploit microbes and been the recipient of several awards. Some of her work has included devising organisms that secrete chemicals that can help bind insulating layers inside semiconductors or organisms that can detect weak points and stress lines in things like airplane wings. Cambrios Technologies was spun out a few years ago to commercialize some of her inventions. (She got into the field by wondering why abalones can produce hard shells out of what is essentially chalk.)\n\nOthers working on the battery include professor Gerbrand Ceder and graduate students Yun Jung Lee and Hyunjung Yi. Those two were the lead authors on a paper published in Science on the battery.\n\nWhen will cars rely on virus batteries? It could take time. Scaling microorganism production will take time and quite a bit of testing. Carbon nanotube production will also have to be improved. Now, nanotubes are often bought by the gram.\n\nThe team will also look at ways of developing lithium batteries with slightly different cathode chemistries which could be capable of storing more power."

      "text": "Scientists from the University of Southern California have developed a new catalyst for hydrogen fuel cells. The catalyst in made from ruthenium, a rare chemical element derived from platinum. Unlike conventional platinum catalysts, ruthenium is highly resistant to electrolysis, the process through which hydrogen is produced from water. The chemical reactions occurring in fuel cells are quite volatile, putting a enormous strain on the internal components of units. These components wear out over time and need to be replaced, a costly procedure considering the massive expense associated with platinum.\n\nUsing the ruthenium catalysts, researchers have developed a fuel cell that extracts hydrogen from ammonia borane. Previous attempts at using ammonia borane as a viable hydrogen source were met with mild success but each attempt harbored a serious drawback. The process through which hydrogen is extracted from ammonia borane produces caustic chemicals which cause damage to fuel cells. These chemicals speed the rate of deterioration, making fuel cells ultimately unviable for commercial use.\n\nThe ruthenium catalysts, however, can extract hydrogen from ammonia borane, producing only a small amount of harmful chemicals in the process. This gives the fuel cells longevity, which translates into better performance overall. Though the catalyst is derived from platinum, ruthenium is less expensive than its parent element, making fuel cells that use this catalyst more affordable.\n\nResearchers have been seeking alternatives to conventional fuel cell catalysts for several years now. Ruthenium is among the most promising developments in fuel cell development, showing that hydrogen is quickly becoming a viable"

The problem with the\nmaterial is that it more than triples in volume when completely\nlithiated. What's more, as the process is repeated, the\nconstant swelling and shrinking causes silicon to break down.\n\nOver the years, researchers have spent thousands\nof hours trying to figure out way to make silicon more suitable for\nbattery use. This led to the creation of nanostructured silicone\nwith a high surface-to-volume ration which researchers figured\nwould allow the silicon to accommodate a larger volume\nexpansion.\n\nBiswal, lead author Thakur and co-author Michael\nWong, a Rice University professor of chemical and biomolecular\nengineering and of chemistry, opted to go in another direction\ninstead: they etched pores into silicon wafers to give the material\nroom to expand. By early 2012, they had advanced the process to the\npoint of making sponge-like silicon films which showed more promise\nthan other technologies.\n\nThe one thing holding it back was a limitation\nfrom the the manufacturer's standpoint: the material is\nnot as easy to handle when scaled up. So what'd the Rice\ngroup do? They decided to crush the film into a powder, creating\nvery tiny, very porous grains. Doing this, they found, allowed the\nmaterial significantly more surface area to soak up even more\nlithium ions.\n\nPorous silicon is the basis for a robust\nanode for lithium-ion batteries.\n\nTo demonstrate the solution, Biswal held two\nvials, one holding 50 milligrams of crushed silicon, the other 50\nmilligrams of porous silicon powder. The difference is quite\nobvious:\n\nFifty milligrams of the treated powder in\nthe right vial has much more surface area than an identical weight\nof crushed silicon in the left vial.\n\n\"The surface area of our material is\n46 square meters per gram,\" she said. \"Crushed\nsilicon is 0.71 square meters per gram. So our particles have more\nthan 50 times the surface area, which gives us a larger surface\narea for lithiation, with plenty of void space to accommodate\nexpansion.\"\n\n\"As a powder, they can be used in\nlarge-scale roll-to-roll processing by industry,\" Thakur\nsaid. \"The material is very simple to synthesize,\ncost-effective and gives high energy capacity over a large number\nof cycles.\"\n\nFor the curious few out there, the porous\nsilicon powder is mixed with a binder, pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile,\nto offer conductive and structural support.\n\nOutlook\n\nRecently, Thakur designed a half-cell battery\nwith lithium metal as the counter electrode and set the capacity of\nthe anode to 1,000 mAh/g — about a third of its\ntheoretical capacity, but three times better than current\nbatteries. The results were stellar, with the anodes lasting 600\ncharge/discharge cycles at a rate of two hours to charge and two\nhours to discharge.\n\nIn another test, an anode was set to cycle at a\nfive-hour charge and five-hour discharge. It is expected to remain\nat 1,000 mAh/g for more than 700 cycles.\n\n\"The next step will be to test this\nporous silicon powder as an anode in a full battery,\"\nBiswal said. \"Our preliminary results with cobalt oxide\nas the cathode appear very promising, and there are new cathode\nmaterials that we'd like to investigate.\""

      "text": "Transparent solar cells could make windows into a power source\n\nOver the past few years, the U.S. has already become a growing player in the solar energy industry, with states like New Jersey and California seeing solar panels cropping up on rooftops from houses to warehouses.\n\nThe UCLA group, led by professor of materials science and engineering Yang Yang, has further developed a new breed of solar technology known as polymer solar cells, which rely on complex large molecules to absorb light and transform it into an electrical charge.\n\nPolymer solar cells offer a variety of interesting potential advantages over traditional crystalline silicon solar cells, or even thin-film solar cells made from elements like gallium or amorphous silicon.\n\nChief among these advantages is that polymers, a broad category of molecules that encompasses plastics and a range of other natural and synthetic substances, can be specifically tailored to target certain attractive traits.\n\nIn general, this has meant creating lighter-weight, more flexible solar cells than the heavy, rigid crystalline silicon allows. But Yang's team also focused on creating polymers that would pointedly target infrared light instead of the visible spectrum that gets absorbed by most traditional solar panels.\n\nWhat resulted was a thin film that incorporates transparent polymers capable of absorbing entirely invisible parts of sunlight along with a mesh of fine silver nanowire that serves as the one electrode for the device and a layer of titanium dioxide as another. According to Bloomberg, these wires are only around 0.1 micrometers thick.\n\nSpreading solar as far as possible\n\nThis new type of solar cell offers a wide range of interesting possibilities for the future of solar power, highlighted first and foremost by the idea that every building could be designed with south-facing windows that would absorb some amount of electricity without impeding peoples' views.\n\nIf the process were made cheap or ubiquitous enough, such windows could conceivably be installed throughout a building, absorbing infrared from the surrounding landscape.\n\nThese types of applications would not necessarily require huge renovations either, simply requiring owners to apply the film on top of the existing glass window.\n\n\"It's my dream that everyone's window can be a solar panel in the future,\" Yang told Bloomberg. \"It could be potentially very cheap.\"\n\nHowever, windows are not the only possible application for this technology. Transparent solar cells could also be applied to all sorts of consumer electronics, helping to recharge batteries with wasted energy from the backlight even as the devices are in use.\n\n\"These results open the potential for visibly transparent polymer solar cells as add-on components of portable electronics, smart windows and building-integrated photovoltaics and in other applications,\" said Yang.\n\nImproving cost-benefit picture\n\nOne of the biggest knocks against solar power is that it is generally not cost-effective at current electricity prices, but that picture has been steadily improving as the technology improves and efficiencies rise.\n\nBy emphasizing making these solar cells transparent, the UCLA team took a step back on efficiency going from between 10 and 20 percent for most on-market technologies, depending on which technology customers choose, to around 4 percent.\n\nHowever, the group has already tested similar technologies that could bring that number as high as 11 percent, in the range currently on the market. Yang told Bloomberg he hopes to eventually reach a cost of between $10 and $15 per window, with even cheaper spray-on applications possible for large-scale manufacturing."

      "text": "Dec 16, 2010\n\nTogether with Italian researchers, Swiss ETH Zurich Professor Hansjorg Grutzmacher and his group have developed a novel organometallic fuel cell. In addition to generating electrical energy, it also produces fine chemicals from renewable raw materials – with no waste.\n\nHansjörg Grützmacher holds a rectangular device made of transparent plastic, a little bigger than a fist. There is a rectangular recess on the front and two connections protrude from the top, one gold-coloured, the other silver. Two oversized-looking clamps hold together the two halves that make up the device. What you cannot tell from looking at this device is that it is the prototype of a novel so-called organometallic fuel cell, which Grützmacher's group has developed in collaboration with an Italian research team.\n\n\"This fuel cell won't solve the world's energy problems,\" says the ETH Zurich professor, \"But I think the fact that it can be used to make fine chemicals from renewable raw materials with no waste products is an enormous step forward.\" The new fuel cell's achievement is really extraordinary. Firstly, it allows fine chemicals to be manufactured with no waste, while secondly it also generates CO2-free electrical energy. The aim of an environmentally friendly chemical industry must be to produce chemicals while creating less waste products or none at all, because according to Grützmacher, some of the these may be rather toxic and their disposal is therefore expensive and problematic.\n\nThe operating principle of the new organometallic fuel cell is entirely different to that of previous types. It is based on a special molecular complex containing the metal rhodium. This complex is molecularly embedded in the anode material. The anode of a fuel cell absorbs liberated charges and transfers them to the cathode, which releases them again. This process generates an electric current. The special feature of the organometallic fuel cell is that the molecular complex in the anode acts as a catalyst and its function can easily be optimised. The anode's support material is carbon powder, to which the molecular complex is applied as a fine dispersion.\n\nThe active catalyst forms and changes progressively while the chemical reaction is taking place in the fuel cell. As a result, various catalysts specific to the individual reaction steps are formed from the metal complex. Thus an alcohol such as ethanol is converted into a corresponding aldehyde, and in the next step it is turned into the corresponding carboxylic acid, e.g. acetic acid. However, the use of this special catalyst enables not only alcohols but also sugars such as glucose to be transformed. The raw materials, i.e. the alcohols used, can be natural fermentation products or by-products from bio-diesel manufacture.\n\nThe chemists already knew that such reactions were possible. However, in these reactions Grützmacher and his colleagues needed to use a \"sacrificial molecule\", which \"absorbs\" the hydrogen molecule formally created in the reaction. The inspirational idea to bypass this problem occurred to the ETH Zurich professor and his Italian colleague Claudio Bianchini while they were picking olives in Tuscany: an electrode, the anode, could be used instead of the sacrificial molecule to absorb the charges from the reaction and to convert them directly into electricity.\n\nHansjörg Grützmacher thinks the organometallic fuel cell has great potential. In an experimental context, for example, 1,2-propanediol, a dialcohol obtained from renewable raw materials, could be converted very selectively into lactic acid. Lactic acid is produced industrially on a large scale for use in the manufacture of biodegradable polymers. The only problem is that for every ton of lactic acid, most processes create approximately one ton of calcium sulphate, which requires expensive disposal. In contrast, the novel fuel cell leaves no residue when it converts the raw material.\n\nHowever, Grützmacher also envisages other applications. The organometallic fuel cell could be miniaturised to power heart pacemakers. It could also contribute to reducing the metal demand of catalysts. Their construction often uses rare earths or noble metals such as platinum. The latter is not only expensive but also scarce. \"If we succeed in constructing a catalyst molecularly, that would considerably improve the material efficiency,\" stresses the ETH Zurich chemist. He says that the aim is to develop a fuel cell whose electrodes manage without metals, or at least use only abundant metals. Candidates include manganese, iron or cobalt, for example. Up to now the researchers have used rhodium in the organometallic fuel cells. Although this metal is often used in present-day catalysts, its availability is limited.\n\nHowever, the organometallic fuel cell also has its disadvantages. The chemical reactions proceed more slowly than in solution because, due to a fuel cell's construction, they only take place on surfaces. This is why the manufacture of larger quantities of fine chemicals will take longer than manufacturing in the conventional way. In addition, for the time being the system only functions with aqueous solutions. \"However, the use of non-aqueous solvents is also conceivable, but we are only at the very beginning, and in the near future we really must first of all understand how a change in the process parameters affects the overall efficiency,\" says Grützmacher.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- The concept of converting renewable raw materials so cleverly that the same process simultaneously produces both energy and industrially desirable chemicals has been high on the wish-list ...\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Do ants hold the key to the fuel of the future?

The major technology breakthrough needed to push the efficiency of a triple-junction solar cell much beyond the current world record of 44% could come with novel semiconductor materials lattice-matched to Indium phosphide (InP). NRL researchers have already produced a realistically achievable design for such a record-breaking lattice-matched multi-junction solar cell.\n\nWith Soitec's Plug and Sun CPV system deployed in Saudi Arabia and with a strong push for solar in the region, the slow but promising growth of Concentrated Photovoltaics underlines the importance of government support to nurture and grow CPV, say CPV International 2013 conference organisers.\n\nJinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. today unveiled its new series of \"Eagle\" solar modules.

They say the new method should lower the cost of such cells by reducing the waste and breakage of the brittle semiconductor.\n\nThe expensive solar cells now are used mainly on spacecraft, but with the improved wafer-slicing method, \"the idea is to make germanium-based, high-efficiency solar cells for uses where cost now is a factor,\" particularly for solar power on Earth, says Eberhard \"Ebbe\" Bamberg, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering. \"You want to do it on your roof.\"\n\nDinesh Rakwal, a doctoral student in mechanical engineering, adds: \"We're coming up with a more efficient way of making germanium wafers for solar cells to reduce the cost and weight of these solar cells and make them defect-free.\"\n\nBamberg and Rakwal are publishing their findings in the Journal of Materials Processing Technology.

The sawing method was developed for silicon wafers, which are roughly 100 times stronger.\n\nThe new method for slicing solar cell wafers known as wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) wastes less germanium and produces more wafers by cutting even thinner wafers with less waste and cracking.

      "text": "Revealing how a battery material works\n\nFeb 08, 2012 by David L. Chandler\n\nSince its discovery 15 years ago, lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) has become one of the most promising materials for rechargeable batteries because of its stability, durability, safety and ability to deliver a lot of power at once. It has been the focus of major research projects around the world, and a leading technology used in everything from power tools to electric vehicles. But despite this widespread interest, the reasons for lithium iron phosphate's unusual charging and discharging characteristics have remained unclear.\n\nNow, research by MIT associate professor of chemical engineering and mathematics Martin Z. Bazant has provided surprising new results showing that the material behaves quite differently than had been thought, helping to explain its performance and possibly opening the door to the discovery of even more effective battery materials.\n\nWhen it was first discovered, lithium iron phosphate was considered useful only for low-power applications. Then, later developments — by researchers including MIT's Yet-Ming Chiang, the Kyocera Professor of Ceramics — showed that its power capacity could be improved dramatically by using it in nanoparticle form, an approach that made it one of the best materials known for high-power applications.\n\nBut the reasons why nanoparticles of LiFePO4 worked so well remained elusive. It was widely believed that while being charged or discharged, the bulk material separated into different phases with very different concentrations of lithium; this phase separation, it was thought, limited the material's power capacity. But the new research shows that, under many real-world conditions, this separation never happens.\n\nBazant's theory predicts that above a critical current, the reaction is so fast that the material loses its tendency for the phase separation that happens at lower power levels. Just below the critical current, the material passes through a new \"quasi-solid solution\" state, where it \"doesn't have time to complete the phase separation,\" he says. These characteristics help explain why this material is so good for rechargeable batteries, he says.\n\nThe findings resulted from a combination of theoretical analysis, computer modeling and laboratory experiments, Bazant explains — a cross-disciplinary approach that reflects his own joint appointments in MIT's departments of chemical engineering and mathematics.\n\nPrevious analyses of this material had examined its behavior at a single point in time, ignoring the dynamics of its behavior. But Bazant and Cogswell studied how the material changes while in use, either while charging or discharging a battery — and its changing properties over time turned out to be crucial to understanding its performance.\n\n\"This hasn't been done before,\" Bazant says. What they found, he adds, is a whole new phenomenon, and one that could be important for understanding the performance of many battery materials — meaning this work could be significant even if lithium iron phosphate ends up being abandoned in favor of other new materials.\n\nResearchers had thought that lithium gradually soaks into the particles from the outside in, producing a shrinking core of lithium-poor material at the center. What the MIT team found was quite different: At low current, the lithium forms straight parallel bands of enriched material within each particle, and the bands travel across the particles as they are charged up. But at higher electric-current levels, there is no separation at all, either in bands or in layers; instead, each particle soaks up the lithium all at once, transforming almost instantaneously from lithium-poor to lithium-rich.\n\nThe new finding helps explain lithium iron phosphate's durability as well. When there are stripes of different phases present, the boundaries between those stripes are a source of strain that can cause cracking and a gradual degradation in performance. But when the whole material changes at once, there are no such boundaries and thus less degradation.\n\nThat's an unusual finding, Bazant says: \"Usually, if you're doing something faster, you do more damage, but in this case it's the opposite.\" Similarly, he and Cogswell predict that operating at a slightly higher temperature would actually make the material last longer, which runs counter to typical material behavior.\n\nIn addition to seeing how the material changes over time, understanding how it works involved looking at the material at scales that others had not examined: While much analysis had been done at the level of atoms and molecules, it turned out that the key phenomena could only be seen at the scale of the nanoparticles themselves, Bazant says — many thousands of times larger. \"It's a size-dependent effect,\" he says.\n\nMIT materials science professor Gerbrand Ceder observed and wrote about lithium iron phosphate's behavior at high current levels last year; now, Bazant's theoretical analysis could lead to a broader understanding not only of this material, but also of others that may undergo similar changes.\n\nTroy Farrell, an associate professor of mathematics at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, who was not involved in this work, says these findings are of great significance for those doing research on lithium batteries. He adds that this new understanding \"enables material scientists to develop new structures and compounds that ultimately lead to batteries that have longer life and higher energy density. This is what is required if battery technology is to be used in high-power applications like electric vehicles.\"\n\nUnderstanding why lithium iron phosphate works so well was \"one of the most interesting scientific puzzles I've encountered,\" Bazant says. \"It took five years to figure this out.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nLithium-ion batteries have become a leading energy source for everything from smartphones and laptops to power tools and electric cars, and researchers around the world are actively seeking ways to nudge their performance ...\n\nSimon Fraser University associate professor James Wakeling is adding to the arsenal of increasingly sophisticated medical imaging tools with a new signal-processing method for viewing muscle activation details that have never ...\n\nEvery time you boil water in a kettle, you witness a phenomenon known as a phase transition — water transforms from a liquid to a gas, as you can see from the bubbling water and hissing steam.

      "text": "2 Photosynthesis\n\nArtificial Photosynthesis: Chemical and Biological Systems for Converting Light to Electricity and Fuels\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\n2\nPhotosynthesis\nArtificial Photosynthesis: Chemical and Biological Systems for Converting Light to Electricity and FuelsOCR for page 26\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\nsource of electricity but will not begin to compete with the major fossil fuel source plants until costs come down further.\nWrighton's presentation, \"Photosynthesis—Real and Artificial,\" was a closely reasoned, step-by-step discussion of the crucial stages in the chemical and molecular sequence of photosynthesis. His colleagues in the session were chosen for their expertise in one or another of these fundamental specialized areas of photosynthesis research. By the end of the session, they had not only provided a lucid explanation of the process, but had also described firsthand some of the intriguing experimental data produced. Douglas Rees of the California Institute of Technology (on the molecular details of biological photosynthesis), George McLendon of the University of Rochester (on electron transfer), Thomas Mallouk of the University of Texas (on the arrangement of materials to facilitate multielectron transfer chemistry), and Nathan Lewis of the California Institute of Technology (on synthetic systems using liquid junctions) all supplemented Wrighton's overview with reports about findings in their own area of photosynthesis research.\nThe science of chemistry is predicated on the atomic theory of matter. No matter how intricate the structure of an atom or molecule, its constituent parts will be conserved after the exchanges of a chemical reaction. In fact it was the development of the balance scale in the 18th century that led to the birth of modern chemistry. Once it was realized that the laws of thermodynamics and the principle of the conservation of energy provide an elegant set of constraints, chemistry became the ultimate puzzle-solving science. One could feel fairly confident—once most of the basic elements and compounds and their simple proportional relationships had been discovered—that the answer could be found in the laboratory, if only the pieces could be assembled into the proper, coherent picture. For chemists, this usually means recreating an interaction under conditions that are precisely repeatable.\nThe enabling paradigm was developed by British chemist John Dalton, who proposed the atomic theory of matter around the turn of the 19th century. Notwithstanding subsequent refinements due to quantum physics and to scientists' increasing ability to probe and examine these reactions directly, Dalton's basic description of the behavior and transfer of protons and electrons among and between elements and compounds—the opening salvo fired at every high school chemistry student—still sets the stage for the most advanced chemical research. Photosynthesis provides a vivid example of the type of drama that is played out effortlessly in nature but reenacted elaborately in chemical laboratories with painstaking concern for the intri-\n\nOCR for page 27\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\ncate details. It is hardly an oversimplification to say that if scientists could figure out exactly how the electrons liberated by light striking plants are so efficiently put to work in subsequent chemical transformations, analogous systems might well be developed that could help substantially to meet the world's energy needs. Thus the stakes for society are high, and the contrast is dramatic: a chemist works on precisely controlled and intricately choreographed reactions in a laboratory—usually on a very small scale—and yet the implications and applications of his or her work may lead to dramatic transformations, on a vast scale, of the material world.\nIn the case of research on artificial photosynthesis, such work could lead to the economical production of an alternative to the dwindling supply of fossil fuels. And a further benefit might be a reduction in the sulfurous products emitted by the combustion of carbon-based fuels. Wrighton explained that these fuels are themselves \"the result of photosynthetic processes integrated over the ages.\" It must be kept in mind that long before plants developed the ability to produce molecular oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis, they were always about their real business of converting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into carbohydrates for their own sustenance. In fact some of these anaerobic plants still exist today in certain specialized ecological niches. The system for photosynthesis evolved to its present state during the earth's natural history, and it exploits materials that are naturally abundant and inexpensive, Wrighton pointed out. As designed by nature, it is the ultimate recycling process—since it uses the planet's two most abundant resources, CO2 and H2O, providing fuel and breaking down a pollutant.\nWrighton and others in the hunt to develop a synthetic version of the photosynthetic process that would generate commercially viable energy accept these two fundamental provisos: it must be cheap, and its raw material inputs must be abundant. Present PV technology has developed solar efficiencies (that is, a certain percentage of the energy received from the sun deliverable as electricity) of 28.5 percent for point-contact crystalline silicon solar cells and 35 percent for a gallium arsenide-gallium antimonide stacked junction cell (Brodsky, 1990), but the manufacturing costs of these products do not allow them to compete where conventional alternative sources are available. If the two natural photosynthetic inputs, CO2 and H2O, could be harnessed, said Wrighton, \"fuel mixtures that would be useful within the existing technological framework—where combustion processes dominate the use of our existing fuels\"—are foreseeable. One ancillary benefit of such a process could be to \"bring global CO2 concentrations to a steady-state value,\" manifestly a desirable goal,\n\nOCR for page 28\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\nsaid Wrighton. But as he pointed out, there are other candidates for an input source that are ubiquitous, including SiO2 (silicon dioxide in rocks), N2 and O2 (molecular nitrogen and oxygen from the air), and NaCl (common table salt).\nIf one of Earth's abundant natural resources could be energized by sunlight to produce (probably by the breakdown and release of one of its elements) a source that could be used for fuel, the entire fossil fuel cycle and the problems associated with it might be obviated. If that resource were water, for example, and the resultant fuel source were hydrogen, burning liquid hydrogen in the air would produce only water as a combustion product. Liquid hydrogen is already in use as a fuel source and has always been the primary fuel powering space vehicles, since it produces more heat per gram of weight than any other known fuel. If a photosynthetic system delivering usable hydrogen could be developed, the process would regenerate the original water source, and an entirely new recycling of natural resources could be established. This time, however, cultural rather than natural evolution would call the shots. With such a major new fuel production process, science would hopefully be able to provide a methodology to better anticipate and control the global impact of any byproducts or emissions.\nThe search for a new way to harness the sun's energy involves first the study of how photosynthesis works in nature, and then the attempt to devise a new system that to some extent will probably mimic or model the successful example. Wrighton and his colleagues provided a lucid description of both efforts.\nPHOTOSYNTHESIS IN NATURE\nPhotons and the Physics of Light Energy\nPhotosynthesis is made possible by the flood of free energy raining down on the planet from the sun. Clearly this energy is put to good use by plants and certain bacteria that have developed analogous photosynthesizing abilities. Many studies of photosynthesis are conducted on these organisms, which are hardy and genetically manipulable under laboratory conditions.\nBut of what does this energy shower of light consist? How can certain structures convert it to chemical energy that is useful to them? The background to answering this question involves two of the giants of 20th-century physics—Planck and Einstein—whose work at the beginning of this century provided important fundamental insights into the energy of light. German physicist Max Planck in 1900\n\nOCR for page 29\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\nderived what is called Planck's constant (universally referred to by the symbol h) to demonstrate his theory of the quantization of energy. He realized that the light energy given off by burning bodies varies with the frequency of their vibrating atoms, and produced the formula E = nvh, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .\nThus the energy (E) of a vibrating atom will vary according to its frequency of vibration (v), but can assume only specific quantity values, namely whole integers times h (approximately 6.63 × 10-34 Joule-second). These values, the various products of hv times whole integers, are known as quantum numbers. When one says the energies of atoms are quantized, one means that they can assume values from this set of numbers only. Thus a quantum of energy—whether it be light or electromagnetic energy outside the optical spectrum—provides scientists a measure of the smallest piece of energy that seems to be involved in the transfer events they are trying to understand. \"These concepts have been extended to molecules, where absorption of quanta of energy—photons—occurs at particular energy levels and gives rise to molecules that then possess very different properties,\" and most importantly, Wrighton continued, \"they can be useful in effecting oxidation and reduction reactions.\"\nThese \"particles\" of electromagnetic energy were observed to be proportional to the frequency of light in which they were traveling. Thus when a photon of a particular energy strikes a metal, for instance, that metal's outer electron(s) will be ejected by the photoelectric effect only when the incoming photon has sufficient energy to knock it loose. Light and the energy value of the photons it transmits vary according to its wavelength frequency; materials vary according to how easy it is to displace a valence electron. When this does occur, the photon is said to be absorbed by the substance, and actually ceases to exist as a particle. Aerobic plants absorb photons of light from the sun within a certain frequency range, and this drives the movement of electrons that yields the synthesis of carbohydrates and oxygen. This is the theoretical physics underlying photosynthesis. But it is the physical chemistry that interests Wrighton and his colleagues, who hope to develop analogous systems that would produce usable energy.\nHarvesting Photons and Putting Them to Use\nTwo fundamental constraints govern the system: the plant or photosynthesizing organism must possess a mechanism to register or receive the incoming photon; and since the energy content of a single photon is small, a way must also be found to collect and aggregate\n\nOCR for page 30\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\nsuch energy. Plants have evolved mechanisms to overcome both of these problems. In plants, chlorophyll provides what chemists classify as a sensitizer, a species that absorbs light and effects subsequent chemical reactions. \"The assembly of chlorophyll collects and aggregates light energy,\" Wrighton explained.\nAs Wrighton pointed out, \"First, it is noteworthy that exposure of CO2 and H2O to sunlight alone does not lead to a reaction, since the photosynthetic apparatus involves light absorption by molecules other than CO2 and H2O, namely chlorophyll. Chlorophyll can therefore be regarded as a sensitizer, a light absorber which somehow channels the light to reaction pathways leading to the production of energy-rich products.\" It is the absorption by chlorophyll of light frequencies in the lower wavelengths that produces the green color of plants, he explained. But the crucial role played by chlorophyll and any sensitizer is to expand the bandwidth of the energy a system can accept. Wrighton added that since CO2 and H2O do not absorb in the visible frequency range, some sort of sensitization will be needed to exploit the full range of the sun's energy in the optical, or visible, range of the electromagnetic spectrum where photon energies tend to be sufficient to dislodge an electron, between 200 and 800 nanometers. This proviso is not limited to the carbon dioxide and water nature breaks down, however, but also applies, said Wrighton, to \"all abundant, inexpensive fuel precursors\" currently under consideration as candidates for a synthetic system. \"Thus, efficient photoconversion systems will involve use of efficient visible light absorbers,\" he concluded.\n\"The second critical feature of the photosynthetic apparatus,\" Wrighton emphasized, is that \"in order to achieve high solar conversion efficiency, the formation of a single fuel molecule will involve the energy from more than one photon.\" The ratio of photons to electrons released will probably be one to one in any system—as it is in nature—but there must be a way to harness the energy from several of these freed-up electrons to produce a chemical transformation. \"If a one-photon mechanism were operative in nature, the process would be doomed to low efficiency,\" he explained, because a single photon that would break down H2O would have to be in the blue wavelength range, and \"sunlight does not contain much energy of blue light, or of shorter wavelengths.\" Nature's way of aggregating and using more than one photon of the energy that is abundant, throughout the entire optical wavelength spectrum, is photosynthesis.\nThe photosynthesis process in nature involves two separate photosystems (called PS I and PS II), each of which contains the chorophyll whose electrons provide the vehicle for the energy that is creat-\n\nOCR for page 31\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\ned. The sequence of molecular events occurs within a structure that biochemists classify as the Z-scheme (Figure 2.1). This molecular arrangement accomplishes an oxidation-reduction, or redox, reaction that involves the actual (or in some cases only the apparent) transfer of electrons between species. When these two phenomena occur together, the overall activity is described as a redox reaction, whereby in one half of the reaction a species loses electrons—is oxidized—and in the other half of the reaction a different species gains electrons—is reduced (Ebbing, 1990). Nature uses photons to free electrons from chlorophyll and—through a series of steps—to oxidize H2O, and in the process O2 is created as a product of the reduction of CO2.\nThe Z-scheme provides an architecture of molecules, located in what biochemists call the reaction center of the plant, that facilitates the redox reaction. Crucial to this arrangement is a mechanism that will serve not only to separate an electron from its atomic species, but will also move it, once it has been separated, in a timed and coordinated way along a known path. Summarizing the three essential elements of the Z-scheme, Wrighton said that the two natural photosystems found in all aerobic plants work in series to (1) absorb four photons of light to energize chlorophyll, (2) release electrons by charge separation and move them by unidirectional charge transport\nFigure 2.1 Z-scheme representation of the photosynthetic apparatus showing, on an electrochemical potential scale, components for light absorption, charge transport, and redox processes for oxidation of H2O to O2 and reduction of CO2 and H2O to carbohydrates. (Courtesy of M. Wrighton.)\n\nOCR for page 32\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\naway from the holes they left behind, and then (3) deliver them to sites distant enough from each other to prevent their mutual interference, where their respective oxidizing (of H2O) and reducing (of CO2) tasks can be fulfilled.\nThe fairly astounding concept at the heart of this series of events is that, in order for photosynthesis to occur, evolution had to develop a structure that would facilitate a chemical series of steps that are, even today, reproducible in the laboratory only with great difficulty. Wrote McLendon (1988), \"Just a few years ago, the idea of 'long-distance' chemical reactions, in which the reactants are held fixed at distances (10–30 Å) that preclude collisions, was viewed with suspicion or disbelief by many chemists. Fortunately, nature is not so skeptical, and biological energy is channelled in the photosynthetic and respiratory transport chains by just such long-distance reactions.\"\nThe Reaction Center\nWrighton reported that \"remarkable progress in establishing the molecular structure\" of the reaction center has been made in recent years, citing Douglas Rees of the California Institute of Technology as a contributor in this area. There remain some important unanswered questions, however, said Wrighton: Why is the electron transfer from the photoexcited chlorophyll so fast? Why does the electron transfer take only one of two quite similar paths? Rees has focused on \"one of the simplest systems for studying biological photosynthetic electron transfer,\" a system with \"only a single photosystem,\" a type of bacteria that—while it does not produce oxygen or reduce carbon dioxide—nonetheless does photosynthesize, and employs in certain of its cells an electron transfer chain that is comparatively clear to study, and that will most likely yield insights about artificial systems that might be designed and built in the laboratory.\nThe reaction center molecules are mostly proteins, specialized polypeptides, and strings of amino acid residues. The overall process begins, explained Rees, when \"light is absorbed by a specialized pair of the bacterium's chlorophyll molecules.\" These molecules are called P680 (pigments that absorb light most strongly at the frequency of 680 nanometers) and react to the photon by giving up an electron. Such a structure is then said to be in an excited state and represents the positive component of the charge separation, referred to as a hole. As the electron moves through the transport chain, its negative charge and the positively charged hole are separated by ever greater distance, and potential energy is created. In essence, the reaction center acts as a tiny capacitor by separating and storing these\n\nOCR for page 33\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\npositive and negative charges on opposite sides of its architecture, figuratively like the poles of a battery. Four more or less distinct steps constitute the process, after the chlorophyll pigment has absorbed the photon and donated its electron. The moving electron is accepted by the pigment pheophytin very quickly, \"in roughly 4 picoseconds,\" explained Rees, which passes it to a primary quinone, QA, and then on to a secondary acceptor quinone, QB. Finally, a secondary electron donor gives up an electron to replace the one lost by the original donor, which is thereby reduced (that is, gains an electron). The light energy captured by the reaction center is ultimately utilized to drive the metabolic processes necessary for life.\nMuch of the detail has been observed directly, said Rees, who pointed out that \"crystallographic studies provide a nice framework for rationalizing and understanding the kinetic sequence of events. But also, they raise a number of questions.\" The most significant of these involves the rates of these various steps. The atomic electrical attraction of positively and negatively charged actors in the process always threatens to draw the liberated electron back into its hole, a process called back electron transfer. If a step proceeds forward at too slow a rate, back transfer will occur and will short-circuit the entire process. In addition to increasing their speed, emphasized McLendon, experimenters also have to steer these freed-up electrons. \"It doesn't do any good to move an electron around in a picosecond if it goes to the wrong place, because you will just short-circuit your electron transport chain. Then every cellular component gets to a common free energy, and you have a death by entropy.\"\nGenetic engineering has also been employed to create mutant reaction centers, where certain proteins and cofactors have been deleted or altered. Rees reported that, \"rather surprisingly, in many of these mutant forms the reaction center still works,\" though with a reduced quantum efficiency. In sum, \"this marriage of molecular biology and chemical physics has provided a good structural understanding of the reaction center,\" said Rees, who was also referring to major strides made in spectroscopy, theory, and x-ray crystallography. The dynamics and the energetics of the process still remain imperfectly understood, but, he predicted, \"the prognosis looks quite good for unravelling these details in the next 5 years or so.\"\nLABORATORY PHOTOSYNTHESIS: IMPORTANT FIRST STEPS\nWrighton and other chemists around the world are trying to use what has been learned about photosynthesis in nature to create a\n\nOCR for page 34\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\nsynthetic system that might produce a renewable source of energy. The energetics Rees referred to have become an important area of inquiry called excited-state electron transfer, advances in which will aid chemists and molecular biologists who are already building actual molecular structures to achieve conversion of light to energy. Thus far, the most promising synthetic systems have exploited the chemistry and physics of liquid-semiconductor junctions.\nExcited-state Electron Transfer in Synthetic Systems\nQuantum physics explains how the light energy of a photon is absorbed by the right sort of receptor, kicking an electron loose and commencing the process of photosynthesis by creating a source of potential energy between the separated electron and the hole it formerly occupied. Gaining and losing electrons \"is the name of the game in redox reactions,\" said Wrighton, who added, \"It has long been known that the photoexcited molecules are both more potent oxidants and more potent reductants than the ground electronic state\" (Figure 2.2). When a photon is absorbed to create an electron and a hole, something thermodynamically unstable is produced, and there's always the tendency for the electron and the hole to recombine. Back electron transfer is, metaphorically, a short circuit that bleeds the potential energy of the charge separation before it can aggregate at a distant site within the system and be put to use.\nFigure 2.2 Orbital diagram rationalizing potent redox power of one-electron excited molecules. (Courtesy of M. Wrighton.)\n\nOCR for page 35\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\nWrighton and others have been able to find and to build multi-component molecules with ''a donor and an acceptor system covalently linked to a light absorber, an assembly,'' he pointed out, \"that does indeed resemble the heart of the Z-scheme\" found in plants. But their system does not produce energy as efficiently as they would like, because of the timing of the reactions: \"In solution the energy-rich molecules lose the stored energy by either intermolecular or intramolecular back electron transfer. In nature, the movement of the carriers away from one another is crucial to high efficiency. The unidirectional movement of electrons in the Z-scheme is a consequence of the components of the charge transport chain, and how they are arranged, both geometrically and energetically,\" Wrighton explained. Work in his group, he continued, did lead to construction of a complex molecule with all of the functional components, but the photoexcitation test showed that a 10-nanosecond time was required for the donor to deliver the molecule to the acceptor. \"This is very sluggish compared to the 4 picoseconds demonstrated [in the natural systems],\" Wrighton summarized, \"and so one of the challenges is to prepare a molecule that will have more zip than our 10-nanosecond time.\" Thus chemists explore the quantum world, said Wrighton, narrowing in on several factors that might elucidate the transfer rates of the electrons: \"the energetics for electrons, the distance dependence of electron transfer, and the structures of the donor and acceptor and their relationship\" in space. George McLendon of the University of Rochester, said Wrighton, \"has made important progress in understanding such factors.\"\nMcLendon is a chemist specializing in the quantum processes of moving electrons from one molecule to another. Not focusing exclusively on photosynthesis, he usually works with proteins and biological systems, but his laboratory has demonstrated phenomena crucial to all electron transfer systems. The basic physics involves the concept of conservation of energy, which, explained McLendon, shows that an electron's rate of transfer varies with the energy force driving it. Essential to the first step in photosynthesis, this relationship between rate and energy was analyzed theoretically some years ago by Rudy Marcus (1956) at Caltech, who predicted an anomaly that was first confirmed by John Miller at Argonne National Laboratory, and verified subsequently by McLendon and others. Up to a certain level of energy, the rate of electron transfer increases with the force driving it, but the initially proportional relationship changes. After the peak level is reached, additional driving force actually slows the electron down. \"A funny thing,\" said McLendon, \"is that you can have too much of a good thing.\"\n\nOCR for page 36\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\nQuantum physics provides a suggestive, if incomplete, explanation of why the electron does not transfer ever more quickly as more energy is applied. McLendon explained that when an electron is lost from one molecule (a donor) and gained by another (an acceptor), the lengths of the bonds in each molecule change, like a stretching spring. The energy for this stretching, called the \"reorganization energy,\" said McLendon, \"is supplied by the excess [free] energy of reaction. The fastest rate occurs when the reaction free energy exactly equals the reorganization energy. If less energy is available, the bonds can't be stretched enough for reaction to occur.\" Conversely, continued McLendon, ''if too much energy is available, the system must wait for this extra energy to 'dribble' away, since at the instant of transfer, the energy of the starting materials and products must be equal, by the law of conservation of energy.\"\nMcLendon provided an example: \"Consider a system containing only ferrous ions (dipositive charged ion molecules) and ferric (tri-positive) ions. When an electron moves, one ferrous becomes ferric, and vice versa. Obviously the system, as a whole, remains unchanged. However, in each case the molecules' bonds have changed length—ferric bonds are shorter. If this length change occurred after the electron moved, energy would be released. With each subsequent electron transfer, the solution would become warmer, and there would be no [so-called] energy crisis. Obviously,\" continued McLendon, \"nature doesn't work this way. Instead, heat is first taken from the system to stretch the bonds. Then, the electron jumps. Finally, the bonds relax, and heat is given back up. Overall, there is no change in heat, and energy is conserved. However, the slow step is getting the initial energy to stretch the bonds. If this can be provided by the energy of reaction, the reaction rate increases.\" The dependence of the separation rate on energy is approximately exponential, falling away from the peak value at lower, or higher, energies. Marcus' theoretical prediction of this phenomenon his colleagues believe was prescient, and he has continued to influence developments in the study of reorganizational energy (Marcus and Sutin, 1985).\nLessons for and from the Construction of Photodiodes\nThomas Mallouk, a chemistry professor at the University of Texas, Austin, wants to make certain that such theoretical insights are put to use. He sees an object lesson in the history of research on superconductors in the 1950s, when increasing knowledge led only very slowly to any \"perturbation in the technology.\" So at his laboratory chemists are actually trying to build a photodiode from which\n\nOCR for page 37\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\nto obtain usable electric current. Using insights from \"the two systems that really work—photosynthesis and photovoltaics that use semi-conductors—the first question in creating a multistep electron transfer mechanism,\" according to Mallouk, \"is, What is the best way to organize the molecules?\"\nBecause the cost of materials and the complexity of assembly are crucial determinants of the viability of a commercial system, Mallouk said, \"we look for ways where we can get these things to self-assemble, hopefully into a matrix that will teach them how to line up usefully, even if we just chuck them all in there randomly.\" Several strategies are combined, including using electric field gradients to propel and direct freed electrons, creating a gate whose size will selectively admit only the desired species of molecule, and employing molecules whose electrochemical potentials are easily controlled. (Figures 2.3 and 2.4).\nFigure 2.3 Analogy between semiconductor- and molecule-based electronic devices. (Courtesy of T.E. Mallouk.)\n\nOCR for page 38\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\nFigure 2.4 Analogy between natural and zeolite-based photosynthetic reaction centers. (Courtesy of T.E. Mallouk.)\nZeolites are a form of aluminosilicate. \"There are many different polymorphs of this general formula,\" said Mallouk, \"and they have the endearing property that the holes in them are about the size of a molecule, about 6 or 7 angstroms across. You have an array of linear tunnels that run through the structure, with the tunnels packed in next to one another.\" By exploiting the diameter of the tunnel to exclude molecules of a certain size, adding some useful catalysts, and charging the system with a calculated amount of energy, Mallouk's team was able to trap the target molecule inside the tunnel, where it could not escape while the scientists beamed their light and photolyzed it. The first transfer step occurs when the electron escapes\n\nOCR for page 39\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\nfrom a molecule in solution to interact with molecules that have been chemically attracted to the surface of the assembly; the second step involves the product of that step reacting with molecules inside the tunnel altogether. \"So we have a self-assembling, three-molecule chain, where the viologen is inside, porphyrin is on the outside, and EDTA is ion-paired with the porphyrin out there,\" Mallouk explained. The assembly worked, in that it propelled the electron into the tunnel in 30 picoseconds, only 10 times slower than with natural photosynthesis. The efficiency of the electron-hole separation was very poor, however, said Mallouk, illustrating Wrighton's emphasis on the importance of back electron transfer pathways.\n\"We had to think more intelligently for our Mach II version,\" said Mallouk, who then added two more components to the system in order to better mimic nature. \"Remember, the natural system is a sort of staircase arrangement of redox potentials,\" he said, and so they tried to create a multistep mechanism within their molecular assembly. Rather than speed up the process, they chemically blocked the back transfer pathway by manipulating the cationic charges and using the 7.1-angstrom-wide zeolite tunnel as a kind of trap. Their molecule was electrically propelled through, small-end first, but then became trapped like a pig in a fence as its other larger end reached the tunnel. Mallouk's team actually \"slowed down the forward rate,\" which, he conceded, is \"kind of a macho thing in electron transfer chemistry, where the basic rule is to get your forward rates as fast as possible.\" But, he said, citing McLendon's thesis, ''it really doesn't matter as long as your forward rate is fast enough compared to the competing back transfer pathway.\"\n\"There are many steps in a row, but the point is to get the electron safely away from where it came. With so much empty space in the zeolite, we can load up the rest of the channel with a molecule that is easier to reduce. Now we have two steps forward, which chemically puts the electron much further away from its hole, so the rate back down [the hill] decreases by a factor of 100 or so,\" Mallouk explained. How did it work? He continued, \"The effect of putting in these more intelligent features is to increase the quantum efficiency by about four orders of magnitude. When you put this whole thing together, you really only have to stir it up, and you come out with a quantum yield of about 30 percent for photochemical separation of electrons and holes, and subsequent hydrogen evolution.\" Thus, Mallouk concluded, they have created another system—this one man made—that works, and that delivers electrons productively. However, even though his system has the advantage of self-assembly, Mallouk noted that it still employs components that are expensive to create.\n\nOCR for page 40\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\nAlthough such systems may eventually evolve into competitive models, Wrighton and his team are currently at work on a prototype that will be compared to, he said, \"the system to beat, the ones that work very well, semiconductor-based photoelectrochemical cells.\"\nPHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS\nAs Wrighton said, not only does photosynthesis work—in nature and in the laboratory—but it can become commercially viable. Solar technology has been a growing phenomenon for two decades. The road to this growth, however, is really a two-lane highway, a fact that is often overlooked. Any alternative system that can produce electricity will be measured by how it compares to the current massive combustion of fossil fuels. On the one hand, scientists, ecologists, and even policymakers taking the long view recognize the finite and dwindling supply of these carbon-based sources and the harmful impacts of their sulfurous emissions. On the other hand, such considerations tend to be overshadowed by more immediate concerns, such as the cost of energy produced by alternative systems and how quickly that energy can be delivered. Market considerations, pragmatic politics, and the interests of the massive infrastructure now producing and selling electricity all deflect attention and, inevitably, resources away from the support of scientific efforts to develop a viable alternative source of energy.\nSolar energy itself is multifaceted. Without the sun to evaporate the water that eventually returns to the earth's rivers and oceans, hydroelectric power would not have achieved the importance it has, providing approximately 17 percent of the energy used in industrialized countries and 31 percent in the developing countries. California's Altamont Pass is the site of the world's largest wind farm, indicating the feasibility and possibility of wind turbines powered by the earth's atmosphere, which in turn, of course, is powered by the sun. In addition, solar cells have been designed to collect heat and transfer it directly into heating and cooling uses at the site, as well as to heat a fluid that can be used to generate power in a system known as thermal electric generation. But the \"system to beat\" referred to by Wrighton, photovoltaic cells, creates energy with no noise and no pollution, and does so in a self-contained unit whose only drawback at the moment is cost of fabrication. If the design of photoelectrochemical cells could be improved to make the cost per kilowatt-hour of their generated electricity competitive, or to yield a fuel product from ubiquitous raw materials, the world's energy future could be reconsidered altogether.\n\nOCR for page 41\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\nConstruction of Typical Solar Cells\nA typical solar cell is made from two different types of semiconductor, each having a characteristic—and opposite—electrical tendency when perturbed by light. So-called p-type semiconductors, said Wrighton, \"exhibit conductivity by virtue of having positively charged carriers, n-type semiconductors by virtue of having negatively charged carriers.\" The typical solar cell looks like a sandwich, engineered to exploit these preferences or atomic tendencies inherent in the silicon or other material of which the usually metallic semiconductor is fabricated. The base of the cell is a substrate of glass or plastic that insulates the cell. Above this cushion is the first of the two (outside, top and bottom) metal contacts that will eventually deliver the current in one direction each. Next comes the first of two silicon layers—say the p-type, designed to create and attract holes—and then an interface where an electric field is built into the cell as a type of particle accelerator. Above this is the second semiconductor, the n-type, through most of the upper layers of which photons from the sun will penetrate from above. This layer, including an antireflective coating at its upper edge, is designed so that photons moving through the material will be absorbed as close as possible to the magnetic interface with the other semiconductor. Thus, when an electron is released and creates a hole, each of these particles will be maximally positioned to begin their respective journeys through the respective semiconductors for which they have an inherent electrical affinity. Propelled by the electric field and their own charge, they migrate through the semiconductor layers to the metal contacts at top and bottom, from which a current can be tapped.\nUse of Liquid Semiconductor Junctions\nNathan Lewis, now at Caltech, did his early work with Wrighton at MIT. Each of them is now working on a version of the photovoltaic (PV) cell described above, but with an important difference. Instead of a semiconductor-to-metal or solid-to-solid interface between the two particle-generating media, they are exploiting a liquid-semi-conductor junction. \"There are many important practical advantages,\" said Wrighton, who conceded that one way of looking at the system is \"as a solid-state PV device [arranged electrically] in series with an electrolysis cell. . . . The junction is easily prepared by simply immersing the semiconductor into the liquid electrolyte.\" Reminding the symposium's scientists that the payoff involves redox chemistry, Wrighton said that \"further, the semiconductor surface\n\nOCR for page 42\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\nmay be unique for certain redox processes that would be chemically inhibited on conventional metallic electrodes. . . . Most significant is the prospect that the liquid junction device could yield higher efficiencies than devices based on p-or n-semiconductor junctions.\" Added Lewis: \"Really it is a cost-performance analysis. The physics of recombination can rigorously be demonstrated to be superior to that at the best semiconductor-semiconductor interfaces. We can control the interfacial chemistry.\"\nThe reason has to do with quantum physics at the surfaces. If the semiconductor is in contact with a metal, said Lewis, \"you find that the resultant voltages are less than thermodynamics analysis predicts,\" because of interfacial reactions. A similar problem plagues the interface between two semiconductors of different electrical characters. \"If you try to match their surfaces with atomic precision, you will pay a price\" to do so, said Lewis, and thus drive up the economic cost of the system. \"When you miss at certain spots, those spots become recombination sites,\" and some of the free charge meant to be collected as electricity is drained into these surface reactions. Using a liquid at the interface obviates both of these problems. First, one can add into the liquid something else that will have a high affinity for the defective sites that could have led to problematic recombination, and can thereby passivate these sites. Second, one can reduce the danger of back electron transfer by choosing a solvent that draws electrons more strongly and increases their forward rate.\nThere is a trade-off, however, because the solvent used in the basic solution determines the wavelength of light necessary to kick loose an electron. Water, it turns out, oxidizes silicon, essentially \"poisons it,\" said Lewis. \"You can suppress that reaction by going to a nonaqueous solvent,\" he continued, \"but you then surrender a key property, the ability to extract simple fuels of H2 and O2.\" For water, Lewis and his co-workers substituted an iron-containing molecule (ferrocene), an ideal donor to accept the holes generated as light kicks loose the silicon electrons. By carefully mixing their solution, Lewis and his team were able to produce a solvent that maximized the forward rate of electron transfer. The advantage of their cell, Lewis pointed out, is that it has an efficiency in the sun of over 14 percent and has been shown to be stable for months. However, it is not capable of simultaneously producing chemical fuel. Lewis sees the challenge as three-fold: achieving stability, efficiency, and simultaneous fuel formation, two-thirds of which has been demonstrated in the silicon cell.\nWrighton described the strontium-titanate cell as \"extraordinarily efficient for the wavelengths of light that excite strontium titan-\n\nOCR for page 43\nScience at the Frontier: Volume I\nate,\" the downside from the practical perspective being that those wavelengths are shorter and \"fall in the ultraviolet range, which contains only 5 percent of the available solar energy.\" Thus, like other experimental systems and cells, Wrighton's assembly works impressively under laboratory conditions, but it uses an energy source (or in other cases, molecular components) that nature does not have an abundance of. \"Short of changing the sun itself,\" said Wrighton, the problem remains to find a stable solution that will provide a complete cycle of oxidation and reduction, and a donor to complement it that will react to visible light. A real frontier in research on PV cells is finding or constructing materials and solvents that will balance all of these considerations: bandgap, passivation to counter deficits at the surface junctions, ionic acceleration of particles to avoid back transfer, and a material that will provide both sides of the redox reaction so as to produce a usable fuel.\nWrighton summarized the challenge: \"Although the semiconductor-based photoelectrochemical cells represent the best chemical systems for conversion of light to electricity or chemical fuel, there are many shortcomings. Long-term durability for any chemical system remains a serious question. Nonetheless, the SrTiO3-semiconductor-based cell for photoelectrolysis of H2O remains as a good demonstration that sustained conversion of light to useful energy is possible. In trying to duplicate the function of the natural photosynthetic apparatus,\" he continued, \"semiconductor-based approaches are far ahead of molecular-based approaches. . . . But before we see a mature solar conversion technology based on the excitation of electrons in materials, advances in chemistry and materials science must overcome present obstacles to efficient, large-area, inexpensive systems.\"\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nBrodsky, Marc H. 1990.

      "text": "Work light twice as hard to make cheap solar cells\n\n\"Third-generation\" solar cells that could shatter the efficiency limit of conventional cells have come a step closer. A proof-of-concept device is the first to generate twice the standard current produced from the most energetic photons in sunlight.\n\nA photon arriving at a solar cell needs a certain amount of energy to break an electron free from its atom and generate current. However, photons with energy above that threshold still generally release only a single electron, generating no additional current even if they arrive with more than enough energy to free two electrons.\n\nIn 1961, semiconductor pioneers William Shockley and Hans Queisser showed that the these factors limited single solar cells to converting no more than 31 per cent of incident solar energy to electrical energy. But around a decade ago Martin Green of the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, challenged that orthodoxy. He suggested the third generation of solar cells could break the 31 per cent barrier.\n\nBreaking the limit\n\nEarlier this year, a team from the universities of Texas and Minnesota offered one way to break through the barrier, by capturing extra energy lost as heat after the electrons escape their atoms. Now Bruce Parkinson and Justin Sambur at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, and Thomas Novet of Voxtel in Beaverton, Oregon, have taken the first steps along another route to super-efficient solar cells. Their approach involves harnessing particularly energetic photons – those with more than twice the energy needed to free an electron – and using them to free two electrons rather than one, potentially doubling the current generated.\n\nThe process had already been seen in macroscopic semiconductors, but it has been extremely inefficient. Seeking better results, Parkinson and colleagues turned to quantum dots, tiny chunks of semiconductor that confine current carriers in nanometre-sized volumes.\n\nParkinson's team coated a smooth titanium dioxide electrode with a single layer of lead-sulphide quantum dots. The quantum dots chosen must absorb between 0.85 and 1.39 electronvolts to free up one electron.\n\nThe researchers illuminated the device with a variety of wavelengths of light. Using reddish light in which individual photons carry 1 to 2 electronvolts, 70 to 80 per cent of the relatively small number of photons absorbed by the device freed up an electron. But then the team switched to light from the blue end of the spectrum, where individual photons carry over 2.4 electronvolts, which is 2.7 times the threshold for freeing electrons. Now they collected an excess of electrons, up to about double the number of absorbed photons. This strongly suggests that many of the photons were generating two electrons.\n\nSuper-cheap cells\n\n\"It's very good science,\" says Michael Naughton of Boston College. The demonstration of collecting the electrons is an important step toward future solar cells, he says.\n\n\"This is a first step,\" Parkinson told New Scientist. The single layer of quantum dots used in the experiment is so thin that it absorbed only a little of the incident light and total efficiency was very low. But he expects others to refine the technique and boost total efficiency.\n\nThe quantum-dot solar cell technology could replace dyes in dye-sensitised solar cells. These cells presently have a peak production efficiency of around 11 per cent, but it is \"cost per watt\" that is the most important metric, says Parkinson, and quantum-dot sensitised solar cells could be very cheap to make. \"What we need is a 12 to 15 per cent efficient solar cell that you can manufacture for a cost not much more than newsprint"

Researchers have received support via the federal SunShot Initiative to study solar panel technologies at SLAC. Credit: Oregon Department of Transportation/Flickr\n\n(Phys.org)—SLAC's Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource will play a central role in three research projects that seek cheaper materials and manufacturing techniques for solar panels, with support from a Department of Energy program called the SunShot Initiative.\n\nThe studies are aimed at improving an ink jet-like printing technique for producing flexible solar paneling, making thin-film solar panels more efficient and understanding structural changes in solar panel components that are heated during manufacturing.\n\nEach project will run for three years, said Mike Toney, who leads the SSRL Materials Science Division and will participate in two of the projects.\n\n\"These are challenging experiments. One of the reasons they haven't been done before is that they're not easy,\" Toney said. He said he expects the research to begin soon.\n\nBuilding experimental chambers for performing X-ray analyses of the solar materials and processing techniques will involve many scientific disciplines, Toney noted, from physics to chemistry to materials science and chemical engineering. \"That's one of the things that make it fun,\" he said.\n\nToney said he would have been delighted to receive DOE support for even one of the three submitted proposals. \"We got all three, which was pretty surprising to me,\" Toney said. \"They are good opportunities to demonstrate how SSRL and DOE labs in general can participate in work that's more applied.\"\n\nToney and Stefan Mannsfeld, an SSRL materials science researcher, had earlier received a Laboratory Directed Research and Development grant from SLAC to conduct research on printing processes for producing solar panel layers, and Toney said he believes that research played a role in securing the SunShot support.\n\nResearchers will study a low-cost printing process using X-rays at SLAC's Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource. This research, and two other solar technology research projects at SSRL, are made possible by the U.S. Department of Energy's SunShot Initiative.\n\nMore about the new research:\n\nPrinting Layers for Flexible Solar Panels\n\nFlexible solar panels, made from plastics or similar materials, are a cheap alternative to conventional silicon-based panels.

This project, which uses an X-ray analysis technique known as scattering, is slated to receive $878,578 over three years.\n\nNew Materials for Solar Panel Layer\n\nStudying how electrons travel throughout the layers in a solar panel – from the top or \"emitter\" layer to the base or \"bulk\" light-absorbing material – could lead to improvements in design, including the development of new top-layer materials that let light through more efficiently. A goal of this project, which has been approved for $896,250 over three years, is a 2 percent gain in efficiency for thin-film solar panels and solar cells with greater than 20.3 percent efficiency.\n\nA research team led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, including SLAC scientists Dennis Nordlund, Tsu-Chien Weng and Apurva Mehta, will use X-ray spectroscopy and diffraction techniques at SSRL to study emitter-layer materials.\n\nStudying Heat Treatment on Solar Panel Components\n\nThe manufacturing of some solar panels incorporates rapid heating. But little is known about structural changes to the materials during heating.

But a Fort Wayne entrepreneur just received a patent on an invention he expects to revolutionize the industry. It was an important moment for Elton Bishop's Fort Wayne company, DigitalHydraulic LLC, and for what could become a new northeast Indiana industry. \"We want to get the technology into a form that is streamline mass producible, and we want to be retrofitting actual machinery,\" he said. \"We'll remove their existing valve blocks and install our DHTs in place of that and save customers a lot of money,\" he said. \"We'll be teaming up with Indiana businesses to do that.\" Bishop invented the digital hydraulic transformer in 2001, after at least three years of extensive research. A typical hydraulic system uses an incompressible fluid — usually a petroleum product — to transmit energy from a piston device through a pipe to another piston device. The principle behind the control of pressures in conventional hydraulic systems relies on a throttling valve restricting the free flow of hydraulic fluid. Without throttling flow, a DHT can increase or decrease pressure to a hydraulic cylinder by controlling the volume of fluid it displaces...]]>\n\nSat, 31 Jan 2009 22:38:35 -0600NuVinci Transmission Invention Draws $25M in Financing\nThe NuVinci CVP can be used in virtually any transmission-based vehicle or device--from bicycles and outdoor power equipment to cars, trucks and wind turbines.

The latter is a saga which combines an investigation into the disappearance of great American entrepreneurs with a vision of utopia. Highly talented individuals go missing one after another with the result that American society starts to crumble. The investigation focuses on John Galt, an engineer, who is among the missing. His disappearance is all the more surprising since he leaves behind an (incomplete) revolutionary invention which he hasn't sought to profit from: a motor which runs on a free and inexhaustible energy source: static electricity. The reader learns that Galt's withdrawal from society was voluntary. He believes that its unproductive members suck the life-blood from its creative, productive individuals, in an abuse of power made possible by the state. Galt has persuaded other great minds to follow him, in effect bringing about the most disastrous strike in US history.

The unique system extracts separated Hydrogen and Oxygen gases from distilled water in a large book sized device installed in a vehicle. The unit uses a little of the vehicles excess energy to produce just the right amount of Hydrogen catalyst to blend with the existing fuel source, enhancing the combustion of fuel from 30% up to 90% or more, completely incinerating fuel toxins and particulates due to the high 3000 degree burn temperature of the Hydrogen catalyst, creating clean air exhaust discharge. The gases go into the vehicle air intake system separately from each other. Vehicles can use regular fuel. The amazing system uses only water and electricity to produce the Hydrogen and Oxygen gases for pennies from water, testing on many vehicles shows greatly reduced or totally eliminated emissions, removal of engine and exhaust carbon deposits, improved torque and power, and increased fuel economy due to the complete burning of the vehicles existing fuel. Please visit the company website at:  for more detailed information. HH2 Hydrogen Fuel Cell Devices have no moving parts and lasts for years.

Lebônê, a startup based at Harvard University, has already shown how to make fuel cells from buckets full of wastewater, with a graphite cloth as the anode and chicken wire as the cathode. In this setup, bacteria extract electrons from organic waste at the anode to generate small amounts of power--enough to charge, say, a flashlight or cell phone. Owners can bury the bags in the yard, so that they are undisturbed and out of the way. They can even link several of the bags together--in series or in parallel--to increase the voltage or the electrode area, respectively. The bags are fairly ubiquitous across Africa, according to the startup. \"They're very familiar to the people there, so it's a natural material to use for something that we want to get widespread acceptance for,\" says CTO Aviva Pressner.

The demand for such commodities is projected to triple by 2050, the researchers note.\n\nThe problem is pronounced in capturing CO2, which in addition to its notoriety with climate change, is an impurity in natural gas, biogas and other gas streams, they said.\n\nThe material is a crystal whose atoms form a three-dimensional lattice with holes that snare molecules of CO2 but allow other molecules in air to pass. SIFSIX-1-Cu is an adaptation of a material created more than 15 years ago and is named after the chemical component that leads to the special properties; its chemical name is hexafluorosilicate.\n\nPorous SIFSIX materials are built from combinations of inorganic and organic chemical building blocks and are part of a general class of materials known as Metal-Organic Materials, or \"MOMs\".\n\nPredicting the exact behavior of even small numbers of molecules requires a huge amount of computer memory — more than one terabyte, greater than the RAM memory in a thousand brand-new iPads. Such calculations are a specialty of Blacklight, the largest \"shared memory\" computer in the world. The researchers then used the Blacklight results to simulate the behavior of the gasses and the MOMs in bulk on XSEDE computers Ranger, at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, and Trestles, at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.\n\nThe group believes the material has three potentially significant applications: carbon-capture for coal-burning energy plants; purification of methane in natural gas wells; and the advancement of clean-coal technology. Some 20 to 30 percent of the power output at a clean-coal plant is consumed by cleaning process. The new material could make those plants more efficient and put more power into the grid, the scientists predict.\n\nThe next step is to collaborate with engineers to determine how the materials can be manufactured and implemented for real-world uses"

Scientists in Michigan have developed a biofuel cell that creates a constant, low-power electricity supply by feeding glucose to common bacteria such as E. coli.\n\nBiochemists Gregory Zeikus and Doo Hyun Park at Michigan State University in East Lansing have manipulated the bugs' metabolism to convert them into tiny powerhouses. They have built a 0.6 volt biofuel cell that can deliver currents of up to 17 milliamperes.\n\nBacteria normally break down glucose to generate adenosine triphosphate -- the main energy source for cells. This involves a flow of electrons, which the researchers have tapped into by adding a chemical called neutral red. Molecules of neutral red insert themselves into the bacterial membrane, where they hijack the reaction's electron-transport process, and shuttle electrons onto an electrode.\n\n\"It's like an electric plug,\" says Zeikus. \"You put it in the cell membrane and put the cells in a cathode to make electricity.\" The method isn't likely to be powering your CD player any time soon, but Zeikus says it could be used as a backup method of maintaining communications in remote areas such as space. There is a bonus, too. Because some of the bacteria's energy is diverted to producing electricity, they don't multiply as fast as usual, leaving less sludge to dispose of.\n\nZiekus and Park are not the only researchers exploring the electrical potential of sugar-fed biofuel cells. Itamar Willner and his colleagues in the chemistry department of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel, for example, are using enzymes rather than bacteria to make batteries that could be implanted in people's bodies.

By implementing nanotechnology into semiconductors ó materials used to convert sunlight into electricity ó his solar panels will be able to harvest light more intensely and access a wider spectrum of the light given off by the sun.\n\n\"A solar cell works by harvesting light and converting it into electricity,\" Shankar explained. \"(We're) using metal nanoparticles which have these so-called plasmonic properties.\"\n\nAccording to Shankar, these plasmonic properties make the electromagnetic field of a structure much stronger. This will help the solar cells convert more electricity out of the light they're exposed to.\n\n\"When we simulated them, we saw that these nanoparticles have a certain resonance, and at that resonance they really amplify the electromagnetic fields around those particles,\" he said.\n\nShankar believes that his proposal could possibly help solar technology take off, largely due to its economic feasibility. By using organic materials, metals, and a semiconductor known as titanium dioxide, costs could be dramatically lowered.\n\n\"(What we're proposing is) potentially a lot cheaper than what's out there,\" he said. \"One of the problems that's preventing the eruption of solar technology is that the solar cells, which are made from American silicon, are very expensive. And so they're still not a viable competitor to fossil fuels.\"\n\nEven though Shankar has been developing this proposal for a year now, he still believes that his idea could take five to 10 years before it will be commercially viable.\n\n\"The first objective is to translate these ideas, perform experiments, and actually realize the idea. Later on, if the idea is successful, we'll probably try to commercialize it in a spin-off company or license the intellectual property to a bigger company if they're interested.\""

Of the various types of cells, polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) have attracted attention as power sources for household cogeneration units, portable devices, and electric vehicles.\n\nThe operating conditions of the PEFCs are generally restricted to be lower than 100℃ and under high humidity due to the properties of widely used perfluorosulfonate membranes such as Nafion®. Solid state proton conductive membranes with high conductivity in the medium temperature range (100–200℃) even under low humidity are required as electrolytes for PEFCs. Now, the operation of PEFCs in the medium temperature range improves the utilization of total electric power generated in the cells and reduced the poisoning of Pt catalysts with CO in the fuel gases. In addition, the operation of PEFCs under low humidity permits the reduction of the weight and volume of humidifiers.\n\nAtsunori Matsuda and colleagues at Toyohashi University of Technology developed a high-performance electrolyte membrane for advanced fuel cells operating at medium temperature and without humidification. The new electrolyte membranes are composed of highly proton conductive inorganic compounds and phosphoric acid-doped polybenzimidazole (PBI). The inorganic compound was prepared from inorganic heteropoly acid containing tungsten and silicon with alkali hydrogen sulfate by high-power mechanical milling. The research team successfully reduced the additive amount of phosphoric acid to improve the chemical durability.\n\nThe maximum output of a fuel cell using this electrolyte film reached the world's highest level of 350mW/cm2 at 160℃ without humidification. The long term stable power generation under these conditions was confirmed to 800 h. These results demonstrate that the newly developed inorganic-organic composite electrolyte membranes have high potential for the practical application for advanced fuel cell systems."

It functions like a leaf and is aimed at meeting the energy needs of individual homes. Dr. Daniel Nocera, a lead researcher of the project states \"A practical artificial leaf has been one of the Holy Grails of science for decades.\"\n\nThe artificial leaf in presence of sunlight and water, is capable of splitting up water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The gases are then stored in a fuel cell which eventually provides the required electricity. During its early stages of development, the catalysts used for the above reaction were rather expensive but Dr. Nocera's uses elements like nickel and cobalt, making the procedure an affordable choice for mass adoption. As a renewable energy option the artificial leaf looks promising and with the current model being able to provide energy constantly for 45 hours, we hope it makes its way into every household soon"

Mullite is not only easier to produce than platinum, but also better at reducing pollution in diesel engines.\"\n\nGiven the fact that, not very long ago, the World Health Organization warned about how the exhaust coming from diesel engines is likely to cause cancer when individuals suffer prolonged exposures to it, being able to further cut down on the amounts of pollution such vehicles produce simply by switching to a catalyst which is both cheaper and more efficient than platinum it seems to us like good news indeed.\n\n\"Our goal to move completely away from precious metals and replace them with oxides that can be seen commonly in the environment has been achieved. We've found new possibilities to create renewable, clean energy technology by designing new functional materials without being limited by the supply of precious metals,\" concluded Dr. Kyeongjiae Cho."

For plant cells, the degradation of chromophores isn't a big deal – they simply self-regenerate.\n\nNow, Purdue researchers are in the early stages of creating a solar cell that self-repairs in a way that is similar to a plant's natural photosynthetic systems. Single-wall carbon nanotubes, anchored to strands of DNA, act as the \"molecular wires\" in the light harvesting cells. The DNA is engineered to have specific nucleotides that recognize chromophores and attach to them. Photo-damaged chromophores then may be removed by using chemical processes or by adding new DNA strands with different nucleotide sequences.\n\nThe work looks very interesting and could ultimately lead to a photoelectrochemical cell that operates at full capacity indefinitely.\n\nScientists at the University of New South Wales (UNSW, Sydney, Australia) developed a process to boost the efficiency of solar cell technology that also lowers the total cost.

      "text": "Thought that compressed air energy storage was ridiculously inefficient? Well, it looks like they've managed to best it with a new concept in energy storage: liquid air.\n\nYes, liquid air, as in cryonic liquid air. In other words, this is a combination of liquid nitrogen, liquid oxygen and little bit of liquid argon.\n\nVia Discovery News:\n\nFrozen Air 'Battery' Stores Wind Turbine Energy\n\nLiquid air, which can be frozen, stored and warmed later, could work better than batteries or fuel cells to store energy from wind turbines or other renewables.\n\nThe technology was originally developed by Peter Dearman, a garage inventor in Hertfordshire, U.K., to power vehicles. For the past several years, U.K. tech firm Highview Power Storage has been working to transfer Dearman's innovation to a system that can store energy for power grids.\n\nDearman's idea works like this: electricity generated by wind farms at night is used to chill air to -310 Farenheit — its cryogenic state — turning it into a liquid. The liquid air is then stored in a giant vacuum flask until it time to be used again. This is done at night when demand for electricity is low and the energy from wind would otherwise go wasted\n\nWhen demand increases during the day, the air can be warmed to ambient temperature. As it vaporizes, it drives a turbine to produce electricity, according to the BBC's Roger Harrabin.\n\nIn July, Highview Power Storage signed a commercial agreement with a German firm to develop \"frozen air\" plants in Sub-Saharan and South Africa. And it now has a pilot facility near a traditional gas-powered plant outside London. That way it takes advantage of the plant's waste heat to warm the liquid air, making the entire process more efficient and less costly. Company officials say their energy-storage system is best designed to help smooth out the peaks and valleys of energy production that often occur with wind, solar and other renewable energy project.\n\nAnd the video…\n\nLiquifying air is a common industrial process. It is most often used as the first step in certain types of air separation techniques. Partial liquification of air can be used as the first step for the separation of nitrogen and oxygen, followed by additional liquification to separate out argon, or it can be used to produce liquid air which is then boiled in a series of distillation columns. Occasionally, air is liquified and used in its mixed state as an ultra-low temperature refrigerant.\n\nThe process is very simple. Air is compressed to extreme pressure, which causes it to heat up. The heat is removed by passing the air through heat exchangers, which may be actively refrigerated to aid the process. Once the heat is removed from the highly-compressed air, it is reexpanded back to ambient pressure. Some of the air boils off in the process, taking additional heat with it and resulting in a super-cooled liquid. In practice, of course, it's a little bit more complex than this. There are additional heat exchangers to reclaim some of the heat from the process stream and the process may be done in stages. After the air is liquified, it is stored in an insulated tank, often a Dewar container.\n\nAlthough the principle is simple enough, the process is incredibly energy intensive. Even when the most modern and efficient equipment is used, the amount of energy required to liquify air enormous. So much so that plants that liquify atmospheric gasses are normally located near cheap sources of electricity or even have their own generation capability on site.\n\nMost of the energy is lost in the process. The final product does contain some recoverable energy, by virtue of the fact that it has a much different temperature than the ambient environment and can be expanded when warmed. However, the best of the best gas refrigeration systems only manage to achieve a Carnot efficiency of about 25-50%. That also does not include the loss that occurs as a result of storing the liquid for any length of time, during which, as a result of imperfect insulation, some inevitably evaporates away. Thus, for every two joules of energy that goes into producing liquid air, only one joule is actually retained.\n\nUnfortunately, it gets even worse from here, because getting that energy back from the liquid air means even greater loss. In order to convert the energy back into mechanical and ultimately electrical energy, the liquid air must be heated so that it expands back into a gas. In principle, this could be done by just exchanging the heat with the atmosphere to return it to the ambient temperature, but doing so is more difficult than it might seem. For one thing, frost is quick to build up on any radiators used, reducing their ability to exchange heat. Of course, it could be heated by using a gas flame or some other heat source, but that would also mean a significant amount of the energy would be coming from burning fuel. You may as well just burn the fuel to begin with and dispense with the ridiculously cumbersome and lossy process of pre-cooling the air to a liquid.\n\nWaste heat may be able to help, but it can only do so much and would limit this to a very secondary method of energy storage, making the claims that it is somehow going to have a major impact impossible. It does, however, make this a great way of adding a \"green\" addition to a thermal power plant, which always seems to makes people feel good.\n\nOnce the air is heated enough to cause expansion back to a gas it would be used to drive a turbine or some other engine. This is actually a thermal engine, although the method of energy storage is the reverse of how thermal engines are typically thought of, since in this case, it's the environment that is hot. As such, it is possible to use basic formulas to calculate the Carnot limit of an engine that runs on a liquified gas. An engine running on liquid nitrogen and at an ambient temperature and pressure of STP would be expected to have a total Carnot efficiency of about 74%. Nitrogen composes the majority of air, but since oxygen boils at a higher temperature, a liquid air engine would have a Carnot efficiency of a bit less.\n\nOf course, Carnot efficiency is the theoretical limit of an engine's efficiency but no engine ever reaches it. It would presume that the liquid air were warmed all the way to ambient temperatures without loss (which it wouldn't be) and that there was no fluid friction involved (which there would be) and that all other aspects of the engine were otherwise perfect and free of any resistance. This never happens. So, really, the engine would not achieve anywhere near 74% or even 70%. The best turbines out there can get about 75% of their Carnot limit. That would mean that realistically, a liquid air engine might be able to achieve about 50% efficiency.\n\nI should note that if we compare this to the actual historical performance of liquid gas engines then these numbers turn out to be exceptionally generous, because such engines have been built and they tend to be very very inefficient. However, there will be those who claim that they can somehow stop frost from becoming a problem and push everything to its limit to get a 50% efficiency rating.\n\nNote that the efficiency will go down significantly during cold weather.\n\nTherefore, we can approximate how much energy you can get out of a liquid air storage system:\n\nBased on current air liquification technologies and the current standard for small to medium thermal engines:\n\n25% * 33% =8.25%\n\nBest case, if the turbine preforms as well as the best large turbines do and the refrigeration is 50% efficient (Which is highly suspect):\n\n50% * 50% = 25%\n\nOf course, none of this actually considers the other losses, such as the fact that electric motors and generators are only 98-99% efficient and that some of the liquid air will evaporate. These may seem like small losses, but they compound!\n\nIt's abysmal!\n\nBy comparison, the current standard for grid energy storage is pumped hydro. Pumped hydroelectric storage systems can achieve efficiencies of between 66 and 75%, which blows away the idea of liquid air energy storage. Utility scale batteries are currently expensive, but a good battery and inverter plant can return more than 90% the energy put in.\n\nAnd NO, this is not a new idea!\n\nBased on the amount of press out there and the number of pundits jumping up and down and saying this will be the end of batteries and that it's a revolutionary way of storing energy, you might think that this was actually new and that someone had only recently come to realize that liquified air can be used to store energy. Unfortunately, it's an all too familiar pattern. Journalists and politicians seem to think every tired old idea was just invented and is brilliant and the perfect place to throw some money.\n\nIn the late 1800's, an inventor by the name of Charles Triplet began developing a means for liquification of atmospheric gas on an industrial level. Among other uses, he promoted liquified air as a possible source of energy. The systems he developed did prove commercially viable for the purposes such as deep refrigeration and gas storage, but they failed to ever succeed for energy storage.\n\nThe image to the left is of a liquid-nitrogen powered vehicle (basically the same concept as liquid air) that was constructed in 1997 at the University of Washington. Another similar vehicle was constructed at the University of North Texas that same year. Many many others have been built, both in the form of vehicles and static engines, powered by liquid nitrogen or liquid air. Every time one of these vehicles or motors is built, the press seems to gather around it and assume it must be something new and amazing, despite the fact that this has been done for more than a century.\n\nThese engines are interesting as scientific curiosities and they certainly do a good job at demonstrating just how diverse thermal engines can be and the energy that can be produced through phase changes. That's about their only practical use, however. Perhaps a winning science fair project but definitely not a practical way of storing energyThe issue with cooling and having to heat the air is there with compressed air storage too. This is just compressed air energy taken to the extreme, which makes it worse, of course.\n\nI feel like there should be a rule that any time a new energy technology comes out it should need to be reviewed by a physicist or engineer to make sure it is actually workable and not a violation of thermodynamics before it gets any public money invested into itTrue… so what you then built, instead, is a liquefaction plant that only works say 15% of the time, when there's some spare wind energy.\n\nAs long as there are feed-in tariffs and priority grid access, though, no wind operator is going to bother with this. They can dump their electricity on the grid, no matter what, for guaranteed returns.\n\nInteresting. I'm very skeptical, though and it seems that they've never actually built a plant, they just have \"experimental results\" presumably from some scaled down systems in controlled conditions.\n\nIf they can then great, because grid energy storage is an issue, but I have my doubts. Their whole scheme seems to be based on the idea that they can recapture and store the heat from compression and then use it to heat the air back up. That kind of thing is very hard to do in practice.So much energy is used to compress air and so much is lost in the process that companies routinely have their penumatic systems audited for ways of improving them to squeeze out some savings. When possible, older compressed air devices are replaced with small electrical motors.m\n\nIt has always been understood that compressed air is just a very expensive form of energy and that it only makes sense in circumstances where the other advantages outweigh the inherent expense and inefficiency. Of course, there have been some improvements over the years with better compressors, but it does not change all that much\n\nWhen someone comes along and claims they have re-written all the rules and turned one of the least efficient means of storing energy into one of the most efficient, I have to be very skeptical. That's like someone saying that they tweaked the design of the internal combustion engine and built one that has 60% thermal efficiency in their garage.\n\nWhen will people learn that the Laws of Thermodynamics always bat last? When I was young, this was just about the biggest thing we were expected to take away from high school physics, and this knowledge of the way the universe works has served me in many different ways down through the years. I am frankly appalled at how this information, which should be seen as one of the supporting pillars of commonsense, is a mystery to so many these days.\n\nSorry I do not have a reference to back this up, but to say that the process of refrigerating a gas down to liquid is 25% efficient sounds very generous to me. 50% is just ridiculous. Refrigeration never really gets anywhere near the true Carnot limit for all kinds of reasons (gasses are never 'idea', waste heat is always an issue)\n\nAtmospheric liquification ranks right up there with aluminum smelting and cell electrolysis when it comes to high energy industrial process.\n\nThe energy return on this might not be quite as bad as a simplistic analysis suggests. For instance, the exhaust of the first-stage of expansion might be cold, but it's still much warmer than liquid air. If you use it to pre-heat the incoming compressed liquid air, it gets colder yet. You can re-compress it, re-heat it with ambient heat, and go for another cycle with it. How well these schemes work depends on how light and efficient you can make heat exchangers. You definitely want to use LN2 for this; allowing liquid air to distill leads to LOX, which is a fire and explosion hazard.\n\nAlso, compression and expansion of gas in a liquid can be made close to isothermal. There is a company, SustainX, claiming to have a scheme for high-efficiency energy storage using such a method. I suspect that other methods might work better, but if they are using water at a maximum temperature less than 100C they can use some mighty cheap insulated tanks to hold it. They might even be able to use flat-plate solar collectors to boost their expansion temperaturesThere are no storage media we could develop that can make non-hydro renewables cheaper than well-regulated nuclear (when you need over-optimistic assessments of wind power that ignore storage costs to get it cheaper than nuclear even free energy storage won't make it economical).Not a key part of discussion, but as something of an FYI : compressed air circuits and pneumatics are also often used where an equivalent electrical system would be a safety and/or fire hazard.\n\nFor certain industrial processes there's also a little more of a fail-safe to them, it's easier to install compressed air accumulators than the equivalent batteries and the accumulators will (almost) never need replacingCompressed air as an energy carrier/storage medium is not cheap. In fact it is the most expensive form energy in any industrial shop that uses it, and one only uses it for the reasons I'mnotreallyhere and drbuzz0 mention as well as the fact that most of the heat is dissipated at the compressor and not the tool-head. Even in a new, tight system the losses are considerable and are only tolerated as they are offset by the other advantages.\n\nA way to make liquid air storage more attractive would be to pump the liquid air to say 300 bar and then expand and reheat it in stages. Double reheat cycles have made the Rankine cycle for steam more efficienct. The exhaust air from the last turbine cycle can unfortunately not be used as clean air for the liquid air production because the vaste quantities of air cannot be stored.\n\nYour analysis is correct except for 2 things:\n1) the system can use waste heat which means Carnot efficiency is higher, and more energy is extracted than you suggested\n2) the cold can be used to offset refrigeration costs if used in a heat-exchanger (ie for industrial A/C, natural gas liquefaction, etc)\n\nAlso, the alternative in some locations is to have a peaker plant that sits idle most of the time. That's economically inefficient although technically it is 100% efficient at doing nothing while it's idle."

The hydrogen would then be purified via a water filter and any moisture could be removed by passing the hydrogen through a cylinder of liquid borax. The final stage would be using the hydrogen to power a generator and create electricity.\n\nWhile the idea of using human waste as a power source is very attractive, the prototype device will have a number of potential problems to contend with before it can become a reality — not least the fact that it may not be capable of creating a net gain in terms of electricity.\n\nThe electrolysis of urea to generate the hydrogen requires an electrical input. As such the urine cannot be used to create electricity in an area without an existing power supply.\n\n\"It's a wonderful idea and really encouraging to see people working to convert waste products to something useful, but considering the required inputs I'd be surprised if the overall gain was positive,\" said Oliver Warr, a researcher at the University of Manchester. \"If there was an alternative method of generating the hydrogen, such as microbial, that would be better.\"\n\nAnother consideration would be the longevity of the device: \"Urine isn't just composed of urea,\" explains Warr. \"There are a lot of salts as well. Electrolysis of salt water creates more hydrogen but also chlorine, which could combine with the hydrogen to form hydrochloric acid — not good for the long-term health of a generator's innards!\"\n\nThese issues, coupled with the complexities of storing hydrogen safely, mean the generator may not be an immediately marketable prospect, but it demonstrates the potential for using the abundant resource that is urine to create valuable products.\n\nWhen the African Robotics Network announced their $10 robot design challenge this summer, co-founder Ken Goldberg was careful not to share too many expectations, lest he influence contestants' designs. But he never imagined one of the winning entries would prominently feature a pair of Spanish lollipops.\n\n\"The ingenuity that has come from all over the world to address this problem is just astounding,\" Goldberg said in an interview with Wired Design. \"And we're very excited about the next step, which is that once they're awarded, some of them will become available products.\"\n\nThe contest had a few simple restrictions, including the loose $10 target; entrants from around the world had to build a prototype, offer instructions on a website, and make the whole plan open-source, software included. The winners were little, an inch or two in size and up, never more than a foot long. They were sourced from cardboard, old cell phones, and circuit boards. They performed simple tasks: navigating, following lines, even communicating with each other.\n\n\"It's a mix of people who really ... want to make this happen,\" said Goldberg. \"No one here did this just to say 'here's something, a thought experiment'.\"\n\nDesigns were judged by a 6-member jury of robotics industry professionals, and compiled by Goldberg and Korsah, who are professors at the University of California in Berkeley and Ashesi University College in Ghana, respectively.\n\nSuckerbot, designed by Thomas Tilley, a computer scientist living in Thailand, started with a hacked PlayStation controller, and wound up winning first prize in the tethered robot category. In this case, the tether is the controller's USB cable, and Tilley attached the rumble motors to a pair of wheels. Suckerbot's list of parts comes to $8.96, but the real genius is the Chupa Chups. Tilley needed a way for the robot to sense if it ran into something, so he stuck a lollipop in each joystick. Whenever the Suckerbot bumps something, the weight of the sucker tips the joystick forward, and a signal is sent to the processor.\n\nMany of the robots were created specifically for the challenge. Kilobot, however, was years in the making. Created by a Harvard robotics team, including Michael Rubenstein, Radhika Nagpal, and Christian Ahler, it was meant to be a multi-unit swarming robot. Having to build 1024 pieces made the project well suited for the event.\n\n\"If you're going to build a lot of robots, you need to have them be cheap and easy to make and easy to use,\" said Rubenstein. \"So all of those things also aided in the AFRON challenge.\"\n\n\"I think there is a great need for — not only in Africa, but even in the U.S. — low-cost robots that you could use for education,\" Rubenstein went on. \"There are people who try to make that now, but they're only in the hundreds of dollars for an educational robot.\"\n\nNii Adjetey Sowah programs a Mindstorms robot in Ayorkor Korsah's Introduction to Robotics class at Ashesi University College in Ghana.\n\nTen Design a $10 robot. Conceived as a teaching tool for use in African classrooms, such a low-cost machine could prove to be revolutionary for education in poorer countries around the world.\n\nLaunched last month and ending on Sept. 15, the contest offers prizes for any professional, student, or hobbyist who can design a $10 robot — or at least one in that neighborhood.\n\n\"Obviously a $10 is very … it's a bit unrealistic,\" says Goldberg, a professor of engineering at UC Berkeley. \"But we wanted to set [a price] that would really get people thinking. And in volume, it's not that farfetched.\"\n\nThe AFRON 10 Dollar Robot Challenge offers three prizes, from $100 to $500, plus a Raspberry Pi, in each of three categories, based on the type of robot. The $10 limit is flexible — more a target price for a high-quantity production run. The prototypes, Goldberg expects, will cost more like $100, still a long way short of even a Lego Mindstorms set.\n\nThe contest is part of Goldberg and Korsah's African Robotics Network (AFRON), a new organization built to bring robots to Africa, not for industry, but as a learning tool for students.\n\nThe contest is designed to bring robots to Africa, not for industry, but as a learning tool for students.\n\nOn a trip to Ghana, Goldberg noticed students in Korsah's class at Ashesi University College using Mindstorms kits … then packing them up and sending them to another school to use the next week. If the $280 cost of a Mindstorms kit is prohibitive, he wondered, what could AFRON do to bring the price down?\n\n\"We set the bar high (or in this case low) to provoke really new ideas,\" Goldberg says.\n\nStill having trouble imagining a robot that can be built for $10? Goldberg is reserved in his description of what one might look like. \"We wanted to be careful not to say too much,\" he says. \"That could bias people and basically push the design in one direction or the other.\"\n\nWhat the robots do isn't as important as what the schools can do with them. They're simply a tool for education, to teach programming and engineering. Still, he points out, using a refurbished laptop for brains (which is not included in the contest's price limit), simple inexpensive tools like laser pointers, electric motors, microphones, and even mirrors can produce a lot of potential function.\n\nThe winning designs must use open source software, and AFRON will publish them online. The hope, says Goldberg, is that educators around the world will be able to use the design and the software, and eventually even order an inexpensive, mass-produced kit.\n\n\"My hunch is that this will be really inspirational,\" Goldberg says. \"People will start writing code for it.\""

Known as polarizing organic photovoltaics, the LCD which is developed by UCLA's scientists is claimed to be more efficient than LCD technology available today. Current LCDs are very inefficient. Almost of 75% of energy is lost in the process of polarization and brightening the display.\n\nThe UCLA's technology will capture and recycle the light that might be lost in the transmission process. It means that the technology acts as a filter while it also generates power from any light sources.\n\nThough it will be awhile before the technology is integrated into the design of everyday green gadgets, the days of keeping one charger at the office, one in the car, and another at home are limited."

      "text": "Electricity from Sea, or Waste, Water\n\nPosted on: 23rd April 2012\n\nA recent article in the American Chemical Society journal examined the potential for generating electricity from the difference in saltiness between freshwater and seawater.\n\nIn the process, called \"pressure retarded osmosis\", freshwater flows naturally by osmosis through a special membrane to dilute seawater on the other side. The pressure from the flow spins a turbine and produces electricity using no fuel and with no greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe study concluded that using this process on just one-tenth of the global river water flow into the oceans could generate enough power to meet the electricity needs of 520 million people.\n\nNow scientists at Penn State have extended the potential of the idea to producing electricity from any water which contains food waste, domestic waste or animal waste.\n\nThe process first uses a naturally occurring exoelectrogenic bacteria, that consumes organic material and produces an electric current, to remove the organic matter from the waste water. They then add ammonium bicarbonate. The ammonium bicarbonate solution works similarly to seawater for producing electricity through osmosis.\n\nAfter it has been used in the process, the ammonium bicarbonate is easily removed from the water by heating it to 43°C. The ammonia and carbon dioxide that make up the salt boil out and are recaptured and recombined for reuse. The heat for this would come from waste heat from the process which produced the waste water.\n\nProject leader, Professor Bruce E Logan, said that \"Waste heat makes up 7 to 17 percent of energy consumed in industrial processes, There is always a source of waste heat near where this process could take place and it usually goes unused"

First, a grid is formed using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a liquid transparent silicone polymer that is typically found in contact lenses. The PDMS is then poured over a silicon wafer and cured to form grid-patterned trenches.\n\nThe material is non-conductive, so the researches evaporate a metal film over the grids. The final piece is a liquid solution containing minuscule, nano-sized active electrode materials that are dripped through the trenches.\n\nThe resulting sheet is thin and round with a visible rectangular shape being the batteries. The sections are cut out of the sheet and stacked with clear gel electrolyte in between each layer. With three-stacked battery layers, the entire cell remains at approximately 60 percent transparency and is also highly flexible.\n\nThe transparent batteries you see don't hold much power, according to ExtremeTech: A battery with a transparency level between 50 and 80 percent could store between a third and a half of the energy of an ordinary battery of the same size. Cui says that adding more electrode layers would allow the battery to compete with regular batteries, but at the cost of transparency.\n\nCui believes we could see transparent batteries in consumer devices in the next two to four years. We've seen see-through screens before, so transparent devices--such as tablets, e-readers, and phones--aren't complete fantasy. Besides looking cool, a transparent device could bring augmented reality to devices without requiring a camera."

New studies on the strength of these submicroscopic cylinders of carbon indicate that on an ounce-for-ounce basis they are at least 117 times stronger than steel and 30 times stronger than Kevlar, the material used in bulletproof vests and other products. The findings, which could expand commercial and industrial applications of nanotube materials, appear in the monthly journal ACS Nano.\n\nSolar funnel\nNew antenna made of carbon nanotubes could make photovoltaic cells more efficient by concentrating solar energy.\n\n'Dry water' could make a big splash commercially\n\nPutting carbon dioxide to good use\nEvery year, about 30 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide are pumped into the Earth's atmosphere from power plants, cars and other industrial sources that rely on fossil fuels. Scientists who want to mitigate carbon dioxide's effects on global climate have started experimenting with storing the gas underground, a process known as carbon sequestration. However, there are still many unknowns surrounding the safety and effectiveness of that strategy.\n\nRed light regulates nectar secretion\n\n\nNo longer pining for organic molecules to make particles in the air\nThe fresh scent of pine has helped atmospheric scientists find missing sources of organic molecules in the air - which, it could well turn out, aren't missing after all. In work appearing in this week's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Early Edition Online, researchers examined what particles containing compounds such as those given off by pine trees look like and how quickly they evaporate. They found the particles evaporate more than 100 times slower than expected by current air-quality models.\n\nHidden in plain sight\nThe idea of being able to become invisible, especially by simply covering up a person or an object with a special cloak, has a perennial appeal in science-fiction and fantasy literature. In recent years, researchers have found ways to make very exotic \"metamaterials\" that can perform a very crude version of this trick, keeping an object from being detected by a certain specific frequency of radiation, such as microwaves, and only working at microscopic scales. But a system that works in ordinary visible light and for objects big enough to be seen with the naked eye has remained elusive.\n\nA Cool Way to Make Glass\nQuantum mechanics, developed in the 1920s, has had an enormous impact in explaining how matter works. The elementary particles that make up different forms of matter - such as electrons, protons, neutrons and photons - are well understood within the model quantum physics provides. Even now, some 90 years later, new scientific principles in quantum physics are being described. The most recent gives the world a glimpse into the seemingly impossible.\n\nSynthetic materials that behave like mollusk shells maintain the integrity of the shell in the event of cracking of the outer layer.\n\nWhat a ride! Researchers take molecules for a spin\n\"This is no cartoon. It's a real molecule, with all the interactions taking place correctly,\" said Anatoly Kolomeisky as he showed an animation of atoms twisting and turning about a central hub like a carnival ride gone mad.\n\nImagine: material that if scratched, you can quickly and easily fix yourself, with light not heat\nImagine you're driving your own new car--or a rental car--and you need to park in a commercial garage. Maybe you're going to work, visiting a mall or attending an event at a sports stadium, and you're in a rush. Limited and small available spots and concrete pillars make parking a challenge. And it happens that day: you slightly misjudge a corner and you can hear the squeal as you scratch the side of your car--small scratches, but large anticipated repair costs.\n\nScreening effort turns up multiple potential anti-malaria compounds\nNumerous potential anti-malarial candidate drugs have been uncovered by investigators from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), both parts of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The study was published in the August 4 online issue of the journal Science.\n\nNano Gold Rush: Researchers use tiny gold particles to boost organic solar cell efficiency\nIn the world of solar energy, organic photovoltaic solar cells have a wide range of potential applications, but they are still considered an upstart. While these carbon-based cells, which use organic polymers or small molecules as semiconductors, are much thinner and less expensive to produce than conventional solar cells made with inorganic silicon wafers, they still lag behind in their ability to efficiently convert sunlight into electricity.\n\nMimicking biological complexity, in a tiny particle\nTiny particles made of polymers hold great promise for targeted delivery of drugs and as structural scaffolds for building artificial tissues. However, current production methods for such microparticles yield a limited array of shapes and can only be made with certain materials, restricting their usefulness.\n\nNanoparticle electrode for batteries could make grid-scale power storage feasible\nThe sun doesn't always shine and the breeze doesn't always blow and therein lie perhaps the biggest hurdles to making wind and solar power usable on a grand scale. If only there were an efficient, durable, high-power, rechargeable battery we could use to store large quantities of excess power generated on windy or sunny days until we needed it. And as long as we're fantasizing, let's imagine the battery is cheap to build, too.\n\nFool's gold leads to new options for cheap solar energy\nPyrite, better known as \"fool's gold,\" was familiar to the ancient Romans and has fooled prospectors for centuries - but has now helped researchers at Oregon State University discover related compounds that offer new, cheap and promising options for solar energy.\n\nNew revolutionary material can be worked like glass\nA common feature of sailboards, aircraft and electronic circuits is that they all contain resins used for their lightness, strength and resistance. However, once cured, these resins can no longer be reshaped. Only certain inorganic compounds, including glass, offered this possibility until now."

The ability owes to a highly electrically conductive, tiny structure called microbial nanowire that the scientists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst discovered in Geobacter.\n\nThe nanowires are only 3-5 nanometres thick (20,000 times finer than a human hair), but quite durable and more than a thousand times as long as they are wide. A nanometre is one-billionth of a metre. The discovery may also have applications in nanotechnology. The findings of the team, led by microbiologist Derek R Lovley, were published in Nature (June 23, Vol 435, No 7045).\n\nSuch long, thin conductive structures are unprecedented in biology, said Lovley, who is also credited with the discovery of Geobacter in 1987. These microbes have been found useful in the bioremediation of groundwater contaminated with toxic and radioactive metals or petroleum. They also have the ability to convert human and animal wastes or renewable biomass into electricity. Geobacter are anaerobic bacteria (living without oxygen) that use metals to gain energy the way humans and other organisms use oxygen.\n\nPrevious studies in Lovley's lab showed Geobacter produces fine, hairlike structures, known as pili, on just one side of the cell. Lovley's team speculated that the pili might be miniature wires extending from the cell that would permit Geobacter to carry out its unique ability to transfer electrons outside the cell onto metals and electrodes. This was confirmed in a study in which microbiologist Gemma Ruegera teamed with physicists Mark T Tuominen and Kevin D McCarthy to probe the pili with the high resolution atomic force microscope. They found the pili were highly conductive. Further, when Geobacter was genetically modified to prevent it from producing pili, the bacteria could no longer transfer electrons."

Student Miles Barr beat out the competition for his development of what is being called a solar technology breakthrough. Barr, who recently finished a PhD in chemical engineering, may have unlocked the future of solar power, according to MIT. MIT believes that Barr's breakthrough could change the way solar cells are built and could turn just about anything into a harvester of solar energy.\n\nBarr's development is, essentially, a printed solar cell. The cell is printed as a textile, making it flexible and resilient while not sacrificing performance. Because of its textile-like structure, the cell can be used on any surface and in any environment. The process used to print the cell can also be used to embed the cell on more than just textiles. It is a simple process, which will eliminate the need for installations, reducing the cost of solar energy adoption. Researchers believe the process can be simplified further to make it viable outside of a laboratory.\n\nBarr was part of a large team of researchers working on the project. His leadership role in the development pegged him as the award's recipient. As part of the award, Barr received $30,000 from MIT. Two other students from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Campaign and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute also were awarded the Lemelson-MIT Student prize"

      "text": "1900's Electric Car Battery Gets 2012 Update\n\nThomas Edison designed an electric car battery in the early 1900's that powered cars for about 20 years. The nickel-iron battery intended as an inexpensive alternative to corrosive lead-acid batteries fell out of favor over the decades. It has been revitalized by researchers at Stanford University.\n\nConsisting of two electrodes - a cathode made of nickel and an anode made of iron - bathed in an alkaline solution, the Edison battery was slow to charge and slow to discharge. Although durable, inexpensive due to the abundance of the materials, and relatively non toxic, it proved to be inconvenient.\n\nWalter C. Baker founded the Baker Motor Vehicle Company in Cleveland, Ohio and in 1910 ran a car powered by an Edison battery for 244-1/2 miles on a single charge. Jay Leno owns and even today drives a Baker with an Edison battery. However, such batteries generally are used now just to store surplus electricity generated by wind turbines or obtained from solar panels.\n\nThe Stanford team has come up with a nickel-iron battery based on the Edison design that they say recharges in 2 minutes and discharges in less than half a minute. Touting the benefits of their work on the earlier battery, lead author of the study, Stanford graduate student Hailiang Wang said, \"We've made it really fast.\" They accomplished this by using graphene. The new design incorporates nano-sized sheets of carbon that are only one-atom thick and multi-walled carbon nanotubes, each consisting of about 10 concentric graphene sheets rolled together. Wang said \"We grew nanocrystals of iron oxide onto graphene, and nanocrystals of nickel hydroxide onto carbon nanotubes.\" The strong chemical bond \"allows electrical charges to move quickly between the electrodes and the outside circuit,\" according to Stanford chemistry professor Hongjie Dai.\n\nFor this decade's electric cars, the low cost battery would be used in conjunction with lithium-ion batteries by \"giving them a real power boost for faster acceleration and regenerative braking,\" Wang said. \"The electrolyte is just water with potassium hydroxide, which is also very cheap and safe. It won't blow up in a car.\" As for its charge/discharge cycle, it decays about the same as a lithium-ion battery - about 20 percent over 800 cycles.\n\nOthers involved in the project supported by Intel, a Stinehart/Reed Award, and a Stanford graduate fellowship, were from Canadian Light Source, Canada and Tsinghua University, China. They suggest that a new generation of Ni-Fe batteries could be useful as novel devices for electrochemical energy storage. More detailed information can be found in their article at Nature Communications."

But they come at a higher up-front price than other bulbs, especially the ones with warmer and more appealing hues.\n\nMary Levin, UW\n\nLumiSands cofounders Chang-Ching Tu, left, and Ji Hoo with with a demo showing the warmer, softer hue of the LED bulb (left side) after a film embedded with their red-emitting silicon nanoparticles is placed underneath. The box on the right is an identical, standard LED bulb.\n\nLEDs give off light when electrons move through a semiconductor material. They are more efficient than standard incandescent or fluorescent bulbs, but they're also pricier. That's partly because within each LED lamp, expensive substances known as rare-earth-element phosphors help to soften the harsh blue light that LEDs naturally emit.\n\nBut these rare-earth elements are hazardous to extract and process. China controls nearly all of the market for these materials, which has quadrupled the average price for the past several years.\n\nThat's where LumiSands comes in. The company uses silicon, derived from sand, instead of rare-earth elements to convert part of the blue light emitted by LEDs into greens, yellows and reds. The resulting light looks more like sunlight.\n\nMary Levin, UW\n\nResearchers use a black light to show the photo-luminescence of their silicon nanoparticles.\n\nThe crew of two plans to sell directly to LED-bulb manufacturers that are looking to transition away from increasingly more expensive materials to make the lights.\n\n\"Hopefully, manufacturers could substitute traditional rare-earth elements with our material with minimal additional steps,\" said Ji Hoo, a UW doctoral student in electrical engineering and co-founder of LumiSands. \"It will be cheaper, better-quality lighting for users.\"\n\nIncandescent bulbs give off light that's most similar to sunlight – and easiest on our eyes – but the bulbs are inefficient and produce a lot of heat. Fluorescent bulbs, seen most commonly as long tubes in overhead office light fixtures, are more efficient than incandescent lights, but they contain mercury, posing health and environmental concerns.\n\nLumiSands etches off nano-sized particles from wafers of silicon. The element, which usually doesn't emit light, can start to glow when its crystalline particle size is smaller than 5 nanometers. The surface is reinforced through a wet-chemistry process. When the red-emitting silicon nanoparticles are added to LED bulbs, the light becomes softer and warmer in hue.\n\nMary Levin, UW\n\nThis device tests the quality and reliability of the silicon nanoparticle phosphors that LumiSands created to use in LED lighting.\n\n\"The beauty of our technology is to create a highly efficient fluorescent material by using silicon rather than rare-earth elements or other types of heavy-metal compound semiconductors,\" Tu said. \"The manufacturing process can be performed in a basic laboratory setting and is easy to scale up.\"\n\nLumiSands plans to tweak the red technology before moving on to other colors such as yellow and green, which will enable LEDs to cast a white light with no rare-earth elements.\n\nThe company has received funding from the National Science Foundation, the Washington Research Foundation and the W Fund. It received an honorable mention in the 2012 Foster School of Business Environmental Innovation Challenge and a top award in the 2012 Jones Milestones/Foster Accelerator mentorship program.\n\nNow, LumiSands is finishing a prototype of the technology and sending samples to lighting industry partners for evaluation.

It's the largest club event in the nation for civil engineering undergraduates, said Jeffrey Berman, faculty adviser for the UW team and an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering.\n\nU of Washington\n\nUniversity of Washington team members compete during a regional competition this year.\n\nThe UW was chosen earlier this year to be the host institution. The Skagit bridge collapse might be discussed during a banquet event, but elements of the competition were set months ago and were not changed after the collapse, Berman said. Many of the student designs, however, will be steel truss structures similar to the Skagit bridge.\n\n\"These bridges might look a little different from the Skagit bridge, but most will also be truss bridges because they are very efficient and fast to build,\" Berman said.\n\nFrom 3-6 p.m. on Friday (May 31), each of the 49 student-built steel bridges will be on display on the UW's Red Square. Students will be judged for the aesthetics of their bridges, which are roughly one-fifth the size of a standard bridge, or about 20 feet long and 4 feet wide.\n\nThen on Saturday, the teams will race to assemble their bridges in the Alaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion. During the school year, the teams designed and built prefabricated pieces to fit the competition's detailed specifications. In the finals, teams will be judged on how fast they can assemble their bridges, how much they weigh and how the structures deform under large loads.\n\nThe Saturday portion of the competition will run from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Teams will compete in rounds, and close to 50 local civil engineers and UW alumni will serve as judges. Most of the scheduled events are open to the public.\n\n\"The students go through the design and fabrication process themselves,\" Berman said. \"It's a really good opportunity to take what they learn in the classroom and actually apply it here in the competition.\"\n\nTeams will have to work through a number of realistic constraints as they build the bridges, including a fake river they can't step in and height-clearance restrictions for traffic. All of the teams have competed regionally before the finals, so the chance of a collapse is relatively small, Berman said.\n\nFor more information, contact Berman at jwberman@uw.edu or 206-616-3530.

Known as the Next Generation Science Standards, the goals outline a vision for what all U.S. citizens should know about science.\n\nBell and Shouse are now advising schools, districts and states about how to implement the standards. They will host two public events May 22 to talk about the vision and the new standards with teachers, scientists, school administrators, parents and others interested in science education.\n\nBell answered questions about the new K-12 science education standards for UW Today.\n\nQ: Why are science learning standards important?\n\nA: Scientific literacy helps us all make better life choices and decisions. The learning standards set the baseline of what we should all know about science. We were very careful to make sure the learning goals help all youth become scientifically literate and college-ready, so they can transition more seamlessly to college and have more choices about majors they can pursue.\n\nQ: What do the standards look like?\n\nA: There are three dimensions that help define the performances for each standard: disciplinary practices, core ideas of science and cross-cutting concepts that apply to multiple fields of science. The standards describe ways a student integrates these dimensions, but we didn't lay out specific ways to meet these learning goals, so there's still a lot of work to do in developing innovative curricula and instruction.\n\nQ: What is different about the latest standards?\n\nA: There are several major changes from the last incarnation of documents that have laid out standards for science education in the mid-1990s:\n\nMore emphasis on specific disciplinary practices used by scientists and engineers, such as developing and using a model, writing an argument from evidence, engaging in computational thinking and developing causal explanations about the natural world. The eight practices for science and engineering help focus what has previously been described as \"inquiry\" or \"hands-on\" instruction.\n\nGreater focus on engineering and design. This is particularly important now that there's an increased emphasis on science, technology, mathematics and engineering and thinking about how to integrate those subjects to solve complex problems. And a greater emphasis on engineering in K-12 is especially important because of the technology industries in the state of Washington and the lack of qualified people for jobs in those fields.\n\nMore challenging goals for preschoolers and kindergarten students. Research studies show that our youngest learners are capable of thinking that's more complex than we previously believed, so the new standards have more ambitious learning goals for this age group.\n\nQ: Won't this just be more work for teachers?\n\nA: I have known many elementary school teachers who feel like they haven't had as much opportunity to teach science over the last decade because of the increased attention being given to reading, writing and mathematics. The new science standards have greater overlap with the existing standards for mathematics and English language arts so that teachers can teach science in ways that accomplish multiple goals. We hope this will make the lives of classroom teachers more manageable while allowing all students to meaningfully learn about science.\n\nQ: Why should people who don't want a science career have to meet these standards?\n\nA: The science standards help people develop core knowledge and ways of thinking that can be used in a broad variety of everyday situations and other careers, including the ability to skeptically critique information, build an argument based on evidence and design a solution to fit an everyday need.\n\nQ: How are the standards put into action?\n\nA: Each state will decide whether they'll try to adopt them and on what timeline. Washington state is working toward adoption, and my sense is there's a lot of excitement around embracing these standards. The state's Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction is coordinating the process of figuring out what the new science standards would mean for the state.\n\nQ: Why are you excited about the new science learning goals?\n\nA: It's an exciting time for helping the public think more deeply about how science and technology relate to their lives and how they can leverage it for their own interests, such as solving problems their communities may be facing. This compels us in a lot of the work that we do.\n\n]]> biomaterial could improve success of medical implants\n 14 May 2013 15:04:25 +0000Michelle Ma a familiar scenario – a patient receives a medical implant and days later, the body attacks the artificial valve or device, causing complications to an already compromised system.\n\nExpensive, state-of-the-art medical devices and surgeries often are thwarted by the body's natural response to attack something in the tissue that appears foreign. Now, University of Washington engineers have demonstrated in mice a way to prevent this sort of response. Their findings were published online this week in the journal Nature Biotechnology.\n\nLei Zhang, UW\n\nThese images show differences in collagen build-up in two tissue samples. Collagen is labeled in blue. The left image shows a thick collagen wall forming in the presence of a material that's widely used for implantable devices. In contrast, collagen in the right image is more evenly dispersed in the tissue after the UW-engineered hydrogel has been implanted.\n\nThe UW researchers created a synthetic substance that fully resists the body's natural attack response to foreign objects. Medical devices such as artificial heart valves, prostheses and breast implants could be coated with this polymer to prevent the body from rejecting an implanted object.\n\n\"It has applications for so many different medical implants, because we literally put hundreds of devices into the body,\" said Buddy Ratner, co-author and a UW professor of bioengineering and of chemical engineering. \"We couldn't achieve this level of excellence in healing before we had this synthetic hydrogel.\"\n\nThe body's biological response to implanted devices – medical technologies that often cost millions to develop – has frustrated experts for years. After an implant, the body usually creates a protein wall around the medical device, cutting it off from the rest of the body. Scientists call this barrier a collagen capsule. Collagen is a protein that's naturally found in our bodies, particularly in connective tissues such as tendons and ligaments.\n\nIf a device such as an artificial valve or an electrode sensor is blocked off from the rest of the body, it usually fails to work. Physicians and scientists have tried to minimize this, but they haven't been able to eliminate it, Ratner said.\n\nRatner's collaborator and co-author Shaoyi Jiang, a UW professor of chemical engineering, and his team implanted the polymer substance into the bodies of mice. The substance is known as a hydrogel, a flexible biomedical material swollen with water. It's made from a polymer that has both a positive and negative charge, which serves to deflect all proteins from sticking to its surface. Scientists have found that proteins appearing on the surface of a medical implant are the first signs that a larger collagen wall will form.\n\nAfter three months, Jiang and his team found that collagen was loosely and evenly distributed in the tissue around the polymer, suggesting that the mice bodies didn't even detect the polymer's presence.\n\nFor humans, the first three weeks after an implant are the most critical, because by then the body will show signs of isolating the implant by building a collagen wall. If this hasn't happened in the first several weeks, it's likely the body won't default to an attack response toward the object.\n\n\"Scientists have tried many materials, and with no exception, this is the first non-porous, synthetic substance demonstrating that no collagen capsule forms, which could have positive implications for implantable materials, tissue scaffolds and medical devices,\" Jiang said.\n\nUW researchers and others have worked for nearly 20 years to find a way to help the body accept implants. In 1996, the National Science Foundation-funded UW Engineered Biomaterials (UWEB) research center opened at the UW, with Ratner serving as director. Since that time, researchers have been trying to make a material that is invisible to the body's immune response and could eliminate the body's negative reaction to medical implants.\n\nNow, nearly two decades years later, engineers have found the \"perfect\" substance, Ratner said.\n\n\"This hydrogel is not just pretty good, it's exceptional,\" he said.\n\nThe UW researchers plan to test this in humans, likely by working with manufacturers to coat an implantable device with the polymer, then measure its ability to ward off protein build-up.\n\nThe research was funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research, UWEB and the UW Department of Chemical Engineering.\n\n###\n\nFor more information, contact Ratner at ratner@uw.edu or 206-685-1005 and Jiang at sjiang@uw.edu. Jiang is traveling this week and is available by email first year will help incoming freshmen acclimate to university-level courses and workload and prepare to major in an engineering discipline. The students will receive extra advising and a detailed course plan to help lay a strong foundation in engineering. At the UW, they will earn a spot in one of the school's 10 engineering departments starting their second year.\n\nDawn Wiggin\n\nMath Academy students from 2012 are shown after a workshop. The summer program at UW could be a feeder program for the new \"academic redshirt\" initiative.\n\n\"Engineering education needs to adapt to the tortoises, not just the hares,\" said Eve Riskin, UW associate dean of engineering and program lead for the UW. \"We're talking about investing an extra year in what will hopefully be a 30-year engineering career.\"\n\nThe initiative, called the Washington State Academic RedShirt in Engineering Program –STARS, for short – is funded by a National Science Foundation grant awarded May 8. Eight other colleges and universities also will receive grants to help increase retention of undergraduates in engineering and computer sciences.\n\nUnder the five-year grant, the UW and WSU will enroll 32 freshmen from Washington high schools each year for a total of 320 students after five years. Both universities will hire a person to oversee the program, and they hope to keep it running indefinitely. The first 64 students will begin this fall.\n\n\"More and more, we're seeing students who are bright, but they've gone to a high school where the college preparation isn't good,\" said Bob Olsen, a WSU associate dean of engineering and lead of the redshirt program at WSU.\n\nThe program specifically targets low-income, motivated high school students in Washington state who are eligible for federal Pell Grants – financial aid based on family income and the cost of attending a university – or go to high schools where a high percentage of the students are on free or reduced-price lunches. Such students usually have a lower retention rate at the university level and are more likely to struggle in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n\n\"Pell Grant students receive engineering degrees at significantly lower rates than non-Pell Grant students,\" Riskin said. \"This is unfortunate, because low-income students could most benefit from a lucrative engineering career.\"\n\nThe Mathematics Academy, a summertime month-long intensive at the UW for high school students, could be a feeder for this new program in the state.\n\nThe UW will receive $970,000 over five years from the National Science Foundation to offer this program to incoming freshmen, and WSU will receive $700,000. Students in the UW cohort will get at least $2,000 in additional assistance from the College of Engineering as well as funding from traditional scholarship sources. These students will live in an engineering residential community.\n\nThe National Science Foundation partnered with Intel Corp. and General Electric Co. to fund the nine institutions for a total of $10 million in a grant called Graduate 10K+. Other funded schools include Cornell University, Syracuse University and California State University Monterey Bay. The Washington program is modeled after the Engineering GoldShirt Program at University of Colorado Boulder, now headed into its fifth year.\n\nThe UW will hire a full-time staff member to work with students in the five-year program. Dawn Wiggin and Scott Winter, associate directors in engineering's student academic services, are collaborators.\n\n###\n\nFor more information, contact Riskin at riskin@uw.edu or 206-685-2313.

Look for old favorites such as the glowing pickle exhibit, homemade silly putty and flame movement demonstrations. You may also spot a water rocket, human-powered submarine and a life-sized robot.\n\nSome new exhibits on this year's program are wool dying, game demonstrations from the Center for Game Science and solar cell-powered toy car races. There will also be a scavenger hunt in which students visit various stations to find answers to baffling and quirky science questions.\n\nBoth days are free and open to everyone, but organizers ask that attendees register online. Close to 10,000 visitors are expected over the two days to this nearly century-old UW event.\n\nOrganizers recommend avoiding driving on campus during the event. Public transit and parking are available.\n\nPhotos from this year's event will be posted on the Engineering Discovery Days Facebook page.\n\nNotkin came to the UW in 1984 after receiving his doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University. He served as chair of the computer science and engineering department from 2001 to 2006, helping to open the Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science & Engineering. He most recently served as the College of Engineering's associate dean of research and graduate studies.\n\nNotkin's research was in software engineering, with a particular focus in software evolution. He received a number of awards for his work, including a National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award and the UW Distinguished Graduate Mentor Award.\n\nIn February, hundreds of Notkin's friends honored him at Notkinfest, a tribute to his personal and professional contributions. The graduate student fellowship was announced at the event.\n\nA memorial service will be held at Bikur Cholim Cemetery in Seattle at 3 p.m., April 23. All are welcome to attend.

But when exposed to sugar, some of the proteins no longer could perform their function, according to findings published online April 15 in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\nJiangyu Li, UW\n\nThe blue spots in this image show where glucose has halted ferroelectric switching in an elastin protein.\n\nThe property, called ferroelectricity, is a response to an electric field in which a molecule switches from having a positive to a negative charge. Only recently discovered in animal tissues, researchers have traced this property to elastin and found that when exposed to sugar, the elastin protein sometimes slows or stops its ferroelectric switching. This could lead to the hardening of those tissues and, ultimately, degrade an artery or ligament.\n\n\"This finding is important because it tells us the origin of the ferroelectric switching phenomenon and also suggests it's not an isolated occurrence in one type of tissue as we thought,\" said co-corresponding author Li, a UW associate professor of mechanical engineering. \"This could be associated with aging and diabetes, which I think gives more importance to the phenomenon.\"\n\nAbout a year ago, Li and collaborators discovered ferroelectric switching in mammalian tissues, a surprising first for the field. Ferroelectricity is common in synthetic materials and is used for displays, memory storage and sensors. Li's research team found that the wall of a pig's aorta, the largest blood vessel carrying blood to the heart, exhibits ferroelectric switching properties.\n\nLi said that discovery left researchers with a lot of questions, including whether this property is found in other soft tissues and the health implications of its presence. Observing differences in ferroelectric behavior at the protein level has helped to answer some of those questions.\n\nThe research team separated the aortic tissue into two types of proteins, collagen and elastin. Fibrous collagen is widespread in biological tissues, while elastin has only been found in animals with a backbone. Elastin, as its name suggests, is springy and helps the heart and lungs stretch and contract. Ferroelectric switching gives elastin the flexibility needed to perform repeated pulses as with an artery.\n\nWhen researchers treated the elastin with sugar, they found that glucose suppressed ferroelectric switching by up to 50 percent. This interaction between sugar and protein mimics a natural process called glycation, in which sugar molecules attach to proteins, degrading their structure and function. Glycation happens naturally when we age and is associated with a number of diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure and arteriosclerosis, a thickening and hardening of the arteries.\n\nThe research team has focused solely on the aortic tissues, but this finding likely applies to other biological tissues that have the protein elastin, such as the lungs and skin.\n\n\"I would expect the same phenomena will be observed in those tissues and organs as well,\" Li said. \"It will be more common than what we originally thought.\"\n\nResearchers next will drill down even more to look at the molecular mechanics of ferroelectric switching and further try to connect the process with disease onset.\n\nCo-authors are Yuanming Liu, Nataly Q. Chen and Feiyue Ma at the UW, and Zhang, Yunjie Wang and Ming-Jay Chow at Boston University.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the UW and a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship.\n.\n\n.\n\nEnvironmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory and UW\n\nA web-like, gel structure is formed after fluid passes through the flow device.

The end result is a gel-like substance that's more viscous and elastic.\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nA diagram showing how the microfluidics device works. Water mixed with salt and soap is injected into a spout (left back).

Shen has presented her initial findings at Procter & Gamble Co.\n\n\"What we can provide are all of the important parameters for operating conditions so companies can have an industrial design to achieve their goals,\" Shen said.\n\n.\n\n]]> powered by nuclear fusion could send humans to Mars\n 04 Apr 2013 15:36:25 +0000Michelle Ma travel to Mars has long been the unachievable dangling carrot for space programs. Now, astronauts could be a step closer to our nearest planetary neighbor through a unique manipulation of nuclear fusion, the same energy that powers the sun and stars.\n\n\n\nUniversity of Washington, MSNW\n\nA concept image of a spacecraft powered by a fusion-driven rocket. In this image, the crew would be in the forward-most chamber. Solar panels on the sides would collect energy to initiate the process that creates fusion.\n\n\"Using existing rocket fuels, it's nearly impossible for humans to explore much beyond Earth,\" said lead researcher John Slough, a UW research associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics. \"We are hoping to give us a much more powerful source of energy in space that could eventually lead to making interplanetary travel commonplace.\"\n\nThe project is funded through NASA's Innovative Advanced Concepts Program. Last month at a symposium, Slough and his team from MSNW, of which he is president, presented their mission analysis for a trip to Mars, along with detailed computer modeling and initial experimental results. Theirs was one of a handful of projects awarded a second round of funding last fall after already receiving phase-one money in a field of 15 projects chosen from more than 700 proposals.\n\nNASA estimates a round-trip human expedition to Mars would take more than four years using current technology. The sheer amount of chemical rocket fuel needed in space would be extremely expensive – the launch costs alone would be more than $12 billion.\n\nSlough and his team have published papers calculating the potential for 30- and 90-day expeditions to Mars using a rocket powered by fusion, which would make the trip more practical and less costly.\n\nBut is this really feasible?\n\nSlough and his colleagues at MSNW think so. They have demonstrated successful lab tests of all portions of the process. Now, the key will be combining each isolated test into a final experiment that produces fusion using this technology, Slough said.\n\nThe research team has developed a type of plasma that is encased in its own magnetic field. Nuclear fusion occurs when this plasma is compressed to high pressure with a magnetic field. The team has successfully tested this technique in the lab.\n\nOnly a small amount of fusion is needed to power a rocket – a small grain of sand of this material has the same energy content as 1 gallon of rocket fuel.\n\nTo power a rocket, the team has devised a system in which a powerful magnetic field causes large metal rings to implode around this plasma, compressing it to a fusion state. The converging rings merge to form a shell that ignites the fusion, but only for a few microseconds. Even though the compression time is very short, enough energy is released from the fusion reactions to quickly heat and ionize the shell. This super-heated, ionized metal is ejected out of the rocket nozzle at a high velocity. This process is repeated every minute or so, propelling the spacecraft.\n\nIn the video below, the plasma (purple) is injected while lithium metal rings (green) rapidly collapse around the plasma, creating fusion.\n\nThe UW-MSNW team has successfully demonstrated the metal-crushing process in the UW Plasma Dynamics Laboratory in Redmond. The video below, taken from a 3-D computer simulation, shows three lithium rings as they collapse around plasma material.\n\nThe team had a sample of the collapsed, fist-sized aluminum ring resulting from one of those tests on hand for people to see and touch at the recent NASA symposium.\n\n\"I think everybody was pleased to see confirmation of the principal mechanism that we're using to compress the plasma,\" Slough said. \"We hope we can interest the world with the fact that fusion isn't always 40 years away and doesn't always cost $2 billion.\"\n\nNow, the team is working to bring it all together by using the technology to compress the plasma and create nuclear fusion. Slough hopes to have everything ready for a first test at the end of the summer.\n\nThe Plasma Dynamics Lab – where Slough and colleagues, including UW graduate students, build and conduct experiments – is filled wall-to-wall with blue capacitors that hold energy, each functioning like a high-voltage battery. The capacitors are hooked up to a giant magnet that houses the chamber where the fusion reaction will take place. With the flip of a switch, the capacitors are simultaneously triggered to deliver 1 million amps of electricity for a fraction of a second to the magnet, which quickly compresses the metal ring.\n\nUniversity of Washington, MSNW\n\nThe fusion driven rocket test chamber at the UW Plasma Dynamics Lab in Redmond. The green vacuum chamber is surrounded by two large, high-strength aluminum magnets. These magnets are powered by energy-storage capacitors through the many cables connected to them.\n\nThe mechanical process and equipment used are reasonably straightforward, which Slough said supports their design working in space.\n\n\"Anything you put in space has to function in a fairly simple manner,\" he said. \"You can extrapolate this technology to something usable in space.\"\n\nIn actual space travel, scientists would use lithium metal as the crushing rings to power the rocket. Lithium is very reactive, and for lab-testing purposes, aluminum works just as well, Slough said.\n\nNuclear fusion may draw concern because of its application in nuclear bombs, but its use in this scenario is very different, Slough said. The fusion energy for powering a rocket would be reduced by a factor of 1 billion from a hydrogen bomb, too little to create a significant explosion. Also, Slough's concept uses a strong magnetic field to contain the fusion fuel and guide it safely away from the spacecraft and any passengers within.\n\nResearch partners are Anthony Pancotti, David Kirtley and George Votroubek, all of MSNW; Christopher Pihl, research engineer in aeronautics and astronautics at UW; andMichael Pfaff, a UW doctoral student in aeronautics and astronautics.\n\n###\n\nFor more information, contact Slough at 425-319-5024 or sloughj@uw.edu.Michael Regnier, UW professor and vice chair of bioengineering, Charles Murry, director of the Center for Cardiovascular Biology and co-director of the Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, and Sarah Nowakowski, a UW graduate student in bioengineering, led the study. The findings appeared online March 25 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nNormally, muscle contraction is powered by a molecule, the nucleotide called adenosine-5′-triphosphate, or ATP. Other naturally occurring nucleotides can also power muscle contraction, but in most cases they have proven to be less effective than ATP.\n\nDr. Charles Murry in his heart muscle cell research lab.\n\nIn an earlier study of isolated muscle, however, Regnier, Murry and their colleagues had found that one naturally occurring molecule, called 2 deoxy-ATP, or dATP, was actually more effective than ATP in powering muscle contraction. dATP increased both the speed and force of the contraction, at least over the short-term.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers wanted to see whether this effect could be sustained. To do this, they used genetic engineering to create a strain of mice whose cells produced higher-than-normal levels of an enzyme called ribonucleotide reductase. This enzyme converts the precursor of ATP, adenosine-5'-diphosphate or ADP, to dADP, which, in turn, is rapidly converted to dATP.\n\nDr. Michael Regnier holds a model of a heart in one hand, and a hand weight in another.\n\n\"This fundamental discovery, that dATP can act as a 'super-fuel' for the contractile machinery of the heart, or myofilaments, opens up the possibility to treat a variety of heart failure conditions,\" Regnier, an established investigator of the American Heart Association, said. \"An exciting aspect of this study and our ongoing work is that a relatively small increase in dATP in the heart cells has a big effect on heart performance.\"\n\nThe researchers found that increased production of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase increased the concentration of dATP within heart cells approximately tenfold. Even though this level was still less than one to two percent of the cell's total pool of ATP, the increase led to a sustained improvement in heart muscle function. The genetically engineered hearts contracted more quickly and with greater force.\n\n\"It looks as though we may have stumbled on an important pathway that nature uses to regulate heart contractility,\" Murry added. \"The same pathway that heart cells use to make the building blocks for DNA during embryonic growth makes dATP to supercharge contraction when the adult heart is mechanically stressed.\"\n\nImportantly, the elevated dATP effect was achieved without imposing additional metabolic demands on the cells. That observation suggests that the modification would not harm the cell's functioning over the long-term.\n\nThe study's findings, the authors write, suggest that treatments that elevate dATP levels in heart cells may prove to be an effective treatment for heart failure.\n\nThe work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program.\n\n###\n\nBEAT BioTherapeutics, a private company spinout from the UW, has entered into an exclusive global license agreement covering this technology and is moving forward with clinical development.

In the top panel, two biomarkers are stained green and red, and in the bottom, after the sample has been regenerated, the same biomarkers are stained red and green. This shows that the same tissue can be used for multiple rounds of testing without degrading the tissue sample.\n\n\"Discovering this process is an unprecedented breakthrough for the field,\" said corresponding author Xiaohu Gao, a UW associate professor of bioengineering. \"This technology opens up exciting opportunities for single-cell analysis and clinical diagnosis.\"\n\nThe research builds on current methods that use a smaller array of colors to point out a cell's biomarkers – characteristics that indicate a special, and potentially abnormal or diseased, cell. Ideally, scientists would be able to test for a large number of biomarkers, then rely on the patterns that emerge from those tests to understand a cell's properties.\n\nThe UW research team has created a cycle process that allows scientists to test for up to 100 biomarkers in a single cell. Before, researchers could only test for 10 at a time.\n\nThe analysis uses quantum dots, which are fluorescent balls of semiconductor material. Quantum dots are the smaller version of the material found in many electronics, including smartphones and radios. These quantum dots are between 2 and 6 nanometers in diameter, and they vary on the color they emit depending on their size.\n\nCyclical testing hasn't been done before, though many quantum dot papers have tried to expand the number of biomarkers tested for in a single cell. This method essentially reuses the same tissue sample, testing for biomarkers in groups of 10 in each round.\n\nScott Manthey\n\nXiaohu Gao, left, and Pavel Zrazhevskiy in a UW bioengineering lab.\n\n\"Proteins are the building blocks for cell function and cell behavior, but their makeup in a cell is highly complex,\" Gao said. \"You need to look at a number of indicators (biomarkers) to know what's going on.\"\n\nThe new process works like this: Gao and his team purchase antibodies that are known to bind with the specific biomarkers they want to test for in a cell. They pair quantum dots with the antibodies in a fluid solution, injecting it onto a tissue sample. Then, they use a microscope to look for the presence of fluorescent colors in the cell. If they see particular quantum dot colors in the tissue sample, they know the corresponding biomarker is present in the cell.\n\nAfter completing one cycle, Gao and co-author Pavel Zrazhevskiy, a UW postdoctoral associate in bioengineering, inject a low-pH fluid into the cell tissue that neutralizes the color fluorescence, essentially wiping the sample clean for the next round. Remarkably, the tissue sample doesn't degrade at all even after 10 such cycles, Gao said.\n\nXiaohu Gao\n\nThis figure shows the cyclical process developed in the study. In step 1, the colored balls representing quantum dots of different colors are used to label biomarkers in cell and tissue samples. Step 2 shows how each biomarker can be isolated and separated into distinct images for analysis. Step 3 illustrates how the tissue sample is flushed clean between rounds to begin biomarker testing again.\n\nFor cancer research and treatment, in particular, it's important to be able to look at a single cell at high resolution to examine its details. For example, if 99 percent of cancer cells in a person's body respond to a treatment drug, but 1 percent doesn't, it's important to analyze and understand the molecular makeup of that 1 percent that responds differently.\n\n\"When you treat with promising drugs, there are still a few cells that usually don't respond to treatment,\" said Gao. \"They look the same, but you don't have a tool to look at their protein building blocks. This will really help us develop new drugs and treatment approaches.\"\n\nThe process is relatively low-cost and simple, and Gao hopes the procedure can be automated. He envisions a chamber to hold the tissue sample, and wire-thin pumps to inject and vacuum out fluid between cycles. A microscope underneath the chamber would take photos during each stage. All of the images would be quantified on a computer, where scientists and physicians could look at the intensity and prevalence of colors.\n\nGao hopes to collaborate with companies and other researchers to move toward an automated process and clinical use.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Defense, the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation and the UW's Department of Bioengineering.\n\n###\n\nFor more information, contact Gao at 206-543-6562 or xgao@uw.edu.

Bragg, professor and interim dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has been selected as dean of the University of Washington College of Engineering, effective July 15, 2013, UW President Michael Young and Provost Ana Mari Cauce announced today. The appointment is subject to approval of the UW Board of Regents.\n\n\"We are very excited that Mike Bragg will be joining us as our next dean of engineering,\" said Young. \"He is a renowned expert in aerospace engineering and a proven leader who gets results. Educating engineers is crucial to our economic future in the state, and Mike is a visionary educator who understands this issue. He is coming from one great engineering program to another, and we are certain he will build on the excellent work being done in the College.\"\n\nAn aeronautical engineer by training, Bragg has held numerous leadership positions at the University of Illinois, including head of the aerospace engineering department, associate dean for research and administrative affairs, executive associate dean for academic affairs, and interim dean in the College of Engineering.\n\nBragg taught aerodynamics and flight mechanics at the undergraduate and graduate level and received department, college and university-level recognition for his teaching and advising. More than 50 graduate students and five post- doctoral researchers received their advanced degrees under Bragg's guidance.\n\nBragg's primary area of research is aircraft icing where he is an international expert on the effect of ice accretion on aircraft aerodynamics and flight safety. He directed over $15 million in externally funded research and published more than 200 research papers. He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and has received several national awards for his work.\n\nAs associate dean for research and administration, Bragg oversaw the administration of all personnel and financial matters in the college, all physical facilities, and administration of the research program and the graduate programs. As executive associate dean for academic affairs he was responsible for all faculty and academic personnel and the strategic management of the over $300 million budget of the college.\n\nHe has been instrumental in curriculum innovation in the college, including supervision of the Technology Entrepreneurial Center and is a co-founder of two faculty startup companies at Illinois.\n\nBragg has grown education programs and championed diversity. As a department head, he increased the department's graduate program by 30 percent and more than doubled the percentage of women in graduate school and on the department's faculty. At the college level he has been instrumental in developing innovative programs to recruit a more diverse engineering faculty.\n\nBragg received a bachelor's degree in 1976, a master's degree in 1977 (both in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), and a doctorate from The Ohio State University in 1981. He was a faculty member at Ohio State from 1981 to 1989.\n\nHis annual salary will be $340,000.\n\nThe College of Engineering is developing a new generation of innovators.

Today these are hard and brittle materials. But cheap, flexible, nontoxic organic molecules may play a role in the future of hardware.\n\nA team led by the University of Washington in Seattle and the Southeast University in China discovered a molecule that shows promise as an organic alternative to today's silicon-based semiconductors. The findings, published this week in the journal Science, display properties that make it well suited to a wide range of applications in memory, sensing and low-cost energy storage.\n\nJiangyu Li, UW\n\nElectrical response of the newly developed organic crystal.\n\n\"This molecule is quite remarkable, with some of the key properties that are comparable with the most popular inorganic crystals,\" said co-corresponding author Jiangyu Li, a UW associate professor of mechanical engineering.\n\nThe carbon-based material could offer even cheaper ways to store digital information; provide a flexible, nontoxic material for medical sensors that would be implanted in the body; and create a less costly, lighter material to harvest energy from natural vibrations.\n\nThe new molecule is a ferroelectric, meaning it is positively charged on one side and negatively charged on the other, where the direction can be flipped by applying an electrical field. Synthetic ferroelectrics are now used in some displays, sensors and memory chips.\n\nIn the study the authors pitted their molecule against barium titanate, a long-known ferroelectric material that is a standard for performance. Barium titanate is a ceramic crystal and contains titanium; it has largely been replaced in industrial applications by better-performing but lead-containing alternatives.\n\nThe new molecule holds its own against the standard-bearer. It has a natural polarization, a measure of how strongly the molecules align to store information, of 23, compared to 26 for barium titanate. To Li's knowledge this is the best organic ferroelectric discovered to date.\n\nA recent study in Nature announced an organic ferroelectric that works at room temperature. By contrast, this molecule retains its properties up to 153 degrees Celsius (307 degrees F), even higher than for barium titanate.\n\nThe new molecule also offers a full bag of electric tricks. Its dielectric constant – a measure of how well it can store energy – is more than 10 times higher than for other organic ferroelectrics. And it's also a good piezoelectric, meaning it's efficient at converting movement into electricity, which is useful in sensors.\n\nThe organic crystal is made from bromine, a natural element isolated from sea salt, mixed with carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen (its full name is diisopropylammonium bromide). Researchers dissolved the elements in water and evaporated the liquid to grow the crystal. Because the molecule contains carbon, it is organic, and pivoting chemical bonds allow it to flex.\n\nThe molecule would not replace current inorganic materials, Li said, but it could be used in applications where cost, ease of manufacturing, weight, flexibility and toxicity are important.\n\n\"Ferroelectrics are pretty remarkable materials,\" Li said. \"It allows you to manipulate mechanical energy, electrical energy, optics and electromagnetics, all in a single package.\"\n\nHe is working to further characterize this new molecule and explore its combined electric and mechanical properties. He also plans to continue the search for more organic ferroelectrics.\n\nThe joint first authors of the new paper are Yuanming Liu, a UW postdoctoral researcher in mechanical engineering, and Da-Wei Fu, a doctoral student working with co-corresponding author Ren-Gen Xiong at Southeast University. Other co-authors are Hong-Ling Cai, Qiong Ye, Wen Zhang and Yi Zhang at Southeast University; Xue-Yuan Chen at the Chinese Academy of Sciences; and Gianluca Giovannetti and Massimo Capone at the Italian National Simulation Centre.\n\nThe research was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, China's National Natural Science Foundation and the European Research Council.\n\n]]> Pacific NW National Lab join forces on computing research\n 09 Jan 2013 17:19:34 +0000Hannah Hickey University of Washington and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have announced the creation of the Northwest Institute for Advanced Computing, a joint institute based at the UW that will foster collaborative computing research between the two institutions.\n\nCo-directors Vikram Jandhyala and Moe Khaleel\n\n\"This collaboration will open up new avenues for research,\" said co-director Vikram Jandhyala, UW professor and chair of electrical engineering, who leads the Applied Computational Engineering Lab. \"We are creating an interdisciplinary place to work with colleagues at PNNL on data-intensive science and engineering.\"\n\n\"The expanded partnership between UW and PNNL will create tremendous new opportunities for both organizations,\" said Ed Lazowska, professor of computer science and engineering. \"Big data is transforming the process of discovery in all fields. UW and PNNL have significant and complementary strengths.\"\n\nLazowska leads the eScience Institute, created in 2008 to support data-driven discovery at the UW. Many of the roughly dozen UW faculty who will be involved with the new group at its launch are eScience Institute affiliates.\n\nThe new institute will initially draw from the UW's departments of Computer Science & Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Applied Math, but all UW faculty whose work advances data-driven discovery and large-scale computing will be invited to affiliate.\n\nPacific Northwest National Laboratory already has two scientists based at the UW who are conducting Department of Energy research related to big data and nuclear physics. About eight more PNNL researchers are expected to join them in UW's Sieg Hall by the end of 2013.\n\nOther researchers will join the center but stay in their existing labs.\n\nJandhyala also hopes to develop relationships with the region's business and startup communities.\n\n\"In the short term, we aim to promote collaboration among university and government scientists who are working with big data,\" he said. \"In the longer term, we hope this becomes a Northwest hub for advanced computing research.\"\n\nInitial projects will include algorithms and software for large graph analyses, smart grid simulation and encryption for cloud computing. The institute will draw on UW expertise in computer science, engineering, applied math and natural sciences, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory expertise in designing high-performance computers and running large-scale environmental simulations.\n\n]]> Ramey appointed interim dean of UW College of Engineering\n 07 Jan 2013 20:07:38 +0000Hannah Hickey Ramey, professor and former chair in the UW's Department of Human Centered Design and Engineering, this month steps into the role of Frank & Julie Jungers Interim Dean of the University of Washington's College of Engineering.\n\n\"I'm honored to have been chosen for this position,\" Ramey said. \"I'm excited to have the opportunity to keep the college on course during the transition to a new dean.\"\n\nRamey joined the UW in 1983 as a faculty member in what was then known as the Department of Technical of Communication, now Human Centered Design and Engineering. She led the department from 1997 until 2008.\n\n\"Dean Ramey has had a distinguished career and is a respected leader in the college,\" said UW Provost Ana Mari Cauce. \"I am grateful for her willingness to serve as dean during this transitional period and look forward to working with her until a new dean is in place. Having solid leadership during this time is critical to the continuing success of the college.\"\n\nThe appointment is subject to approval by the Board of Regents.\n\nJudith Ramey\n\nRamey earned a doctorate at the University of Texas in Austin and went on to become an expert in usability research and testing. In 1990 she founded the nation's first academic usability testing lab, the UW's Laboratory for Usability Testing and Evaluation, and served as its director for more than two decades. She is author of numerous research articles including influential papers on the emergence of usability testing, the use of participants' thinking-aloud in usability testing and, most recently, on the design of better self-service systems.\n\nDuring her tenure as chair the UW became internationally recognized in the emerging field of technical communication. Ramey led development of the department's doctoral degree program and its professional master's program, one of the first to be offered in the College of Engineering. She also helped design a new, interdisciplinary professional master's in Human-Computer Interaction and Design set to launch in the fall. She is a fellow of the Society for Technical Communication and a member of the Association of Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction, and she has held adjunct appointments in the Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering and the Information School.\n\nO'Donnell will spend this year traveling with his wife Cathy to visit research collaborators in Belgium, Taiwan and Pittsburgh. He is principal investigator for two grants from the National Institutes of Health and will return to his research in medical imaging in the Department of Bioengineering.\n\nDr. Mark Snowden, Harborview chief of psychiatry, discusses the implementation of an innovative depression treatment, PEARLS (Program to Encourage Active, Rewarding Lives), with a group of administrators.\n\nUW Training Xchange is on a mission to put more new therapies, tools, and process improvements into the hands of healthcare practitioners and other professionals for the benefit of millions of people. Life-saving advances continually emerge from faculty labs and clinics at the University of Washington, which is one of the nation's largest recipients of federal research funding for biomedical science.\n\nMost UW researchers publish journal articles about their new findings and proven methods, but many of their readers don't know how to adopt them. Faculty and graduate students do not have time to set up and promote training programs. To address the innovation adoption gap, the UW is expanding its Training Xchange initiative to enable researchers to transmit their innovations to healthcare workers and other professionals locally and far beyond the Northwest.\n\nDr. Paul Ciechanowski, director of Training XChange, with Allison Waddell, program manager, in front of the Center for Commercialization sign. Photo by Brian Donohue.\n\n\"The UW is one of the nation's leading centers for health, medical, and bioengineering research, and we'd like to see as many research advances out in the world making lives better for people, rather than sitting on a bookshelf. Training others in their use is a way to do this,\" said Dr. Paul Ciechanowski, UW associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and director of the Training Xchange. Ciechanowski co-developed the initiative with Dr. Richard Veith, chair of the UW Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences.\n\nTheir team created a training infrastructure that helps university researchers translate evidence-based information and methods from their labs and clinics into formats designed for wider dissemination.\n\nOfferings include a range of in-person and online training products through which trainees gain tangible skills and practical knowledge they can put to work immediately.\n\n\"Combining our faculty's expertise with the experience and platform of Training Xchange is a great way to bridge the gap between research and practice,\" Veith said.\n\nOne major initiative called TEAMcare brings a proven UW faculty intervention to medical clinics. It integrates mental health and medical services for people diagnosed with both depression and diabetes or coronary heart disease. TEAMcare results in better treatment that can save lives. A group led by Dr. Wayne Katon, UW professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, developed TEAMcare with assistance from Training Xchange. Success in promotion and early adoption of has earned the UW a $1 million award from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to expand the program as part of an $18 million national initiative to foster the widespread implementation of TEAMcare.\n\nAllison Waddell and Zandra Grissom from Training XChange present a poster about the program at a Center for Commercialization's Innovator Award Ceremony.\n\n\"Health professionals are eager to have concrete ways to help their patients, and the Training Xchange infrastructure makes it easier to transmit programs like TEAMcare,\" Katon said.\n\nTraining Xchange is already at work across the country. It has been teaching health professionals at a major national health system how to reduce debilitating anxiety in patients with an approach developed jointly by UW and UCLA. Clients for Training Xchange programs now include Harborview Medical Center and The Polyclinic in Seattle, the California Institute of Mental Health, the national offices of the Epilepsy Foundation in Maryland and others.\n\nAs a program within the university's Center for Commercialization, more commonly known as C4C, the Training Xchange has expanded from its early focus on healthcare to other training areas, such as education, computer science, and bioengineering.\n\n\"Over the coming years, we are committed to seeing more of our research outcomes in practice out in the world,\" said Fiona Wills, director of Technology Licensing at C4C. \"Training Xchange is a terrific option for our busy researchers to increase the visibility and impact of their innovations.\"\n\n]]> Dept. funds UW project to turn wasted natural gas into diesel\n 13 Dec 2012 21:52:34 +0000Hannah Hickey U.S. Department of Energy recently awarded a group led by the University of Washington $4 million to develop bacteria that can turn the methane in natural gas into diesel fuel for transportation.\n\n\"The product that we're shooting for will have the same fuel characteristics as diesel,\" said principal investigator Mary Lidstrom, a UW professor of chemical engineering and microbiology. \"It can be used in trucks, boats, buses, cars, tractors – anything that diesel does now.\"\n\nThe Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E, selected the UW-led project in its second major funding round that awarded 66 grants to U.S. universities, businesses and national labs. The Energy Department launched the agency in 2009 to support high-risk, potentially transformative energy research projects.\n\nThe UW engineers will work with scientists at the National Renewable Energy Lab and two industry partners. They will target the natural gas associated with oil fields, which is often flared off as waste, as well as so-called \"stranded\" natural gas reserves that are too small for a pipeline to be economically viable.\n\nThe team aims to capture that natural gas and use bacteria to turn its main component, methane, into a liquid fuel for transportation.\n\n\"The goal at the end of three years is to have an integrated process that will be ready for pre-commercialization pilot testing,\" Lidstrom said.\n\nThe four project partners have distinct roles. First, the UW team will develop a version of the bacteria that is even better at converting methane to energy-rich fatlike molecules. Then LanzaTech, Inc., an Illinois-based biofuels company, will develop a way to grow the new bacteria in larger quantities at high efficiency. Next the U.S. National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colo., will devise an efficient way to extract the energy-rich molecules from the microbe's cells. Finally, partners at Johnson Matthey, a U.K. chemical company, will use chemical catalysts to convert those molecules into diesel.\n\nAfter establishing a viable method, national lab scientists will work with the industry partners to develop an economic model that predicts manufacturing costs as production scales up.\n\nThe bacterium at the center of the effort comes from an alkaline salty lake near Mongolia. Team member Marina Kalyuzhnaya, a UW research associate professor in microbiology, discovered it during her graduate studies in Russia. The microbe can survive in harsh environments, consumes methane and uses it to build cells containing energy-rich lipids. At the UW, the microbe has been evolved to grow unusually fast, making it practical for industrial applications.\n\nOther members of the UW team are research assistant professor David Beck and senior research scientist Ludmila Chistoserdova, both in chemical engineering. The grant starts in February and lasts three years, with project milestones due every quarter.\n\n\"It's exciting,\" Lidstrom said. \"We have to hit the ground running. It's very ambitious but we believe this team is strong enough, and we know enough about what needs to be done that we will achieve our goal.\"\n\n]]> site compiles new sign language for math and science\n 07 Dec 2012 18:00:14 +0000Hannah Hickey multimedia feature published this week in the New York Times, \"Pushing Science's Limits in Sign Language Lexicon,\" outlines efforts in the United States and Europe to develop sign language versions of specialized terms used in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n\nThe article shares newly defined signs for terms like \"light-year,\" \"organism\" and \"photosynthesis.\" It also describes a successful crowdsourcing effort started at the University of Washington in 2008 that lets members of the deaf and hard-of-hearing community build their own guide to the evolving lexicon of science.\n\nA screen capture from the ASL-STEM Forum.\n\n\"It's not a dictionary,\" explained Richard Ladner, a UW professor of computer science and engineering. \"The goal of the forum is to be constantly changing, a reflection of the current use.\"\n\nA scientific and technical dictionary for American Sign Language has existed since the late 1990s. It is called Science Signs Lexicon, launched by Harry Lang, an early proponent of science in the deaf community and a professor at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf at Rochester Institute of Technology.\n\nBut a dictionary can't include the newest terms, Ladner said, and many graduate students won't find the specialized terms used in their chosen fields. For example, Ladner helped organize a 2008 workshop where a deaf scientist said only about one-quarter of his field's specialized terms existed in his native language, American Sign Language, or ASL. Many workshop participants reported that at some point they had had to work with their interpreters to develop their own code words.\n\nThat year, with funding from Google Corp. and the National Science Foundation, Ladner's group launched the ASL-STEM Forum, an online compilation of signs used in science, technology, engineering and math that is more like Wikipedia or the Urban Dictionary.\n\n\"The goal was to have one place where all these signs could be,\" Ladner said. \"We're not trying to decide on new signs but just collect the ones that are in current use.\"\n\nThe site lists 6,755 terms from biology, chemistry, engineering, math and computer science textbooks. Of those, about 2,800 have video entries, some with multiple entries. Partnerships with the country's two largest higher education institutions for deaf and hard-of-hearing students have helped provide content.\n\nCollaborators include Caroline Solomon, a UW alumna and biology professor at Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., and Lang and Raja Kushalnagar at Rochester's National Technical Institute for the Deaf.\n\nAnyone can visit the forum, but to add signs a user must create a free account then record a short video using a computer's camera that can be reviewed and uploaded. People also can rate and comment on signs uploaded by other users.\n\nMary Levin, UW\n\nRichard Ladner with students in a 2007 summer computing program.\n\nLadner hopes the recent article will spur interest and encourage people to suggest more entries among the remaining terms. He is seeking funding to update the site, and hopes it will reach critical mass among ASL speakers in scientific and technical fields.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2010, U.S. institutions awarded 301 doctorate degrees in STEM fields to people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, Ladner said. Because that number includes hard-of-hearing, the number of science PhDs who use ASL is likely much lower. Many members of that community are geographically scattered, and to make matters worse, American Sign Language and British Sign Language have their own technical lexicons.\n\n\"I hope ASL-STEM Forum helps more deaf students become scientists and engineers,\" Ladner said. \"And as more deaf students enter these fields they will hopefully contribute to the forum, making it sustainable and useful over time.\"\n\nNow working on the forum at the UW are Kyle Rector, a doctoral student in computer science and engineering, and John Norberg, a UW undergraduate in math who is minoring in ASL. Early members of the UW team include computer science and engineering doctoral students Anna Cavender, now working on accessibility projects at Google, and Jeffrey Bigham, now an accessibility researcher at the University of Rochester in New York; and former UW undergraduates Daniel Otero, Michelle Shepardson and Jessica Dewitt.\n\nLadner runs a national summer program to encourage deaf and hard-of-hearing students to pursue careers in computer science, and he leads AccessComputing, a larger UW-based national effort to encourage people with disabilities to pursue computing fields. His group is also involved in a number of research projects that combine computing, mobile technology and accessibility.\n\n]]> spun fabric offers dual defense against pregnancy, HIV\n 30 Nov 2012 17:43:13 +0000Hannah Hickey only way to protect against HIV and unintended pregnancy today is the condom. It's an effective technology, but not appropriate or popular in all situations.\n\nA University of Washington team has developed a versatile platform to simultaneously offer contraception and prevent HIV. Electrically spun cloth with nanometer-sized fibers can dissolve to release drugs, providing a platform for cheap, discrete and reversible protection.\n\nKim Woodrow, UW\n\nThe electrospun fibers can release chemicals or they can physically block sperm, as shown here.\n\nThe research was published this week in the Public Library of Science's open-access journal PLoS One. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation last month awarded the UW researchers almost $1 million to pursue the technology.\n or pills. No high temperatures are involved, so the method is suitable for heat-sensitive molecules. The fabric can also incorporate large molecules, such as proteins and antibodies, that are hard to deliver through other methods.\n\nAt a lab meeting last year, Woodrow presented the concept, and co-authors Emily Krogstad and Cameron Ball, both first-year graduate students, pursued the idea.\n\nKim Woodrow, UW\n\nFibers stick to a hard surface (top) and then can be removed to create a hollow ring (bottom left). Bottom right shows a closeup of the tiny fibers.\n\nThey first dissolved polymers approved by the Food and Drug Administration and antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV to create a gooey solution that passes through a syringe. As the stream encounters the electric field it stretches to create thin fibers measuring 100 to several thousand nanometers that whip through the air and eventually stick to a collecting plate (one nanometer is about one 25-millionth of an inch). The final material is a stretchy fabric that can physically block sperm or release chemical contraceptives and antivirals.\n\n\"This method allows controlled release of multiple compounds,\" Ball said. \"We were able to tune the fibers to have different release properties.\"\n\nOne of the fabrics they made dissolves within minutes, potentially offering users immediate, discrete protection against unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nAnother dissolves gradually over a few days, providing an option for sustained delivery, more like the birth-control pill, to provide contraception and guard against HIV.\n\nThe fabric could incorporate many fibers to guard against many different sexually transmitted infections, or include more than one anti-HIV drug to protect against drug-resistant strains (and discourage drug-resistant strains from emerging). Mixed fibers could be designed to release drugs at different times to increase their potency, like the prime-boost method used in vaccines.\n\nThe electrospun cloth could be inserted directly in the body or be used as a coating on vaginal rings or other products.\n\nElectrospinning has existed for decades, but it's only recently been automated to make it practical for applications such as filtration and tissue engineering. This is the first study to use nanofibers for vaginal drug delivery.\n\nWhile this technology is more discrete than a condom, and potentially more versatile than pills or plastic or rubber devices, researchers say there is no single right answer.\n\n\"At the time of sex, are people going to actually use it? That's where having multiple options really comes into play,\" Krogstad said. \"Depending on cultural background and personal preferences, certain populations may differ in terms of what form of technology makes the most sense for them.\"\n\nThe team is focusing on places like Africa where HIV is most common, but the technology could be used in the U.S. or other countries to offer birth control while also preventing one or more sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nThe research to date was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the UW's Center for AIDS Research. The other co-author on the paper is Thanyanan Chaowanachan, a UW postdoctoral researcher and longtime HIV expert.\n\nThe team will use the new Gates Foundation grant to evaluate the versatility and feasibility of their system. The group will hire more research staff and buy an electrospinning machine to make butcher-paper sized sheets. The expanded team will spend a year testing combinations that deliver two antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV and a hormonal contraceptive, and then six months scaling up production of the most promising materials.\n\n###\n\nFor more information, contact Woodrow at 206-685-6831 or woodrow@uw.edu.\n\n]]> devised for building ideal protein molecules from scratch\n 30 Nov 2012 00:32:29 +0000Leila Gray following certain rules, scientists can prepare architectural plans for building ideal protein molecules not found in the real world. Based on these computer renditions, previously non-existent proteins can be produced from scratch in the lab. The principles to make this happen appear this month in Nature magazine.\n\nLeila Gray\n\nRie Tatsumi-Koga (right) and Nobu Koga are a wife-and-husband scientific team who research protein design.\n\nThe lead authors are Nobuyasu Koga and Rie Tatsumi-Koga, a husband-and-wife scientific team in David Baker's lab at the UW Protein Design Institute.\n\nThe project benefited from hundreds of thousands of computer enthusiasts around the world who adopted Rosetta@home for simulating designed proteins.\n\nProtein molecules start as an unstable, high energy chain of amino acids. This chain then begins folding into various shapes to try to achieve a stable, low energy state. The end result is its distinctive molecular structure. Rosetta@home volunteers helped the project team to plot this energy landscape from protein structure predictions.\n\n\"The structural options become fewer as the interactions that stabilize the protein selectively favor one folding pattern over others,\" explained Koga. \"This decline in conformation options to eventually achieve a unique, ordered structure is called a funnel-shaped energy landscape,\" he said, drawing a tornado-like figure on a whiteboard. The researchers came up with guidelines for robustly generating this type of energy landscape.\n\nAccording to Tatsumi-Koga, these rules require the interactions among the residues in the protein's amino acid chain to consistently favor the same folded conformation in forming its molecular shape. This is made possible, for example, by defining whether a specific unit will form a \"right-handed\" orientation or its mirror image, and disfavor others.\n\nThe researchers, she said, synthesized the proteins they had originally designed and tested \"in silico\" (on the computer) and physically characterized them through \"in vitro\" (laboratory test tube) experiments. They also compared the molecular structures of the computer models with these laboratory-derived proteins to see how well they matched.\n\nKoga stressed that the project looked strictly at protein structure. He smiled as he said his group was striving toward a \"platonic ideal,\" a reference to Plato's theory of perfect forms. In our imperfect material world, proteins are not always optimized for their stability, but can be beset by bulges, kinks, strains, and improperly buried parts, and many diseases arise from protein malformations.\n\nDuring this project, the researchers achieved a library of five ideal structures, but since filing their report have added several more. To make them accessible to other scientists, the designs have been deposited in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics and the lab analysis of their chemical structure was put in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Database.\n\nThe team was not attempting to create specific new proteins that could carry out particular activities.\n\nHowever, their design principles and methods, according to their report, should allow the ready creation of a wide range of robust, stable, building blocks for the next generation of engineered functional proteins. Such proteins would be custom-made for the task, instead of repurposed from proteins with unrelated functions.\n\nLeila Gray\n\nThe UW Protein Design Institute is housed at the new UW Molecular Engineering Building.\n\nThe hope is that engineered proteins will be useful for drug and vaccine development, especially for formidable viruses like HIV or rapidly changing ones, like the flu. Proteins designed to exact specifications might also prove therapeutically useful in cleaving mutated genes, and for speeding up chemical reactions important in industry and environmental reclamation.\n\nThe Institute for Protein Design, directed by David Baker, was recently established at the UW and aims to design proteins to address 21st century challenges in medicine, energy and technology.\n\nThe project, Principles for designing ideal protein structures, was funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the U.S. Department of Energy, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIH grant U54 GMO94597. Koga also received a postdoctoral research fellowship from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.\n\n]]> Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics named for William E.

We are proud to recognize this amazing partnership in naming our outstanding department of aeronautics and astronautics for Bill Boeing.\"\n\nThe almost 100-year history began when William Edward Boeing founded the Boeing Airplane Co. in 1916 along the shores of Lake Union and hired two UW engineering graduates to work on his flying machines. Though Clairmont Egtvedt and Philip Johnson were mechanical engineering graduates, they went on to become presidents and general managers of the growing company.\n\nBoeing realized he needed trained aeronautical engineers as well as a facility to test new airplane designs. In 1917 he donated a wind tunnel to the UW, paid for with a personal gift of almost $6,000, on condition that the university would establish an aeronautics curriculum. The department had its early beginnings later that year.\n\nIn the 1920s, Boeing wrote on behalf of the university to the Guggenheim Fund for the Advancement of Aeronautics, and in 1928 the fund approved a grant of $290,000 for a building, renovated in 2007, that still houses UW Aeronautics & Astronautics.\n\nThe company and the department have grown together. In 1926, all but one member of Boeing's engineering department were UW graduates. In the 1940s most of Boeing's engineers still came from the UW, and even today the UW remains a primary supplier of engineering talent for the company. Thousands of UW alumni have gone on to work for the company, and company employees, faculty and students have carried out many joint research projects.\n\n\"We are thrilled with the University of Washington's decision to name its Department of Astronautics & Aeronautics for our founder, William E. Boeing. His name is on every product we design, every service we provide and every task we undertake,\" said Ray Conner, president and CEO for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. \"His vision and mandate for technical excellence and innovation lives on in the hearts and minds of Boeing employees, and we hope that the students who pass through the College of Engineering will be similarly inspired as they take their places as our future aerospace leaders.\"\n\nThrough the years, Boeing has invested nearly $80 million in the UW. In the 1980s, the company donated $2 million to upgrade the computer systems of a second wind tunnel, the Kirsten Wind Tunnel, that it helped fund in the 1930s. That tunnel is still operated by students and performs tests for UW students, faculty and external clients. In the 1990s, the company created a major faculty endowment to support engineering teaching and research.\n\nIn the past 10 years, nearly $20 million in Boeing funds have gone to the UW's College of Engineering for research, graduate scholarships and undergraduate student support.\n\nThe Boeing Co.\n\nWilliam E. Boeing and pilot Eddie Hubbard flew the first international mail flight to the U.S. on March 3, 1919 from Vancouver, B.C. to Seattle. UW alumnus Clairmont Egtvedt later designed the Model 40 plane that in 1927 won Boeing the contract to deliver mail from San Francisco to Chicago.\n\n\"It's difficult to think of a company that has had a greater impact on the aerospace industry worldwide than the company created by Bill Boeing,\" said James Hermanson, professor and chair of UW Aeronautics & Astronautics. \"Bill Boeing is considered a founding father of our department, which was one of the first aeronautical engineering programs in the nation.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled to be able to honor Bill Boeing and recognize the ongoing, vital partnership between the Boeing Company and the Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics, the College of Engineering, and all of the UW,\" Hermanson added. \"The company that Bill Boeing founded has played a vital role in our community of faculty, students and alumni.\"\n\nToday the UW's aeronautics and astronautics department has an enrollment of 153 undergraduates, 167 graduate students and 17 faculty members. In recent years, UW faculty have collaborated with Boeing on unmanned aerial vehicles and on lightweight, composite materials incorporated in the Boeing 787. Recently the company and the UW launched a joint post-graduate certificate programs for the analysis and design of composite materials and for integrated systems engineering.\n\nThe permanent naming honors nearly 100 years of partnership, and specifically recognizes William E. Boeing Sr. as the department's founding benefactor.\n\n\"Both my father and the University of Washington understood very early in the development of commercial aviation how big the industry would become, and how much it would impact people's everyday lives,\" said William E. (Bill) Boeing Jr. \"My family and I are very pleased to have the aero department named in his honor to permanently link two aeronautics pioneers.\""

Of all piezoelectric materials, PZT is the most efficient and is able to convert 80 per cent of the mechanical energy applied to it into electrical energy.\n\n'PZT is 100 times more efficient than quartz, another piezoelectric material,' said Michael McAlpine, an assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton, who led the project. 'You don't generate that much power from walking or breathing, so you want to harness it as efficiently as possible.\n\n'Fabrication started with the researchers producing PZT nanoribbons - strips so narrow that 100 fit side by side in a space of a millimetre. In a separate process, they embedded the ribbons into clear sheets of silicone rubber, creating what they call 'piezo-rubber chips'.\n\n'Silicone, which is used for cosmetic implants and medical devices, already is biocompatible. 'The new electricity-harvesting devices could be implanted in the body to perpetually power medical devices and the body wouldn't reject them,' McAlpine said.\n\nIn addition to generating electricity when it is flexed, the opposite is true - the material flexes when electrical current is applied to it. This opens the door to other kinds of applications, such as use for microsurgical devices, McAlpine said.\n\n'The beauty of this is that it's scalable,' said Yi Qi, a postdoctoral researcher who works with McAlpine. 'As we get better at making these chips, we'll be able to make larger and larger sheets of them that will harvest more energy"

      "text": "Posted\nby\nScuttleMonkeyon Wednesday March 14, 2007 @12:14PM from the jiggle-handle-below dept.\n\npwp writes to mention that researchers at the University of New Brunswick are reporting they have found a new method of storing hydrogen gas. The new method is able to condense hydrogen gas into a usable solid under mild conditions. \"Hydrogen gas is typically stored under pressure in large metal cylinders, approximately four feet high. These cylinders are heavy and expensive to transport. Since they are under pressure, they also pose a safety hazard. 'We've reached a milestone with our ability to condense hydrogen into a usable solid,' said Dr. McGrady. 'The next step is to produce a safe, compact storage system for the compound that is both lightweight and affordable.' The research is expected to produce reversible hydrogen storage materials that can be processed into a powder for use in limitless commercial applications.\"\n\nThis article has absolutly vague information on what research they are doing. Storing hydrogen as a solid, apparetly as a powder? What would be interesting is to see how much energy is lost in the chemical reactions of reacting hydrogen with whatever they react it with and then changing it back into hydrogen gas. I would also like to see how this compares to the energy required to compress hydrogen as it is currently done. This is what will determine this technologies usefulness in reality.\n\nOnly nine percent hydrogen by weight is success? How much fuel will it waste in transportation if there is nine times as much \"pakaging\" material as there is hydrogen. Yes the currently used hydrogen cylinders are heavy, but I do not believe they weigh nine times as much as they can carry.\n\nWhoah, seriously? They're making alane [fuelcellsworks.com] (stabilized aluminum hydride, AlH3)? Yep, a quick search revealed this to be the case [fuelcellsworks.com]. This would interest the rocketry industry as well, since alane offers great Isp. Let me check those weight numbers. Aluminum's atomic mass is about 27, while hydrogen's is about 1. AlH3 would thus be about 10% hydrogen by weight, so 9% would be essentially saturated, and 6% over half saturated. If correct, this would be incredible.\n\nHOWEVER...\n\nAs many people seem to forget on energy and rocketry threads, breakthroughs like this are sadly a dime a dozen. The vast majority never reach the market or reach it in a greatly diminished form. Thus, take press-release style reports of breakthroughs with a heavy grain of salt.\n\nOf course, the real problem isn't just hydrogen density, the thermodynamics and kinetics of hydrogen uptake and release are important too. You want it to fall off in a nice controlled manner with very little energy: on the order of thermal energies so you can use waste heat from the fuel cell, or a simple heater, to get the hydrogen off. Likewise you want to be able to recharge it with hydrogen quickly and with small energy requirements. Many really great hydrogen storage solutions have run into problems at this end of the problem and need metal catalysts, which increases the weight and cost.\nFrankly, practical hydrogen fuel vehicles are still a couple of decades off. It's going to be cool, though. At the gas station, you won't have to go to the pumps, you'll just haul your \"empties\" out and swap them for reloaded cartridges. If you wanted to take extra fuel with you for a cross-country trip, you could just buy some spares. More expensive than jerry cans, but easier to swap in and out. Of course there's no particular reason for Audi's hydrogen cartridges to be same shape as BMW's, which could get \"interesting\".\n\nIf the manufacturers standardize on a cartridge format, then it could be automatically removed and a fresh cartridge inserted. The robotics for such an operation have been more than adequate for about a decade now.\n\nOf course, you are right in questioning how standard these things will get. (Answer: If it will kill a competitor or three, not very)\n\nScrew that - I'm hoping it burns better than thermite (with is pretty much what powdered aluminum is, when you add a little iron oxide.) The only way they could make it more interesting (fun) than that would be to infuse it with a healthy chunk of sodium or potassium so all it takes to set it off is WATER.\n\nDamn, I'm getting excited just thinking about it (in a totally platonic way, of course.)\n\nThat works fine for compressed or liquefied hydrogen, and maybe some physisorption methods. Chemically stored hydrogen (which seems to be the most promising) would probably require that the cartridge was regenerated by the manufacturer. I think it'll be like milk deliveries: buy new stuff and return the empty bottles.\n\nI agree that it would appear they could be talking about Alane (AlH3), which has a theoretical weight-density of about 10% hydrogen. Yes, 10% is good...but as folks in the hydrogen storage community would be quick to tell you, it's not unusual. For example, Lithium Borohydride (LiBH4) has a theoretical weight-density of almost 18.5% hydrogen! The key is simply to bind hydrogen with light elements in a stable configuration, right?\n\nWrong. That's not even the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThe real problem, as any hydride person would correctly point out, is not \"theoretical storage fraction\"; rather, it's REVERSIBLE storage fraction. It doesn't really matter, in the long run, if you can store 18%, or even 25% hydrogen by weight in a substance if the following are true:\n\n1. it takes a LOT of energy to put it in (theormodynamically unfavorable hydrogenation reaction) 2. you can only get out a small fraction of what you put in under favorable conditions (non-reversibility) 3. the reaction doesn't move very quickly (unfavorable kinetics)\n\nWith these limitations, you face a severe energy penalty for trying to use the material as a hydrogen carrier, mostly because it's one-way. The keys to an inexpensive, efficient solid-state hydrogen storage material combine high storage fraction with a high level of reversibility: why bother using a material if you have to ship it back to the \"refinery\" when the hydrogen has been depleted? As an example, let me use the typical automotvie application to illustrate. (I know that TFA - which doesn't really say ANYthing, natch - doesn't explicitly state that their \"revolutionary\" material is for automotive applications, but that's where all the money is coming from these days.)\n\nWhat I want to do is expose the dehydrogenated powder (it's usually a powder) to hydrogen gas at about 1 atmosphere (~15 psi), remove some heat of reaction (for later use, naturally) and go on with my business. Preferably at a \"hydrogen filling station\", whatever that ends up looking like. Oh, and refueling shouldn't take more than about 5 minutes. And once the tank is full, I should be able to drive 300 miles without filling up again.\n\nRight now, there is NO material known on Earth that can fulfill these requirements and still be designed into a car.\n\nThe astute reader will notice immediately that I'm leaving out what might be the single-most crucial design driver: SAFETY. I don't know if everyone's been keeping up, but alane (and the alanate hydrides in general) are ROCKET FUELS. Personally, I don't want to drive around with 20kg of solid rocket fuel in my car's gas tank. In this case, safety will absolutely drive eventual adoption, even trumping reversible storage fraction.\n\nFor example, sodium alanate (NaAlH4) has a theoretical storage fraction of 5.6%, and the reversible fraction is starting to approach 4-5%, which is a very, very good track record. However, when it sees water (which it might, in a car accident) it EXPLODES. Well, deflagrates, but you get the point.\n\n(rant on)\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm all about solid-state H2 storage, and the \"H2 economy\" in general, whatever that happens to be. I'm even a \"real\" materials engineer, working with hydrides. But I'm also all about reality, and hopefully trying to \"drop the veil\" of proprietary information wherever possible. We're working as a team, people. So, to the press folks at UNB: write better articles, publish some papers, or both.\n\nInteresting. My comments were mostly on the fact that alane, as you noted, *is* rocket fuel. There's been great interest in economically bulk producing alane that is stable at low pressures, because you get get an Isp with LOX/Alane that's almost as good as LOX/LH. While this article touts it for its use in the hydrogen economy, I find the concept of a high density, high ISP solid (best of both worlds) a lot more intriguing. But that's probably just me.:) It would hold great promise for reducing launc\n\nYes, but the ~100K for LOX is much, much easier to deal with than the near absolute zero that you need for LH.:) Yes, a hybrid using alane (or even a solid using an oxidizer other than LOX) would be far better than LOX/LH. You get a slight Isp cut, but you get a manyfold increase in fuel density, which reduces your craft mass. Reducing craft mass increases performance and reduces manufacture cost/maintenence. There's long been a debate over which is more important -- high Isp (as in LOX/LH) or high densi\n\nBut yes, even 9% is better than curent gas storage, which is much less than 5% hydrogen by weight. The DOE target for 2010 is 6%. And even then you'd be about five times the volume using compressed gas for a given amout of hydrogen.\n\nNot to mention that hydrogen's energy is about 120 MJ/kg, while gasoline has about 45 MJ/kg. Yes, this still translates to only a quarter the energy density of gasoline, but then there's another factor: conversion efficiency. A good hydrogen fuel cell and engine may give you 65% efficiency instead of 30% for a gasoline engine. So, assuming that this outgasses freely, your range per kg will be something like half the energy of gasoline per kilogram of fuel + fuel storage. So, double the mass of your fuel + fuel storage. If your vehicle normally takes 15 gallons of gasoline, then you'd be carrying an extra 48 kilograms (half the weight of one passenger) in fuel + fuel storage. Now you get to subtract: fuel cell/electric engines are generally ligher than ICEs, and you don't need an ICE.\n\nIn short, I think the overall vehicle mass would come out to be lower. Volume of the fuel+drivetrain will be probably bigger, but I wouldn't expect it to be bigger by a huge amount (I'm not sure of the volume of current fuel cells; electric engines are pretty small, though, and you get to eliminate all sorts of components (like the alternator)).\n\nBear in mind that the 2010 target is for the whole storage system: the fuel, the tank and any apparatus needed to get the hydrogen to stay in or come out of it (electrical gear, heaters, coolers, whatever). Ammonia borane stores about 20% hydrogen by weight, for example, but nobody's setting off fireworks yet.\n\n [fsnet.co.uk] Typically, a 1460 x 230 mm K size industrial gas cylinder weighs 65kg and holds 7.2 cubic metres of hydrogen, which has to be compressed at 175 bar (c. 2500 psi) - a convenient size and weight (same as a 50 litre fuel tank) for one cylinder to fit into a car, but the actual weight of the hydrogen is only 0.6kg. hmmm... 65kg/.6kg.0092 ratio... that's uh, less than 1/100th or 100 times as much packing material....\n\nNothing that new here. Energy Conversion Devices has two stock Prius vehicles modified to run on Hydrogen instead of gasoline tooling around Detroit and LA. The hydorgen is stored as a Nickel Hydride (solid). Right now they can travel about 200 miles on a \"tank\" of hydrogen. Probably the best solution out there for hydrogen generation is nuclear power thermolysis. No fossil fuels used, and it has a very high thermal efficiency. The\n\nBut that leaves open the question of regenerative braking. A great deal of the efficiency bonus of EVs and HEVs (PHEV or no) is that they do regenerative braking. You can't effectively use a fuel cell for this without an intermediate storage medium, which currently means batteries (as we've been waiting for supercapacitors to get good price:performance for many years now.)\n\nIf you have to add batteries in to store the power from regenerative braking until you can accomplish electrolysis of water, then you have inefficiency and weight to deal with. And you probably won't be able to store it in this solid form, which I suspect won't be a very portable process (although I am willing to be proven wrong.) So you'd lose out on one of the major benefits of using an electric vehicle.\n\nOh, fine, you talked me into it. Let's say you want the charge from 110km/h (30.5 m/s) in a 600kg vehicle. That's a kinetic energy of 0.5 * 600 * 30.5^2 = 280 kJ. Let's say that you can recover 250kJ of that. That's ~70 watt hours. A little over 1kg worth of NiMH batteries. Not a big deal, wouldn't you say?\n\nNow, give me enough hardware to do that thirty times as I drive from one corner of SF to another, and take into account the maximum practical charge and discharge rates. Also take into account the weight\n\nOkay, new calculation time, then:) NiMH batteries have a specific power around 200 W/kg. Let's say we're talking about 1.5kg. 70 Wh would indeed take too long to be useful, at 14 minutes for discharge. However, with such small weights, why go with batteries? Just with what's on the market right now (which is a literal order of magnitude behind the next gen), and you're looking at ~6 Wh/kg and ~2kW/kg. ~70Wh => ~12kg. Not a big deal. And for discharge rate? 24 kW, discharging 70 Wh => 10.5 seco\n\nLet's see, a quick search reveals a supercapacitor price of $2.50/Wh, so 2.5 * 70 = $175. Hardly breaking the bank there. Cooling, charge controller, etc -- I'm not sure how many different ways that I can point out that we're not exactly dealing with a lot of energy here. I could do the calculations, but why bother? It's obviously not going to cost much. Most of the cabling you need anyways (to run to the engine(s) from the fuel cell. You're just splicing a new power source into that line.\n\nObviously you put really tiny knives at the edge of the vacuum sucker that break those bonds and force the atoms to go in single file, and since the oxygen atom is so huge it just can't fit and it floats away. DUH.\n\nYou take advantage of the fact that when aluminum is placed in water and its temperature is raised to a certain point, the aluminum is able to pull the oxygen off of the hydrogen, thus releasing free hydrogen. It's usually done with an electric current, and most people think it's electrolysis, but it's not. The most popular design takes aluminum welding wire off of a spool and feeds it up against a rotating aluminum cylinder, all submerged in water (the purer the better of course).\n\nAssuming the energy needed to perform the condensation is not lossy, this technique is going to be da bomb.:)\n\nHaha. But seriously, this is what the \"hydrogen economy\" needs. You could even grind the powder fine enough to be a slough, and 'pump' that into your vehicle's fuel tank.\n\nWhen George Bush first proposed hydrogen as the solution to our fossil-fuel habit, everyone mocked him for failing to understand that hydrogen is just a storage medium, rather than an energy source. I suspect he knew that all along... but since most Americans don't know it, he persuaded them to (at least in principle) buy in to the idea.\n\nOnce there is enough interest in hydrogen, the \"hydrogen economy\" will indeed take off (e.g. today's breakthrough), and at that time we will be groping for a way to produce hydrogen in bulk. The optimal way to produce bulk hydrogen is of course a nuclear reactor. And so by this (alas necessarily) indirect route will Americans come to accept ubiquitous nuclear power. And that is exactly what Bush wanted (or at least should have wanted) all along. And how do you keep this average American simian safe from terrorists if all of his power is coming from said reactors? I ask this because even centralized nuclear power is risky, and for the average American to\n\nWhat?\n\nThere is NO reason to have a nuclear plant in your backyard.\n\nAs supposedly unsafe as centralized nuclear power is (hint: if we actually used modern reactor designs, they would be much much safer) it's a lot\n\n\"You could even grind the powder fine enough to be a slough, and 'pump' that into your vehicle's fuel tank.\"\n\nThe thought that one of my profs mentioned in a business class was that IF this technology advances enough, that you could literally go to Walmart and buy your fuel off of a shelf. Since at room temperature the stuff is completely stable, is there even a need to have a gas station like environment?\n\nBush's only interest in a hydrogen economy is that it appears a long way off and gives his oil industry buddies plenty of time to make money. If he really wanted to cut oil consumption, he'd be promoting things we could do RIGHT NOW.\nAnd, please don't give Bush credit for first proposing hydrogen research (which he also underfunded).\n\nHydrogen makes wonderfully good rocket fuel, because the energy/weight is the most important factor in rocket fuel, outweighing other factors such as cost and safety.\n\nUsing hydrogen to power a car is insanely stupid.\n\nThere is no scenario for the use of hydrogen in a terrestrial vehicle that would not be rendered safer, cheaper, and less polluting by taking whatever source of energy used to manufacture hydrogen and directly applying it to move the car -- skipping the extremely wasteful hydrogen conversion/transport/storage processes. Electrons are much easier to produce, ship, store, and use than hydrogen. There are already LiON battery technologies that promise very rapid charge/discharge cycles with no thermal runaway, and over 9000 complete charge/discharge cycles [altairnano.com]. NiMH and Ni-Zn, while not quite as good in some ways as LiON, are still more viable than using hydrogen, whether by burning in an ICE, or in a fool-cell. And last time I checked, we are much closer to being able to build 50,000,000 EVs than we are to being able to build 50,000 fool-cell vehicles, because lithium (and nickel, and zinc) is far cheaper and more plentiful than platinum, which so far, is the only reasonably (?) effective catalyst for a fool-cell.\n\nHydrogen will only be the fuel of choice for two groups: Those who have more money than sense, and those who can freely spend other people's money. Those of us that have to spend our own money, and don't have enough to burn, will go for more efficient technologies, such as EV and bio-diesel. Unless we are coerced by the government.\n\nPolitical Correctness makes lousy science, lousy economics, and even worse public policy.\n\nHome power has a cool PDF [homepower.com] that describes how to create your own metal hydride based system. What's cool about their plans is they use bulk materials direct from the manufacturers and then show you how to prime your own system in a home lab if you're so inclined. I'd love to try it.\n\nSeems I read there was a similar system that is used in one version of the hydrogen powered car prototypes and they say they can get a hundred miles per tank on tanks about the size of a scuba tank.\n\n>they can get a hundred miles per tank on tanks about the size of a scuba tank.\n\nSo can a moped. Which is to say: we need a better metric. I suggest what aircraft use: miles per gallon per passenger (assuming full occupancy, which means divide the number by four if it's being used in the US.) Unfortunately that doesn't include range, because there are lots of great transit options if you only need to go a couple of blocks. People expect a range of about 600 km or 6 hours, whichever comes first (except for pr\n\nShame they didn't consider combining with oxygen - nearly 6% H efficiency right out of the gate. Sure, it takes a bit more energy to extract the H2 on the vehicle end, but it's easy to store and transport. Plus, no recombination issues since you can just get more in the pre-combined state, as it occurs naturally at STP.\n\nIt's hard to say since the article is so light on the details, but DTU --the Danish equivalent of MIT-- demonstrated hydrogen in pellet form something like two years ago.\n\nOne would do something I do not recall (perhaps pour water or an electric current over them?) to release the hydrogen, but otherwise they were inert. (I don't know what happened to that technology since, however.)\n\nI believe the relevant slashdot article is here [slashdot.org]. The link has moved since (and lost relevance, as, judging by the wording of slashdot summary, TFA just announced a presentation), but the guys behind it still have their website (here [amminex.com]). But what matters is that the method is not the same. The new method (for suitable values of new) uses an aluminum compound, the one the DTU guys (or whoever) have demonstrated uses ammonia.\n\nI'd think you'd be quite disappointed with lack of ambience in your fireplace, however. Pure hydrogen burns with a nearly invisible flame. But heck, if all you care about is the heat, then who cares what it looks like when it burns.\n\nPretend this is real... Solidified hydrogen. I'm imagining a solid rocket motor. I'm imagining the \"specific impulse\" (thrust per unit mass) of such a system. I'm imagining the materials it would take to contain it.\n\nHydrogen is already storable in a solid state, borax. I don't know how feasible it is for wide use. One of the main problems I see is that it would require three tanks in a vehicle; one for the borax, one for water and a third for waste, which is basically soap. From here [findarticles.com]:\n\n\"We developed a dual-bladder fuel tank,\" says Moore, \"to hold the residue created by this process.\" Refueling pushes the filtrate out of the second bladder and into a collection tank, where it is held until returned for reprocessing. \"Unlike gasoline, the tankers won't return to the refinery empty,\" says Moore, \"so the trip back is value-added.\" And vehicle dynamics are more consistent due to the retention of the residue. There is no dramatic weight variation between \"Full\" and \"empty\".\n\nThe technology currently is undergoing testing in a Chrysler minivan. \"Technically, the vehicle is a hybrid,\" says Moore, \"because the fuel cell recharges a lithium-ion battery pack that provides power for the wheels.\" Early testing has shown the van to be capable of 0-60 mph in 16 sec., the equivalent of 30 mpg, and of 300 miles on a tank of, well, slush. That tank, by the way, holds 54 gallons of new fuel, up to 40 gallons of residue, and is located between the rear axle and bumper under the van floor.\n\nIronically, U.S. Borax, Former sponsor of Death Valley Days, owns most of the borax reserves in the world. There are 600 million metric tons of known borax reserves (dry lake beds are the greatest source), and estimates predict the 50 million vehicles currently on the road would use 20 million tons of borax each year, most of which would be recycled.\n\nGiven that the article is five years old, it sounds like that technology didn't go much of anywhere. Maybe they learned some useful stuff from it that will apply to another hydrogen store, but after five years with no follow-up it sounds like a dead end in itself.\n\nIt's also possible to store hydrogen in a stable solid matrix using oxygen. There are some limitations on temperature (IIRC, the maximum temperature is something like 273 K) as well as a lot of issues with toxicity [dhmo.org]. In addition, most of the energy stored in H2 is used up by adding the oxygen to the hydrogen.\n\nThere are, however, plenty of advantages to the oxygen-hydrogen storage matrix, the most significant of which is that it can also be used to chill a refeshing potent potable.\n\nYou jest, but I've seen research papers on using ices to store molecular hydrogen. They were created in diamond anvils, mind, so it's waaaaay off in the periphery of theory right now, but it's got potential.\n\nCue Slashdot posts emphasising the uselessness of hydrogen due to the fact that we must put more energy into the process than we get out. Well blow me over. Who'd have thought that thermodynamics would apply to our energy supplies?\n\nBut you forgot about cueing the guy pointing out that one of the most important factors for vehicular power sources is energy density, and that currently hydrogen along with its containment system absolutely sucks in this regard.\n\nMy hydrogen storage device: a giant balloon around an aliminium frame inflated with the gas, such that it is lighter than air. Attach a few engines and this green machine could be manouevred through the skies, carrying massive cargo and passengers. I just need some help to think of an imposing name for the future of transportation.\n\nThis said, most of universe's energy comes from the fusion of Hydrogen nuclei.\n\nA virus is caused by a pathogen... let's see... pathogen... pathogens... pathogens are carbon-based life, which means they're mostly water. Water is mostly hydrogen... hydrogen... Ah! Hydrogen is flammable. Flame is hot... and our sun fuses hydrogen, which means the sun is hot. I've got it! We'll launch the aliens into the sun!\n\nThe amount of energy released by fusing hydrogen is immensely more than the amount released chemically. A tank full of water will drive your car to the moon and back if you've got cold fusion going, even if it's only 11% hydrogen.\n\nBut if all you're doing is reducing it with oxygen in the air, you're going to have to fill your tank fairly often if you've only got 9% hydrogen in your tank.\n\nThe US dept of energy set a target of 6.5% hydrogen by weight [pnas.org] for automobile hydrogen storage. So, yes, 9% is great (although the article is short on details and 9% is only their prediction - they haven't done it yet). The main alternatives to storing H2 gas in a high pressure gas cylinder are:\n\nMolecular hydrogen (H2) physically sticking to a porous storage medium, such as a metal organic framework [trnmag.com], without chemically reacting.\n\nChemically storing atomic hydrogen in a compounds, such as metal hydrides [csa.com], wh\n\nInvestigation of the Direct Hydrogenation of Aluminum to Alane in Supercritical Fluids\n\nAlane, AlH$_{3}$ has many of the properties that are requisite for materials to be considered viable for onboard hydrogen storage applications.

To me it's one that's easily manufactured, non-polluting, cheap, safe to transport, and leaves no residue behind.\n\nIf there is a residue, then it's a new Storage Container, and not a Usable Solid. If that's the case, then it needs to be easily rechargeable/refillable, quickly rechargeable/refillable, cheaply rechargeable/refillable, safely rechargeable/refillable/transportable, and provide good energy density for its overall weight and volume.\n\nAnd it is indeed easily maufactured, non-polluting, non-toxic, cheap, safe to transport, and (usually) leaves no residue behind. It is also very cheap to manufacture, and can be delivered to your home at a price cheaper than dirt or gravel in volume. And it is also found in quantity at most fuel stations where you buy gasoline, so the need to establish a seperate distribution system is not going to be too much of a problem. Indeed, the major oil companies already offer it for sale at premium prices from in\n\nOne problem with that.. It requires a high amount of energy to dissociate back into its elemental components, with poor energy return. It's heavy, bulky, corrodes certain metals, and is easily contaminated by trace elements. If it freezes, it expands to twice its volume and breaks whatever container it's in. If it's temperature exceeds it's boiling point, you get steam. With predictable results to it's vessel. Pelletized hydrogen sounds like a novel idea that it might just work if they can get the energy/wei\n\nHere is an idea: create a chain of about 8 carbon atoms and attach 18 hydrogen atoms to this carbon chain. That is about 16% hydrogen by weight! Not only that, it is an easy to handle liquid at normal temperatures and pressures. Imagine simply pouring a liquid into your car for refueling!\n\nHere is an idea: create a chain of about 8 carbon atoms and attach 18 hydrogen atoms to this carbon chain.

I'm sure you could fit 6 hydrogen atoms on there AND an oxygen atom - imagine that - you're increasing the hydrogen to carbon ratio from 2.25:1 to 3:1 and you're even providing part of the oxygen for combustion. This theoretical fuel should provide more than enough energy to power a vehicle and comes\n\nTFA is *very* short on details but, as far as I can determine, they have nothing more than a (slightly) more efficient gas/metal adsorbtion method.\n\nTo illustrate *how* short on detail it is, take the quote \"The way to do this is to turn hydrogen into a compound -- a solid -- so you can use it when you want, safely, in the amount you want.\"... Errr, OK; you mean ICE?\n\nHydrogen aDsorbtion (which means sticking to the surface of, rather than being pulled into the structure of (aBsorbtion) onto metals) has been known about for a very long time. Using these techniques does do away with the classical problems of storing hydrogen cryogenically (cold, volatility and risk of explosion) but for a *huge* cost of energy-density/weight ratio. So much so that it isn't really worth the effort. Even if they have achieved a ten-fold improvement over traditional (titanium) adsorbtion methods, it wouldn't be nearly enough to be viable consumer level energy requirements.\n\nUnsurprisingly it's not the formation of solid dihydrogen as you might expect from the amazingly poorly written press release. Like almost everyone else they're working on chemical hydrogen storage, whereby hydrogen-rich compounds are used to store and release hydrogen gas. The remainder are working on physical dihydrogen storage (carbon nanotubes etc).\n\nAbstract\nA system for generating hydrogen gas for use in a fuel cell includes a powder metal hydride source, a water source, a mixing device and a catalytic hydrogen generating chamber. A method of generating hydrogen for use in a fuel cell includes the steps of: providing a source of dry metal hydride fuel; providing a source of steam; providing a mixing/reaction chamber connected to the source of dry metal hydride fuel and to the source of steam; operating the mixing/reaction chamber to transport the dry metal hydride fuel from its source to a byproduct receptacle and feeding steam into the mixing/reaction chamber such that the steam reacts with the dry metal hydride fuel to produce hydrogen gas and a dry metal powder byproduct; removing the dry metal powder byproduct from the mixing/reaction chamber; and extracting the hydrogen gas from the mixing/reaction chamber.\n\nI started laughing when the article stated that burning hydrogen produced zero pollution. Sure, if you live in a pure oxygen environment. Unfortunately, cars have to operate with a supply that's mostly nitrogen and significant portion of the resulting pollution is nitrogen compounds. Besides, the energy density per weight still sucks worse than decent battery technology which really does have zero emissions at the point of use.\n\nI just realized that there's this really new way to store hydrogen. It contains as much as 15% hydrogen, much more than the article's 9%, and is perfectly suitable for today's automobile motors. It is a clear liquid, boiling at 99 C, and can be easily pumped. It burns cleanly, and is safe to transport. It is available from biological sources. Hydrogen doesn't evaporate off it. The magic compound is called iso-octane, which contains 85% carbon and 15% hydrogen. If we could only solve the small technological p\n\nOk, lets just assume that this is a real breakthrough, and that we can safely and cheaply:\n\n* manufacture said compound (AlH3)\n* store said compound\n* use said compound with high efficiency in fuel vehicles\n\nAfter all, its volumetric density is fair (I calculate it at.15 kg/L hydrogen * 120 MJ/kg or 5 kwh / liter versus 9.7 kwh/liter for gasoline) and with the extra efficiency boost it IS energy competitive.\n\nMy question is - where are we going to get the aluminum? This would require a MASSIVE production spike in aluminum - to provide a replacement for the ~ 400 million metric tons of gasoline that the US alone uses.\n\nRight now, the amount of aluminum we produce globally per year is about 20 times lower - 23.8 million metric tons yearly to be exact (source:  ?form=1 [world-aluminum.org]) and aluminum production is very energy intensive (I calculate it as being 6 times *higher* - at 30 kilowatt hours/liter - than the hydrogen is meant to store. That becomes 90 kilowatt hours / liter considering that most of the energy used in aluminum production is electric)\n\nSo the only realistic way of doing this would be to recycle the aluminum and 'rehydrate it'. And there would be a hefty price premium on the creation of the fuel ($12 / gallon at current aluminum prices, which would probably go up dramatically if this took off)\n\nOverall then this is a mixed bag. The infrastructure costs would be substantial in creating the distribution network for the fuel, both for hydrating and recycling the fuel containers, and the energy cost would be horrific in making the aluminum.\n\nAt 30 kilowatt hours / liter, and 700 grams CO2/ kilowatt hour (if the energy making the aluminum was coal), this corresponds to 19000 grams C02 / liter of fuel, versus the 2000 grams CO2 / kilowatt hour that you get by simply burning the gasoline to go! The aluminum had better be VERY recyclable.\n\nWhile they do not say directly in the article, the artcile does have hints that thier method of turning hydrogen solid is to react it with something. This will form a powerder at room temperature. The thing is they only have six percent of this powder is hydrogen so there is alot of dead weight to haul around so little H2. Also this method of a reversible reaction will use up energy. It is yet to be seen if this is more or less than the energy required to compress a similar volume of hydrogen.\n\nAlthough I believe hydrides to be very reactive (lithium aluminum hydride, anyone?), I think you'd have better luck transporting well-protected solids that are (even explosively) reactive than high-pressure tanks of a highly combustible gas."

      "text": "New Material Efficiently Turns Heat Into Electricity\n\n(Los Angeles Times) An international group of scientists has developed a material that can turn wasted heat into electricity with unprecedented efficiency, a discovery that may one day allow for more efficient cars and buildings. The finding was reported this week in the journal Nature.\n\nThe material is crucial to creating devices called thermoelectric generators, which are designed to create an electrical charge when a difference in temperature exists across them. When such a difference exists, electrons move from one side to the other and a voltage is created which can be captured and used as electricity.\n\nThermoelectric generators are commonly used in space. The Mars rover Curiosity, for example, has as its electricity source a thermoelectric generator that is powered by heat produced by the radioactive isotope plutonium-238 dioxide. When the radioactive heat arrives at just one end of the generator, electricity is generated, powering the rover for as long as the heat can be produced.\n\nThere are many situations on Earth where such generators would be useful. Cars, for example, produce hot exhaust; if that heat could be captured before it flies out the tailpipe, cars could re-use that energy and become more efficient. Similarly, many buildings—especially factories and restaurants, which are constantly spewing excess heat—could become more efficient if their heat waste was put to good use."

Researchers had previously looked at carbon nanotubes, hydrogen-clathrate-hydrates and other nanostructured materials as ways of storing hydrogen, but they only work in fuel cells at low temperatures or high pressures. Now, Ihm and co-workers have shown that polymers covered with metal atoms can store a significant amount of hydrogen under more practical working conditions.\n\nThe large storage capacity is predicted because numerous hydrogen molecules are attracted to the metal atoms that lie along the polymer chain. Using a series of first-principles electronic-structure calculations, the physicists worked out how much energy the hydrogen molecules need to bind to the metal atoms. They looked at a wide combination of metal atoms (including titanium, scandium and vanadium), polymers (including polyacetylene, polypyrrole and polyaniline) and bonding sites for the hydrogen on the metal atoms.\n\nThe researchers found that a form of polyacetylene \"decorated\" with titanium atoms was the best. This molecule consists of a series of carbon atoms linked together in a chain by alternating single and double bonds. Each carbon atom has one hydrogen atom that can be replaced by a particular atom like titanium.\n\nThey found that up to five hydrogen molecules can be attached to each titanium atom in this particular form of polyacetylene, allowing the material to reversibly store 7.6 wt% of hydrogen, or 63 kilograms per cubic metre under practical working conditions. This value is higher than a target of 45 kilograms per cubic metre that the US Department of Energy said should be reached by 2010 (Phys. Rev. Lett.97 056104).\n\n\"Our results will have considerable importance for experimentalists and engineers to synthesize metal-decorated polymers for hydrogen storage,\" Ihm told PhysicsWeb. \"Indeed, we have already begun to make some titanium-decorated polymers in collaboration with other researchers and are measuring their hydrogen-storage capacity now\"."

They can be manufactured quite economically and, because they are as bendable as plastic wrap, they can be processed flexibly.\n\nThe problem is that they are yet markedly less efficient than conventional inorganic semiconductor cells. The most crucial process in the conversion of light into electric current is the generation of free charge carriers.\n\nIn the first step of photoconversion, upon absorption of light one component of the organic solar cell, usually a polymer, releases electrons that are taken up by the second component of the cell - in this case silicon nanoparticles - and can then be transported further.\n\n\"The mechanisms and the timescale of charge separation have been the subject of controversial scientific debate for many years,\" says LMU physics professor Eberhard Riedle. In cooperation with investigators at the Technical University in Munich and at Bayreuth University, Riedle and his group have now been able to dissect the process in detail.\n\nTo do so, the researchers used a novel hybrid cell type containing both organic and inorganic constituents, in which silicon serves as the electron acceptor.\n\nBased on the insights obtained with this system, they developed a processing strategy to improve the structural order of the polymer - and found that this enhances the efficiency of charge separation in organic semiconductors by up to twofold. Their findings provide a new way to optimize the performance of organic solar cells.\n\nThe key to this breakthrough lies in a unique, laser-based experimental setup, which combines extremely high temporal resolution of 40 femtoseconds (fs) with a very broadband detection.\n\nThis allowed the team to follow the ultrafast processes induced by photon absorption in real time as they occur. Instead of the fullerenes used in typical organic cells, the researchers used silicon as the electron acceptor, a choice that has two major advantages.\n\n\"First, with these novel hybrid solar cells, we were able to probe the photophysical processes taking place in the polymer with greater precision than ever before, and secondly through the use of silicon, a much larger segment of the solar spectrum can be harnessed for electricity,\" says Riedle.\n\nIt turns out that free charge carriers - so called polarons - are not generated immediately upon photoexcitation, but with a delay of about 140 fs. Primary photoexcitation of a polymer molecule first leads to the formation of an excited state, called an exciton.\n\nThis then dissociates, releasing an electron, which is then transferred to the electron acceptor. The loss of electrons leaves behind positively charged \"holes\" in the polymer and, as oppositely charged entities are attracted to one another by the Coulomb force, the two have a tendency to recombine.\n\n\"In order to obtain free charge carriers, electron and hole must both be sufficiently mobile to overcome the Coulomb force,\" explains Daniel Herrmann, the first author of the new study.\n\nThe team was able to show, for the first time, that this is much easier to achieve in polymers with an ordered, regular structure than with polymers that are chaotically arranged. In other words, a high degree of self-organization of the polymer significantly increases the efficiency of charge separation.\n\n\"The polymer that we used is one of the few known to have a tendency to self-organize. This tendency can be inhibited, but one can also increase the polymer's intrinsic propensity for self-organization by choosing appropriate processing parameters,\" Herrmann explains.\n\nBy cleverly optimizing the processing of the polymer P3HT, the researchers succeeded in doubling the yield of free charge carriers - and thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency of their experimental solar cells.

Image courtesy of Timur Islamoglu/VCU.\n\nVirginia Commonwealth University scientists have developed a \"sponge-like\" porous material – just one gram of this material is equal to the surface area of 11 tennis courts – to purify natural gas and store hydrogen gas to be used in clean energy applications such as fuel cells that generate electricity and water with zero emission.\n\nOn Monday, the VCU team presented the findings of their work at the 243rd National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society.\n\nIn many countries, generating natural gas without compromising environmental safety and the health of citizens has become a top priority. Carbon dioxide, CO2, is a major contaminant of hydrogen and natural gas fuels, and it is mainly released from coal-fired plants. Its separation and capture remain a great challenge.\n\nSo, the race is on to develop materials that can selectivity remove CO2 from hydrogen and methane fuels, or sequester it from flue gas – all of which would have a tangible impact on the environment and economy.\n\n\"The organic polymers we have created have the potential to remove impurities such as CO2 from natural gas making its transport, storage and use more efficient,\" said lead author of the study, Hani M. El-Kaderi, assistant professor in the VCU Department of Chemistry.\n\n\"Moving into a 'hydrogen economy' would secure an energy source for the world and would eliminate greenhouse gas emission from the burning of fossil-based fuels, such as coal and gasoline, because the use of hydrogen in fuel cell produces only electricity and water,\" he said.\n\nEl-Kaderi, together with Mohammad G. Rabbani, Ph.D., a research scientist in El-Kaderi's lab who led the research efforts, developed a material that can soak up CO2 with high efficacy. They demonstrated that the new organic polymers, which have high thermal and chemical stability, can selectively capture carbon dioxide over methane, making them very practical for use in natural gas purification processes. El-Kaderi described the polymers as metal-free \"green.\" This means that the use of such polymers would eliminate the possibility of metal leakage during application or after disposal – making them environmentally friendly.\n\n\"Our team is expected to expand this materials domain in a timely fashion to explore new properties related to solar energy and catalysis, and I believe our findings will enable new technologies to emerge in the clean and renewable energy field,\" he said.\n\nWhile the technology is at the \"discovery stage,\" and it may take some time to develop large scale synthesis procedures for these polymers, there is a provisional patent on this technology through VCU, said El-Kaderi.\n\nIn related news, El-Kaderi was selected by the US Department of Energy as one of eight scientists from all national laboratories and university across the United States to present his research on hydrogen storage during the upcoming Department of Energy and Office of Basic Energy Science Hydrogen Storage Meeting in coordination with DOE Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy's Annual Merit Review scheduled for mid-May.\n\nThe study was supported in part by grants from VCU, the U.S. Department of Energy and Office of Basic Energy Sciences, and the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund"

      "text": "Oct 11, 2010\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory developed a lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery technology with reversible capacity of more than 1,600 milliamp hours per gram (mAh/g) after 40 charging/discharging cycles. This silicon-based anode technology doubles the capacity of conventional graphite anode technology used in Li-ion batteries, and may lead to Li-ion batteries with much higher energy density and capacity.\n\nA future with millions of fossil-fuel powered cars displaced from American roadways by plug-in electric vehicles presents significant economic and environmental benefits. It also poses a challenge to develop a next-generation battery technology that offers far greater energy density. Silicon anodes for Li-ion batteries present a promising solution.\n\nToday's electric vehicles rely on nickel-metal hydride batteries. They are heavy, bulky and have a specific energy that is too low, about 80 watt hours per kilogram (Wh/kg), for long-distance travel. Li-ion batteries, commonly used in handheld electronics, offer greater capacity. Composed of three main components—a graphite anode, a cathode and electrolyte (lithium salt dissolved in organic solvent)—the graphite anode has specific capacity of about 350 mAh/g. Li-ion batteries using graphite anodes exhibit a specific energy of more than 160 Wh/kg, double that of nickel-metal hydride batteries.\n\n\"If we want to increase driving distance of electric vehicles, we need to have much better capacity -- at least double the capacity of graphite anodes and cathodes used in the Li-ion battery,\" said Dr. Jason Zhang, a PNNL scientist.\n\nOne of the limiting factors of the Li-ion battery is its anode—the graphite. Lithium is added to graphite when charging and removed as the battery is used. Graphite anodes are used in nearly all Li-ion batteries, but recent research has sought to capitalize on a better anode solution—silicon. With a theoretical capacity of more than 10 times that of graphite, silicon anodes can at least double the capacity of graphite-anode batteries. However, it is this very ability to absorb lithium and expand during charging that is the problem: The silicon breaks down quickly.\n\nThe challenge for PNNL researchers: Take advantage of silicon's high capacity while finding a way to keep it from deteriorating through repeated charging/discharging cycles.\n\nZhang and the PNNL research team addressed the challenge by designing a silicon particle architecture that would maintain structural integrity. Nanostructured porous silicon was used to maintain stability through repeated expansion and contraction. Next, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of carbon coatings and highly elastic Ketjen Black (KB) carbon were used to improve the electrical conductivity throughout all cycling stages. The team placed these anodes between graphene -- planar sheets of bonded carbon atoms—to maintain strong electrical contact between silicon particles.\n\nThey tested these anodes in the laboratory and found they had a reversible capacity of more than 1,600 mAh/g after 40 charging/discharging cycles. This technology more than doubles the capacity of conventional graphite anodes used in Li-ion batteries.\n\nThe PNNL research team continues to improve the performance and long-term stability of the silicon anodes from 40 to 50 charging/discharging cycles today to a goal of about 500 cycles in the future. One solution may be the development of a better binder that can maintain improved mechanical and electrical contact. This method has potential for much greater cyclability while maintaining high energy density.So... if I discharge and recharge my car every work day, thats about 260 days/year. 500 cycles gives me about 2 years of life if I take vacations and use my regular car. I think that a more realistic lifetime would be on the order of 2500 cycles or so. Otherwise I don't think this would work commercially. Having said that, I have no doubt that the very competent researchers here will achieve it eventually. I would just suggest a more realistic target.\n\nOf course 500 cycles might be fine if we are talking about an application (like notebooks) that only require about a cycles per week or so.\n\nSo... if I discharge and recharge my car every work day, thats about 260 days/year. 500 cycles gives me about 2 years of life if I take vacations and use my regular car.\n\nWhy would you need to charge/discharge fully every day? Tesla roadster has a 200 mile plus range. I would only need to charge it once per week, so 10-year life span. If you live 100 miles from work, then battery electric is probably not for you"

Because both wind and solar power do not provide a consistent flow of electricity, technology like the vanadium redox battery is gaining the attention of commercial operations as well as governments, projecting a push in future demand for the mineral.\n\n\"The overall acceptance of energy storage globally is becoming more and more, and that's going to boost the batteries that can cycle and do things that only we can do,\" said Tim Hennessy, President of Prudent Energy, a United States-based company that designs and manufactures vanadium redox battery (VRB®) energy storage systems.\n\nWhat makes vanadium an ideal mineral for battery technology is that as a transition metal four energy states can be created within the same material. Vanadium is used in the electrolyte state in VRB®, which are a type of flow battery. The electrolyte is the element that stores the energy and that flows through or past an electrode. This movement of electrons or protons across a membrane allows heat to be taken out of the battery and separates the energy storage from the power.\n\nHennessy explained that one advantage of a flow battery is that it can be scaled up to the desired size without having to increase the power output, as with a lithium battery. Controlled scaling is ideal for large-scale applications like powering grids, as the VRB is limited only by space in its storage capacity.\n\n\"Another advantage of the VRB® is that unlike most other battery technologies, it can be repeatedly cycled without affecting the lifespan.\" said Hennessy.\n\nThe downside of this is that the VRB has a lower energy density than other battery formats, meaning that Prudent Energy's current products are focused more on commercial applications.\n\n\"Its applications are limited to places where you have sufficient space, you can't jam it into your computer or a car, and you can't jam it into a very small space down in the basement necessarily,\" said Hennessy. \"It is primarily focused on places that you have space like wind farms and solar, or companies where they have larger loads.\"\n\nHennessy projects an increase in demand for vanadium in batteries, equaling 10-15 percent of the mineral's total use in the next three years.\n\n\"Demand for vanadium in going to be increasing, but having said that, vanadium is pretty plentiful. The volume of supply now is limited only to manage the price and that is used mainly in the steel industry,\" he said.\n\nEnergizer Resources (CVE:EGZ) is one company that is planning to produce vanadium at its Green Giant project in Madagascar by the end of 2014. What makes this project unique is that because it is sediment-hosted rather than magnetite hosted, it will be producing vanadium as a primary product – ideal for the demands of the battery industry.\n\n\"High-purity and battery-grade are two different things. The steel industry requires a high purity vanadium, but it's not a battery grade,\" said Brent Nykoliation, Vice President of Business Development at Energizer Resources.\n\nNykoliation said that projects like Energizer's are going to be needed in the future as the battery industry grows and other vanadium producers who primarily target the steel industry must perform additional processing to remove impurities from their product.\n\n\"What they fail to tell people is that if you produce this vanadium for the battery world, it needs to be further processed. This means additional operating costs because you have to remove the contaminants,\" said Nykoliation. \"It's a significant cost jump to go from a normal vanadium product to a battery-grade product, and then to get an electrolyte.\"\n\nOther developments in the vanadium battery market may come from vanadium-charged lithium batteries for use in high-performance technology like electric vehicles, which Nykoliation says are currently in the process of being developed by laboratories in the United States, Germany and Japan.\n\n\"All these world-class labs are fast-tracking the vanadium battery development and that makes me feel good – there is a huge untapped market,\" said Nykoliation. \"There is a technological breakthrough and the tipping point is fast approaching. It's not if, but when.\""

      "text": "Hydrogen gas is seen by some as the holy grail of alternative fuels. It is clean, it is green, and it is plentiful. However it is also expensive to make thanks to the need for platinum and other rare earth elements required to make the hydrogen catalyst.\n\nThankfully, scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory have developed a new electrocatalyst that addresses the high cost problems by generating hydrogen gas from water cleanly and with a much more affordable material – a form of nickel-molybdenum-nitride, basically nickel.\n\nHydrogen can be oxidized into a fuel cell to generate electricity, for example to power cars, without releasing carbon dioxide (CO2), and it can be produced in remote places without an electric infrastructure. The potential for hydrogen is as a viable alternative fuel is very high.\n\nIn order to get hydrogen gas, you have to break up a water molecule. The process is done through the electrolysis of water, splitting water (H2O) into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2). This requires external electricity and an efficient catalyst to break the chemical bonds and shift around protons and electrons. The best catalyst to use is platinum, and if you have looked at high end jewelry recently you know platinum is expensive — around $50,000 per kilogram. Also, there is a limited global supply for platinum, which brings into question the suitability of hydrogen gas as an alternative fuel.\n\nScientists from DOE had to figure out a way to lower costs and use a more sustainable catalyst in the process of making hydrogen gas. Nickel-molybdenum-nitride is their solution; $20 per kilogram for nickel and $32 per kilogram for molybdenum – about 1000 times less-expensive than platinum. The new nickel based catalyst performs nearly as well as platinum\n\nWhile the new DOE created catalyst does not represent a total solution to the challenge of creating affordable hydrogen gas, it does offer a major reduction in the cost of essential equipment. Wide spread use of hydrogen gas is indeed a ways off, however through government funded research such as that taking place at Brookhaven National Laboratory the future does seem a bit brighter for hydrogen gas."

      "text": "Sunlight is a diffuse energy resource and thus all methods of solar energy capture and conversion have one feature in common – concentration. In this talk, I will focus on some of our recent efforts in luminescent solar concentration, a concept originally introduced three decades ago as a simple route to obtain high concentration for photovoltaic cells without tracking the sun. Luminescent concentrators (LSCs) traditionally consist of a transparent slab embedded with a chromophore that absorbs sunlight and re-emits it back into the slab, where it is trapped by total internal reflection and absorbed by photovoltaic cells attached to the edges. Concentration ratios exceeding 100 are theoretically possible, however, in practice, the overlap between chromophore absorption and emission spectra ultimately leads to unacceptable reabsorption losses that limit the concentration ratio to ~10, and hence the utility of LSCs to date.\n\nRecently, we have developed an all-optical means of overcoming the reabsorption problem by incorporating a simple bilayer cavity on top of a transparent substrate and continuously varying its resonance across the lateral dimensions of the concentrator. In this 'resonance-shifting' approach, sharply directed emission from the cavity continuously avoids the narrow reabsorption resonance at each subsequent bounce and hence propagates with low loss to the substrate edges. This strategy is demonstrated for several different organic chromophores with varying degrees of reabsorption overlap, with near-lossless propagation and a significant improvement in concentration ratio demonstrated for each case.\n\nBiography:\n\nNoel Giebink is currently the George Wells Beadle postdoctoral fellow at Argonne National Laboratory in conjunction with an appointment at Northwestern University through the Argonne-Northwestern Solar Energy Research Center. He received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Princeton University and holds undergraduate degrees in both Physics and Engineering Science from Trinity University (TX).

The turbines that spin inside of them to generate electricity require tons and tons of steam, and all of that water has to come from somewhere.\n\nRecent studies have estimated that roughly two-fifths of the nation's freshwater withdrawals and three percent of overall freshwater consumption goes to supplying the steam generators at large power stations in the United States. In order to cut down on the enormous quantities of water required to operate these plants, scientists have begun to look for new technologies that could improve their efficiency and reduce the demand for water.\n\nAs part of a larger consortium involving partners from several energy companies, universities, and government agencies, researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory are developing a special class of nanoparticles that partially melt as steam evaporates from a plant's cooling towers, absorbing a significant percentage of the diffused heat in the system.\n\nIn order to operate, electrical plants use a cycle that uses partially condensed high-temperature steam to turn a large turbine. During generation, a significant quantity of this steam is lost due to evaporation. \"In every cycle, there's a significant amount of water that we can't recapture,\" said Argonne materials scientist Dileep Singh, who is working to develop the specialized nanoparticles.\n\nThe nanoparticles are based on what is known as a \"core-shell\" configuration, in which a solid outer coat protects an inner layer that can melt above a certain temperature. Once dispersed in the plant's water supply, the nanoparticles are able to absorb heat during the thermal cycle. After partially melting, the particles travel to the cooling tower where they resolidify. The system is closed and designed to ensure against leakage of the plant's water or steam into the environment.\n\nAt the molecular level, Singh and his colleagues are especially concerned with the surface of the nanoparticles, as the chemistry at the boundary between the metal and the water determines how much heat the particles can take up. \"We're experimenting with looking at the bonding between the particles and the water molecules,\" he said.\n\n\"What we really want to know is how much heat we can pick up given a constant amount of water to cool the system,\" he added. \"Environmentally responsible energy growth involves worrying about how you manage your water resources.\"\n\nThe vast quantities of water that are needed to operate these facilities will necessitate the mass production of the nanoparticles once they are commercially developed, a fact that could potentially complicate the research and development process, said Argonne associate division director Thomas Ewing. \"As we begin lab testing, we need to keep in mind the costs and issues associated with making this work in a real live power plant,\" he said. \"There are lots of tradeoffs to take into account.\"\n\nAccording to Ewing, Argonne is working with the Electric Power Research Institute and other partners to move this basic technology quickly through the developmental pipeline. Initial plans call for the demonstration of proof of concept to commence this year and full-scale commercial deployment to begin in four years. \"It's practically unheard of for industry to seek to deploy a new technology so quickly,\" Ewing said. \"However, water consumption is a major issue that limits the expansion of power. If we want to solve the energy crisis, we'll have to move boldly.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Controlling the behavior of nanoparticles can be just as difficult trying to wrangle a group of teenagers. However, a new study involving the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne NationalAn innovative solar-thermal heating and cooling system installed on top of the UA's Student Recreation Center is expected to harvest almost 200 million kilowatt hours of solar energy per year – enough ...\n\nMore research is needed to understand how nanoparticles could impact the environment.

Nonetheless it is also known that the process isn't a really efficient one; its efficiency being of only one percent.\n\nThis is why the specialists have been working on creating an 'artificial leaf' that could really turn solar power into liquid energy. One of the specialists working in this field is Roger Cogdell from the University of Glasgow.\n\nAccording to the professor the sun offers us this possibility, but we have to keep in mind that it is quite difficult to make use of it at its full potential.\n\nNaturally there are the solar panels that we could be using, but their use is quite limited.\n\nThis is why the specialists are trying to come up with a way to trap the energy of the sun and to store it so it could be used when people need it.\n\nThe researchers are working on a chemical reaction that is something like photosynthesis but it takes place in an artificial setting. The plants are using the energy of the sun to split water into oxygen and hydrogen.\n\nThey release the oxygen and turn hydrogen into fuel. This is the process that the researchers are trying to replicate.\n\nThe professor said that the researchers are working on a large chemical system that could be performing the same process on a large scale. Unlike the solar panels that are producing electricity, this system would produce fuel.\n\nThis new system could make the most of the solar energy. If we go back to the basic reactions of photosynthesis, researchers could find ways to convert energy at higher levels. In case they succeed, as a result we could have a more sustainable economy based on this process.\n\nSince the fossil fuel burning would be decreased, there would be less carbon-dioxide released into the atmosphere.\n\nHoward Griffiths, a professor at the University of Cambridge has the same goal. Still he has a different approach; he is focusing more on the enzyme known as RuBisCo. This is a vital enzyme regarding photosynthesis. It makes it possible for the plants to use carbon-dioxide and turn it into different molecules, such as sugar.\n\nThe truth is that there is still a long way ahead to finalize the 'artificial leaf', but the results are worth the effort."

As well as being costly to manufacture they are potentially volatile.\n\nTo prevent short circuiting, the electrodes of these cell-based batteries are kept apart by separator elements but the polymer gel developed by the university team removes the need for this.\n\n\"The polymer gel looks like a solid film, but it actually contains about 70 percent liquid electrolyte\" said Professor Ian Ward FRS, a research professor of physics at the University of Leeds. \"It's made using the same principles as making a jelly: you add lots of hot water to 'gelatine' – in this case there is a polymer and electrolyte mix – and as it cools it sets to form a solid but flexible mass.\"\n\nPatent manufacturing process\n\nProfessor Ward's team has also developed a patented manufacturing process called extrusion/lamination which sandwiches the gel between an anode and cathode at high speed to create a highly-conductive strip that can be cut to any size.\n\nThe lamination process also seals the electrodes together so that there is no excess flammable solvent and liquid electrolyte.\n\nIn 2006, Dell, Toshiba, Apple and Lenovo all recalled laptops amid fears that overheating could damage their batteries' separators and potentially result in explosion. The batteries were all made by Sony. Hewlett-Packard has recalled batteries several times since then\n\nOne Lenovo ThinkPad burst into flames at a Los Angeles airport prompted wide ranging restrictions on laptop use on planes for a period.\n\nApple replaced its batteries with a solid lithium-polymer but had to accept a reduction in power output. The BBC reports that the Leeds-based researchers promise their batteries perform at the level of liquid-filled batteries and are as safe as polymer ones but are just 10 to 20 percent of the price.\n\nProfessor Peter Bruce from the University of St Andrews, who was not involved in the Leeds study, told the BBC: \"Safety is of paramount importance in lithium batteries. Conventional lithium batteries use electrolytes based on organic liquids; this is what you see burning in pictures of lithium batteries that catch fire. Replacing liquid electrolytes by a polymer or gel electrolyte should improve safety and lead to an all-solid-state cell.\"\n\nLeeds University has licensed the polymer gel technology to American company Polystor Energy Corporation, which is conducting trials to commercialise cells for portable consumer electronics.\n\nThe research was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and Yorkshire Concept.\n\nMaterials scientists are approaching the problem of batteries from several directions.

The thin spherical structure improves light absorption by trapping the light inside the material, creating what are known as optical whispering galleries. Credit: Yan Yao\n\nVisitors to Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol Building may have experienced a curious acoustic feature that allows a person to whisper softly at one side of the cavernous, half-domed room and for another on the other side to hear every syllable. Sound is whisked around the semi-circular perimeter of the room almost without flaw. The phenomenon is known as a whispering gallery.\n\nThe downfall of nanocrystalline-silicon, however, has been its relative poor absorption of light, which requires thick layering that takes a long time to manufacture.\n\nWhispering galleries\n\nThe engineers call their spheres nanoshells. Producing the shells takes a bit of engineering magic. The researchers first create tiny balls of silica — the same stuff glass is made of — and coat them with a layer of silicon. They then etch away the glass center using hydrofluoric acid that does not affect the silicon, leaving behind the all-important light-sensitive shell. These shells form optical whispering galleries that capture and recirculate the light.\n\n\"The light gets trapped inside the nanoshells,\" said Yi Cui, associate professor of materials science engineering at Stanford and a senior author of the paper. \"It circulates round and round rather than passing through and this is very desirable for solar applications.\"\n\nThe researchers estimate that light circulates around the circumference of the shells a few times during which energy from the light gets absorbed gradually by the silicon. The longer they can keep the light in the material, the better the absorption will be.\n\n\"This is a new approach to broadband light absorption. The use of whispering-gallery resonant modes inside nanoshells is very exciting,\" said Yan Yao, a post-doctoral researcher in the Cui Lab and a co-lead author of the paper. \"It not only can lead to better solar cells, but it can be applied in other areas where efficient light absorption is important, such as solar fuels and photodetectors.\"\n\nThrough thick and thin\n\nIn measuring light absorption in a single layer of nanoshells, the team showed significantly more absorption over a broader spectrum of light than a flat layer of the silicon deposited side-by-side with the nanoshells.\n\n\"The nanometer spherical shells really hit a sweet spot and maximize the absorption efficiency of the film. The shells both allow light to enter the film easily and they trap it so as to enhance the absorption in a way larger-scale counterparts cannot. That is the power of nanotechnology,\" said Jie Yao, a post-doctoral researcher in Cui's lab and co-lead author of the paper.\n\nFurther, by depositing two or even three layers of nanoshells atop one another, the team teased the absorption higher still. With a three-layer structure, they were able to achieve total absorption of 75% of light in certain important ranges of the solar spectrum.\n\nClever structure\n\nHaving demonstrated improved absorption, the engineers went on to show how their clever structure will pay dividends beyond the mere trapping of light.\n\nFirst, nanoshells can be made quickly. \"A micron-thick flat film of solid nanocrystalline-silicon can take a few hours to deposit, while nanoshells achieving similar light absorption take just minutes,\" said Yan.\n\nThe nanoshell structure likewise uses substantially less material, one-twentieth that of solid nanocrystalline-silicon.\n\n\"A twentieth of the material, of course, costs one-twentieth and weighs one-twentieth what a solid layer does,\" said Jie. \"This might allow us to cost effectively produce better-performing solar cells of rare or expensive materials.\"\n\n\"The solar film in our paper is made of relatively abundant silicon, but down the road, the reduction in materials afforded by nanoshells could prove important to scaling up the manufacturing of many types of thin film cells, such as those which use rarer materials like tellurium and indium\" said Vijay Narasimhan, a doctoral candidate in the Cui Lab and co-author of the paper.\n\nFinally, the nanoshells are relatively indifferent to the angle of incoming light and the layers are thin enough that they can bend and twist without damage. These factors might open up an array of new applications in situations where achieving optimal incoming angle of the sun light is not always possible. Imagine solar sails on the high seas or photovoltaic clothing for mountain climbing.\n\n\"This new structure is just the beginning and demonstrates some of exciting potentials for using advanced nanophotonic structures to improve solar cell efficiency,\" said Shanhui Fan.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nSilicon is readily available, easy to process, highly stable and non-toxic.

The hydrogen is burned at the same time to produce more high-power steam, and the two steam sources power the engine. The new technology produces no carbon dioxide or other harmful emissions and the only by-products from this reaction are water and magnesium oxide. The magnesium is separated from the oxide through a solar-powered laser process and is reused over and over again as fuel. This clean energy cycle, which is supported by solar power, has the potential to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, and could bring about a paradigm shift in the way future energy needs are met.\n\nwhy would it nead a solar powered laser? Could it not produce it's own power trough a generator?\n\nDos it nead 5w from solar power to produce 4 on it's own?\n\nMost likely. The advantage over typical solar-storage systems would be power density and immediate output. It is basicaly a rechargable primary battery. Many naval weapon system have been using lightweight sea water/active metal batteries for years.\n\nMy money says that an analysis will show that the overall system (ore to consumer) is energy negative due to the material (magnesium, high temp steels, solar pannels) processing and forming energy debitIn Japan, the Tokyo Institute of Technology is developing an efficient solar powered laser. This laser will supposedly aid in the development of magnesium combustion engine.\n\nAccording to the professor of mechanical engineering and science, Takashi Yabe, their goal is to create a powerful laser that can effectively combust magnesium from sea water. You would be astonished to know that Magnesium is a great energy source, as its energy storage density is 10 times more than hydrogen. Moreover, it is also immensely abundant.\n\nYabe also informed that magnesium oxide produced from the reaction can again be converted into magnesium. This recycling process demands great temperature. In order to operate magnesium combustion engine, solar power is required for the lasers. Lasers concentrate sunlight on neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet. Usually, solar powered lasers depends a lot on large mirrors. However, Yabe along with his colleagues have developed an immensely powerful laser.\n\nThis was made possible with the addition of chromium. Yabe stated, \"Thus the efficiency from sunlight to laser is greatly enhanced.\" Instead of large mirrors, they have sued small Fresnel lens. Yabe also informed that, \"In our case, we used only 1.3 meter squared and achieved 25 watts,\" he further added, \"So we are expecting 300 to 400 watts with the four-meter-squared Fresnel lens.\"\n\nSunita Stayapal, HOD of Hydrogen Storage team, state it as unusual approach. She also said, \"The key issue is cost and total efficiency.\" She also informed several other ways of generating hydrogen from solar power\n\nMy impression of the technology (the link in post 1 is broken, btw) is that metallic magnesium is being used as an intermediary, ie. a storage medium, between a stationary solar collector and a mobile engine. Much like hydrogen, produced by electrolyzing water via solar-generated electricity, can be stored and later burned in an engine or reacted in a fuel cell. The magnesium or hydrogen is used, in its elemental (high chemical potential energy) state, as a storage medium.\nCrude oil is, in a way, similar. It stores in its chemical bonds a large amount of energy that was absorbed many millions of years ago, and is now being released as we burn it. Perhaps the most important difference is that the process of restoring water or magnesium oxide to hydrogen or magnesium, respectively, would be repeated at will by us, while the process of converting plant matter to crude oil ceased with the evolution of organisms capable of decomposing plant matter, and cannot now be restarted.\nThe magnesium-based system being discussed here has a significant advantage over hydrogen-based storage systems, in that the energy density is probably a lot better. I have to agree with DB, though, that it is a dangerous proposition onboard a boat"

This process is used to make organic solar cells and organic light-emitting diodes that go into displays on mobile phones.\n\nThese devices offer advantages over conventional silicon- or semiconductor-based electronics because they can be more flexible, irregularly shaped, and lighter in weight, reports Mitch Jacoby for Chemical & Engineering News. However, organic electronic devices tend to remain expensive because some of the manufacturing steps require vacuum processing to prevent the component materials — calcium, magnesium, and lithium — from reacting with oxygen and moisture. This is why electronics in solar cells or TVs are often covered with rigid, thick plates of glass or encapsulating layers.\n\nNow, a team of scientists from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) have developed a method to eliminate this problem. They spread a layer of polyethylen­imine or ethoxylated polyethyl­enimine one to 10 nanometers thick onto a conductor's surface. The application turns the air-stable conductors into efficient, low-work function electrodes. The polymers are commercially available and are diluted in solvents before applied.\n\nReplacing reactive metals like lithium and calcium with stable conductors, including conducting polymers, completely changes the requirements of how electronics are manufactured and protected and paves the way for lower cost and more flexible devices. This technique is based on the printing of organic inks that have semiconducting properties that can be processed at temperatures below 200 C.

But, more than this, it will be clean and renewable energy,\" says Australian Museum Director, Frank Howarth.\n\nWhile photovoltaics is the world's most rapidly growing energy source, the production of solar cells currently requires sophisticated and expensive manufacturing facilities and highly trained personnel. These conditions are not easily available in developing countries. Nicole Kuepper's low cost and low-tech solar cells could offer a way to remove the dependence of developing countries on greenhouse gas-producing energy sources.\n\nBeyond her work as a scientific innovator, Ms Kuepper has also taken up the role of communicator and educator. She lectures in engineering at UNSW, where she has developed courses on the ethics of manufacturing and sustainable energy in developing countries.\n\nMs Kuepper has taken her message out of the University and into the broader community, using a creative and accessible approach to her subject matter. She has held miniature solar car races to teach Indigenous children about renewable energy and incorporated pop music into a waste management course in the Philippines.\n\nHer leadership credentials are demonstrated by her past presidency of the Photovoltaic Society, and her Directorship of the Sydney Energy Cooperative, which helps households reduce their CO2 emissions. Through the Green Geeks program, she has presented solar energy workshops for the ACT Greens party and conducts public lectures to help the local community around UNSW to understand this issue.\n\nRecently, Ms Kuepper was selected to attend the Australian Government's Youth Summit2020 where she presented her idea for the 'Australian Sustainability Challenge', a program which would present incentives for local governments to improve their sustainability. The idea was voted the best in the Climate Change and Sustainability category and was presented to the Australia2020 Summit proper.\n\nThe British Council Eureka Prize for Young Leaders in Environmental Issues and Climate Change, which will provide Ms Kuepper with a study tour to the UK to the value of $10,000, is awarded to a young Australian aged 21-30 for scientific or technological leadership in responding to the challenges that threaten our environment and our climate.\n\nWith mathematicians as parents, Nicole's birthday presents were always going to be little \"nerdy\". For her tenth birthday they gave her a solar energy kit, which she believes completely changed her life. Now a solar energy scientist at the University of New South Wales, Nicole is completing her PhD in new, simple ways of making photovoltaic solar power available to the 2 billion people without electricity.\n\nIt's no secret that solar energy will play a critical role in decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and abating the affects of global warming. What's not well recognised, however, is the role solar energy can play in alleviating poverty.\n\nToday, one-third of the world's population is without electricity - no lights to read by at night, no radio or TV to stay informed, and no fridge to store life-saving vaccines. There is a clear link between electricity and living standards and Nicole believes passionately that photovoltaic technology is the key to addressing poverty, by giving everyone access to cheap, green electricity.\n\nA typical photovoltaic cell is made of a thin boron doped P-type (P for positive) silicon wafer with positively charged 'holes' (missing electrons). One side of this original wafer is then doped with phosphorus to create extra electrons, and is called N-type (N for negative). Where the P and N-type silicon meet a junction is created that separates electrons and holes when exposed to light. Metal contact is made to both the P and N-type silicon allowing electrons to flow out of the N-type silicon, through a light bulb and back around to the P-type silicon. This movement of electrons constitutes an electric current - thus converting light into electricity!\n\nUnfortunately photovoltaic cells are expensive to produce, as you traditionally need access to elaborate, 'clean' manufacturing plants staffed by highly trained technicians. Most solar cells are therefore manufactured in developed countries that experience high tax, transport and labour costs, putting the technology well out of the reach of poor countries.\n\nNicole has spent the last two years researching an alternative manufacturing process and has designed and patented an affordable, simple and innovative photovoltaic device called the iJET Cell. Using Inkjet printing, aluminium spray and a pizza oven, Nicole has created metal contacts to both the negative and positive sections of a solar cell in the simple, low temperature process.\n\nWhen asked to describe the process she says \"To pattern the cell we spray on something like nail polish and then inkjet print a kind of nail polish remover which lets us etch certain parts of the wafer. This creates a metallisation pattern so we can deposit aluminium on the back surface of the solar cell and create our metal contacts to both the P and N-type silicon simultaneously using a very cheap, low temperature pizza oven! And hey presto we've created a simple, low-cost solar cell without having to use expensive high tech equipment or high temperature processes!\"\n\nNicole is busy creating prototypes of the device and working toward implementing the technology in a commercial production environment.\n\nWhen Nicole's not in her lab, she enjoys hiking and has recently climbed Mt Kinabalu in Borneo. She likes nothing more than a good fancy dress party, preferably with an 80's theme so she can don her favourite fluoro tube skirt.\n\nNicole entered her research in the British Council Eureka Prize for Young leaders in Environmental Issues and Climate Change.\n\nHi Nicole,\nI would just like to know about when you say \"affordable\" in you summery about you, what price do you mean by that?\nthankyou,\nalice\n\nCurrently silicon and labour costs dominate the production of solar panels that cost approx US$4.80/Watt ( The iJET cell has been designed to reduce both silicon and labour costs by using:\n\na) thinner wafers (ideally 50um compared to standard 250um wafers used today) of a lower quality that are significantly cheaper than standard wafers and, b) low-tech, low-temperature, low-cost processes that are well-suited to a developing country production environment where labour costs are less, jobs can be created and the panels can be used in the country where they are manufactured (reducing shipping and tax costs)\n\nThese key cost benefits will likely ensure that the iJET cell will be significantly cheaper than solar cells manufactured today. However at this stage of research it is difficult to give cost estimates as I am not yet sure what silicon purity level or thickness the iJET cell will be able to tolerate. After prototypes of the device have been created extensive economic research will have to be undertaken to determine the price of an iJET cell module.\n\nHow does your research affect peoples everyday lives?\n\nThere are currently some 2 billion people in the world who do not have access to a reliable source of electricity. Photovoltaic panels that generate electricity from the sun can be used anywhere where the sun shines and have the potential to bring light, radio, refrigeration, etc to people who currently rely on expensive and potentially dangerous energy sources such as batteries and kerosene lamps. By producing a simpler, low-cost solar cell that will be able to be manufactured in developing countries, more people will gain access to a reliable source of affordable electricity and local jobs will be created.\n\nWhat inspired you to create this amazing solar panel?\n\nI have always been interested in science, but more importantly I have always been interested in the application of science to find appropriate technological solutions to global problems. Working in developing countries heightened my interest in how products are manufactured and I soon realised that the cleanliness requirements of a standard screen-printed solar cell meant that they were not well suited to a manufacturing environment found in some of the least developed countries in the world. I wanted to see if there was a solar cell design that could use low-tech, low-temperature processes to manufacture a photovoltaic cell... what started off as a simple brainstorming exercise has lead my supervisor Prof Stuart Wenham and I to design the iJET cell!"

      "text": "Award-Winning PV Cell Pushes Efficiency Higher\n\nSo how can we make a solar cell that has a higher efficiency than the rules allow?\n\nThat's the question scientists in the III-V Multijunction Photovoltaics Group at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) faced 15 years ago as they searched for materials they could grow easily that also have the ideal combinations of band gaps for converting photons from the sun into electricity with unprecedented efficiency.\n\nA band gap is an energy that characterizes how a semiconductor material absorbs photons, and how efficiently a solar cell made from that material can extract the useful energy from those photons.\n\n\"The ideal band gaps for a solar cell are determined by the solar spectrum,\" said Daniel Friedman, manager of the NREL III-V Multijunction Photovoltaics Group. \"There's no way around that.\"\n\nBut this year, Friedman's team succeeded so spectacularly in bending the rules of the solar spectrum that NREL and its industry partner, Solar Junction, won a coveted R&D 100 award from R&D Magazine for a world-record multijunction solar cell. The three-layered cell, SJ3, converted 43.5% of the energy in sunlight into electrical energy — a rate that has stimulated demand for the cell to be used in concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) arrays for utility-scale energy production.\n\nLast month, that record of 43.5% efficiency at 415 suns was eclipsed with a 44% efficiency at 947 suns. Both records were verified by NREL. This is NREL's third R&D 100 award for advances in ultra-high-efficiency multijunction cells. CPV technology gains efficiency by using low-cost lenses to multiply the sun's intensity, which scientists refer to as numbers of suns.\n\nFriedman says earlier success with multijunction cells — layered semiconductors each optimized to capture different wavelengths of light at their junctions — gave NREL a head start.\n\nThe SJ3 cells fit into the market for utility-scale CPV projects. They're designed for application under sunlight concentrated to 1,000 times its normal intensity by low-cost lenses that gather the light and direct it at each cell. In regions of clear atmosphere and intense sunlight, such as the U.S. desert Southwest, CPV has outstanding potential for lowest-cost solar electricity. There is enough available sunlight in these areas to supply the electrical energy needs of the entire United States many times over.\n\nBending Material to the Band Gaps on the Solar Spectrum\n\nSunlight is made up of photons of a wide range of energies from roughly zero to four electron volts (eV). This broad range of energies presents a fundamental challenge to conventional solar cells, which have a single photovoltaic junction with a single characteristic band gap energy.\n\nConventional cells most efficiently convert those photons that very nearly match the band gap of the semiconductors in the cell. Higher-energy photons give up their excess energy to the solar cell as waste heat, while lower-energy photons are not collected by the solar cell, and their energy is completely lost.\n\nThis behavior sets a fundamental limit on the efficiency of a conventional solar cell. Scientists overcome this limitation by using multijunction solar cells. Using multiple layers of materials in the cells, they create multiple junctions, each with different band gap energies. Each converts a different energy range of the solar spectrum. An invention in the mid-1980s by NREL's Jerry Olson and Sarah Kurtz led to the first practical, commercial multijunction solar cell, a GaInP/GaAs two-junction cell with 1.85-eV and 1.4-eV bandgaps that was recognized with an R&D 100 award in 1990, and later to the three-junction commercial cell based on GaInP/GaAs/Ge that won an R&D 100 award in 2001.\n\nThe researchers at NREL knew that if they could replace the 0.67-eV third junction with one better tuned to the solar spectrum, the resulting cell would capture more of the sun's light throughout the day. But they needed a material that had an atomic structure that matched the lattice of the layer above it — and that also had the ideal band gap.\n\n\"We knew from the shape of the solar spectrum and modeling solar cells that what we wanted was a third junction that has a band gap of about 1.0 electron volt, lattice-matched to gallium arsenide,\" Friedman said. \"The lattice match makes materials easier to grow.\"\n\nThey concentrated on materials from the third and fifth columns of the periodic table because these so-called III-V semiconductors have similar crystal structures and ideal diffusion, absorption, and mobility properties for solar cells.\n\nBut there was seemingly no way to capture the benefits of the gallium arsenide material while matching the lattice of the layer below, because no known III-V material compatible with gallium arsenide growth had both the desired 1-eV band gap and the lattice-constant match to gallium arsenide.\n\nThat changed in the early 1990s, when a research group at NTT Laboratories in Tokyo working on an unrelated problem made an unexpected discovery. Even though gallium nitride has a higher band gap than gallium arsenide, when you add a bit of nitrogen to gallium arsenide, the band gap shrinks — exactly the opposite of what was expected to happen.\n\n\"That was very surprising, and it stimulated a great deal of work all over the world, including here at NREL,\" Friedman said. \"It helped push us to start making solar cells with this new dilute nitride material.\"\n\nGood Band Gaps, but Not So Good Solar Material\n\nThe new solar cells NREL developed had two things going for them — and one big issue.\n\n\"The good things were that we could make the material very easily, and we did get the band gap and the lattice match that we wanted,\" Friedman said. \"The bad thing was that it wasn't a good solar cell material. It wasn't very good at converting absorbed photons into electrical energy. Materials quality is critical for high-performance solar cells, so this was a big problem.\"\n\nStill, NREL continued to search for a solution.\n\n\"We worked on it for quite a while, and we got to a point where we realized we had to choose between two ways of collecting current from a solar cell,\" Friedman said. \"One way is to let the electrical carriers just diffuse along without the aid of an electric field. That's what you do if you have good material.\"\n\nViewing Page 1 of 2\n\n3 Comments\n\nDr. Panicker\nPlease have a look at my patent pending solar energy system and see if you think it would be useful in India.

Organic semiconductors potentially offer a route to realizing low-cost solar cell modules, but currently suffer from low conversion efficiency.

Here are some examples of products launched recently by the various business groups.\n\nProppants in the extraction of unconventional oil and gas\n\nProppants, used in the extraction of unconventional oil and gas deposits, are beads used to prop open fractures in the rock. They are experiencing significant growth in the United States and demand is set to increase in the coming years. Imerys rapidly identified the potential of this market and has already filed 14 patents in this field. In 2008, the Group launched a small production unit for an innovative proppant. Its elongated shape helps increase the productivity of wells, while reducing the use of polluting additives. Opened at the end of 2011, the new ceramic proppants lines draws on the reserves of bauxitic kaolin held by the Group in southern Georgia (United States) and benefits from the facilities of a specialty refractories plant.\n\nCarbon for the Li-Ion battery\n\nA Li-Ion battery allows energy to be stored through the reversible exchange of lithium ions between a negative electrode (composed of specific carbon, graphite or other products) and a positive electrode (made of various metallic oxides and conducting additives such as carbon black). Reversible storage of ions on the negative electrode is made possible by a special carbon which has proved harmful and whose mechanical process consumes a large amount of energy. To respond to health and environmental concerns, Timcal, an Imerys subsidiary and world leader in carbon black, proposed an alternative solution in 2005. This was subsequently improved before being launched as a new product in 2011.\n\nZirconia for oxygen sensors\n\nThis product, developed several years ago, is a key component of advanced ignition systems for modern cars. Oxygen sensors act as a small fuel cell. In cells of this type, combustible gas is oxidized,\ngenerating a current as it passes through a ceramic membrane. In oxygen sensors, a very small fraction of exhaust gas is taken up. This small amount of gas goes through a ceramic membrane made from\nyttrium oxide-stabilized zirconia before regaining the oxygen in air. The difference in electrical potential generated in this way depends on the oxygen content of the initial gas, the composition of which can therefore be measured. In practice, two cells are used in a row to make the mechanism more accurate. An especially demanding automotive parts supplier chose Imerys zirconia because of its\nrepeatability qualities."

Channels formed by polymers (tan) and fullerenes (dark blue) allow electric current to flow into the electrode at bottom. NIST research has revealed new information about how the channels form, potentially improving cell performance. Credit: NIST\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- A new class of economically viable solar power cells--cheap, flexible and easy to make--has come a step closer to reality as a result of recent work at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, where scientists have deepened their understanding of the complex organic films at the heart of the devices.\n flexible surfaces to create solar cell modules that can be spread over large areas as easily as unrolling a carpet. They'd be much cheaper to make and easier to adapt to a wide variety of power applications, but their market share will be limited until the technology improves. Even the best organic photovoltaics convert less than 6 percent of light into electricity and last only a few thousand hours.\n\n\"The industry believes that if these cells can exceed 10 percent efficiency and 10,000 hours of life, technology adoption will really accelerate,\" says NIST's David Germack. \"But to improve them, there is critical need to identify what's happening in the material, and at this point, we're only at the beginning.\"\n\nThe NIST team has advanced that understanding with their latest effort, which provides a powerful new measurement strategy for organic photovoltaics that reveals ways to control how they form. In the most common class of organic photovoltaics, the \"ink\" is a blend of a polymer that absorbs sunlight, enabling it to give up its electrons, and ball-shaped carbon molecules called fullerenes that collect electrons. When the ink is applied to a surface, the blend hardens into a film that contains a haphazard network of polymers intermixed with fullerene channels. In conventional devices, the polymer network should ideally all reach the bottom of the film while the fullerene channels should ideally all reach the top, so that electricity can flow in the correct direction out of the device. However, if barriers of fullerenes form between the polymers and the bottom edge of the film, the cell's efficiency will be reduced.\n\nBy applying X-ray absorption measurements to the film interfaces, the team discovered that by changing the nature of the electrode surface, it will repulse fullerenes (like oil repulses water) while attracting the polymer. The electrical properties of the interface also change dramatically. The resultant structure gives the light-generated photocurrent more opportunities to reach the proper electrodes and reduces the accumulation of fullerenes at the film bottom, both of which could improve the photovoltaic's efficiency or lifetime.\n\n\"We've identified some key parameters needed to optimize what happens at both edges of the film, which means the industry will have a strategy to optimize the cell's overall performance,\" Germack says. \"Right now, we're building on what we've learned about the edges to identify what happens throughout the film. This knowledge is really important to help industry figure out how organic cells perform and age so that their life spans will be extended.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nResearchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and Seoul National University have learned how to tweak a new class of polymer-based semiconductors to better control the location and alignment ...\n\nWhile exploring the properties of polymer formation, a team of scientists at the National Institute for Standards and Technology has made a fundamental discovery* about these materials that could improve methods ...\n\nResearchers at the Advanced Technology Institute (ATI) at the University of Surrey have reported a new technique to UV laser processing of thin film silicon for applications such as display control circuits and solar cellsAll the whilst trying desperately to schieve 4 or 6 kiloWatt-hours per square meter per 24 hour day.\n\nThe Solar Constant is 1350 Watts per square meter.\n\nDoug--\n\nI notice that on many articles related to solar energy you quote the Solar Constant, (which defines the total amount of electromagnetic radiation reaching the top of the earth's atmosphere,) whether or not the article is about spaced-based vs. ground-based energy production. You are absolutely correct that the Solar Constant is roughly 1350 W/M2, and I also understand your comment of trying to achieve 6 KW-H/M2/Day, which would require solar collectors with 100% efficiency. But, because of the attenuation of the solar radiation by the earth's atmosphere, isn't the correct number closer to 1000 W/M2 (at the equator at high noon on a clear day)? I have always believed that that number, or 250 W/M2 averaged over a day, (250x24 to get your 6 KW), to be more useful when speaking of ground-based systems and their potential. Am I mistaken?

Also, you should probably do a bit of research into\nthe uses and functions of plants.\nPlants, much like we humans,\ngenerate waste. However, unlike we humans (hopefully), plants deposit it\ninto the soil and surrounding water in which their roots reside.\nBacteria feed on that waste, and leave behind spare electrons, hydrogen\nions, and carbon dioxide after the act. A team led by Bert Hamelers\nfrom Wageningen University in the Netherlands was attempting to use\nmicrobial fuel cells to treat wastewater, when they discovered that the\ncells could send the ions to a cathode, but could not pass the\nelectrons, leaving them behind. This created an electric potential\ndifference, also known as voltage. From this, another Wageningen team,\nled by Marjolein Helder, constructed a pilot plant — essentially a test\nsystem — that was able to generate 0.44W per square meter that was\nfitted with the plant-based fuel cells. For comparison, a wood-burning\nsystem is estimated to generate about 0.7W per square meter. While\nneither number is a significant amount of power, the plant-derived\nenergy at least doesn't require gathering and shipping wood.\n\nThough\nthe system is still in the early stages and hasn't reached a higher\nvoltage as of yet, Helder feels it can reach a potential of 3.2W per\nsquare meter. The team would achieve this by tinkering with the fuel\ncell electrodes, specifically changing both the shape and size in order\nto reduce the resistance — which increased the voltage twofold the last\ntime changes were made. Another potential upgrade would be to grow the\nplants in such a way where they would direct more waste into the cells.\nThe\nsystem provides renewable energy, but it currently does not provide\nenough power to really be of any use. However, bioelectrochemist Feng\nZhao notes that Helder's current system does generate enough electricity\nto power sensors that monitor the very plants that generate the\nelectricity powering the sensors. On top of that, the system is quite\nexpensive at around $780 per square meter alone, though most of the cost\nwas reportedly due to installation fees.\nThe plant fuel cell\nsystem is far off — like all potentially revolutionary technology always\nseems to be — so at the moment, Helder and company are working on\nputting the system in a toy globe that will spin using the collected\nenergy. Perhaps one day, though, we'll all have a roof of plants that\npower our homes."

The result is basically a recreation of the same techiques ocean waves employ to pick up, collect and carry debris along the water's surface. Preliminary experiments show that thermopower has the potential to create 100 times more energy than a lithium-ion battery if it can be refined.\n\nSub-microsopic hollow nanotubes are created to form a lattice of carbon atoms that are coated with a combustible fuel source. When ignited, the nanotubes move the thermal waves 10,000 times faster than any chemical reaction, producing a pulse of heat that drives the electrons along the tube, causing 'electron entrainment'. This phenomenon \"opens up a new area of energy research,\" commented Michael Strano, MIT's Charles and Hilda Roddey Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering and senior author of the paper published in the March edition of Nature Materials. Although currently very tiny, Strano suggests nanowires could be designed into large arrays that could supply significant power for larger electrical devices.\n\n[...] with a reactive fuel which, when ignited at one end by a laser or high voltage spark, creates an internal thermopower wave that moves up to 10,000 times faster than the initial chemical-based chain reaction and reaches [...]"

Liquid catalysts like those in detergents can also economically convert hydrogen into electricity for vehicles, according to ACAL.\n\nPlenty of things are holding back the hydrogen economy. One of them is the cost of hydrogen fuel cells. A British company now says it has slashed costs by replacing platinum with a liquid that makes fuel cells affordable to automobile manufacturers.\n\nThe company, ACAL Energy, said in an email that it has developed its FlowCath catalyst with backing from \"a leading car manufacturer\" that it declined to identify.\n\nHydrogen fuel cells typically produce electricity by catalyzing oxygen and hydrogen. The conventional process relies on platinum, a rare and expensive metal. FlowCath gets rid of 80 percent of the platinum by using a liquid chemical catalyst inspired by detergent - an idea applied by co-founder Andy Creeth, who is a former chief scientist at soap seller Unilever.\n\nThe technology strips out 25 percent of costs \"in mass market volumes\" and \"dramatically enhances the cell's longevity,\" the company said. That could be a key advantage, since platinum itself is known to provide durability. The technology can also help shrink fuel cells, which could make it easier to fit them into cars.\n\nACAL's backers include the unnamed auto company, as well as Belgian chemicals company Solvay and The Carbon Trust, a U.K. low carbon advisory group with strong ties to German industrial company Siemens.\n\nIt has hired a new CEO, Greg McCray, to oversee its licensing business model. McCray was CEO of Antenova, a British firm that provides antenna technology to smartphone and consumer electronics manufacturers.\n\nNow, if only someone would license a way to economically obtain hydrogen in the first place. And transport it.\n\nImage from Unilever\n\nCycle through this list of previous hydrogen and related stories on SmartPlanetPosted by adornoe\n\n20th Feb\n\nJust InHydrogen\n\nI think the problem with hydrogen as a fuel for light vehicles is having a large enough tank. Hydrogen is difficult to handle and requires either an extremely high pressure tank to hold it or an impractically cold tank so it can be held as a liquid. Unless someone develops a way to simply catalyze hydrogen out of water at a high enough rate to feed the fuel cell I think it is an impractical fuel for most vehicles."

There are many types of batteries available, representing a multi-billion dollar industry. Among the battery types of much interest are standard lead acid batteries and Li-ion batteries. Materials improvements are critical in making these energy systems more effective in the future. The Batteries track will explore novel energy storage materials and technologies.\n\nBiomass\n\nBiomass is energy derived from organic plant and animal matter, including wood, crops, manure and municipal solid wastes. When burned, the energy in biomass is released as heat but it can also be converted to other forms of energy like methane gas, ethanol and biodiesel. The Biomass track will deal with bioprocess development along with materials challenges.\n\nElectric Grid\n\nThe Electric Grid is an interconnected network designed to deliver electricity from various energy sources, and involves controlling the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. The grid cannot store significant amounts of power, so electricity must be generated as needed. This track will spotlight the development of efficient and effective control systems to match electric generation with use.\n\nGeothermal\n\nMost geothermal reservoirs are deep underground but can find their way to the surface as volcanoes, hot springs and geysers. California has almost three dozen geothermal power plants that produce the largest fraction of U.S. energy from this source. The Geothermal track explores geothermal systems and applications.\n\nHydrogen\n\nHydrogen can be produced from a variety of sources, including fossil fuels as well as from renewable resources and can be stored in gas, liquid or solid forms. There is considerable work in progress on development of materials and systems for effective hydrogen storage. The Hydrogen track will focus on H-separations, H-interactions and effects on materials; new methods and novel materials for H-Storage; theoretical studies of H-storage materials and additional practical use in energy storage systems; absorption, catalysis and means of enhancing H-interaction with materials; and analytical methods and characteristics of novel hydrogen storage systems.\n\nHydropower\n\nHydropower is the most often used form of renewable energy in the U.S. Mechanical energy is produced and used by harnessing moving water. The Hydropower track will explore material challenges for conventional and marine hydropower.\n\nMaterials Availability for Alternative Energy\n\nTying all of the alternative energy technologies together is the availability of the materials needed to solve the issues for creating, storage and distribution of energy. This track will focus on challenges and solutions in materials availability as we develop our new and sustainable energy infrastructure.\n\nNanocomposites and Nanomaterials for Energy\n\nThere has been a tremendous increase in the use of nanocomposite materials to improve the existing energy systems based on conventional and renewable energy sources. This track will focus on the possibilities and limitations of the use of nanomaterials in providing solutions for the current energy issues in solar cells, fuel cells, supercapacitors, and more.\n\nNuclear\n\nNuclear power extracts usable energy from atomic nuclei by controlled nuclear reactions and most often, through nuclear fission. This track will focus on improved and advanced materials systems for fuel and nuclear power plant components.\n\nSolar Fuels\n\nDirect production of fuels from solar energy represents the most prominent and promising avenue for sustainable energy solutions derived from regenerative primary energy sources. The conversion of light into electrical or storable chemical energy can be achieved by photovoltaics (PVs) and photoelectrochemical systems, respectively. This track will address science and technology of energy harvesting modules based on photonic stimulation of semiconductor materials, including novel structures for solar thermal, solar hydrogen, and artificial photosynthesis.\n\nWind\n\nWind power is the conversion of wind energy into a useful form of energy, such as using wind turbines to make electrical power or windmills for mechanical power. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, wind power in the United States has grown to over 50,000 MW, enough electricity to power 13 million homes annually. This track will explore current and emerging materials and technologies in this growing energy system."

Now in a new study, researchers for the first time have used a laser\nto control the motion of a magnetically levitating graphite disk. By changing the disk's temperature, the laser can change the disk's levitation\nheight and move it in a controlled direction, which has the potential to be scaled up and used as a light-driven human transportation system. Laser\nlight or sunlight can also cause the levitating disk to rotate at over 200 rpm, which could lead to a new type of light energy conversion\nsystem.\n\nI can imagine in a controlled environment, like a factory setting or shipping center (think of Amazon's massive fulfillment centers) a maglev sled\nusing a laser light to guide it would require virtually no energy for movement on it's rounds.\n\nThe experiment also demonstrated the disk would spin just using sunlight - could we one day see massive disks hovering over a field of magnets using\nsunlight to cause it to spin, would it generate enough torque to drive machinery?\n\nDemonstrations of a diamagnetic graphite disk being moved in a linear direction and rotated by a laser, and rotated by sunlight. A large enough\ngraphite disk could potentially be used as a new type of light-driven human transportation system. Video credit: Masayuki Kobayashi and Jiro\nAbe\n\nRotation also occurs when the set-up is exposed to sunlight. By converting solar energy into rotational energy, the disk can reach a rotational\nspeed of more than 200 rpm, which could make it useful for applications such as optically driven turbines.\n\nOf course a 'Crookes radiometer' can spin just using sunlight, but there's no useful torque to be gained from this device for driving machinery.\n(There are multiple theories over the cause of this effect, more than a hundred years after it's first demonstration.)\n\nI think this experiment shows a great deal of potential, but also how little we still grasp magnetism.\n\nDon't worry, once the free lunch crowd gets their hands on the concept they will 'develop' antigravity spaceships that power themselves for 1000\nyears off this technology. Surprisingly, there will be no independent tests to back their claims, but, lo and behold you can buy plans/components to\ntheir apparatus for only $89.99+Shipping.\n\nI have a SLIGHT problem with this: \"I can imagine in a controlled environment, like a factory setting or shipping center (think of Amazon's massive\nfulfillment centers) a maglev sled using a laser light to guide it would require virtually no energy for movement on it's rounds.\"\n\nWould require NO ENERGY...\nWere do the \"Laser\" come from...Thin air???\n\nI like the idea but it will require energy and if using LASERS....\nLOTS of energy"

      "text": "Nanosheet Filters Could Cut Cost of Gas\n\nZeolite has been known for decades as an absorbent and a catalyst in many industries. In the future, sheets of it just nanometers thick may be used to filter gasoline out of crude oil.\n\nA team of researchers at the University of Minnesota led by materials science professor Michael Tsapatsis, found a way to make ultra-thin sheets of zeolite that can speed up filtration and save a lot of energy (and money) in the process.\n\nSubstances such as gasoline are usually distilled from the parent liquid. Gasoline, for example, is produced when crude oil is mixed with ordinary powdered zeolite, which helps to separate the gasoline and other products from the crude. Purifying gasoline -– or any other liquid –- requires additional filtration.\n\nDNEWS VIDEO: GREEN ENERGY\n\nBut that can eat up a lot of energy. Filtration can be a good 15 percent of the energy used in separating liquids. A lot of that energy is lost because the whole filtering process isn't very efficient. Rising energy prices have made it tougher for industry to ignore the extra costs.\n\nA molecular membrane, one that let molecules of only a certain size pass through, would go a long way towards boosting that efficiency and that's where the invention of nanometer-scale films of zeolite comes in.\n\nThe researchers used sound waves in a centrifuge to develop \"carpets\" of zeolite that are have just the right thickness. The resulting product can be used to separate molecules like a sieve. Ordinarily zeolite is not that hard to make, but forms chunks rather than ultra-thin sheets."

These are proteins that help move electrons back and forth.\n\nIt also has genes that help it find metallic compounds. Plus the bacterium, previously thought to be able to exist only in the absence of oxygen, may have genes that would allow it to function when oxygen is present.\n\n\"We've provided a comprehensive picture that has led to fundamental changes in how scientists evaluate this microbe,\" said Barbara Methe, the TIGR researcher who led the study.\n\nThe first Geobacter species to be discovered, G. metallireducens, was found in sediments from the Potomac River, which separates Maryland from Virginia in the Washington D.C. area.\n\nG. sulfurreducens was found in a soil sample in Oklahoma that was contaminated by hydrocarbons -- breakdown products of fossil fuel combustion.\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts researcher Derek Lovley and colleagues have previously found that G. sulfurreducens can convert uranium that is dissolved in water to a solid compound called uraninite, which can then be removed.\n\nThe bacteria removed about 70 percent of the uranium from a contaminated underground aquifer.\n\nA manga about the effects of the United States using depleted uranium in its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq will be published in book form following massive public acclaim, according to publisher Kodansha Ltd.\n\nHundreds responded to the story when it ran in the weekly Shonen Magazine, prompting Kodansha to bring out the book some time next month.\n\nManga has helped formulate many people's views on the wars and taught others about depleted uranium bullets for the first time. \"Newspapers and TV haven't really devoted a great deal of time to coverage of the depleted uranium issue, so the manga seems to have slipped into that gap,\" a Kodansha spokesman said.\n\nShonen Magazine started in May to run a column by Tetsu Nakamura, head of an NGO offering medical support in Iraq.\n\nWhen it was completed, Kodansha editors decided to run a follow-up featuring the war in Iraq. Cartoonist Yoshiharu Mitsue, who also illustrated Nakamura's column, decided to tell the story of Takashi Morizumi, a photojournalist focusing on the use of depleted uranium bullets. The acclaimed story tells of Morizumi's encounters with victims of the Iraq war and the effects radiation from the controversial bullets has had on their bodies.\n\nResponse to the story was astounding, primarily coming from male students, housewives and high schoolgirls.\n\nAbout 80 percent of messages the publisher has received have been antiwar or anti-American in nature. Dissenting voices have also been heard.\n\n\"Don't make out the United States as the only bad guy,\" one letter read, while another pointed out: \"(Deposed Iraqi President Saddam) Hussein was also bad. It would have been a better story if you had written what caused the wars.\" (Mainichi Shimbun, Japan, Dec. 12, 2003)\n\nChancellor Gerhard Schröder has said he will not rethink his decision to allow Siemens to ship a mothballed nuclear reprocessing plant to China. His government's junior coalition partner, the Greens, must deal with the dissent within the party on their own, he said.\n\nForeign Minister Joschka Fischer, a member of the Greens, called the decision \"bitter\" but said the government had no legal basis to withhold export approval. \"This isn't a question of credibility or a lack of credibility but an obligation to uphold the law. On the other hand, if you ask me about the political implications of the whole thing, I can only stress that we are all convinced that we should not only get out of atomic energy but that we should also implement that decision.\"\n\nThe Environment Minister, Jürgen Trittin, who pushed through legislation to phase out nuclear energy in Germany, has not made a statement on the facility's sale. \"The minister of the environment went into hiding, but it's not right that he hasn't said anything about this issue,\" said Albert Schmidt, a member of parliament.\n\nLacking support from their own top-ranked politicians, the Greens said they hoped Washington would move to stop the sale. Greens party leader Angelika Beer speculated that the United States would intervene because of China's nuclear armament. \"I don't think that the Americans are excited by this,\" she said on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. state department said the government does not oppose the sale, according to Handelsblatt newspaper. Schröder preempted potential controversy with Washington by promising to involve the International Atomic Energy Commission in the sale of the plutonium enrichment facility.\n\nThe chancellor had announced his intention to support the sale of the reprocessing plant during his visit to China last week, where he also called for an end to the 14-year EU weapons embargo against that country. Imposed after troops gunned down a revolt on Peking's Tiananmen square in 1989, this embargo has come to be seen by EU businesses as a political boomerang for trade. If the EU arms embargo falls, a much bigger beneficiary could be Germany's struggling armaments industry, which is currently being bought up by U.S. investors because the volume of EU military contracting is too small to sustain it.\n\nSchröder, who is on record for opposing this sellout of weapons technology to non-European interests, has taken concrete steps to protect the domestic weapons industry from foreigners. On Wednesday, his cabinet signed off on legislation that would put the final decision about the sale of stakes in German military contractors in the hands of the government.\n\nGermany's plans to promote the EU's weapons industry received another boost earlier this week when the EU heads of government and state agreed to adopt the joint proposal of Germany, France and Belgium made last May to set up a general staff for central military planning and execution, a plan that is fiercely opposed by the U.S. government.\n\nThis autumn, the U.S. diplomat at Nato, Nicholas Burns, had called the EU's plan to set up its own general staff for planning and carrying out military action \"the most significant threat to Nato's future.\"\n\nIndividual member countries are free to join the new military alliance. The EU military staff in Brussels will be expanded. At the same time, the EU's military planning group, which currently has its office at Nato, will be established on a permanent basis.\n\nThe expected uproar over the likely export of a plutonium plant to China has now been raised - not by the three Green party ministers in Germany's coalition government, but among second and third-level politicians. And the arguments of parliamentarians, who years ago found strong words to condemn the \"nuclear mafia,\" sound strangely feeble.\n\n\"This has to be examined,\" they say, adding that \"everything needs to be done\" to prevent the export. Those are the words of people who know they have already lost the fight. The cabinet has already made its decision, and what follows now is nothing but a futile rearguard action.\n\nThe callousness with which Chancellor Gerhard Schröder is now supporting the sale of the plutonium plant, sitting unused near Frankfurt, mocks the propaganda with which the constructors of the facility were once forced to capitulate in Germany. In fact, Germany is one of the few countries in which the hazardous business of dealing with plutonium can be carried out safely; the necessary precondition is an open society with reliable watchdogs and high technical standards, but China, as a single-party state, does not entirely fulfill these preconditions. Therefore, selling the technology to the Chinese is less responsible than operating it in Germany.\n\nIndeed, the use of nuclear energy in Germany is being wound down not because the risks cannot be controlled, but because of political resistance to the technology. To this day, Social Democrats and Greens are proud to have spoilt this business for industry through \"exit-oriented legislation\" that is nothing more than bureaucratic bullying.\n\nThe world noticed, with both bafflement and amusement, that Germany voluntarily relinquished its leading position in this technology and instead concentrated on the production of wind mills. Meanwhile, the high-temperature reactor, which is immune to the much-feared core meltdown and was also invented in Germany, is being readied for serial production in South Africa and China.\n\nIt might return to Germany from there one day.\n\n-------- india / pakistan\nPakistan Holds Scientists for Questioning\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nNEW YORK TIMES\n\n\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Dec. 11 - Government officials confirmed Thursday that they were questioning two Pakistani nuclear scientists who were reported missing on Sunday. But they denied newspaper reports that the scientists were under investigation for sharing nuclear weapons technology with Iran.\n\nMasood Khan, a foreign ministry spokesman, said there were no links between the scientists and Iran's nuclear weapons program. He said the scientists were only being \"debriefed\" and had not been taken into custody.\n\n\"People associated with sensitive programs in Pakistan are governed by stringent personnel dependability,\" he told reporters here. \"The debrief program will end soon.\"\n\nTwo major Pakistani newspapers carried reports this week identifying the scientists as Dr. Yasin Chohan and Dr. Muhammad Farooq and saying that they were being questioned for possible links to the Iranian nuclear program.\n\nThe men held senior positions in Kahuta at the Khan Research Laboratories, named for Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, the founder of Pakistan's nuclear program.\n\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- One of two Pakistani nuclear engineers detained for unspecified reasons has been released, officials said Friday.\n\nYasin Chuhan, a senior engineer at Pakistan's main nuclear weapons laboratory, was released Thursday after four days in custody.\n\nHis colleague, Mohammad Farooq, a former director general at the laboratories, was still being questioned but might be freed soon, officials said. He is a former aide to Abdul Qadeer Khan, the founder of Pakistan's nuclear program.\n\nThe government insists the two men were not arrested but has refused to say why they were being questioned.\n\nOn Friday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan said Chuhan has ``resumed his normal duties'' after the completion of ``debriefing sessions.''\n\nChuban works for the main nuclear weapons program at Khan Research Laboratories, according to the Federation of American Scientists.\n\nPakistan, a nuclear-armed nation, has been accused of sharing its technological know-how with other countries -- including Iran and North Korea. It denies the charge.\n\nLast year, Pakistan detained a former nuclear scientist, Sultan Bashiruddin Mehmood, on suspicion of having links with Osama bin Laden.\n\nMehmood, who worked for Pakistan's Atomic Energy Commission until his retirement in 1999, was later freed.\n\nKARACHI (Reuters) - With one eye on nuclear rival India, Pakistan launched its first home-made submarine on Friday in what the navy called a ``quantum leap'' toward military self-reliance.\n\nAt a ceremony at Karachi's naval dockyard, President Pervez Musharraf inaugurated the Agosta 90B submarine five years after construction began with the help of French state-controlled naval shipbuilder Direction des Constructions Navales (DCN).\n\n``It has given a considerable boost to our defense capabilities,'' the military leader said. ``Pakistan has joined the elite group of countries which can construct submarines. It is a step toward self-reliance.''\n\nThe launch of the vessel was delayed by the U.S.-led war in neighboring Afghanistan and the killing in May 2002 of 11 French naval technicians working on the project by a suicide bomber. The attack has been linked to Islamic militant groups in Pakistan.\n\n``I express my heartfelt condolences to the families of the French engineers who lost their lives in this gruesome attack,'' Musharraf said.\n\nThe diesel-electric submarine is the second of three to be constructed under a deal with France, and the navy said in a statement it would go on building conventional submarines once they were finished. The first of the three was built in France and has been in service with the Pakistan navy since 1999.\n\nThe Agostas have been fitted with modern command and control systems and are capable of launching anti-ship missiles and torpedoes. It is designed as an anti-submarine, anti-surface and intelligence gathering resource.\n\nMAIN THREAT INTERNAL\n\nMusharraf said the main threat to Pakistan was not ``external,'' but came from religious extremism and sectarianism.\n\n``This menace of extremism is eating us like termites. All Muslims are facing a threat because of it,'' he said.\n\nBut the navy made a pointed reference to India:\n\n``The induction of this new submarine...will help maintain peace and stability in this volatile region by deterring our main adversary from any kind of adventurism,'' the statement said.\n\nPakistan has become increasingly alarmed at aggressive defense acquisitions by India in recent years, saying that they could further upset the military balance in South Asia in conventional and nuclear forces.\n\nMusharraf recently banned six radical Islamic groups, some of which had already been outlawed but reappeared under new names.\n\nThe groups have been blamed for a wave of violence aimed at Western and Christian targets as well as Pakistanis from rival Muslim sects.\n\nSome outfits have been linked to the al Qaeda network and others are involved in a separatist insurgency in the disputed Kashmir region, the trigger for two of three wars between India and Pakistan since independence from Britain.\n\nThe neighbors are taking tentative steps toward peace after coming to the brink of war last year, although there is little prospect of a swift resolution to the core Kashmir issue.\n\nMusharraf criticized India for building a fence along the heavily militarized de facto border dividing the two countries in the Himalayan region.\n\n``There should be no change on the Line of Control, especially when there are talks of rapprochement.''\n\nBoth countries are holding to a cease-fire along the frontier ahead of a regional summit in Islamabad in January which may provide a platform for further peace initiatives.\n\n-------- israel\nAgency Thinks Israel Has Nuclear Weapons\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said in an interview published Friday that he believes Israel has nuclear weapons and suggested Israel rid itself of the stockpile to promote Mideast peace.\n\nMohamed ElBaradei also revealed that he has toured some of Israel's nuclear plants, although not the reactor in the southern town of Dimona where it is believed Israel produces arms.\n\nElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, spoke to the Israeli daily Haaretz at his office in Vienna. The newspaper didn't say when the interview was conducted.\n\nElBaradei said he has made several visits to Israel, most recently in the late 1990s when he met with Benjamin Netanyahu, who was then prime minister. The visits were not made public at the time.\n\nThe newspaper said ElBaradei came as a guest of the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission. ElBaradei has been a senior member of the International Atomic Energy Agency since 1984.\n\nElBaradei said his most recent contact with Israeli leaders was a meeting in Vienna with Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom. The newspaper did not say when the meeting occurred.\n\nElBaradei said he cannot confirm independently that Israel has nuclear arms, but that ``we work on the assumption that Israel has nuclear capability.''\n\n``I haven't seen that Israel ever denied it,'' he added.\n\nIsrael has refused to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, aimed at stopping the spread of nuclear weapons, because it objects to international inspections.\n\nAlthough widely assumed to have a stockpile of nuclear weapons, the government's public policy is purposely vague, stating only that Israel will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle East.\n\nIn 1986, Mordechai Vanunu, a former technician at the Dimona plant, gave pictures of his workplace to The Times of London. Based on the photographs, scientists at the time said Israel had the sixth-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world. Vanunu is serving an 18-year term for treason and espionage.\n\nIn his talks with Israeli officials, ElBaradei said he ``raised the regional situation and issues of nuclear weapons with them. The status quo is not one with which I feel comfortable.''\n\nHe told Haaretz that opening discussions on the nuclear issue does not prejudge their outcome but dialogue is essential to reduce tension.\n\n``My fear is that without such a dialogue, there will be continued incentive for the region's countries to develop weapons of mass destruction to match the Israeli arsenal,'' he said.\n\n``As I go around the Middle East there is a sensation of frustration and impotence. People say there is an asymmetrical situation and a situation that is not sustainable and that we cannot go on like this, and I agree.''\n\nA northern village is in the running for a multinational fusion project.\n\n`If researchers come to Aomori, the impression of outsiders will change.'

It is also the site of a facility now under construction to reprocess spent nuclear fuel so plutonium can be extracted and used in the nation's nuclear-fuel recycling program.\n\nThe other candidate to host the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is Cadarache in France, which was chosen by the European Union in November.\n\nNuclear fusion is considered a dream energy source because it would use fuel and materials that are fairly abundant. A nuclear fusion reactor could not operate on a commercial basis until the end of the century, experts say.\n\nTheoretically, one gram of fusion fuel will produce the same energy as eight tons of petroleum. The goal of the ITER project is more modest: to produce more than 10 times the energy used and to maintain nuclear fusion continuously-for more than five minutes.\n\n-Still the operation will have to cope with extraordinary levels of energy. About 500,000 kilowatts of electricity will be needed. Part of the problem, then, will be to harness all that power-enough to rip apart atoms and vaporize their cores.\n\nThe solution will be a tokamak-style vacuum container shaped like a doughnut. Its outer diameter will be about 20 meters.\n\nSuperconducting magnetic coils will confine and heat the fuel, deuterium and tritium, to temperatures above 100 million degrees. At that temperature, the fuel becomes a plasma, in which atomic nuclei and electrons are separated.\n\nThe site to host the ITER is expected to be selected at a ministerial meeting set for Dec. 20 in Washington, D.C. Victory, however, will come at a price, with the finalist contributing the lion's share of about 300 billion yen for construction and equipment.\n\nThe total cost for all participants is expected to reach 1.3 trillion yen over the 20-year life of the project. The budget was decided in Dec. 4-5 negotiations in Vienna. ITER members are Japan, the EU, Russia, Canada, the United States, China and South Korea.\n\nInternational negotiations to pick the construction site, as well as participants in operating the ITER facility, got under way in November 2001. Japan offered Rokkasho as a candidate in May 2002.\n\nThe selection of the construction site will be made through a vote of the seven members.\n\nScience and technology ministry officials have been lobbying their counterparts in China and South Korea to back Japan. However, an official with the Cabinet Office said China appears to be leaning toward France, but Russia may back Japan.\n\nOther government officials said they hoped lingering ill will between the United States and France over the war in Iraq will work in Tokyo's favor.\n\nAomori business circles are keen for Rokkasho to win.\n\n``If advanced technology and researchers come to Aomori, which has a negative image as being at the end of the northern part of Honshu, the impression of outsiders toward us will change,'' said Mitsuo Hayashi, president of the Federation of Aomori Prefecture Chambers of Commerce and Industry.\n\nConstruction of the experimental reactor will cost about 570 billion yen and take about a decade to complete. In addition, about 600 billion yen will be needed to operate and maintain the facility during its life span.\n\nCanada said it cannot pay its share, which leaves financing to the other six members. The United States, China, Russia and South Korea will pay 10 percent each.\n\nThe winner of the construction site contest, either Japan or France, will pay about 48 percent and the loser the rest.\n\nIn addition to construction, the winner will pay all costs for equipment: price tag about 90 billion yen.\n\nExpenses will also be incurred for improving roads to the facility and housing and schools for foreign researchers and their families.\n\nThe Cabinet approved the Rokkasho candidate on condition no special fiscal measures would be implemented. That means the budget for other science and technology projects will have to be cut.\n\nAmong the projects that could be affected are the high-intensity proton accelerator under construction jointly by the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization and the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI).\n\nTOKYO: Japanese protesters on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to change his mind about sending troops to Iraq, saying the plan was a violation of the country's pacifist constitution.\n\n\"Don't kill!\" said a banner held by about 20 members of the anti-war group Peaceboat, as they gathered across a street from the prime minister's official residence.\n\n\"Dispatching the Self Defence Forces to Iraq violates our constitution, which forbids the use of military forces,\" Peaceboat director Tatsuya Yoshioka said through a loud-hailer. \"If Japan cannot follow its own laws, how can it be a protector of democracy in Iraq?\" he added.\n\nProtesters held placards denouncing Koizumi and his allies as \"war criminals\". Japan's post-war pacifist constitution bans the use of Japanese force as a means of settling international disputes.\n\nThe dispatch has prompted deep unease among the Japanese public, with the latest survey by the national broadcaster NHK showing only 17 percent of voters supported sending the troops as soon as possible, while 28 percent opposed the plan outright.\n\nMalaysian PM warns: Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi has warned Japan its troops face unknown dangers in Iraq in an interview with Japanese media ahead of his visit here for a regional summit. \"You are going into a situation where you don't know what is going to happen,\" Abdullah was quoted as saying by Kyodo News agency on Tuesday.\n\n\"The situation in Iraq at the moment is not very predictable. The situation is so volatile. Opposition to the US presence in Iraq is very strong...it's a pity that the war has been won but not the peace,\" Abdullah said according to Kyodo. -AFP\n\nSouth Korea is investigating but has yet to confirm reports of fresh activity this month at North Korea's main nuclear center at Yongbyon, Unification Minister Jeong Se-hyun said yesterday.\n\nSouth Korea's JoongAng Ilbo newspaper quoted US and South Korean officials as saying an American intelligence satellite detected fumes rising from a coal-fired boiler at the nuclear lab at Yongbyon. The fumes were traced on four days this month.\n\nYongbyon, about 90km north of the capital Pyongyang, contains a nuclear reactor and a plutonium reprocessing plant at the center of the year-long crisis over the secretive communist state's attempts to build nuclear weapons.\n\n\"We are trying to confirm the activities, but at this stage I have no definitive information to disclose,\" Jeong told reporters at his weekly news conference in Seoul.\n\nState Department spokesman Steve Pike said he had not heard of new activity in the Yongbyon facility.\n\n\"It's the first I've heard,\" Pike said.\n\nJoongAng Ilbo quoted Seoul officials as saying the fumes were detected on Dec. 2, 3, 4 and 7, and that a truck was spotted travelling in and out of the premises of Yongbyon's five-megawatt nuclear reactor on Dec. 3.\n\nThe latest report comes as the US, South Korea, Japan, China and Russia are trying to convene a second round of six-way talks on the nuclear dispute with North Korea to follow an inconclusive first round held in Beijing in August.\n\nJeong said that a nuclear crisis resolution proposal worked out last week by South Korea, the US and Japan had been conveyed to North Korea by China.\n\nBut he said North Korea had not given a reply -- a critical step in getting the talks started before the end of the year, which remains a goal of South Korea.\n\nEchoing remarks on Wednesday by South Korea's Foreign Minister Yoon Young-kwan, Jeong said he didn't think a statement by North Korea on Tuesday calling the three-country proposal \"greatly disappointing\" represented Pyongyang's formal reply.\n\nNorth Korea's Foreign Ministry proposed a deal on Tuesday under which it would freeze its nuclear activities in exchange for energy aid and other diplomatic concessions from Washington and regional powers.\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) - Six-country talks to try to halt communist North Korea's nuclear weapons program -- which had been expected this month -- are likely to be put off until mid-January, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported on Friday.\n\nA senior South Korean official said a December meeting could not be ruled out, but it looked more likely the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and Russia would hold a second round of nuclear talks with North Korea next month, it said.\n\nBut Japan's Fuji TV network reported that preparations were still underway to try to hold the talks in Beijing from Dec. 17, which remains the goal of South Korea and its allies.\n\nA senior U.S. official in Washington played down the chances of talks this month, saying: ``I guess at this point I would say it's not impossible, rather than it's possible.''\n\nThe official said if there were to be talks next week, the last full week before the Christmas and New Year's holidays, a U.S. team would probably have to leave on Sunday or Monday.\n\nA European Union delegation, which arrived in South Korea on Friday after visiting North Korea, said officials in Pyongyang indicated the North would quickly join the six-way negotiations if their conditions were met.\n\n``They would answer that they're willing to go right away, but of course the question would be on which terms,'' Percy Westerlund, a senior European Commission official, said after the three-day mission to North Korea.\n\nHe said the North Koreans, including Foreign Minister Paik Nam-sun, repeated demands for security assurances and stressed a proposal they made earlier this week to freeze their arms programs in exchange for aid.\n\nThe EU officials stressed that Brussels was not a party to the six-way talks.\n\nUNDERMINING SECURITY\n\nThe Yonhap report pointed to signs that prospects for opening talks before the end of the year had dimmed: Both the South Korean and Russian chief delegates to the talks had postponed plans to fly to Beijing.\n\n``The trend is moving toward opening talks in mid-January,'' Yonhap quoted an unnamed official as saying.\n\nU.S., Asian and Russian officials have conducted intensive shuttle diplomacy in the months since Beijing hosted an inconclusive first round of six-way talks in August to try and convince North Korea to attend a second round.\n\nEarlier this week, South Korea, the United States and Japan conveyed to China their proposed wording for a resolution to end the 14-month-old crisis. Beijing then passed it on to North Korea.\n\nPyongyang, apparently responding to media reports of elements of that U.S.-led plan, pronounced it ``greatly disappointing'' and published a counter-proposal that repeated demands for energy aid and diplomatic concessions in exchange for freezing its nuclear program.\n\nPresident Bush rejected the idea of a freeze, saying Washington wanted North Korea's nuclear arms program dismantled ``in a verifiable and irreversible way.''\n\nThe EU officials said they told Pyongyang development aid and deeper economic ties required a resolution of the crisis.\n\n``They see the nuclear weapons option as an indispensable part of their national security,'' said Westerlund.\n\n``We tried to persuade them that the development of nuclear weapons did not enhance their security. In fact, we suggested to them that it undermines their security -- that the nuclear weapons issue is the core of their problem,'' he said.\n\nThe North was unmoved by such reasoning, he added.\n\nThe CIA believes the North has produced one or two nuclear weapons. The nuclear crisis erupted in October 2002 when Washington said Pyongyang had admitted having a covert nuclear program.\n\n----\nSeoul suspects nuke activity\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nTHE WASHINGTON TIMES\n\n\nSEOUL - South Korea is investigating but has yet to confirm reports of fresh activity this month at North Korea's main nuclear center at Yongbyon, Unification Minister Jeong Se-hyun told reporters yesterday.\n\nSouth Korea's JoongAng Ilbo newspaper quoted U.S. and South Korean officials as saying an American intelligence satellite detected fumes rising from a coal-fired boiler at the nuclear lab at Yongbyon. The fumes were observed on four days this month.\n\nYongbyon, about 60 miles north of the capital, Pyongyang, has a nuclear reactor and a plutonium reprocessing plant that are at the center of the year-long crisis over the secretive communist state's attempts to build nuclear weapons.\n\n\"We are trying to confirm the activities, but at this stage I have no definitive information to disclose,\" Mr. Jeong told reporters at his weekly news conference in Seoul.\n\nState Department spokesman Steve Pike said he had not heard of new activity at the Yongbyon facility.\n\n\"It's the first I've heard,\" Mr. Pike said.\n\nThe latest report comes as the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and Russia are trying to convene a second round of six-way talks on the nuclear dispute with North Korea to follow an inconclusive first round held in Beijing in August.\n\nMr. Jeong said that a nuclear crisis resolution proposal worked out last week by South Korea, the United States and Japan had been conveyed to North Korea by China.\n\nBut he said North Korea had not given a reply.\n\nIn a separate development, the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) warned yesterday that up to 3.8 million North Koreans - 17 percent of the country's population - could be deprived of critical international food aid by the end of winter.\n\nAs the first snows fall, 2.2 million are already missing WFP deliveries because of global cutbacks in donations, the agency said in a statement. The group expects to have delivered 300,000 tons of food aid, only 62 percent of what it originally requested, in 2003.\n\nThe WFP also criticized North Korea for banning the group's activities in 43 out the country's 206 counties. The WFP has a policy of not sending aid to areas its staff can't enter.\n\n\"The restrictions imposed by the government continued to seriously impact operations and made some donors reluctant to provide food aid,\" the WFP said.\n\nAccess is a key issue for the United States, which in February said it would give North Korea 40,000 tons in food aid and could offer 60,000 more depending in part on whether Pyongyang let donors track its distribution and provided access to all vulnerable groups in the country.\n\n-------- missile defense\nMissile benchmark\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nWashington Times\nInside the Ring\nBy Bill Gertz and Rowan Scarborough\n\n\nTomorrow marks the second anniversary of President Bush's announcement that the United States would pull out of the stale Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The move paved the way for deployment next year of a ground-based interceptor. When done, the missile shield is supposed to be composed of \"layered\" defenses to knock out rockets and warheads at various launch and descent phases.\n\nThe Senate Republican Policy Committee is using the anniversary to issue an eight-page call to continue funding the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency.\n\n\"A single architecture likely will not deter rogue states from ballistic missile development or proliferation,\" the report says. \"Multiple layers of missile defense - reinforced by additional allied capability - will serve as an anti-proliferation measure. As U.S. vulnerability to ballistic missiles is reduced, so will the incentive for rogue states to produce them.\"\n\n-------- u.s. nuc weapons\nU.S. Dismantles Last Nuclear Artillery Shell\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) held a ceremony today to mark the dismantling of the last nuclear artillery shell in the U.S. nuclear stockpile.\n\nThe agency has now completed the elimination from the U.S. arsenal a type of battlefield nuclear weapon that comprised a key element of America's Cold War arsenal.\n\n\"Eliminating the last nuclear artillery warhead marks the end of an era in U.S. defense policy that included ground launched battlefield nuclear weapons,\" said NNSA Administrator Linton Brooks.\n\nThe United States introduced artillery fired atomic weapons in its defense arsenal in 1957. Six types were deployed over the years - the final shell dismantled this year was a W-79, a shell designed to be fired from an eight inch artillery piece.\n\nIn 1991, President George H.W. Bush announced his decision to retire artillery fired atomic weapons in the U.S. stockpile - the decision was made unilaterally, apart from any arms control agreement with the former Soviet Union.\n\nU.S. Secretary Spencer Abraham praised the dismantling of the weapons and said the administration of President George W. Bush is \"committed to reducing the threat of nuclear weapons worldwide.\"\n\nBut critics say the Bush administration's policies are increasing the threat. The White House requested, and received from Congress, funding to research new types of nuclear weapons and the lifting of a decade old ban on researching new low yield nuclear weapons.\n\nCongress has also approved a Bush administration request to shorten the time required to prepare for a full scale nuclear test from 24 months to 18 months.\n\nThe administration received $7.5 million for research into nuclear \"bunker buster\" weapons and $6 million for low yield nuclear weapons less than five kilotons.\n\nThe Bush administration says research into these new nuclear weapons will make the nation's nuclear arsenal into a more effective deterrent, because these kinds of weapons could reduce the potential for causing civilian casualties and could improve the effectiveness of nuclear weapons in destroying deeply buried and hardened targets.\n\nBut critics are concerned that the Bush administration's plan blurs the line between the use of nuclear and conventional weapons and could undermine the international effort to contain the world's development of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe United States has more than 10,000 nuclear weapons.\n\n----\nNew nuke\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nWashington Times\nInside the Ring\nBy Bill Gertz and Rowan Scarborough\n\n\nPentagon officials were quietly overjoyed last week when President Bush signed into law the 2004 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act. Tucked away in the spending law is $7.5 million for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator. It was half the $15 million request.\n\nThe money will be spent studying the ultimate precision guided weapon: a high-yield nuclear bomb designed to drill through rock and destroy deep underground bunkers and facilities. If the weapon is built, rogue states like North Korea and Iran can forget about hiding weapons of mass destruction in rock-hardened, blast-proof shelters.\n\nAnd the penetrating nuke also would put Russia, China and other nuclear states on notice that they will be unable to protect hardened silos or cave missile complexes. Russian underwater submarine caves also could be taken out with the bomb. Pentagon officials would love to chalk a note on the penetrator before firing one into the cave used by Osama bin Laden and company in Afghanistan, when he is eventually located.\n\nLittle has been said in public about the new weapon. Linton Brooks, director of the National Nuclear Security Administration, told a Senate hearing earlier this year one idea is to use a B-61 or B-83 nuclear warhead on a new guided aerial bomb with a special nose cone that can burrow through solid rock. \"It's not just that you have to be able to penetrate,\" he said. \"We know how to make things that will penetrate. You have to be able to penetrate and still have nuclear weapons, which are actually quite intricate machines, to work right.\"\n\nBoth warheads have 350 kilotons or more of explosive power - the equivalent of 350,000 tons of TNT. The Pentagon wants a bomb that can go through 30 feet to 60 feet of solid rock before detonating. The bomb could also be used for what the Pentagon calls \"agent defeat\" - frying deadly biological or germ weapons.\n\n----\nNASA HIRES PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRM TO HELP BLUNT OPPOSITION TO NUCLEAR ROCKET\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nFrom: \"Global Network\" <globalnet@mindspring.com>\n\nFearing another public relations defeat like they got during the 1997 Cassini campaign, NASA has hired a public relations outfit to gather information from potential critics of their latest space nuclear project. Project Prometheus, the nuclear rocket, is now being developed under the Bush Nuclear Systems Initiative that will spend $3 billion during the next five years to expand the launching of nuclear power into space.\n\nI actually began organizing the Cancel Cassini Campaign in 1994 by writing articles, speaking to groups around the world, and expanding the numbers of interested contacts. By the time the 1997 launch came around and the media began paying attention to the issue, there was a tremendous grassroots movement in place to oppose the plutonium launch. Even the TV program 60 Minutes covered the issue with a story just a week before the lift-off.\n\nThis time NASA wants to be prepared. While Project Prometheus is just now in the development stage, NASA has retained The Keystone Center, based in Colorado, to gather information about potential critics so they can effectively combat any expected opposition.\n\nThe Keystone Center called the Global Network office this fall and wanted to send one of their representatives to our office in Maine to \"interview\" me about our concerns. It was clear from the conversation that the real intention of the visit was to find out what strategies we intended to employ to block the launch of the nuclear rocket. I didn't want to have any part in helping NASA -- they have lots of money and easy access to the corporate dominated media. Neither was I about to help The Keystone Center, which is being paid quite well with taxpayer dollars, I'm sure. I told them I was not interested in being \"interviewed\" and left it at that.\n\nJust today in the mail, I received a letter from The Keystone Center once again asking me to submit to an interview. In the letter they say that they'd like to \"converse with you about NASA's Project Prometheus Nuclear Systems Program......We are undertaking a round of meetings and structured interviews with some 25 people, many of whom are long-standing skeptics or critics of NASA. Our sole focus is to understand what public involvement strategies, above and beyond the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), might be appropriate for NASA as they begin to develop Project Prometheus.\"\n\nSo basically The Keystone Center is being paid big bucks by NASA to find out what \"critics\" are saying and/or planning around Project Prometheus so they can then advise NASA on the best way to sell the project to the public and blunt the critics. And they have the audacity to ask me to help them!\n\nI know we should take this as a supreme compliment. NASA is worried about the work of the Global Network. They fear the public response to Bush's plan to dramatically expand the launching of nuclear power into space. And so they should! But to ask us to help them create a plan to circumvent our very opposition is the height of arrogance.\n\nWhat made it fun though was that a reporter from the New York Times also called today. The Times is doing a story on Project Prometheus and wanted to know if we were going to organize to oppose it. I told him that we were already organizing and he wanted to know why he had not seen anything in the media. I told him the reason was because the corporate media usually isn't very interested in what we have to say. He then said that he doubted that NASA was very worried about our opposition and I said, \"Hey let me read you this letter I just got from The Keystone Center.\" After hearing the content the reporter asked me to fax him the letter, which I gladly did.\n\nThe New York Times called because Bush is expected very soon to make a big announcement about going back to the moon and Mars. The nuclear rocket will be a key component of this plan. At a time when we are facing massive budget deficits Bush is going to promote his \"big idea\" to spend $50 - $150 billion on this moon base mission.\n\nIt just goes to show that our work is being watched by the government and the corporate media. They know what we are doing, and as much as they like to make us think they ignore us, they don't. They watch all of us like a hawk because they are worried to death that the public might catch onto what we have to say. If anything should tell us to keeping doing what we are doing, this is it.\n\nSo put this one into your mental file cabinet -- NASA's Project Prometheus, the nuclear rocket. Keep it close to your heart because it is going to be another hot issue down the road. How do I know that? Well, The Keystone Center told me so.\n\nThe Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) has presented a report to Congress which raises serious questions about the safe long- term storage of weapons plutonium at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Savannah River Site (SRS), located in South Carolina.\n\nThe report will likely have impacts on both the DOE's troubled plutonium disposition (MOX) program as well as further plutonium shipments to SRS, the site chosen for consolidation of DOE surplus plutonium. (See URL for report below.)\n\nThe DNFSB, an independent panel which oversees the environmental impact of DOE's nuclear weapons programs, was required under the Defense Authorization Act of FY 2003 to produce a report on the storage of plutonium in aging facilities at SRS. Given DOE's consolidation of plutonium storage at SRS, Congress determined it necessary to evaluate the implemented plutonium storage plan, one which had been drastically altered from earlier plans.\n\nThe DNFSB pointed out that DOE lacked \"careful, consistent planning\" in regards to plutonium storage at SRS and that DOE had foreclosed \"cost-effective and safety-conscious\" options by choosing to store plutonium in a closed 50-year old nuclear reactor at SRS. DOE has stood by plans to store plutonium in the old K-Reactor building (K-Area Material Storage facility, KAMS) for the long-term (up to 50 years) but the DNFSB stated in the report that storage KAMS could be done safely only for a period of \"roughly 4 to 5 years\" and beyond this amount of time only if safety improvements were undertaken.\n\nGreenpeace International has long-maintained that KAMS, not built to store nuclear materials, was improper for long-term plutonium storage and was chosen simply to cut costs, thus placing cost concerns far above safety considerations. DOE refused to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the use of KAMS for storage of plutonium in spite of known concerns.\n\nDOE has shipped all remaining weapons plutonium to SRS from the Rocky Flats site in Colorado and is now secretly developing plans to ship several tons of contaminated weapons plutonium from the Hanford site in Washington State to SRS. Given the DNFSB concerns, stated in the report, that \"DOE has no apparent plan for the disposition of approximately 5 metric tons of excess plutonium\" the issue of shipping yet more plutonium to SRS will spark controversy given that \"disposition\" of this material is unknown.\n\nIt is believed that DOE is once again looking at building an immobilization facility to mix plutonium in existing high-level waste, a program which was terminated in 2002. Greenpeace continues to support immobilization of all surplus plutonium on cost, environmental and non-proliferation grounds and thus believes that DOE should manage surplus plutonium as waste. The DNFSB report should bolster arguments to slow down the costly MOX program and reevaluate rapid implementation of the cheaper and quicker immobilization option.\n\nDue to probelms with the MOX program in the US and Russia, it is rumored that the MOX program has fallen another year behind schedule though DOE has not publicly admitted this yet.\n\no \"DOE has no apparent plan\" to dispose of 5 tons of dirty plutonium which can't be processed into plutonium fuel (MOX) o proposes installation of fire protection systems at KAMS for storage longer than 4-5 years o DOE should proceed with plutonium removal from the 235-F Building and upgrade as necessary for long- term storage\n\no \"DOE recognizes the importance of establishing a disposition path, and to that end formed a team in 2002 to determine a disposition path for material not planned for MOX fuel. Unfortunately, progress made on this task has been slow. So far, no technically feasible path forward has been approved. DOE needs to expedite this task to preclude unnecessary extended storage of plutonium at SRS.\"\n\nGiven the environmental and health impact to residents of South Carolina and Georgia in case of an accident in a plutonium storage or handling facility at SRS, Greenpeace believes that DOE must take immediate steps to upgrade plutonium storage conditions and halt further consideration of more plutonium shipments to the old facilities at SRS.\n\nFriday, Dec. 12, the PBS television program NOW with Bill Moyers will air a report on Bush administration secrecy produced in collaboration with U.S. News. Please visit pbs.org for stations and airtimes in your area. The U.S. News article, \"Keeping Secrets,\" will be publshed in Monday's edition. Full text will be available on USNews.com Saturday, Dec. 13, at 6 p.m.\n\nThe Bush administration has removed from the public domain millions of pages of information on health, safety, and environmental matters, lowering a shroud of secrecy over many critical operations of the federal government.\n\nThe administration's efforts to shield the actions of, and the information held by, the executive branch are far more extensive than has been previously documented. And they reach well beyond security issues.\n\nA five-month investigation by U.S. News details a series of initiatives by administration officials to effectively place large amounts of information out of the reach of ordinary citizens, including data on such issues as drinking-water quality and automotive tire safety. The magazine's inquiry is based on a detailed review of government reports and regulations, of federal agency Web sites, and of legislation pressed by the White House.\n\nU.S. News also analyzed information from public interest groups and others that monitor the administration's activities, and interviewed more than 100 people, including many familiar with the new secrecy initiatives. That information was supplemented by a review of materials provided in response to more than 200 Freedom of Information Act requests filed by the magazine seeking details of federal agencies' practices in providing public access to government information.\n\nAmong the findings of the investigation:\n\n~Important business and consumer information is increasingly being withheld from the public. The Bush administration is denying access to auto and tire safety information, for instance, that manufacturers are required to provide under a new \"early-warning system\" created following the Ford-Firestone tire scandal four years ago. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, meanwhile, is more frequently withholding information that would allow the public to scrutinize its product safety findings and product recall actions.\n\n~New administrative initiatives have effectively placed off limits critical health and safety information potentially affecting millions of Americans. The information includes data on quality and vulnerability of drinking-water supplies, potential chemical hazards in communities, and safety of airline travel and others forms of transportation.\n\n~Beyond the well-publicized cases involving terrorism suspects, the administration is aggressively pursuing secrecy claims in the federal courts in ways little understood--even by some in the legal system. The administration is increasingly invoking a \"state secrets\" privilege that allows government lawyers to request that civil and criminal cases be effectively closed by asserting that national security would be compromised if they proceed.\n\n~New administration policies have thwarted the ability of Congress to exercise its constitutional authority to monitor the executive branch and, in some cases, even to obtain basic information about its actions.\n\nThere are no precise statistics on how much government information is rendered secret. One measure, though, can be seen in a tally of how many times officials classify records. In the first two years of Bush's term, his administration classified records some 44.5 million times, or about the same number as in President Clinton's last four years, according to the Information Security Oversight Office, an arm of the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nNew York Times\nBy ELISABETH BUMILLER\n\n\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 11 - President Bush on Thursday defended his policy of barring France, Germany, Russia and other nations from $18.6 billion in American-financed Iraqi reconstruction projects. But despite the anger the policy has aroused in foreign capitals, he said his personal envoy, James A. Baker III, would still meet with the leaders of several of those nations to ask that they forgive debts they are owed by Iraq.\n\nThe president's argument was that only those nations that contributed militarily to the American effort in Iraq should reap the benefits of the $18.6 billion that Congress approved last month for reconstruction.\n\n\"The taxpayers understand why it makes sense for countries that risk lives to participate in the contracts in Iraq,\" Mr. Bush told reporters after a cabinet meeting at the White House. \"It's very simple. Our people risk their lives. Coalition, friendly coalition folks risk their lives, and, therefore, the contracting is going to reflect that.\"\n\nAdministration officials acknowledged that Mr. Bush's position had enraged the very nations the administration was now seeking help from, and that Mr. Baker, who was appointed as the president's envoy last Friday, faced a more chaotic situation than he had expected. But the officials sought to portray Mr. Baker as undeterred.\n\n\"Was it helpful?\" said a senior administration official who asked not to be identified for fear of being seen as criticizing the president. \"Well, clearly not. But he'll find a way to work with the world as it is.\"\n\nMr. Baker is to leave on Monday from his home in Houston for a five-day, five-nation trip. He is to see the administration's chief foreign opponents in the debate over the war with Iraq: President Jacques Chirac of France, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Baker will also meet with two allies who supported Mr. Bush on the war: Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy.\n\nMr. Baker will return to Houston on Friday and brief the president by phone. Administration officials said he had no plans to return to Washington before the end of the year.\n\nA former secretary of state and former secretary of the treasury, Mr. Baker will travel to the foreign capitals by government plane from Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington. He will take with him staff members from the State Department and the Treasury Department as well as Gary Edson, a deputy national security adviser at the White House who handles international economics.\n\nMr. Baker will not have a press secretary, reporters will not travel with him, and he is not expected to hold news conferences overseas. Administration officials said Mr. Baker, who in previous administrations was extraordinarily accessible to reporters, was adamant that he not be seen as grandstanding or as undercutting Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who is the administration's chief representative overseas.\n\nBut administration officials said Mr. Baker would be seen in foreign capitals as having more leverage with Mr. Bush than Mr. Powell, who is viewed as a combatant in the Bush administration's policy wars.\n\n\"Baker is Bush,\" said a senior administration official who asked not to be identified because he was criticizing Mr. Powell. \"Other countries know that Powell doesn't win all the battles. If you deal with Baker, you know you're going to get what you need.\"\n\nMr. Baker met with Mr. Bush in the Oval Office on Wednesday, when the president gave him general instructions, a senior administration official said, to \"go and get the international community to do something about Iraq's crushing debt.\" The official said that Mr. Bush was not more specific because \"Baker knows how to do this.\"\n\nMr. Baker's approach with the foreign leaders, the official said, would be to make the president's case on keeping the $18.6 billion in the hands of alliance members while holding out the promise that there will be more construction contracts for other nations down the road.\n\n\"This is our money, but there's lots of other money for which contracting is completely open,\" the official said. \"Even with the U.S.-led reconstruction, as circumstances change on the ground, we want to look at that.\"\n\nMr. Bush left similar room on Thursday for Canada, which opposed the war and as a result was barred under the policy from the $18.6 billion in Iraqi projects. Canadian officials were so outraged that Mr. Bush telephoned Prime Minister Jean Chrétien on Thursday morning to reassure him.\n\nExactly what was said is not clear. Soon after Mr. Chrétien told reporters at a news conference that Canada would now be eligible to compete for projects in Iraq. But White House officials said later in the day that Canada was still excluded - though they kept their public comments vague and implied they were open to negotiating an agreement.\n\n\"We'll be glad to talk with Canadian officials about this decision,\" Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, told reporters. \"We do very much appreciate the contributions that they have made, both in Afghanistan and to Iraq, and we'll be glad to discuss those issues with them.\"\n\nMr. Baker, who was secretary of state for Mr. Bush's father during the 1991 Persian Gulf war, is volunteering his time as the president's personal envoy. In the decade since leaving the White House, he has created the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston. He has also worked as an lawyer for Baker Botts, the Houston law firm his grandfather founded, and as a senior counselor at the Carlyle Group, an international investment bank.\n\nAdministration officials said Mr. Baker would retain his positions at Baker Botts and the Carlyle Group while serving as the president's personal envoy, and added that he had been vetted by the White House counsel's office for potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Carlyle Group, which has $17.5 billion in gross assets under management, invests money for 550 investors in 55 countries, and has investors in the Middle East. It has no investors or investments in Iraq.\n\nChris Ullman, a Carlyle spokesman, said Mr. Baker had not personally raised money from overseas investors, and therefore would not be in the position of negotiating with his business clients on behalf of the White House. But Mr. Ullman said Mr. Baker did speak at Carlyle events intended to attract investors.\n\n\"He never asks for money, and does not follow up or do any of that,\" Mr. Ullman said. \"He effectively is a draw at fund-raising-type events.\"\n\n-------- MILITARY\n\n-------- afghanistan\nU.S. Soldiers Kill 4 Men in a Raid to Arrest an Afghan Commander\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy CARLOTTA GALL\nThe New York Times\n\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 11 - American soldiers killed four men in the eastern town of Jalalabad on Thursday when they raided a house and arrested a powerful commander allied to the government, local officials said. At least two others were wounded.\n\nThe raid appeared to be part of the continuing military effort against Taliban suspects and other militants who might try to disrupt a grand council that will convene Saturday to debate a new constitution.\n\nThe fighting erupted when soldiers tried to arrest General Esmatullah, a commander allied to the Northern Alliance faction led by Defense Minister Marshal Muhammad Qasim Fahim, the Nangarhar provincial governor, Din Muhammad, said.\n\nGeneral Esmatullah had traveled from his base in the neighboring province of Laghman to Jalalabad for a meeting with regional military commanders. It was not clear why American soldiers had tried to arrest him because he is opposed to the Taliban and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who are seen as the greatest threat to security. But aid workers familiar with the region said there had been complaints recently from the population about General Esmatullah and his soldiers.\n\nThe arrest is in keeping with the aggressive actions of American forces in the last nine days. United States officials say they have specific intelligence that the Taliban and Al Qaeda are planning actions to disrupt the loya jirga, and prevent delegates reaching the capital, and so troops have sought to take the offensive to prevent any attacks.\n\n--------\nDeadly U.S. Raid Leaves Some Afghans Bewildered\nVillagers Say Target Was Not a Terrorist\n\nNARAI KALAI, Afghanistan, Dec. 11 -- The village, surrounded by bleak winter fields, was deserted Thursday. A dozen U.S. soldiers were busy inside a mud compound; next to it was another farmhouse with one mud wall smashed to rubble. On a frozen slope nearby, eight new graves, marked with jagged rocks, were already partly covered by snow.\n\nSometime between midnight and dawn on Dec. 5, U.S. warplanes and ground forces attacked this mud-walled hamlet in eastern Paktia province, searching for a arsenal of weapons, U.S. military officials said Wednesday. In the rain of rockets and gunfire, an earthen wall collapsed on a sleeping family, killing both parents and their six young children.\n\nAccording to U.S. officials, the raid -- one of two military attacks that have killed a total of 16 Afghan civilians in the last week -- was aimed at an Islamic extremist identified as Mullah Jalani, who owned the compound. The officials said U.S. troops later found thousands of weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition inside, along with the bodies of the victims.\n\nResidents described Akhtar Mahmad Jalani as a controversial local tribal and militia leader who had crossed swords with provincial officials and changed sides several times in the region's seesawing political struggles. Provincial sources said he had supported the Taliban at one time and was known as a bully who used threats of force in tribal disputes.\n\nBut most people interviewed insisted that Jalani was neither a terrorist nor a threat to the government, and some professed outrage and shock at the U.S. attack. They noted that, until recently, Jalani had served as district commissioner and was also a leader of the local tribal council.\n\nSeveral residents said Jalani had supported the U.S. military campaign and met often with U.S. and Afghan troops based in Gardez, the provincial capital 20 miles west of here.\n\n\"This was always the safest place for Americans, and there has never been a single incident in our district,\" said Hairan, 29, a truck driver. \"Everyone knew Jalani, and the day before this happened the new district chief came to have tea with him. We are amazed that they would bomb his house.\"\n\nNaser Gul, 25, a brother of the man who was killed with his family in the attack, said the victims were sleeping when the sound of planes overhead woke them about 3 a.m. Gul said he ran outside, but the rest of the family was buried and died. He said the family, originally from Logar province, was visiting as guests of the Tutakhel tribe, which controls the district.\n\nGul identified the dead as Ikhtar Gul, 35, a farmer; Khela, his wife; four daughters, Ahmad Khela, Daulat Zai, Anara and Kadran; and two sons, Asif and Nematullah. He said the children's ages ranged from 1 to 12.\n\nTheir deaths came to light just days after a U.S. air assault on a village in neighboring province of Ghazni killed nine children and one adult. That raid was also aimed at an alleged Islamic extremist, Mullah Wazir, who apparently had already left the area.\n\nBoth cases have drawn strong statements of concern and criticism from U.N. officials, who are overseeing Afghanistan's difficult transition to democracy. They warned that such incidents could alienate Afghan civilians from the international community.\n\nU.S. military officials have apologized for the deaths in Ghazni, calling the episode a \"tragic mistake\" and saying they had no indication that civilians were in the immediate area. They have promised to investigate the incident in an effort to make sure similar mistakes do not occur in the future.\n\nIn the Paktia incident, however, U.S. officials have continued to strongly defend their actions. Lt. Col. Bryan Hilferty, the U.S. military spokesman at Bagram air base, said Wednesday that the raid netted a significant arsenal. He also said that if civilians \"surround themselves\" with weaponry in a compound used by a terrorist, \"we are not completely responsible for the consequences.\"\n\nAt a briefing Thursday, Hilferty again defended the high-powered military raid and added more detail to support it, saying that when U.S. troops attacked, they were met with heavy gunfire from inside the farmhouse.\n\n\"Certainly, we followed the law of proportionality in this compound,\" Hilferty said. \"From the compound, they were shooting at us with machine guns. Jalani has more ammunition at his house than the coalition keeps at Bagram.\" Hilferty said the compound contained hundreds of 107mm rockets, mortar shells, rocket-propelled grenades, antitank and antipersonnel mines and howitzers.\n\nHilferty further identified Jalani as a suspected associate of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the former Afghan prime minister who is believed to have formed an alliance with revived Taliban forces against the current U.S.-backed government.\n\nSome residents and tribal leaders scoffed at such descriptions, saying Jalani had always strongly opposed the Taliban and had frequent dealings with U.S. military forces here.\n\nNo one in the area Thursday was able to say where Jalani is now.\n\nSeveral residents said they thought he might have been killed in the raid but that they had not been allowed to enter the compound except to retrieve and bury the dead.\n\nBetween nine and 14 village men were detained by U.S. forces, but officials said Jalani was not among them. Sources in the province said it had been variously reported that Jalani escaped from his compound disguised in a woman's veil or had been in Pakistan at the time of the attack.\n\n\"We don't know if Hajji Jalani is alive or dead, and we don't understand the reason for this disaster,\" said Mahmad Yusuf, a retired army colonel and tribal leader from the district. \"If he committed a crime, he should be brought to justice, but the Americans killed innocent people for nothing, and this is a very bad work.\"\n\nU.S. Special Forces troops in the village Thursday refused to speak to a reporter and said she should leave the area. But several sources in Paktia gave accounts of the attack that cast the U.S. actions in a favorable light.\n\n\"The Americans surrounded the compound Friday night and gave everyone a chance to come out. The women and children eventually left, and the bombing did not start until several hours later,\" said a knowledgeable source in Gardez.\n\nIn the past several months, Taliban fighters and other armed guerrillas have staged numerous violent attacks in Afghanistan's southeastern provinces bordering Pakistan. A French U.N. worker was shot to death in Ghazni province, three foreign highway workers -- a Turk and two Indians -- were kidnapped, and a bomb wounded 20 people in downtown Kandahar.\n\nThe attacks have already led to cutbacks in many foreign aid projects and have threatened to disrupt a national constitutional assembly due to begin Saturday in Kabul.\n\nReuters reported from Bagram air base:\n\nNearly a week into what was described as the biggest ground operation in Afghanistan since the Taliban was overthrown in late 2001, thousands of U.S. soldiers have so far failed to engage any Taliban or allied militants, the army said Thursday.\n\nHilferty said soldiers of the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment who helicoptered into Paktia on Monday as part of Operation Avalanche had yet to make contact with the enemy. But he said they had conducted patrols and cave searches over a 40-square-mile area as part of the offensive.\n\n\"The fact that we did not hit the jackpot here is not indicative that the air assault was not successful,\" he said.\n\n-------- arms\nRights Group Faults U.S. Over Cluster Bombs\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nNew York Times\nBy THOM SHANKER\n\n\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 11 - The American and British armies could have prevented hundreds of civilian injuries or deaths during the war in Iraq by eliminating the use of cluster munitions in populated areas, according to a study by a leading human rights group.\n\nThe organization, Human Rights Watch, also says in a new report that while the Air Force was able to minimize civilian casualties in its strikes against fixed targets chosen in advance, it was not as successful in missions to kill leadership figures whose whereabouts became known only fleetingly, prompting quick attacks.\n\nThe report, \"Off Target - The Conduct of the War and Civilian Casualties in Iraq,\" states that 50 attacks aimed at senior Iraqi leaders failed to kill any of their intended targets, but resulted in dozens of civilian deaths.\n\nHuman Rights Watch says those strikes relied on the interception of satellite telephone calls for locating targets. But the map coordinates snatched from those satellite telephones were not precise enough to avoid civilian casualties when the attacks were conducted in urban areas.\n\nThe report makes no estimate of the total number of civilians killed or injured in the war.\n\nBut it says \"the widespread use of cluster munitions, especially by U.S. and U.K. ground forces, caused at least hundreds of civilian casualties.\" Cluster bombs are weapons that spread a large number of smaller bomblets over a broad area to halt troops or vehicles massing for attack.\n\nThe study says American and British ground forces fired almost 13,000 cluster munitions, which spread nearly two million smaller bombs. The report says the Air Force limited its use of cluster bombs, and that the greatest numbers of these munitions used in the war were fired by the United States Army.\n\nKenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said in a telephone interview that the use of cluster bombs in Iraq also left many unexploded munitions, \"littering the landscape, waiting for people to trip over them.\"\n\nA spokesman for the military's Central Command, Lt. Cmdr. Nick Balice, said that \"while civilian casualties of war are a tragedy, coalition forces have taken extreme care in Operation Iraqi Freedom to limit needless loss of human life and collateral damage.\"\n\nCluster munitions were used \"against very specific and valid military targets and only when deemed a military necessity,\" he said.\n\nThe Human Rights Watch report also criticizes Iraqi forces, saying they violated international law and likely contributed to civilian casualties.\n\nThese violations, the report said, included the \"use of human shields, abuse of the red cross and red crescent emblems, use of antipersonnel landmines\" and the \"location of military objectives in protected places,\" like mosques and hospitals.\n\n\"Clearly, when you're putting your artillery pieces in school yards or whatever, that increases civilian casualties,\" Mr. Roth said of the Iraqi tactic.\n\nMADRID - The US government needs to explain why the missile shipment on a vessel intercepted a year ago on the high seas by the Spanish navy ended up in Libya, a spokesman from Spain's Defense Ministry said this week.\n\nThe official was referring to declarations made by sources from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to the Madrid daily El Mundo that claim 15 complete Scud missiles, a set of conventional warheads and 85 containers of chemical products - some 20 holding nitric acid - were ultimately delivered to Libya under a Washington decision.\n\nThe episode began on December 5, 2002, when US intelligence services informed Madrid about the route of a freighter named So San, which they suspected of trafficking weapons and which was, at the time, crossing a zone under Spain's authority in the Indian Ocean. Four days later, a Spanish frigate and warship intercepted the So San after ordering the captain to halt and firing warning shots. The vessel was found to be sailing under the Cambodian flag.\n\nThe weapons and chemicals came from North Korea and did not appear on the ship's manifest, which showed only that the merchant vessel was carrying bags of cement. After intercepting the freighter, Spain then handed the ship over to the US Navy. Immediate official explanations out of Washington and Madrid said the missiles might have been headed for the al-Qaeda network, which the US government holds responsible for the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. However, just hours later, the US administration took Spain by surprise by turning the So San over to Yemen, explaining that the cargo was actually a legal shipment of weapons purchased from North Korea by the Yemini government.\n\nThe handover was preceded by a telephone conversation between US Vice President Dick Cheney and Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. When that conversation was made public, the White House justified the move by calling Yemen a friendly nation. So what initially came off as a brilliant Spanish military operation to prevent illegal trade in weapons of mass destruction was reduced to a suspected manipulation directed from Washington, with Madrid in the role of receiving and carrying out orders that were not very clear in their purpose.\n\nThe NATO sources cited in El Mundo said that at the time the shipment was intercepted, the United States was secretly negotiating the possibility that Libya would accept Saddam Hussein, then still president of Iraq, in exile. And Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who played the role of go-between during the Gulf War in 1991 by assisting in Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, had hopes of gaining access to the weapons.\n\n\"Gaddafi wanted the missiles and Yemen acted as intermediary. In the context of gestures with Libya, it was decided to look the other way, given that there was no international regulation that impeded it,\" said the newspaper, citing sources from the Pentagon.\n\nToday, as it was a year ago, Madrid's reaction of disappointment regarding the United States' handling of the shipment was immediate, but not very explicit, because Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar continues to be a staunch, unconditional supporter of the policies of his US counterpart, President George W Bush.\n\nAs a result, the opposition United Left (IU) has announced that it will petition Defense Minister Federico Trillo to inform parliament about the country's participation, \"past and present\", in relation to the case of the weapons shipment. Madrid's handling of the issue \"is one more demonstration of [Aznar's] erratic foreign policy and his troubling submission and total dependence on the policy marked by the US,\" IU general coordinator Gaspar Llamazares said. \"The IU is highly concerned that Spain is extending political and commercial ties to a country that does not provide any democratic guarantees,\" such as Libya, he added.\n\nNeither the Spanish government nor the opposition and civil-society organizations categorize the Gaddafi regime as terrorist and they agree on the need to facilitate his integration into the international community. In fact, Spain has not drawn up a list of countries it considers terrorist, noted a Foreign Ministry spokesperson, but the United States has, and Libya, which figures on that list, is subject to a commercial and military embargo. No US company is authorized to sell weapons to Libya directly or indirectly, nor to facilitate the delivery of arms.\n\nWhen the United Nations Security Council lifted sanctions against Libya, then-US ambassador James Cunningham abstained from the vote, stating that Washington did not want to give the idea that it believed Libya had done an about-face, because, said the ambassador, the country continued to try to obtain weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. But things appear to have changed radically, given that the weapons shipment intercepted by Spain, and which ended up in Libya, includes such arms.\n\nOne year after President Bush sought to energize the nation's bioterrorism preparations with an unprecedented smallpox vaccination campaign, the program has all but ground to a halt. A report released yesterday, meanwhile, finds that only two states -- Florida and Illinois -- are prepared to distribute and administer vaccines or medicines that would be needed in the event of a major outbreak or attack.\n\nFewer than a dozen states have written plans for dealing with other public health threats such as pandemic flu, the report added, and most remain ill-prepared for any large-scale emergency.\n\nAfter two years of work and $2 billion in federal aid, \"states are only modestly better prepared to respond to public health emergencies than they were prior to Sept. 11, 2001,\" the Trust for America's Health, a nonpartisan, nonprofit health advocacy group, concluded.\n\nDespite Bush's high-profile call on Dec. 13, 2002, for the immunization of millions of health care workers and emergency responders, the number vaccinated has been stuck at 38,700 for months.\n\n\"We are still underprepared to respond to even two cases of smallpox anywhere in the world,\" Michael T. Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, said in a telephone interview. Just as health care workers and the public \"panicked\" in the spring over a few cases of monkeypox, Osterholm predicted that a report of smallpox would send thousands rushing to hospitals in search of vaccine and find few people there ready to deliver it.\n\n\"You need a core group of vaccinated workers able to go out to the front lines, and we don't have that,\" he said.\n\nOther experts voiced fears that not enough attention has been given to lethal chemical agents, hospital surge capacity and sophisticated staff training.\n\n\"Are we ready or not? The answer is not,\" said Trust executive director Shelley A. Hearne. \"Now is the time to get serious about developing an all-hazards approach to public health to ensure we are ready for the range of possible threats we face.\" White House spokesman Trent Duffy said Bush is pleased with the progress made on smallpox defenses but \"would like more front-line workers to be vaccinated.\"\n\nJoseph Henderson, associate director for terrorism preparedness and emergency response at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the report \"tells us things we've already known. We know we have a lot of work to do.\"\n\nBut, he added, the swift response to naturally occurring outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome last year and influenza now \"demonstrate we are definitely more prepared.\" CDC expects to have more precise measures for evaluating the nation's preparedness next fall, but there will always be a reluctance to publicize that information, he said.\n\nIf, for instance, the president asked for a state-by-state assessment, Henderson said he is prepared to give it. \"We don't tell the public because we're afraid it might reveal too many vulnerabilities.\"\n\nState budget cuts, personnel shortages and red tape were the chief reasons identified by the Trust for the spotty progress. Although the report found significant improvement in communications capability and general terrorism response planning, researchers at the Trust and other experts identified several areas that are lagging.\n\nGeorges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said public health departments are able to respond more quickly, are better trained and are better equipped. He remains concerned, however, about staffing shortages, labs that are unable to identify chemical agents and the shortage of state influenza plans.\n\n\"I'm not sure this flu will be a pandemic flu, but we're going through a widespread flu epidemic now, and it worries me that states were not up to speed with those plans,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to tracking flu plans, the report scored states in nine other areas, such as lab capacity, availability of information on the SARS virus and appropriate distribution of federal dollars. States received one point for each category in which they met basic thresholds, with a 10 the highest possible score. More than 70 percent of the states received scores of 5 or lower.\n\nLocally, the picture is mixed. Maryland was one of four states to receive a 7, the highest score given. Virginia received a 5, and the District, a 3.\n\n\"While states have achieved piecemeal progress, the full-scale effort to comprehensively fix the nation's public health system is falling short,\" the report noted.\n\nRandall Larsen, a retired military officer and chief executive of the consulting firm Homeland Security Associates, endorsed the overall conclusions but counseled patience. \"People need to understand that although this is frustrating, we're not much better prepared. An enormous change is required to prepare us for homeland security in the 21st century,\" he said.\n\nJerome M. Hauer, the former Bush administration bioterrorism preparedness chief who now runs a terrorism response center at George Washington University, said he is concerned that hospitals have not done enough to prepare to handle mass casualties and that states are having trouble hiring specialists such as epidemiologists and laboratory technicians.\n\nHe and Larsen criticized CDC Director Julie L. Gerberding for recently denying that the administration had pursued a nationwide smallpox immunization program, calling her comments \"a very clever political move to distance herself from a failing program.\"\n\nWhen Bush announced the program -- he was among the first people to be inoculated -- the administration said it intended to immunize nearly 500,000 public health and hospital workers by the end of February this year. The plan called for vaccinating millions of police officers and firefighters by spring, and by summer, Bush promised, any American who insisted would be able to receive the vaccine. That has not happened.\n\nGerberding's spokesman, Tom Skinner , said, \"She fully supports the plan the president outlined last December. We're much better prepared even with only 40,000 vaccinated, but obviously we still have more work to do.\"\n\n-------- business\nBush Thinks U.S. Overcharged in Halliburton Contract\n\nWASHINGTON - President Bush, seeking to deflect criticism from the controversy surrounding Halliburton contracts in Iraq, said on Friday he believed a subsidiary overcharged the U.S. government for fuel deliveries to Iraq by $61 million, and expected it to be repaid.\n\nBush told reporters the Pentagon was investigating the overcharge after an audit found Halliburton's Kellogg, Brown & Root unit overcharged the U.S. Army by $1.09 per gallon for nearly 57 million gallons of gasoline for Iraqi citizens.\n\n\"Their investigation will lay the facts out for everybody to see. And if there's an overcharge, like we think there is, we expect that money to be repaid,\" Bush said.\n\nCritics of the Bush administration say Halliburton, the Houston-based oil company where Vice President Dick Cheney was chief executive, has unduly benefited from its government connections. The fuel deliveries fall under a contract awarded, without competition, to Halliburton in March.\n\nDemocrats are using Halliburton as a symbol of what they view as big business profiting from the Bush administration while regular citizens are short-changed.\n\nHoward Dean, running for the Democratic presidential nomination, told reporters in Council Bluffs, Iowa, that there should be an independent investigation of Halliburton's alleged overcharging and ties to the Bush administration.\n\nSo far the company has generated about $2 billion in business from a March contract and more than $2 billion from a logistics contract for which it supplies services ranging from delivering mail to doing laundry for U.S. troops.\n\n\"I would like to see such an investigation,\" Dean said. He said there was \"an appearance of impropriety.\"\n\nConnecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, also a Democratic presidential candidate, called on the Defense Department over a month ago to seek reimbursement from Halliburton for amounts it has overcharged the U.S. government.\n\n\"At a time of soaring federal deficits, we can ill afford to line the pockets of well-connected corporations at the expense of the American taxpayer,\" he said on Friday.\n\nHalliburton defended its work and said it welcomed a full review. Chairman and Chief Executive Dave Lesar denied the company had overcharged the government, citing Army Corps of Engineers audits.\n\nBush said: \"I appreciate the Pentagon looking out after the taxpayers' money. They felt like there was an overcharge issue. They put the issue right out there on the table for everyone to see and they're doing good work. We're going to make sure that as we spend the money in Iraq that it's spent well, spent wisely.\"\n\n\"PRESIDENT FOR BIG OIL\"\n\nDemocrats charged the case showed Bush was coddling Halliburton at the same time Bush was excluding Iraq war opponents from U.S.-funded reconstruction contracts in Iraq.\n\nThe Bush administration has decided to bar Iraq war opponents like France, Germany and Russia from competing for $18.6 billion in U.S.-funded reconstruction projects in Iraq.\n\nRetired Gen. Wesley Clark's campaign attacked what it called \"the Bush administration's ties to Halliburton.\"\n\n\"George W. Bush is a president for Big Oil, of Big Oil, and 'buy' Big Oil. He is more concerned about the success of Halliburton than having a success strategy in Iraq,\" said Chris Lehane, a communications strategist for Clark.\n\nNew Jersey Democrat Frank Lautenberg wrote this week to Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the Republican chair of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, to repeat his request for hearings on Halliburton's Iraqi reconstruction contracts, especially the size of the no-bid contract.\n\nCollins has previously declined the request. Her aides said she was unavailable on Friday.\n\n\"This is the sweetheart deal of the century that is grossly wasting taxpayer dollars. It's time for the vice president and the rest of the Administration to come clean on the Halliburton backroom deals,\" Lautenberg said through a spokesman.\n\nThe Pentagon has begun an extensive inquiry into Halliburton's activities in Iraq after evidence emerged that the oil services company, which was formerly run by the US vice president, Dick Cheney, overcharged the US government by as much as $120m (£69m).\n\nHalliburton has not been accused of wrongdoing, but this is the first time Pentagon officials have believed that major contracts for the war in Iraq have been mishandled.\n\nIn one case, Pentagon auditors found evidence that KBR may have overcharged the Army Corp of Engineers for petrol by $61m.\n\nAuditors say that KBR did not profit, but had overpaid for supplies from Kuwaiti companies, pushing up the final price. The Pentagon says KBR failed to adequately evaluate the costs and operations of its Kuwait subcontractor.\n\nThe other case of overcharging involved the supply of mess halls, and the Pentagon said it had found evidence that KBR may have overestimated the cost of catering by $67m.\n\nInvestigators at the Defence Contract Audit Agency are now examining all aspects of financial controls and subcontracting arrangements by KBR in Iraq, with around 20 auditors having been assigned to the job.\n\nIn a statement, David Lesar, the chief executive of Halliburton, said: \"We welcome a thorough review of any and all of our government contracts.\"\n\nMr Lesar defended the company's performance, and said that the questions were \"a normal part of the audit process and not a condemnation of KBR processes\".\n\nHowever, Democrats - who have criticised the lack of competition for contracts in Iraq - were quick to lay into the Bush administration.\n\n\"We've recently learned what many Americans have suspected for a long time - special interest contributor Halliburton is overcharging the American taxpayers,\" Howard Dean, the Democratic presidential contender, told the Washington Post.\n\n\"Now this president is preventing entire nations from bidding on contracts in Iraq so that his campaign contributors can continue to overcharge the American taxpayers.\"\n\nMr Dean was referring to a White House decision earlier this week to block firms from countries opposed to the conflict in Iraq from bidding for contracts, worth $18.6bn, to rebuild the country.\n\nThe move caused predictable outrage in the countries affected, which include France, Germany and Russia. However, companies from Britain and Italy - which were coalition partners - are eligible for contracts.\n\nKofi Annan, the UN secretary general, has urged the administration to reverse the decision, which he called \"unfortunate\", and the EU has raised the possibility that the US move violates World Trade Organisation rules.\n\nThe discovery that Halliburton could have overcharged the US government is certain to add to the arguments raging over Iraq's reconstruction. Halliburton has been under intense scrutiny ever since it was awarded a no-bid contract to provide billions of dollars in services in Iraq.\n\nCritics of the Bush administration say that Halliburton has benefited from White House patronage, because the company is a big donor to Republican party coffers.\n\nIt gave $708,770 in political contributions between 1999 and 2002, with 95% of that going to Republicans. Administration officials counter that few companies have the resources and expertise to carry out the work needed.\n\nMr Cheney, a former defence secretary under the first Bush administration, stepped down as chief executive officer of Halliburton when he became Mr Bush's running mate in 2000.\n\nHe has said that he played no role in contracts for his former company, of which he became head in 1995.\n\nKBR was first criticised in the summer by Congress for charging high rates to bring petrol into Iraq from Kuwait, but there have been accusations of overcharging before.\n\nLast year, the firm paid $2m in fines to settle charges of inflating prices for repairs and maintenance at Fort Ord, California.\n\nIn 1997 and 2000, the General Accounting Office, the congressional watchdog, found that KBR had billed the army for questionable expenses on its support contracts for operations in the Balkans.\n\nThose reviews cited instances such as charging $85.90 per sheet of plywood actually costing $14.06, and billing the army for cleaning some offices up to four times per day.\n\n----\nU.S. Sees Evidence of Overcharging in Iraq Contract\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nNew York Times\nBy DOUGLAS JEHL\n\n\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 11 - A Pentagon investigation has found evidence that a subsidiary of the politically connected Halliburton Company overcharged the government by as much as $61 million for fuel delivered to Iraq under huge no-bid reconstruction contracts, senior military officials said Thursday.\n\nThe subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown & Root, also submitted a proposal for cafeteria services that seemed to be inflated by $67 million, the officials said. The Pentagon rejected that proposal, they said.\n\nThe problems involving Halliburton, where Vice President Dick Cheney was chief executive, were described in a preliminary report by auditors, the officials said. The Pentagon contracts were awarded without competitive bidding and have a potential value of $15.6 billion; recent estimates by the Army have put the current value of the Halliburton contracts at about $5 billion.\n\nHalliburton denied overcharging and called the inquiry a \"routine audit.\" Dave Lesar, the company's chairman, president and chief executive, said in an e-mail statement, \"We welcome a thorough review of any and all of our government contracts.\"\n\nHalliburton, which had more than $12.5 billion in revenues in 2002, has emerged as a symbol for many people who opposed the war in Iraq and who claimed that the interests of such companies with close political ties were given too much consideration by the administration.\n\nCriticism intensified when Halliburton received the no-bid contract to provide billions of dollars in services in Iraq. Administration officials counter that few companies have the resources and expertise to carry out the work needed.\n\nMilitary officials said the Pentagon was negotiating with K.B.R. over how to resolve the fuel charges. But Michael Thibault, deputy director of the Defense Contract Audit Agency, said in a telephone interview that a draft report by the agency had recommended that the Army Corps of Engineers seek reimbursement.\n\nThe officials said Halliburton did not appear to have profited from overcharging for fuel, but had instead paid a subcontractor too much for the gasoline in the first place.\n\nHalliburton has also said that one reason it needed to charge a high price for fuel was that it must be delivered in a combat zone. Several K.B.R. workers have been killed or wounded in attacks by Iraqis.\n\nOther questions, in a second contract with the Army, involved unacceptable delays by the subsidiary in providing cost estimates for dozens of projects already under way in Iraq, Mr. Thibault said. These violations, for work that includes the construction of food, housing and other facilities for the military, could involve inflated costs as well, he added.\n\nA spokeswoman for Halliburton, Wendy Hall, said in an e-mail message that the inquiry was part of a \"routine audit\" and that it was \"not the fact that K.B.R. has overcharged.\"\n\nMr. Lesar, the chief executive, said in his e-mail: \"We will work with all government agencies to establish that our contracts are not only good for the United States, but also the company is the best and most qualified contractor to perform these difficult and dangerous tasks.\"\n\nMr. Thibault said that it would be \"premature\" to describe the auditor's conclusions as final, that the investigation was continuing and that the Halliburton subsidiary \"deserves a chance to respond to our findings.\" He said auditors expected to issue a final report this month, but added that the preliminary findings involved overcharging that was \"potentially very substantial.\"\n\nThe two Halliburton contracts are by far the largest awarded by the Pentagon in Iraq. Some Democrats have criticized the awarding of contracts to the Halliburton subsidiary, saying they might appear to be a political payoff to a company well connected with Republicans.\n\nBut administration and Halliburton officials have denied that politics played any role in the awards to K.B.R., whose work in Iraq involves a contract with the Army Corps of Engineers for repairing and restoring Iraq's oil industry. The initial value of the work was set at $7 billion. A second contract with the Army for logistical support has a maximum value of $8.6 billion, military officials said.\n\nMr. Thibault would not be specific about the basis on which the auditors have found evidence that the Halliburton subsidiary has overcharged for the fuel it is providing in Iraq under the oil contract.\n\nBut government documents show that the United States government is paying Halliburton an average of $2.64 a gallon to import gasoline to Iraq from Kuwait, more than twice what others are paying.\n\nRepresentative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who has been a leading Congressional critic of the contract, said the preliminary audit \"confirms what we've known for months: Halliburton has been gouging taxpayers and the White House has been letting them get away with it.\"\n\n\"It is deplorable and we need to put an immediate end to it,\" Mr. Waxman said in a written statement. \"There needs to be a top-to-bottom review of all the Iraqi contracts.\"\n\nDefense Department and other government officials said a draft report of the audit agency's finding was sent to K.B.R. on Dec. 5 and included \"harsh assessments\" of the company's handling of its contract to import fuel from Kuwait.\n\nMr. Thibault said that Halliburton had promised a response by Dec. 17, and that the agency would issue a final report within a week after that. Once that report is complete, it will be turned over to the clients, including the Army Corps of Engineers, which contracted with K.B.R. in March for tens of millions of gallons of gasoline, benzene and other fuel.\n\nThe audit agency has also discussed with K.B.R. the delays in the pricing of elements of the logistics contract, military officials said. Among projects under way, the company has provided the government with cost estimates for just 12 orders, with 69 outstanding and overdue, the officials said. They said the delays raised the possibility that the company would eventually claim an unacceptably high cost for a project whose work was already largely completed.\n\nThe company's work for the military in Iraq has evolved from putting out oil field fires to overseeing rebuilding of Iraq's oil infrastructure and providing fuel. K.B.R. also provides support to American troops, including serving meals.\n\nMr. Cheney, the former chief executive, left Halliburton in 2000, after President Bush asked him to become his running mate.\n\nThe Army awarded the logistics contract to Halliburton in 2001, on a competitive basis, but its size has swelled since the Iraq war, with additional work awarded to Halliburton without competition. The second contract, for oil reconstruction projects, was formally awarded in March on a \"sole source\" basis, but the decision to give the project to Halliburton was made in late 2002 by senior administration officials who were part of a secret task force planning for postwar Iraq.\n\nDon van Natta Jr. contributed reporting from London for this article.\n\n--------\nBush Says Halliburton Will Have to Repay Any Overcharges\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy DAVID STOUT\nThe New York Times\n\n\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 12 - President Bush said today that the Halliburton Company would have to pay back any money it might have have overcharged the government for work it is doing in Iraq.\n\n``If there's an overcharge, like we think there is, we expect that money to be repaid,'' Mr. Bush said this afternoon as he and his chief spokesman sought to distance the White House from a continuing controversy over Iraq-related work being done by Halliburton, which was once headed by Vice President Dick Cheney.\n\nAlluding to a Pentagon audit that has found that Halliburton may indeed have overcharged the government by some $61 million for fuel deliveries, the president said: ``I appreciate the Pentagon looking after the taxpayers' money. They felt like there was an overcharge issue.''\n\nIt was not entirely clear today just how much in supposed overcharges may already have been paid by the government to Halliburton, a huge oil-field services company. But it was clear that questions about the politically well-connected company may continue to nettle the White House.\n\nAsked whether Halliburton might be ``an albatross around this administration's neck, '' the president replied: ``I expect anybody doing business with the United States government to be transparent, and to give the taxpayers a good return on their money. That's what I expect. And if anybody is overcharging the government, we expect them to repay that money.''\n\nThe preliminary Pentagon audit has found that a Halliburton subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown & Root, may have overcharged the government for fuel deliveries under lucrative no-bid construction contracts. But Pentagon officials have said the company did not appear to have profited from overcharges but rather may have initially paid a subcontractor too much. Halliburton has vigorously denied any overcharges, declaring in a statement that it welcomes ``a thorough review of any and all of our government contracts,'' and asserting that the Pentagon inquiry is routine in any event. The company has said, too, that fuel deliveries in a combat zone are inherently costly.\n\nEarlier today, the president's chief spokesman, Scott McClellan, tried to characterize Halliburton and its contracts as the bailiwick of the Pentagon, not the White House.\n\n``We expect the Pentagon to look at this and get to the bottom of it,'' Mr. McClellan said.\n\nDefense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld also encountered the Halliburton issue, in a generally friendly question-answer session at a meeting today of the National Conference of State Legislatures in the capital.\n\nA Minnesota lawmaker said she was concerned about apparent overcharging by Halliburton and urged Mr. Rumsfeld to look into it personally. Mr. Rumsfeld replied that he was not ``intimately knowledgeable'' about the affair.\n\n``We've got auditors that crawl all over these things,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said. He emphasized that while there had been disagreements over charges, there had not yet been any actual overpayments.\n\nMr. McClellan, when asked whether the White House was planning any changes to guard against similar problems, indicated that no new measures were contemplated.\n\n``This was a matter, a contracting matter, that was decided at the Pentagon,'' Mr. McClellan said at a news briefing. ``There are some oversight measures that are in place to make sure that tax dollars are protected, to make sure that tax dollars are being spent appropriately.\n\n``And from our standpoint, we expect those measures and procedures that are in place for oversight purposes to be followed,'' Mr. McClellan went on. ``And we expect the Pentagon to look at this and get to the bottom of it.''\n\nFurther questions on the Houston-based Halliburton, where Vice President Cheney was chief executive until he joined the 2000 Bush ticket, should be directed to the Pentagon, Mr. McClellan said.\n\nDemocrats have had a field day with the Halliburton affair, asserting that the company is ``gouging taxpayers,'' as Representative Henry A. Waxman of California put it.\n\nMr. McClellan was asked today whether, in retrospect, it would have been better if Halliburton had never gotten any contracts. ``It's a Pentagon decision,'' he replied. ``It's a Pentagon matter.''\n\nDefense Department auditors have discovered that a Halliburton Inc. subsidiary may have overcharged the government $61 million on a contract to supply fuel for Iraq, a Pentagon official said at a hurriedly called news conference last night.\n\nIn another contract to operate U.S. military mess halls, Halliburton, which was headed by Dick Cheney before he became vice president, would have been overpaid $67 million if auditors hadn't questioned the arrangement, officials said, citing findings of a draft audit.\n\nWhile Halliburton isn't being accused of wrongdoing, and the government isn't yet seeking reimbursement, this is the first instance the Pentagon has said it believes that major contracts for the war in Iraq and its reconstruction have been mishandled.\n\n\"We have found some issues of concern that are worthy of immediate attention and we're making sure that that kind of aggressive action is taken so that we resolve these issues as expediently as possible,\" said William H. Reed, director of the Defense Contract Audit Agency.\n\nOn the gas contract, Halliburton subsidiary KBR has been charging the U.S. government $2.27 a gallon to deliver gasoline from Kuwait, while a similar contract for gas from Turkey sets the price at only $1.18, the official said.\n\nHalliburton didn't profit from that differential, officials said. \"This isn't money that went to the company,\" said Larry DiRita, the Pentagon's top spokesman. Rather, he said, the money the Pentagon believes was overcharged went to a private Kuwaiti company that is a subcontractor on the contract. He declined to identify that company. He also noted that during last spring's war, the Kuwaiti government provided fuel to the United States and its allies at no charge.\n\nHalliburton's problem with the contract, a Pentagon official said, was that it failed to adequately evaluate the costs and operations of its Kuwaiti subcontractor. On the contract to operate mess halls, the official said that Halliburton told the Pentagon its subcontractor price would be $220 million. But auditors examining Halliburton's operations found that at that time, the company already had awarded a subcontract under which the cost was actually $67 million lower than that.\n\n\"You'd have to be pretty stupid\" to do this on purpose, the official said, implying that it was an easy discrepancy to catch. He said he believes this was \"a clear, obvious, miscommunication error\" that resulted from a \"disconnect\" between the company's operations in the Mideast and its contracting office at its Houston headquarters.\n\nHalliburton chief executive David J. Lesar said in a statement, \"We welcome a thorough review of any and all of our government contracts.\" He defended the company's performance and said the questions were \"a normal part of the audit process and not a condemnation of KBR processes.\"\n\nOn the fuel pricing, he said only one supplier from Kuwait met the government's specifications and said the company has repeatedly tried to transfer the delivery work to another contractor. On the food contract, he said that the auditors were talking about \"a proposal, not an invoice.\"\n\nDemocrats have criticized the lack of competition and the prices being charged in the Halliburton contracts and were quick to jump on the Pentagon announcement about Cheney's former company.\n\n\"We've recently learned what many Americans have suspected for a long time -- special-interest contributor Halliburton is overcharging the American taxpayers,\" said former Vermont governor Howard Dean, a leading Democratic presidential contender. \"Now this president is preventing entire nations from bidding on contracts in Iraq so that his campaign contributors can continue to overcharge the American taxpayers.\"\n\nRep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.), who has taken the lead in questioning the Halliburton contracts, said in a statement that the draft report \"confirms what we've known for months. Halliburton has been gouging taxpayers and the White House has been letting them get away with it.\"\n\nCheney was defense secretary from 1989 until 1993, and then was chief executive at Halliburton from 1995 until 2000, when he resigned to join George W. Bush on the 2000 Republican ticket.\n\nBob Faletti, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers, which administers the fuel contract, said, \"We have a copy of the draft audit. We are going to let the process work. KBR has an opportunity to provide additional information and refute the charges. We will not be taking any action prior to the process being completed.\"\n\nThe two contracts in question are among the biggest the U.S. government has let for operations in postwar Iraq. They are open-ended arrangements under which about $5 billion has been spent so far, one of the Pentagon officials said.\n\n-------- china\nTaiwan's President Giving Bush Headaches\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\nTAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The latest guy giving President Bush headaches isn't an AK-47 toting leader of a shadowy terrorist group. And he's not a Stalinist recluse with nuclear ambitions.\n\nHe's Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian -- a 52-year-old workaholic attorney who wears plain blue suits and big wire-framed glasses, and who runs one of Asia's most vibrant democracies and richest economies.\n\nChen landed in Bush's inbox of problems by calling for Taiwan's first island-wide referendum. He says the March 20 vote will be on whether China should withdraw hundreds of missiles pointing at this tiny island.\n\nThe Taiwanese leader is under tremendous pressure to cancel the referendum, which Washington fears could lead to an independence vote that could spark a war with China. The two split amid civil war in 1949, and Beijing is demanding that the island agree to unify.\n\nOnce an enthusiastic supporter of Chen, Bush leaned on the Taiwanese leader this week, warning that America opposes unilateral moves to change the status quo. It was Chen's biggest slap from Washington since he took office four years go.\n\nSome members of Chen's Democratic Progressive Party said it's too early to say if Chen would scuttle the referendum to preserve friendly relations with America, Taiwan's most likely defender if China ever attacks. Much depends on whether Washington keeps the heat on Chen.\n\nLuo Wen-jia, a lawmaker close to Chen, doubted the president would back down on the referendum.\n\n``He has already compromised by proposing this anti-missile vote'' and not calling an election that directly involves the touchy sovereignty issue, he said. ``The president may twist and turn, but he won't easily give up.''\n\nChen is also locked in what could be the biggest election battle of his life. He's being challenged by two parties that have combined forces to defeat him in the March election. Dropping the referendum would be extremely embarrassing, his supporters say.\n\nChen has a long history as a scrappy fighter. He grew up in poverty in southern Taiwan; his father was a factory worker and his mother was a day laborer. He has said the family milk supply came from U.S. aid packages.\n\nChen excelled at school and majored in law at Taiwan's top school, passing the bar exam before graduating and settling into a career as a maritime lawyer.\n\nHe showed no strong interest in politics until the late 1970s, when he began defending dissidents arrested during the martial law era. He later became a Taipei city councilman and a member of parliament, where he often stormed around the legislature tossing papers as his party pushed for greater democracy.\n\nChen's political career brought pain to his family. His wife, Wu Shu-chen, was paralyzed from the waist down when a truck ran over her three times in 1985. The couple believes it was a politically motivated murder attempt.\n\nChen's upset election victory four years ago snapped the Nationalist Party's five-decade grip on the presidency. The win was an amazing success story for the Democratic Progressive Party, which the Nationalists had banned during martial law.\n\nThe party was founded by human rights, democracy and independence activists. But Chen remains flexible on independence, said Shen Fu-hsiung, a Progressive Party lawmaker.\n\n``Most of us think he's just trying to use this issue to his benefit,'' Shen said. ``Those in the heart of the independence movement have doubts about him.''\n\nShen acknowledged that from the broader perspective used by China and sometimes America, Chen's views and his referendum plans seem pro-independence.\n\nBeijing is also suspicious of Chen because he won't call himself ``Chinese.'' He has yet to embrace China's goal of eventual unification, and continues to insist that Taiwanese voters should have a choice.\n\nChen's program to remake Taiwan also includes holding other referendums and rewriting the constitution. Many analysts agree things need to be done, but some question whether Chen is the person to do them.\n\nDenny Roy of the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Hawaii noted that President Richard Nixon was a good man to restart U.S.-China relations because of his anti-communist background.\n\nBut Roy said he doubts Chen is the right person for the delicate tasks he wants to undertake. And Roy says the timing may not be the best.\n\nBEIJING, Dec. 11 -- China issued a rare thank you to the United States on Thursday when it applauded President Bush's strongest statement yet opposing any moves by Taiwan toward independence.\n\nThe statement from the Foreign Ministry, calling Taiwan \"the most important and sensitive\" issue in U.S.-Chinese relations, underscored a continuing improvement in dealings between China and the United States and followed this week's visit by Premier Wen Jiabao to the United States. A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Liu Jianchao, pronounced the visit a \"complete success\" and said, \"We appreciate President Bush's statement.\"\n\nStanding next to Wen on Tuesday, Bush said the United States opposed \"any unilateral decision by either China or Taiwan to change the status quo.\" Bush added: \"And the comments and actions made by the leader of Taiwan indicate that he may be willing to make decisions unilaterally to change the status quo, which we oppose.\"\n\nBush was responding to recent moves by Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, to call a \"defensive\" referendum asking voters whether they want China to withdraw the hundreds of missiles it has deployed within striking distance of Taiwan.\n\nWestern analysts have said Chen's move was based on a desire to heighten tensions between Taiwan and China in the run-up to Taiwan's presidential election on March 20. In 2000, Chen benefited from increased tensions with China and became the first opposition candidate to win Taiwan's presidency.\n\nChina has accused Chen of using the referendum as a ploy to push Taiwan one step closer to declaring formal independence. China has threatened to attack the island, which it considers to be part of its territory, if such a proclamation is made.\n\nIn Taiwan, citizens shrugged off the Chinese warning as bluster, and Chen's supporters dismissed any suggestion the referendum could provoke an attack. Chen argued that the United States would eventually support the referendum, a view shared by many on the island.\n\n\"I believe America is a democratic country. It will absolutely support and encourage the public opinion of Taiwan's 23 million people and their pursuit of deeper democracy and peace,\" he said in an interview with CNN, according to a presidential office statement.\n\nEarlier in the day, Chen said the referendum was in line with U.S. democratic values, which should allow voters to express opinions about a threat.\n\nTrong R. Chai, a pro-independence legislator and influential party official who has urged Chen to take a stronger stand against China, said the United States could do little to punish Taiwan if the island ignored Bush's warning and held the referendum.\n\n\"The U.S. won't tell China, 'You can take over Taiwan,' \" he said. And the Bush administration is unlikely to cancel arms sales to the island or impose economic sanctions, he said.\n\nPressing forward with his reelection campaign, Chen announced that Vice President Annette Lu would again be his running mate. Lu is fiery orator who openly advocates Taiwan's independence, and Chinese state media have labeled her a traitor and \"scum of the nation.\"\n\nCorrespondent Philip P. Pan in Taipei contributed to this report.\n\n-------- colombia\nColombian Terrorism Bill Expands Military Powers\n\nWORLD IN BRIEF\nFriday, December 12, 2003\nWashington Post\n\n\nBOGOTA, Colombia -- Senators approved a divisive anti-terrorism bill that gives the military sweeping powers to search homes, detain suspects without warrants and tap phones. The legislation, criticized by human rights groups, is part of President Alvaro Uribe's strategy to defeat a 39-year insurgency and restore authority in the country's lawless provinces.\n\n\"The country's citizens can feel more serene,\" Interior and Justice Minister Sabas Pretelt told Congress. \"They should know that the terrorists harming them will now face all the force of the state.\"\n\nThe decision came after Colombian troops launched a massive operation against outlawed right-wing paramilitary fighters, killing 24 and capturing 39. It was one of the largest campaigns against the militias since they opened disarmament talks with the government in July, the army said.\n\nColombia's main paramilitary umbrella group, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or AUC, has declared a unilateral cease-fire, but some members of the group have allegedly continued attacking villages and killing civilians.\n\n-------- europe\nGermans fed up with war legacy\n\nReuters in Berlin\nFriday December 12, 2003\nThe Guardian\n\n\nAlmost 70% of Germans say they are annoyed at being held responsible for the Holocaust and many believe Jews use Germany's Nazi past to their advantage, a survey showed yesterday.\n\nThe survey by Bielefeld University showed 69.9% were irritated at still being held responsible today for crimes against Jews.\n\nA quarter of 3,000 people surveyed also agreed with the statement: \"Many Jews try to use Germany's Third Reich past to their advantage and want to make Germans pay for it.\" A further 30% said there was \"some truth\" to the statement.\n\nAlmost two-thirds said they believed too many foreigners live in Germany, while 30% said foreigners should be sent home when jobs are scarce.\n\nEndorsing the survey, the German parliamentary president, Wolfgang Thierse, said he understood why so many people wanted to shed guilt for what happened before they were born. He said the survey did not prove there was widespread anti-Jewish sentiment.\n\nThe authors of the survey said they found that Germans who were worried about security threats and losing their jobs had become more hostile to Jews, Muslims, and immigrants.\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy SUSAN SACHS\nThe New York Times\n\n\nBAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 11 - The American administrator of Iraq said Thursday that the country's transition to independence could be marred by increased violence, but he expressed confidence that Iraqis could build a democracy that values religious and political freedom.\n\nL. Paul Bremer III, the former diplomat and counterterrorism official who has governed Iraq since May, expressed high hopes for Iraq's political future after 35 years of dictatorship and one-party rule, saying he believes Iraqis want and understand democracy.\n\n\"It is ambitious and it is possible,\" he said in an interview in one of Saddam Hussein's vast palace compounds, where the Coalition Provisional Authority has its headquarters in a building dating from the Iraqi monarchy in the first half of the last century.\n\n\"We're not going to have a Jeffersonian democracy here,\" he added. \"The process will be bumpy. We'll have bad days and good days.\"\n\nMr. Bremer, appearing relaxed and in good humor, spoke in broad terms about the next phase of the American occupation, a period that he predicted could bring a spike in violent attacks as well as an American-nurtured public debate over the shape of the new Iraq.\n\nUnder an agreement with the Bush administration last month, Iraq's political leaders are supposed to create a new legislative assembly by next spring and elect a provisional government by July 1. An elected body to write a constitution would then follow, with national elections possibly by 2006.\n\nBefore that, however, Iraq's transitional leadership must also tackle one of the more complicated questions about its future relationship with the United States, the country that many Iraqis applaud for ending Mr. Hussein's rule but also criticize for its handling of the seven-month-old occupation.\n\nBy March 15, the two sides are supposed to draw up a status of forces agreement on the future relationship between an independent Iraq and the American military.\n\nSeveral members of the Iraqi Governing Council, appointed by Mr. Bremer in July to nominate ministers and take a limited role in law-making, have said they would like to see the American troops stay in their base or bases unless called upon for help.\n\nWhile it is too early to say how long American forces might stay and under what conditions, Mr. Bremer said he believed Iraqis would ask for an agreement based on security conditions in the country.\n\n\"It's a question that really ought to be asked in six months, when we get through this very important crucial period and let's we see where we are,\" he said. \"My own guess is we're going to have an increase in violence over the next six months.\"\n\nAlthough the number of daily attacks on American troops surged as high as 50 in November before the military started cracking down harder, most parts of Iraq remained relatively calm, as was Baghdad until a series of unexplained explosions on Thursday night. Mr. Bremer and American military commanders, however, said they feared that terrorists, loyalists of the old government and Islamic militants could increase attacks on Americans and Iraqi officials in the period leading up to independence.\n\n\"The violence will be precisely because of the fact that we're building momentum toward success,\" Mr. Bremer said.\n\nIn the last 45 days, American commanders have already noticed what they call a regional command and control capability on the part of attackers who have executed nearly simultaneous bombings in the capital and other cities.\n\nAn attack on an American military convoy in Samarra last week added yet another element, with military officials reporting large numbers of men mounting a daytime assault. \"This was really an unusual attack,\" Mr. Bremer said. \"It's really the first time anybody larger than a squad even has stood and fought.\"\n\nAn rise in attacks in the coming months would necessarily bring a sharper military response, he added, and should be accompanied by a comparable increase in American investment in improving the daily lives of Iraqi civilians. Mr. Bremer said he planned to pour millions of dollars into local reconstruction projects over the next six months.\n\n\"As we respond to attacks - and we do have to respond to attacks to show that we mean to carry out our security obligations here - we have to be careful that we don't overdo that,\" he said. \"We balance that by putting an enormous amount of money into reconstruction efforts.\"\n\nSince the fall of Mr. Hussein's government in April, military commanders have said they spent more than $100 million on projects in the provinces under their control. The source of the money was the seized assets of the old government.\n\nMr. Bremer said he wanted to spend more than double that.\n\nAlready this month, American forces have adopted aggressive new tactics to flush out their attackers, dropping 500-ton bombs on urban sites believed to harbor guerrillas, setting up barbed wire cordons around villages and arresting relatives of wanted men.\n\nCommanders have acknowledged that their tactics could further alienate Iraqis.\n\nMr. Bremer said the coalition had become better organized to gather and analyze intelligence about its attackers, in part because because of greater Iraqi involvement. It is still too soon \"to say we've broken the code,\" he added.\n\nThe interplay between the military and civilian sides of the occupation has been a source of muted tension since the beginning, with Mr. Bremer inclined to make life in Iraq as normal as possible and Army commanders inclined to close roads, patrol city neighborhoods and set up checkpoints to ensure security.\n\nMr. Bremer said he had worked to reduce tensions by assembling the military and civilian commands under the same roof.\n\nThe relationship, however, will be tested in the coming months.\n\nThe new timetable for turning political control and sovereignty back to Iraqis will require some process to select a new Iraqi provisional legislature, possibly by people now serving as municipal and provincial council members.\n\nIn most provinces, American Army officers picked the local legislators months ago, but many have since fallen into public disfavor. Mindful of their importance in the upcoming political battle for control of the new provisional government, the Iraqi Governing Council has already started to replace some local officials, most recently the provincial governor of Babylon.\n\nMr. Bremer, who had appointed the governor, said he, too, wanted to recast the local governments and reduce their dependence on the American military.\n\n\"What we will try to do is beef up the civilian capability in the provinces by refreshing the provincial councils, making sure the provincial councils are more representative,\" he said. \"It's one of the issues we're working on right now with the Governing Council, so that there is a local Iraq political institution that is more or less representative\" to aid the transition from occupation to independence.\n\nOver the coming months, Mr. Bremer and his staff of 3,000 also have plans to engage Iraqis in a national debate over the shape of their nation.\n\n\"We want televised debates, town hall meetings, focus group meetings, meetings all across the country for people to sit down and talk about what kind of Iraq they want, what democracy means, what does separation of powers mean,\" Mr. Bremer said.\n\n\"It's never happened here and it needs to happen rather quickly.\"\n\n--------\nDISPATCHES: THE MILITARY\nMarines Plan to Use Velvet Glove More Than Iron Fist in Iraq\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy MICHAEL R. GORDON\nThe New York Times\n\n\nCAMP PENDLETON, Calif., Dec. 10 - No force has a tougher reputation than the United States Marines. But the marines who are headed to Iraq this spring say they intend to avoid the get-tough tactics that have been used in recent weeks by Army units.\n\nMarine commanders say they do not plan to surround villages with barbed wire, demolish buildings used by insurgents or detain relatives of suspected guerrillas. The Marines do not plan to fire artillery at suspected guerrilla mortar positions, an Army tactic that risks harming civilians. Nor do the Marines want to risk civilian casualties by calling in bombing strikes on the insurgents, as has happened most recently in Afghanistan.\n\n\"I do not envision using that tactic,\" said Lt. Gen. James T. Conway, the commanding general of the First Marine Expeditionary Force, who led the Marine force that fought its way to Baghdad and will command the more than 20,000 marines who will return to Iraq in March. \"It would have to be a rare incident that transcends anything that we have seen in the country to make that happen.\"\n\nThe increase in guerrilla attacks on American troops in Iraq has prompted Army units in the so-called Sunni triangle in central Iraq to adopt a hard-nosed approach - and spawned a behind-the-scenes debate within the American military about the best way to quash the insurgents.\n\nWhile some Army commanders insist the hard-nosed tactics have been successful in reducing enemy attacks, other military officers believe they are alienating Iraqis and thus depriving American commanders of the public support and human intelligence needed to ferret out threats.\n\nIn an interview at his headquarters at Camp Pendleton, General Conway was careful not to criticize the Army. Still, he indicated that he plans to pursue a very different strategy.\n\n\"I don't want to condemn what people are doing,\" General Conway said. \"I think they are doing what they think they have to do. I'll simply say that I think until we can win the population over and they can give us those indigenous intelligence reports that we're prolonging the process.\"\n\nThe Marines, General Conway says, will try to design their raids to be \"laser precise,\" focused on the enemy with a maximum effort made to avoid endangering or humiliating Iraqi civilians.\n\nAfter American forces invaded Iraq last spring, United States marines fought some of the fiercest battles of the war at Nasiriya and at a mosque in eastern Baghdad. After Saddam Hussein was ousted, the Marines assumed the responsibility for stabilizing south-central Iraq, where most of the inhabitants are Shiite Muslims who were persecuted under Mr. Hussein and were glad to see him gone. In contrast to the Army's experience, no marine was killed in action after mid-April.\n\nThe Marines insist their success also reflected their energetic efforts to work with the local population, an effort guided by their \"Small Wars\" manual, which derives from their 20th-century interventions in Central America.\n\nThere were several parallels between the Marine experience in southern Iraq and how the Army's 101st Airborne Division has approached northern Iraq - and many differences from the aggressive tactics of the Army's Fourth Infantry Division and other Army units in the Sunni triangle.\n\nOn their return to Iraq now, the Marines will be dealing with a much more challenging area which includes restive towns like Falluja, west of Baghdad.\n\nIn that region, American military units have come and gone so often that they have had little time to understand their surroundings. Falluja was initially occupied by the 82nd Airborne Division, which was soon replaced by the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment, which was in turn replaced by the Second Brigade of the Army's Third Infantry Division. In early summer, the Third Infantry Division had some success in helping to establish the local police. But it returned to the United States, handing the town back to the Third Armored Cavalry, which was soon replaced by the 82nd Airborne.\n\nIn Iraqi society, which emphasizes personal relationships, the constant rotations have made a difficult job that much harder. So have some tactics: in April, soldiers from the 82nd Airborne based themselves in Falluja and were fired on during an anti-American demonstration. The troops fired back. Iraqis say 17 people were killed and more than 70 wounded, many of them civilians who never fired on the American troops. The 82nd Airborne has disputed that account.\n\nStarting next March, nine battalions of marines will be deployed. In addition to infantry, the Marine force will include light armored reconnaissance units, engineers and attack helicopters. The Marines will also take command of a brigade from the Army's First Infantry Division, which is also going to Iraq in the spring.\n\nSuccess, Marine commanders say, will ultimately depend winning the trust of a wary Iraqi population. The measure of progress, General Conway says, will not be the number of American raids or enemy dead. It will be tips about potential threats that are provided to the Marines by ordinary Iraqis.\n\n\"The program we used in the south was a maturing Iraqi police, supported by an Army M.P. company in each of the cities, supported by a Marine quick reaction force,\" he said, defining this as a Marine infantry battalion. \"That worked very well for us. That is the model we intend to use.\"\n\nToward this end, the Marines are planning to work with the Iraqi police and also train and equip an Iraqi military force to take on the insurgents. \"We intend to create an Iraqi Marine battalion, maybe a brigade,\" General Conway said.\n\nMarine commanders have stressed the need to be sensitive to local traditions. Marines here have been told to remove their sunglasses and look Iraqis in the eye when they speak with them. A select group of marines also been selected for intensive Arabic language training. The marines will use Iraqi, not American names, to delineate the zones assigned to specific Marine units and will try to align them with Iraqi administrative districts. To limit the disruption to the local populations, the Marines also plan to set up their bases outside of Iraqi cities.\n\nBut the marines at Camp Pendleton are also prepared to fight.\n\n\"We carry an embedded offensive capability in every convoy,\" said Maj. Gen. James N. Mattis, the commander of the First Marine Division. \"To us you don't drive on through, you stop, you hunt them down and you nail them.\"\n\n\"We will try to go and restore a degree of civility,\" said General Mattis. \"If they choose to fight, they are going to regret it, but we also believe that part of the physicians' oath that says first do no harm. If to kill a terrorist we have got to kill eight innocent people, you don't kill them.\"\n\nGeneral Conway added: \"We will be as vicious with the resistance as we have to be. It is not that we intend to go in and coddle everyone. Our marines just have to be able to be aggressive and hostile one moment and the next moment be able to play soccer with the kids.\"\n\nGeneral Conway said, for instance, that if marines fire artillery shells, they will be special illumination rounds to light up terrain, not destroy targets.\n\n\"Right now, in some of the sectors they are firing artillery missions against radar hits,\" General Conway said. \"That will not be our method of operation.\"\n\n--------\nU.S. Draws on Israeli Methods for Iraq\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- In fighting insurgents in Iraq, the United States is drawing on some of Israel's methods and experiences in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including running checkpoints and tracking militants with drone aircraft, Israeli officials say.\n\nIsraeli and U.S. security experts have met repeatedly in recent months to discuss urban warfare and Israel's lessons from its grueling three-year fight against Palestinian militants.\n\nIn public comments, Israeli and U.S. officials acknowledge ``strategic cooperation'' and confirm high-level meetings, the most recent one last week in Tel Aviv. However, they play down the contacts as routine, apparently for fear the Arab world will be outraged.\n\nRecent U.S. methods in Iraq increasingly mimic those Israel uses in the West Bank and Gaza -- setting up impromptu checkpoints, keeping militants on the defensive with frequent arrest raids and, in at least one case, encircling a village and distributing travel permits.\n\nAn Israeli security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Israel has briefed the U.S. military on its frequent use of drones, or unmanned reconnaissance aircraft, which allow officers at Israeli military headquarters to watch operations in real time.\n\nThe Israeli security official said Israel has taught the U.S. military how to make use of intelligence information within minutes to attack a moving target. The U.S. military has not formally adopted targeted killings, though some wanted Iraqis have been killed in arrest raids.\n\nA U.S. Army officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S. troops try to stay clear of methods that look like collective punishment. Israel routinely demolishes the family homes of Palestinian attackers in hopes of deterring future attacks.\n\nThe British newspaper The Guardian recently reported Israeli advisers are training U.S. soldiers at Fort Bragg, N.C.\n\nLt. Col. Hans Bush, of the U.S. Army's Special Operations Command, said there are no Israeli forces ``currently teaching Army Special Operations Command forces at Fort Bragg.''\n\nLast week, a large delegation from the Army Training and Doctrine Command in Fort Monroe, Va., visited Israel. Harvey Perritt, the command's civilian spokesman, said the meeting was routine, but would not elaborate.\n\nThe Israeli army said in a statement it does not comment on ``ongoing strategic cooperation between the U.S. and the Israeli military.''\n\nBut military officials close to the sides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the meetings focused on lessons learned from Israel's fighting in the West Bank and Gaza and how to adapt them to Iraq.\n\nIsrael also gave the United States a training video for troops to illustrate an 11-point code on treating civilians, the rights of international relief groups and other issues ``very tied into...the daily dilemmas'' of urban warfare, said Lt. Col. Amos Guiora, commander of the Israeli army's school of military law. The Israeli military recently began showing the video to its troops, amid persistent Palestinian complaints of mistreatment by soldiers.\n\nIsrael has an entire doctrine on operating checkpoints: how many soldiers are needed for different types of blockades and how to differentiate between civilians and militants, said Eitan Ben-Eliahu, a former Israeli air force commander.\n\n``These are details that only people who were involved in it for many years can know, and other armies, like the U.S. military, haven't had ... enough experience,'' he said.\n\nUrban warfare is different from conventional fighting in every way, Ben-Eliahu said. Soldiers are often confronted with face-to-face battles against an enemy willing to commit suicide. And soldiers have to avoid killing civilians who mingle, knowingly or not, among militants, he said.\n\nAn Israeli security source said American officers have visited a mock-up of an Arab town used for Israeli training. Earlier this year, Israeli and American troops held joint exercises in Israel's Negev Desert, focusing on air defenses.\n\nBrig. Gen. Michael Vane, deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Army's Training and Doctrine Command, acknowledged in a letter to Army Magazine in July that ``we recently traveled to Israel to glean lessons learned from their counter-terrorist operations in urban areas.''\n\nMartin Van Creveld, an Israeli military expert, warned that just as Israel has been unsuccessful in eliminating militant groups and suicide bombers, the United States cannot expect to be victorious in Iraq.\n\nVan Creveld traveled to Camp Lejeune, N.C., last year to lecture U.S. military officials on the door-to-door fighting that took place in April 2002 in the West Bank refugee camp of Jenin. Twenty-three Israeli soldiers and 52 Palestinians were killed in the battle.\n\n``They are already doing things that we have been doing for years to no avail, like demolishing buildings ... like closing off villages in barbed wire,'' Van Creveld said. ``The Americans are coming here to try to mimic all kinds of techniques, but it's not going to do them any good.''\n\nIn Iraq, the Americans have a more difficult task than Israel's in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Van Creveld said. Iraq is larger, the borders are open and there is almost unlimited access to arms.\n\n``I don't see how on earth they (the U.S.) can win. I think this is going to end the same way Vietnam did,'' Van Creveld said. ``They are going to flee the country hanging on the strings of helicopters,'' he added, referring to the 1973 U.S. departure from Saigon.\n\n-------- israel / palestine\nA Bush Aide Criticizes Israel for Not Doing More for Peace\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy STEVEN R. WEISMAN\nThe New York Times\n\n\nWASHINGTON - In an unusually blunt criticism of a close ally, a Bush administration envoy on the Middle East said Thursday that Israel had \"done too little for far too long\" to foster peace negotiations with the Palestinian Authority.\n\nSpeaking at a conference in Rome held to raise money for the Palestinians, David F. Satterfield, a deputy assistant secretary of state, criticized the Palestinian side as well as the Israelis. But his comments about Israel were among the toughest any American official has publicly made in some time.\n\nHis statement was the third sign of American displeasure with Israel in the last month.\n\nIn late November, the administration reduced loan guarantees for Israel to punish the expansion of settlements and the construction of a barrier in the West Bank.\n\nLast week the administration rebuffed Israel as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met with self-appointed negotiators from Israel and the Palestinian side who proposed a peace plan to create a Palestinian state in most of the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nIsrael had asked the United States not to meet with the authors of that plan.\n\nMr. Powell met Thursday with two other freelance peace \"negotiators,\" Ami Ayalon, a former chief of Israel's security service, Shin Bet, and Sari Nusseibeh, a Palestinian professor, who have also advocated the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nMr. Satterfield's criticism of Israel occurred amid other signs that European, Arab and American diplomats were trying to restart the peace effort after months of inactivity.\n\nOmar Suleiman, the Egyptian security chief, met in Washington with Mr. Powell and other top American officials about the Arab efforts to get the Palestinian side to agree to a cease-fire.\n\nIn Rome international donors to the Palestinians said that, because of the installation of a new Palestinian prime minister, a \"window of opportunity\" had reopened, permitting the resumption of negotiations with Israel.\n\nThe donors also said they would consider establishing a special trust fund to help the Palestinian Authority deal with a $650 million shortfall in its budget. The donors provided $1.2 billion to the Palestinian Authority last year.\n\nThe conference in Rome included the first meeting with the Palestinian foreign minister, Nabil Shaath, and the Israeli foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, since the new Palestinian government was formed last month.\n\nSecretary Powell is to meet with Mr. Shalom on Friday, and administration officials said they were awaiting details of certain unilateral actions to be taken by Israel that have been circulating in the Israeli news media. They include closing some settlements and establishing an interim Palestinian state, according to the media reports.\n\nSome American officials said the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, might unveil these steps next week, the first anniversary of his endorsement of the administration-backed peace plan known as the \"road map.\"\n\nThe view in the administration is that the peace negotiating process is stalled right now but could be rekindled if the Israeli steps could be coupled with a cease-fire by the Palestinians and a promise to crack down on Palestinian militants. But few officials were willing to express certainty that something was in the offing.\n\n--------\n6 Palestinians Reported Killed in Gaza Clash\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy GREG MYRE\nThe New York Times\n\n\nJERUSALEM, Friday, Dec. 12 - Israeli troops on a predawn raid on Thursday shot dead six Palestinians, including militants and civilians during heavy exchanges of gunfire in the southern Gaza Strip, Palestinians said. If the death toll given by the Palestinians is correct, it would be one of the highest in a single day in recent weeks.\n\nIsraeli armored vehicles, supported by attack helicopters, entered Rafah around 4 a.m. in search of Khaled Qadi, a leading member of Islamic Jihad, a Palestinian militant group that has carried out many suicide bombings and attacks against Israel.\n\nThe military said Israeli troops were fired upon and shot back.\n\nThe army said its soldiers had shot three Palestinian gunmen and believed that all were killed. But Palestinian witnesses and doctors at Rafah Hospital said six Palestinians were killed, two of them militants and four civilians. More than a dozen Palestinians were wounded, the hospital added.\n\nThe dead included a man hit about a half-mile from the scene of the fighting by a stray bullet, a hospital official said. He added that a medic was shot while trying to help the wounded, and later died of his wounds. Israel said the medic belonged to the militant group Hamas.\n\nPalestinian gunmen wounded seven Jews who defied Israeli military orders early on Friday to try to reach a holy site in the West Bank city of Nablus, Israeli security officials told Reuters. The officials said one of the Jews was critically wounded when gunmen fired at the group near Joseph's Tomb.\n\nPalestinians in Nablus said the Israeli Army had moved in to seal off the area of the shooting.\n\nOn Thursday, the Palestinian prime minister, Ahmed Qurei, said it would be \"a terrible mistake\" if his Israeli counterpart, Ariel Sharon, tried to impose a unilateral political settlement on the Palestinians. Mr. Sharon has suggested he could take such action if peace efforts remain stalled.\n\n\"You cannot build a fence on our land, to cage us like chickens and hope all will be well,\" Mr. Qurei told the Israeli newspaper Maariv, referring to the barrier Israel is building in the West Bank. \"The conflict will continue, the fire will burn, terror will increase, nobody will benefit.\"\n\nJERUSALEM, Dec. 11 -- Six Palestinians were killed and about 20 were injured Thursday in the southern Gaza Strip when Israeli soldiers arrested a senior Palestinian militant and fierce gun battles erupted in the neighborhood surrounding his home, Israeli and Palestinian security officials said.\n\nLater in the day, Tel Aviv was rocked by a sidewalk explosion that bore the hallmarks of a Palestinian suicide bombing but turned out to be an attempted gangland hit that killed three bystanders, Israeli police officials said.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman said troops entered a refugee camp in Rafah, along the Egyptian border, at 4 a.m. to arrest Khaled Kadi, whom the spokesman described as a senior member of Islamic Jihad. He said that Kadi was involved in smuggling weapons into the Gaza Strip from Egypt and had previously planned attacks inside Israel and against Israeli soldiers and settlers in Gaza.\n\nPalestinian witnesses and security officials said that about 20 Israeli armored vehicles entered the Salam neighborhood in eastern Rafah and came under attack as they approached Kadi's house. The Israeli spokesman said that when Palestinians from two groups -- Islamic Jihad and Hamas -- opened fire with light weapons and antitank rockets, Israeli troops returned fire and killed three Hamas gunmen.\n\nPalestinian security sources and witnesses said that six people were killed, including two Hamas members -- Omar Abu Muhsin, 28, and Nasir Abu Naja, 28 -- and an emergency medical technician, Mohammed Vino, 23, who they said was shot in the head while aiding the wounded. Israeli military sources said that Vino was known to them as a Hamas operative.\n\nThe other victims were identified as Sabri Abu Loli, 25; Ayyad Mahmom, 55; and Kamal Akhras, 17. Palestinian security and hospital officials said at least 20 people were wounded, including a 10-year-old girl.\n\nIsraeli troops said they captured Kadi during the operation and destroyed three structures, including his family's house.\n\n[Early Friday, Palestinian gunmen ambushed an Israeli car heading toward a disputed holy site in the West Bank city of Nablus, wounding seven, one critically, the Associated Press reported, citing military officials and rescue workers. The Israelis, members of an extremist Jewish sect, were sneaking into the city to pray at a site where some Jews believe the biblical patriarch Joseph is buried. Israel abandoned the site in 2000 and banned Jews from going there.]\n\nIn Tel Aviv, Israeli police said the bombing Thursday targeted Zeev Rosenstein, who is considered one of the top organized crime bosses in Israel. He reportedly owns several casinos in Europe and has been the target of at least six previous assassination attempts.\n\nRosenstein and a bodyguard were slightly injured in the blast, police officials said. Three men killed in the blast had not been identified Thursday night but apparently were pedestrians, police said. At least 19 people were injured, they said.\n\nThe explosion occurred near a cafe and money changing store at a crowded intersection in central Tel Aviv. Police said the bomb was planted on an awning over the entrance of a shop.\n\nA police spokesman, Gil Kleiman, said Rosenstein had been released from police custody a few days ago after being held for investigation in a purported murder-for-hire scheme.\n\n-------- space\nUS will attack from space?\nChina and Russia call for space arms prohibition Statistics show that space-related industries grow at an annual rate of 20 percent, and the profit of international space industry exceeded US$80 billion in 2000, which is expected to increase by over 200 percent in the next 10 years. The human society has become inseparable from the outer space, and it has become a common concern of world countries to make peaceful use of the outer space and ensure space security.\n\nWho is challenging space security?\n\nThe end of the Cold War not only dramatically changed the global security circumstance, but put an end to the situation in which arms race in the space was more or less restrained. Superficially, the fast development of space technology and its wide application in military fields are the main factors threatening space security. As a matter of fact, the disintegration of the bipolar structure has made America the only superpower and its boundless expanding strength and ambition are also the actual factors challenging space security.\n\nThe dual-purpose space technology and its wide military application have provided potential driving force to space weaponization. Along with hi-tech development, the demarcation between technologies for military and civilian uses has become increasingly blurred. This is manifested as follows: firstly, many key technologies in military fields are at the same time pillar technologies for the development of the national economy; secondly, the convergence of military and civilian technologies is the orientation for technical renovation. The integration of these two kinds of technologies has made it difficult for people to tell one from the other. A case in point is space technology. Navigation, detecting and communication satellites can be applied to both military purposes and economic construction. During the Iraq War, America mobilized more than 100 satellites of various kinds, ranging from highly confidential electronic reconnaissance satellites to meteorological satellites accessible to anyone.\n\nBesides, the wide application of space technology to the military field has, on the one hand, enormously enhanced the US army's capability of global reach and real-time striking, enabling US troops to have a farther sight, faster action, more direct attacking and smoother communication than their enemies. On the other hand, due to the fact that the efficient use of space resources has become an important factor deciding the outcome of war, satellites and other space resources will therefore possibly become targets of attack and intervention during wars and conflicts. Civilian satellites, in particular, due to their role as supplements and substitutes for military satellites in wars, are much likely subject to attack in war. For this reason, the dual purpose and wide military application of space technology have, to a certain extent, intensified the danger of weaponization of the space.\n\nThe US space policy of one-sided search for absolute advantages may trigger off a series of chain reactions and new vulnerability in space. America's attempt, plan and action to control the outer space not only have long been in existence, but also have undergone new development thanks to the effort of the Bush administration. To take the military highland of space all to itself, the US army not only aims to rely heavily on the space, but also wants to dominate it exclusively. As clearly pointed out in the nation's space development guide, the \"space control\" defined by the US army is the capability to \"secure its own freedom of action in space\", and at the same time \"prevent its rivals from having such capability\". The Pentagon is organizing its space combat troops and Rumsfeld has ordered the air force to get ready for \"carrying out fast and continuous space operations\".\n\nWhat worth mentioning is that the Bush Administration is developing its missile defense system, aiming at missile interception in space by 2008. An official with the US Missile Defense Agency this year stressed efforts made on developing a space-based test platform, which includes at least three satellites at its initial stage, while a Space-Based Laser (SBL) in the missile defense program will be put into test by 2012. The application of SBL will go far beyond the needs of a missile defense system, experts pointed out. According to the SBL project director, the extra functions of SBL include \"defending/attacking anti-space-based fights (i.e., anti-satellite missions); \"preventing enemy use of space (such as destroying enemy launching); preventing information input/output of satellites (likely to use low-energy beams to jam satellites rather than directly destroying them); \"defending/attacking anti-space fights\" and \"striking high-altitude planes, cruise missiles and unmanned aircraft\". Although the efficiency of SBL is uncertain, the adverse current of space weaponization has appeared.\n\nDue to the development of space technology, existing international treaty framework for planning space activities fails to meet the new growing space security challenge. By now, international treaties relating to the prevention of outer-space arms race mainly include the \"Five United Nations Treaties on Outer Space\", \"Partial Test Ban Treaty\", \"Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques\", \"Agreement Concerning Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies\", as well as the \"Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty\" between the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\nThese treaties once played a positive role in preventing outer-space arms race, but limited by political, military and technological conditions, they are seriously flawed and unable to prevent arms race in the outer space. For example, the \"Five UN Treaties on Outer Space\" is weakened in its function of preventing outer-space arms race and laid perils for future weapons in space since it doesn't prohibit the deployment of non-WMD arms nor the development, production and use of outer-space weapons. Some treaties do have strict regulations, but they have ceased to be effective, such as the \"Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty\" of 1972. Some others fail to be universal because signatories are too few, such as the \"Moon Agreement\" of 1979. In a word, the current international mechanism for preventing space arms race is too weak to tackle the rapid development of space technology and weapons. The existing treaties must be added or revised, even new treaties need to be concluded through negotiations.\n\nTit-for-tat lines in space security\n\nThe new threat to space security has raised higher requirements on outer-space arms control. In recent years, although the international community has made much effort in this regard, the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, due to obstructions from the United States, remained stagnant in the aspects of preventing outer-space arms race and strengthening the outer-space legal system. Currently there are two lines of thought for preventing out-space arms race and securing space security. One is represented by America, which, in quest of absolute security, is against negotiations on space disarmament regardless of the interests of other countries. Now the Bush Administration is bent on expanding its space military capability, believing that actions must be taken to guarantee its security as long as they are technologically practicable. Washington's excuse is that America relies heavier on space than other countries do, so it is obliged to develop a unique space capability to ensure security. America declared its space weapons as defensive, then whom is it to guard against? Are they Russia and China, who have been taken by America as rivals?\n\nThe other line is represented by China and Russia. The two countries oppose outer-space armament and arms race, and advocate addressing related countries' space security concerns through international cooperation, this helps enhance international security and stability and is in the common interests of all countries. To this end, China has been making strenuous efforts to spur the international community to sign related international legal documents through negotiations and proposed to the Conference related documents together with other countries involved. China holds that a special committee for preventing outer-space arms race should be rebuilt as soon as possible to reach, through negotiation, agreements or treaties with legal effect for preventing outer space arms race.\n\nTo ensure the effectiveness of the treaties China suggested that they must contain the following articles: prohibition of test, deployment and use of any weapon, weapon system and their components in outer space; prohibition of test, deployment and use of any weapon, weapon system and their components used for outer-space war on land, sea and in the atmosphere; prohibition of the use, or threat of use, of weapons on outer-space objects; prohibition of helping and encouraging other countries, groups and international organizations to participate in activities forbidden by the treaty.\n\nThe existence of the two completely different lines shows that the international community must take immediate actions to bring the outer-space weapon control into track. Once a legal binding agreement on space disarmament is reached, it will help remove an important unstable factor in future international security and ensure the continuous peaceful use of space.\n\nWhile ABC might have a few points about being the only other network other than MSNBC to have a full-time reporter with the campaign, what they are missing, and hoping you will miss as well, is how they DON'T use the footage that Melinda Arons has collected over her period with the campaign. Melinda is a great person who is very dedicated to her work (I've met her several times and has had the opportunity to talk to her quite extensively), yet everytime I ask her why Dennis Kucinich is not mentioned more, she always refers the cause to upper-management: producers decide what to show and what not to show. So don't let ABC scare you away with their rhetoric about how they have been responsible and should be the last in line to be criticized. They should be criticized for not giving equal air time to all the presidential candidates, and they should be held responsible for the decisions they make. After all, does anyone really think Lieberman or Edwards is going to get the nomination? I didn't think so...\n\nThe controversy began when the White House said Air Force One was spotted by a British Airways plane but the president's pilots told the dubious British Airways pilots by radio that they were flying a Gulfstream V. The White House later said there was no British Airways plane involved and the conversation took place between British air traffic control and another plane while Air Force One was \"off the western coast of England.\"\n\nAs it happens, Air Force One was flying across the North Sea, off the eastern coast of England, when it was spotted by the mystery plane, a German charter jet. But that's being picky.\n\nOf more concern, air traffic controllers in Britain are seething over the flight, in which the president's 747, falsely identified as a Gulfstream, traveled through British airspace. Prospect, the controllers union in the United Kingdom, says the flight broke international regulations, posed a potential safety threat and exposed a weakness in the air defense system that could be exploited by terrorists.\n\n\"The overriding concern is if the president's men who did this can dupe air traffic control, what's to stop a highly organized terrorist group from duping air traffic control?\" asked David Luxton, Prospect's national secretary. Luxton said the flight was in \"breach\" of regulations against filing false flight plans set by the International Civil Aviation Organization, which he said should apply to a military aircraft using civilian airspace.\n\nLuxton said that by identifying itself as a Gulfstream V instead of the much larger 747, Air Force One could have put itself and other airplanes in danger. The Gulfstream can climb faster and maneuver more nimbly than a 747, which means controllers could have assumed the president's plane was capable of a collision-avoiding maneuver that it couldn't actually do. And the \"wake vortex\" of a 747, much larger than a Gulfstream's, could jeopardize smaller planes that were told by unsuspecting controllers to follow in the mislabeled plane's wake.\n\nAs it happens, Air Force One passed without incident. But Luxton said that's beside the point. \"It's important air traffic control have an accurate picture of what's up there in the sky they're controlling,\" he said.\n\nThe White House has declined to elaborate further on the flight plan and other security measures for the trip.\n\n-------- POLICE / PRISONERS / COURTS / JUSTICE\n\n-------- death penalty\nWhen DNA Meets Death Row, It's the System That's Tested\n\nInside a walk-in freezer in a Richmond, Calif., laboratory sits a tiny vial that holds one-fifth of one drop of a 20-year-old sperm sample. It is forensic DNA evidence extracted from the body of a brutally murdered young bride, evidence that no one is permitted by law to touch, evidence that -- if tested -- could determine whether an innocent man was executed in Virginia 11 years ago.\n\nThe case of Virginia coal miner Roger Keith Coleman -- put to death for the 1982 murder of his wife's sister, Wanda McCoy -- is one of a handful of death-penalty cases in which DNA evidence still exists in police labs and evidence facilities across the country that could cast doubt on the guilt of men already executed.\n\nSince DNA \"fingerprinting\" began to revolutionize criminal forensics in the late 1980s with precise identifications, it has freed more than 130 convicts, 12 of whom have walked off death row. But in other cases, prosecutors have successfully blocked the testing of DNA before an execution and then fought posthumous tests just as vigorously.\n\nNow two of those cases are moving toward denouement. In the Coleman case, advocates met recently with a senior aide to Virginia Gov. Mark R. Warner (D), who could order the DNA tested. Warner is seriously considering the request, said Robert Blue, the governor's chief counsel. And last Friday, in the Texas case of Richard Wayne Jones, a judge granted a prosecutor's motion to conclude legal efforts to obtain evidence for testing -- the last barrier stopping the state from destroying the evidence.\n\n\"The most critical reason to test these cases is that you can find the person who really committed the crime,\" said Barry Scheck, co-founder of the Innocence Project at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, which provides pro bono help to inmates seeking post-conviction DNA testing. \"It seems to me the community would have a compelling interest in knowing the truth, and we can learn from the truth.\"\n\nScheck points to the Florida case of Frank Lee Smith as the most unsettling example of the relevance of DNA testing. Smith -- black, poor and mentally ill -- was convicted of the 1985 rape and murder of an 8-year-old girl. He died of cancer on death row in 2000, waiting for the DNA testing that exonerated him 11 months later. The results identified a convicted rapist and murderer as the perpetrator.\n\nProsecutors say that they usually support post-conviction testing if the results could definitively resolve an inmate's guilt or innocence. But a number acknowledge that they remain opposed to what they see as baseless testing, in large part out of concern for the victims' relatives, who have waited years -- sometimes decades -- for closure.\n\nLegal experts say that the costs of testing, which run into thousands of dollars, contribute to the resistance. They also cite a prosecutorial fear that foes of the death penalty are simply trying to undermine the capital-punishment system. John Eastman, a Chapman University law professor, said that post-conviction DNA testing is not always \"about a particular guy being innocent, but an effort to open the door to build a case against the death penalty.\"\n\nIn the case of Joseph Roger O'Dell III, executed in Virginia in 1997 for a rape and murder, a prosecuting attorney bluntly argued in court in 1998 that if posthumous DNA results exonerated O'Dell, \"it would be shouted from the rooftops that . . . Virginia executed an innocent man.\" The state prevailed, and the evidence was destroyed.\n\n\"There are circumstances where enough is enough after going through 15 years of appeals,\" said Josh Marquis, an Oregon prosecutor who is co-chairman of the capital litigation committee of the National District Attorneys Association. \"At some point there has to be finality. They have no disincentive for stopping. . . . In most of these cases, it's the last-ditch effort, the Hail Mary pass.\"\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers agree that the spate of well-publicized wrongful convictions uncovered by DNA testing has taken its toll on the system. As Attorney General John D. Ashcroft encourages prosecutors to aggressively pursue the death penalty, jurors are showing increasing reluctance to mete it out. A 2001 Bureau of Justice Statistics study shows death sentences are down by half since 1994. Proof that an innocent man has been executed could be a tipping point in this national debate, according to both sides.\n\n\"There is no question\" that the vindication of an executed man \"could have a significant impact on the system,\" said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, an anti-death-penalty education organization in Washington. \"By putting a human face on a huge mistake, hesitation of the death penalty could turn into opposition -- not because people morally perceive it as wrong but because they would see the system is flawed.\"\n\nOthers, however, believe the impact would be minimal, and a recent survey supports that. A May 2003 Gallup Poll showed that 73 percent of Americans believe that an innocent man has been executed in the past five years -- but the same poll showed that 60 percent of those surveyed believe the punishment is applied fairly.\n\nIn four cases of executed men examined by The Washington Post, anti-death-penalty advocacy groups, relatives of the executed, lawyers or the media have tried to have samples tested. In two of the cases, the states thwarted DNA testing before the men were executed. Most recently, the Texas attorney general denied a request from The Post to test evidence in the case of Jones, executed in 2000 for the stabbing murder of a woman he was accused of kidnapping. Also in Texas, defense attorneys continue to try to obtain DNA evidence in the case of Windell Broussard, put to death for killing his estranged wife and stepson. The nonprofit Innocence Project has agreed to handle the testing if they are successful. In the Oklahoma case of Malcolm Rent Johnson, executed for the rape and murder of an elderly woman, the state had tentatively agreed to posthumous testing -- but then federal authorities seized the evidence for another investigation.\n\nMore than 30 states have in recent years enacted laws that permit some form of post-conviction DNA testing in the event that evidence -- or technology -- should develop years later that could spare a life. But when Coleman, Broussard, Jones and Johnson were convicted, they were afforded no such guaranteed protections.\n\n'Let Sleeping Dogs Lie'\n\nIn the decade that Roger Coleman sat on death row for the 1981 murder of his sister-in-law, he had more public support for his innocence claim than any other condemned man in recent history. Articulate and white, the coal miner from Grundy, Va., had going for him an ingratiating personality as well as a team of high-powered lawyers, an inmate aid organization, a supportive University of Virginia girlfriend and a press corps raising questions about his guilt. Days before his execution, Time magazine asked on its cover, \"Must This Man Die?\"\n\nBut in the end, no amount of public pressure could persuade the courts and the governor of Virginia at the time, L. Douglas Wilder (D), to spare Coleman's life. Coleman was electrocuted on May 20, 1992, after proclaiming, \"An innocent man is going to be murdered tonight.\"\n\nLast year, the Virginia Supreme Court rebuffed a pleading to obtain the sample for posthumous testing from Centurion Ministries, the inmate aid charity, and a group of media organizations, including The Post, ruling that the parties had \"no right\" to gain access to the sample for testing.\n\nBut the matter is not over.\n\nEdward Blake, a forensic scientist hired by the defense in 1990 to do an earlier form of DNA testing, could not at that time eliminate Coleman as the rapist and killer. But with more-advanced technology now at his disposal, Blake holds the small sample in his Forensics Science Associates laboratory freezer in California, refusing to return it to the state for fear it will be destroyed -- but also barred from testing it without a court order.\n\nAlthough Blake suspects Coleman is guilty based on his earlier work, he is also steadfast in his belief that the public has the right to know the truth. \"I'm not anti-death penalty; I'm pro-democracy,\" he said in an interview. \"How can the state take the position that this is not worth inquiring into? Why not find out once and for all?\"\n\nBlake also said that because he has not examined the sample in years, he cannot be sure there is enough left to test.\n\nColeman supporters have long challenged his conviction based on what they say was an implausible timeline and inexperienced trial lawyers. They argue that if he had been everywhere witnesses said he was, Coleman would not have had time to park his truck on the main road, wade through a creek, rape his sister-in-law, cut her throat and get home. He became suspect because of an earlier conviction for sexual assault -- a crime he also denied.\n\nAfter years of legal maneuvering, Coleman's defense team persuaded a judge in 1990 to allow the semen swab to be tested, over strong objections from the Virginia attorney general. Blake concluded that the semen was consistent with Coleman's, but DNA technology was still in its nascent stages. Blake raised the possibility that two different semen samples may have been present.\n\nWhen he lost the court battle to have the DNA tested, Jim McCloskey, head of Centurion Ministries, asked Warner to have the sample retested, a decision the governor can make unilaterally.\n\n\"That is not implying that I have any worry that Coleman was wrongly convicted,\" he said. \"What do we do about it in 10 years -- when more sophisticated technology comes up? Do we test it again? When does this Pandora's box stop opening?\"\n\nSharon Paul, Coleman's former girlfriend, lives in Seattle today and has tried to move on with her life. She said she is ambivalent about testing the sample -- but would like to see Coleman's name cleared. She said she has no apprehension about the results.\n\n\"I am very secure in my belief that Roger Coleman was innocent,\" she said. \"Any results that offer a different answer will just lead me to conclude mistakes were made.\"\n\n'Simply Unconscionable'\n\nWhen Richard Wayne Jones was arrested in 1986 for the kidnapping and stabbing murder of Tammy Livingston in Fort Worth, he and his girlfriend had in their possession the victim's checkbook, bank card and credit cards. His fingerprint was found on the victim's car, and a couple of drops of blood consistent with hers were on his pants.\n\nFrom the initial investigation, Jones never denied being at the crime scene. But after confessing to the murder, he later recanted. In a goodbye letter to his mother in 1993, after his first execution date had been set, he for the first time accused his sister, Brenda, and a friend of hers, Walt Sellers, of the murder, and claimed to have only helped dispose of the body to help Brenda. He admitted to driving the victim's car and to burning her body to cover up the crime.\n\nEvidence in the case still sits in a Fort Worth police lab, but none of it -- including swabs from Livingston's body and cigarette butts found in her car -- was ever tested for DNA. Jones's defense team asserts that testing would have spared his life by raising a reasonable doubt that he was the murderer. Jones's sister and Sellers were never charged.\n\n\"I have no doubt about his version of events. I have no doubt this man did not kill Tammy Livingston,\" said Tina Francis, an investigator who worked on the case for years. She said she came across numerous people who supported Jones's version of events.\n\n\"It's unforgivable that he burned the body -- but he shouldn't have been executed for it. It's still very raw for me.\"\n\nAccording to defense lawyers and Francis, Jones grew up in an unstable, poor family in rural Texas and had been in trouble with the law before this arrest. He had an IQ of 67, said Francis, which made him borderline retarded. The defense team was never able to persuade the courts to reopen the case. In a last-ditch effort shortly before his execution -- and immediately afterward -- Jones's attorneys and his two sons unsuccessfully tried to have the DNA tested. The effort was vigorously opposed by the state as a waste of time and resources.\n\n\"He always admitted to being present at the crime scene, so the DNA would never exclude him and therefore never exonerate him,\" said Ann Diamond, a prosecutor in the case, who is seeking the dismissal of the case.\n\n\"They found her blood on him. His fingerprint was on the car. He admitted to burning the body. There is no articulated basis, in any way, shape or form, that he could be cleared of this crime. If there were any possibility . . . we would have [tested]. But when we have so many cases, there was no justification to expend public resources.\" William Harris, Jones's appellate lawyer, said: \"It was simply unconscionable that they would not test the evidence before killing a man.\"\n\nJones was executed Aug. 22, 2000. After he died, a member of the defense team secured a DNA sample from Jones's body, which is tucked away in a lockbox in the event the state ever agrees to test the evidence.\n\nIn September, the Texas attorney general's office denied a request from The Post for the physical evidence in the case, stating that \"tangible physical evidence . . . is not public information.\" Then, last week, a judge agreed to dismiss all pending claims on the evidence. Jones's attorneys, Greg Westfall and Gerald Staton, did not oppose the prosecutor's motion.\n\n'Wasn't a Choirboy'\n\nIn April 1992, a little girl named Toccara Harris lay critically wounded in a Port Arthur, Tex., emergency room, just hours after a brutal stabbing attack that took the lives of her mother and 10-year-old brother.\n\n\"Who hurt you?\" a police officer asked her.\n\nShe was unequivocal in her response: \"My stepdaddy,\" she said. \"Windell Broussard.\"\n\nAt that moment, at 8 years old, Toccara became the most compelling witness against the estranged husband of her 28-year-old mother, a witness who the defense argued was far too young to make a definitive identification. The room was dark when the assailant stabbed the family, the lawyers argued. She could see only a man's profile, and furthermore, she was awakened in the middle of the night. How, the lawyers asked, could the child be so sure?\n\nBroussard denied involvement, but prosecutors built a strong case based on his criminal record, his volatile relationship with his wife, Dianna, testimony from an elderly aunt who quoted him as saying he killed someone -- and Toccara's eyewitness account.\n\nBroussard was convicted and sentenced to death. In April 2001, Texas passed emergency legislation to permit post-conviction DNA testing. Within weeks, Broussard's appellate lawyers filed suit in state district court in Beaumont to compel the testing.\n\n\"Windell wasn't a choirboy -- you'd never accuse him of singing too loud in church,\" said Michael Charlton, who filed the lawsuit. \"But I believed him. . . . I just liked the guy.\"\n\nDuring a hearing on the matter, Judge Charles Carver in Beaumont denied the request to test the scrapings but agreed to order the blood samples from the scene to be tested. A few weeks later, Charlton recalled, the judge changed his mind with no explanation. The lawyer appealed to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals but was not able to get a stay of execution.\n\n\"I don't know what the purpose of DNA testing would be -- for publicity or to find the truth,\" Jefferson County Assistant District Attorney Ed Shettle said yesterday. \"The little girl was an incredible witness.\"\n\n\"Windell maintained his innocence on the gurney,\" Charlton said.\n\nThis month the Innocence Project agreed to test any available DNA, and Charlton continues to press for whatever evidence may remain.\n\n'I'm Going to Heaven'\n\nOklahoma City public defender Robert Ravitz is not sure to this day whether his client Malcolm Rent Johnson was innocent of the 1981 rape and murder of 76-year-old Ura Alma Thompson. But the defense lawyer is nonetheless certain that Johnson did not get a fair shake from the legal system before he was executed for the crime almost four years ago.\n\nThe state's case relied on Johnson's possession of Thompson's personal property, as well as fiber, hair and semen analysis that was later challenged. \"Maybe [the state] could have made a case for being in possession of stolen property,\" Ravitz said. \"But I just can't believe in my wildest dreams that a jury, even back then, would give someone the death penalty based on that kind of flimsy evidence.\"\n\nJohnson maintained his innocence for 18 years. \"I'm going to heaven on a midnight train,\" he told the witnesses to his execution.\n\nJohnson was a young man with a low IQ and a troubled history when he was charged with Thompson's murder. A product of an abusive home life, he had served time for rape, robbery and assault by the time he was 23.\n\nOn the day Thompson's body was discovered by her nephew in her Oklahoma City apartment, Johnson was arrested on an unrelated weapons charge. The arresting detective noticed in Johnson's apartment a doll matching a description of one taken from another rape victim. A wider search uncovered a number of items belonging to Thompson -- a ring, a watch, a key to her apartment. Johnson said that he did not know how the items got there, that perhaps his brother brought them.\n\nThe forensic evidence presented at Johnson's trial had been handled and tested by now-disgraced police scientist Joyce Gilchrist, whose alleged mishandling of evidence threw the state law enforcement community into turmoil two years ago.\n\nGilchrist testified that semen samples allowed her to identify the blood type as being the same as Johnson's. She also testified that blue fibers at the apartment matched a shirt of Johnson's, and that the blue dye from the shirt was found on hairs at the scene -- a highly unusual conclusion. It was the first time Gilchrist had testified about fiber. The court denied Johnson's request for funds to hire an expert to refute her testimony.\n\nWhen questions were raised about Gilchrist's competence after Johnson's execution, a lawyer who never knew Johnson took up his cause. Douglas Parr sued the police for documents and to have tested the semen-stained evidence -- a bedspread, pillowcases and pantyhose.\n\nTwo years ago, an internal police memorandum was made public that contradicted Gilchrist's testimony at trial. A new exam of the slides that Gilchrist had said contained sperm showed they contained none -- which a defense expert would likely have caught. \"I was very upset,\" Ravitz said.\n\nA month later, the city attorney agreed to let Parr have the evidence. But before it could be tested, the federal government subpoenaed all the Johnson evidence as part of an investigation into Gilchrist's practices.\n\nOklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson said in an interview this week that he supports testing the evidence but added that he has no doubt that the state executed the right man.\n\n\"If we tried this case again today without DNA, you'd still get a conviction.\" he said. \"He was in the vicinity, his blood type was corroborative, her keys were in his apartment, and she's dead.\"\n\nEdmondson said he has tried unsuccessfully to ascertain whether the federal government has tested the evidence. Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office in Oklahoma City declined to say. The truth, one said, will be revealed in time.\n\nResearchers Lucy Shackelford and Alice Crites contributed to this report.\n\n-------- justice\nProbe Fails to Find Source of Leaks About Secret Service\n\nA government leak investigation into a 2002 magazine series that found widespread problems within the ranks of U.S. Secret Service has failed to identify anyone who improperly revealed information.\n\nThe Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General, in a report released yesterday under the Freedom of Information Act, said that it was unable to find current or former Secret Service employees who were involved with the \"unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information\" to U.S. News & World Report.\n\nIn a series of investigative reports, the magazine detailed a host of serious failings within an agency that considers itself the most elite and professional in law enforcement. The Secret Service employs thousands of uniformed officers and plainclothes agents to protect the president and other senior government officials and their families.\n\nThe magazine found gaps at times in the protective detail around some government officials and their families, though not the president. It described inadequate weapons training and accidents caused by Secret Service motorcades.\n\nThe articles also reported numerous instances of improper activity by Secret Service personnel, including allegations of criminal behavior, alcohol abuse and misuse of government property and reports that senior Secret Service officials had extramarital affairs with White House employees. The magazine detailed how a team of agents assigned to Vice President Cheney when he traveled to San Diego got into a drunken brawl when their shift ended.\n\nAfter the articles' publication, a senior official of the Secret Service's inspection division asked the inspector general of the Treasury Department, which includes the Secret Service, to find out whether Secret Service employees had broken the law by disclosing sensitive information or by making false statements about their contact with U.S. News reporters.\n\nThe inspection division questioned whether the release of such information could have harmed the service's mission and violated any law, rule or policy, according to the IG report.\n\nA Secret Service spokeswoman had no comment yesterday on whether the agency had asked for an investigation or taken any other steps to respond to the problems reported by U.S. News.\n\n\"We don't know whether the inspector general did any substantive investigation,\" said U.S. News Editor Brian Duffy. \"We know that the president asked [White House chief of staff] Andy Card to take it up with the then-head of the Secret Service, and we heard Card did raise it.\"\n\nDuffy added that the Secret Service refused to respond to the magazine's questions throughout the course of its inquiry.\n\nThe inspector general's report, which was completed April 28 but released only yesterday in redacted form, said that the inspection division identified employees it suspected of talking to U.S. News employees.\n\nOne of those Secret Service employees declined to provide a sworn statement to investigators and resigned from the agency.\n\nThe inspector general found that another employee \"probably did\" discuss Secret Service issues, but, in a sworn affidavit, denied speaking to reporters.\n\nIn the course of the probe, IG investigators examined Secret Service telephone and computer records.\n\nThe Justice Department \"declined to prosecute on the merits of the investigation,\" the IG report said.\n\n-------- terrorism\nEfforts to Fight Terror Financing Reported to Lag\n\nDecember 12, 2003\nBy ERIC LICHTBLAU and TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN\nThe New York Times\n\n\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 11 - The federal authorities do not have a clear understanding of how terrorists move their financial assets and are still struggling to prevent the flow of money to terror groups, according to a new Congressional report.\n\nThe report, by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, also finds that the Internal Revenue Service has not developed a formal plan for sharing financial information with state authorities about charities under investigation. And the report says the Treasury and Justice Departments have fallen nearly a year behind in developing a plan for attacking money laundering and issues like terrorists' use of black-market gems and gold. It says some agencies have failed to make terrorism financing a high priority or have set unrealistic goals for overhauling their tactics. The report is to be made public on Sunday.\n\nThe findings come at a time when some government officials and lawmakers say they have grown increasingly concerned about weaknesses in the government's ability to track how terrorists finance their operations.\n\nLaw enforcement officials point to several recent successes in investigating people in the United States and overseas suspected as major financiers of terrorism. But they acknowledge that gaining a clear understanding of how terrorists move their money has proven far more difficult than many anticipated and that recent attacks in Saudi Arabia, Turkey and elsewhere point to terror groups with continued access to significant resources.\n\nJustice Department officials acknowledged to investigators that the Federal Bureau of Investigation \"does not systematically collect and analyze\" information on financing used by terrorists. Such schemes have involved filtering money through charities or laundering it by selling diamonds and gold, or even cigarettes and household appliances on the black market.\n\nThe investigation \"is a real eye opener,\" said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, who requested the study along with Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa.\n\n\"This is an indication that we were naïve to believe that all of our attention had this problem under control,\" Senator Durbin said. \"I don't think we're close, and this report says that terrorists are going to continue to have resources at their disposal.\"\n\nSeveral current and former government officials said in interviews that they believed that federal agencies have made strong progress in the last two years in attacking terrorist financing, with the F.B.I, the Treasury Department, the Department of Homeland Security and others committing more agents and greater coordination to the problem.\n\n\"There have been real and material advances in the war on terrorist financing since 9/11,\" said David Aufhauser, the Treasury Department's former general counsel, who left the government in October after working extensively on the terrorist financing issue. \"It's now part of the international agenda and has to be part of the international agenda in order to be effective.\"\n\nMark Corallo, spokesman for the Justice Department, said he had not received a copy of the report. But he said, \"Since Sept. 11, the government has tirelessly pursued terrorist financing to great success.\"\n\nMr. Corallo said that \"tracking down terrorist financing is no easy matter, but we pursue all the leads in order to dry up the financing that makes terrorist activity possible.\"\n\nOther government officials say the course has been slow-going.\n\n\"Right now there is a lack of understanding of what the problem really is,\" a Justice Department official who works extensively on terror financing issues said in an interview. \"Tracing money in the best of circumstances is very, very difficult, and when you're talking about terrorist operations that can be carried out for $50,000 or $75,000, it's almost impossible.\"\n\nThe campaign to cut off terrorist financing has seen some high-profile successes and arrests in recent months, and investigators are continuing to delve into a complex network of Islamic charities and organizations in Northern Virginia that they say may have funneled money to terrorist groups. In the New York City and New Jersey area alone, investigators with the Department of Homeland Security have identified $100 million that they say was sent through illegal money-transmittal businesses, like hawalas, to countries with possible terrorist ties.\n\nBut the efforts to trace terrorist financing have been marred at times by turf wars between agencies and occasional conflicts in mission.\n\nSome agencies say they remain frustrated by a lack of resources to combat terrorist financing. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, part of the Treasury Department, said that it has felt stymied as investigators have either been let go or reassigned to other agencies.\n\nThe Treasury Department's efforts to freeze terrorist-related assets have slowed after an initial rush following the Sept. 11 attacks. More than $136 million has been frozen worldwide, most of it in the months immediately after the attacks.\n\nLaw enforcement officials say terrorists have proven adept at finding new ways to raise money, using commodities like stolen baby formula to launder money.\n\nThe report from the accounting office said investigators looked into suspected terrorists who were raising money by selling counterfeit household appliances; they simply created their own brand.\n\nIn Pakistan, a charitable group implicated in terrorist financing avoided a Pakistani intelligence investigation by moving its money to Afghanistan, the report said.\n\nAnd in Lebanon, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration ran into a dead end in investigating possible ties between drug smugglers and terrorists because of the group's \"indecipherable records\" on its financial transactions, the report said.\n\n\"We recognize that such analyses are difficult, but without an attempt do so, information about terrorists' usage and potential usage remains unknown, leaving vulnerabilities for terrorists to exploit,\" the report said in recommending a comprehensive, more analytical approach to identifying terrorist money.\n\nSenator Grassley said the report pointed up a need for a more integrated approach to investigating terrorist financing.\n\n\"What you're seeing in all of this is the left hand of the government doesn't know what the right hand is doing,\" he said in an interview. \"Why do we have a problem? Three words: lack of cooperation.\"\n\nCongressional investigators also faulted the F.B.I. for not distinguishing terrorist financing cases from broader international terror cases. \"The lack of such data hinders the F.B.I. from conducting systematic analysis of trends and patterns\" in financing and establishing clear priorities on areas it needs to attack, the report said.\n\nBut the F.B.I. said in a statement that it had aggressively analyzed the full range of unconventional financing schemes, including drug smuggling, charities and bulk-cash smuggling, in its effort to dismantle terrorist networks. \"We believe we have had significant success in this aspect of the war on terrorism,\" the bureau said.\n\nEric Lichtblau reported from Washington for this article, and Timothy L. O'Brien in telephone interviews from Moscow. David Johnston contributed reporting from Washington.\n\nHAMBURG, Dec. 11 -- The trial of a Moroccan man accused of helping the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers appeared close to collapse Thursday after the court announced that the German federal police had provided information, apparently taken from the interrogation of a top al Qaeda planner in U.S. custody, that the defendant had no advance knowledge of the plot.\n\nThe The judge said Mzoudi, alleged to be a member of the Hamburg cell that spearheaded the attacks in the United States, will have to continue to attend the trial but is otherwise free until a verdict is reached.\n\n\"There is the serious possibility that Mzoudi was purposefully left out of the attack plans despite his links to the Hamburg group and despite his stay in Afghanistan, and that his supportive actions were not consciously made,\" Ruehle said.\n\nThe surprise turn could also undo the guilty verdict a German court returned in February against another Moroccan, Mounir Motassadeq, on the same charges. With that ruling, he became the first person anywhere to be convicted of helping in the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nIn Washington, Attorney General John D. Ashcroft told reporters that he was \"disappointed that the case in Germany has taken the turn it has taken.\" He added that \"fortunately, in the United States, we enjoy a legal structure which anticipates the need for protecting both national security and adjudicating the innocence or guilt of individuals who are charged.\"\n\nRuehle, citing police information faxed to the court, reported that an unnamed witness had said that of the cell members who were based in Hamburg, only suicide pilots Mohamed Atta, Marwan Al-Shehhi and Ziad Samir Jarrah, along with and Ramzi Binalshibh, knew of the plan for the hijackings.\n\nRuehle said in court that he believed the unnamed witness was Binalshibh, a citizen of Yemen who was arrested in Pakistan on the first anniversary of the attacks, and is believed by investigators to have been one of the plot's central planners. Binalshibh is being held at a secret location by U.S. authorities.\n\nThe decision by the panel of five judges in Hamburg will increase pressure on the United States to release Binalshibh's interrogation transcripts so that his credibility can be assessed. If his statement were found to lack credibility, the court might ignore it and move to convict Mzoudi. Without such disclosure, the court could dismiss the cases against Mzoudi and Motassadeq solely on the strength of the police statement, lawyers said.\n\nThe judge said that because the court had no opportunity to question Binalshibh or review transcripts of his interrogations, it had no way to know how believable he is.\n\nUnder German law, authorities who become aware of potentially exculpatory evidence are required to report it to the court.\n\nProsecutors argued successfully in the Motassadeq case that the defendant knew what Atta and other members of the Hamburg cell were planning and willingly assisted them by transferring money to the United States and providing other services. Both Mzoudi and Motassadeq maintain that whatever help they gave was unwitting.\n\nThe three pilots and Binalshibh \"did not speak with others at any time about 'actual operations or creating a terrorist cell' for furthering the jihad,\" read the faxed statement from the Bundeskriminalamt, the German equivalent of the FBI.\n\nMotassadeq's attorney said in an interview that he would immediately petition the court to release his client because the information also appeared to exonerate Motassadeq, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison.\n\n\"I think the Germans will have to offer him a major apology and that he will be able to stay here,\" said the attorney, Josef Graessle-Muenscher, referring to statements by the government that Motassadeq would be deported to Morocco when he completed his sentence. \"The Americans should consider what they have caused. Statements they kept secret led to a guilty verdict.\"\n\nA short man with a thick beard and a receding hairline, Mzoudi was present in court Thursday when the decision was announced. He first appeared dumbfounded, as if he did not understand what had been said. He asked his attorneys and interpreter, \"Am I a free man now?\" according to one defense attorney. \"Mr. Mzoudi, you can go home now,\" Michael Rosenthal told his now-smiling client.\n\nAfter leaving the courtroom, Mzoudi immediately fell to his knees and prayed, Rosenthal said. \"He is still shocked, and we had to explain to him it's not finished,\" Rosenthal added.\n\nThe court's decision infuriated prosecutors. Lead prosecutor Walter Hemberger also said that the unidentified witness could only be Binalshibh and that any evidence from him was probably an attempt to protect others. The federal police's fax did note that the witness had provided contradictory information in the past and that those who went to al Qaeda training camps were taught how to behave if arrested and interrogated.\n\nU.S. officials have turned over selected summaries of Binalshibh's interrogation to the Germans with the understanding that they would not be used in court, German officials said. Because the summaries themselves have not been provided to the court, just a brief communication about them, the German government has kept its side of the bargain.\n\nBoth sides in the trial have been pressing for access to the full material, however. Two weeks ago, German prosecutors asked the court for a delay before ending the evidentiary part of the trial to see if they could produce some of the transcripts. But U.S. officials said in recent interviews that they would continue to refuse such access for the court, citing national security concerns. And in letters to the court Thursday, the office of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and the Interior Ministry said the transcripts would remain secret.\n\nAn attorney for American co-plaintiffs in the case, relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, said he believed the prosecution's case was now doomed. \"We assume that the trial against Mzoudi will . . . end in an acquittal,\" said Andreas Schulz, a Berlin lawyer hired by a number of relatives to represent their interests in the trial. \"Motassadeq will probably be freed.\" Schulz said he would appeal any such decisions.\n\nA Frenchman facing terrorism charges in U.S. District Court in Alexandria is also demanding access to statements made by key al Qaeda detainees, including Binalshibh, arguing like Mzoudi and Motassadeq that the statements could exonerate him. The issue of access to the witnesses has stalled the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, who was charged in December 2001 with conspiring with al Qaeda in the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - In 1872, the U.S. government enacted a law to prevent \"sailor mongering\" - the practice of luring sailors from their ships with liquor and prostitutes. Some 131 years later, the U.S. Justice Department is using the law to prosecute the environmental organization Greenpeace for boarding a ship and unfurling a banner to protest the Bush administration.\n\nThe indictment centers on an April 2002 protest in which two Greenpeace activists climbed aboard a commercial ship several miles off the coast of Florida.\n\nThe activists believed the ship carried a shipment of mahogany illegally exported from Brazil's Amazon rainforest and once aboard they unfurled a banner that said \"President Bush, Stop Illegal Logging.\"\n\nThis kind of protest has been a signature of Greenpeace for more than three decades and the activists expected to be arrested and charged.\n\nThe individuals involved in the protest settled charges against them last year, but the Justice Department filed criminal charges against the entire organization in July 2003 under the 1872 law.\n\nBush administration lawyers say the charges are not severe enough to warrant a jury trial and a federal judge in Miami is set to hear the case. Possible penalties under the law are unclear - the law has only been used twice and the last time was in 1890.\n\nBut Greenpeace fears it could lose its tax exempt status, a potentially crippling blow to the organization's U.S. activities, and says the use of the \"sailor mongering\" law reflects a political vendetta by the Bush administration.\n\nThe administration is trying to \"muzzle a group that frequently, publicly and effectively protests the Bush administration's policies,\" said John Passacantando, executive director of Greenpeace USA.\n\nThe indictment is the first time a non governmental organization has been charged for free speech activities of its members and environmentalists are not the only ones worried about the possible implications.\n\nJulian Bond, a longtime civil rights activist and chairman of the board of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, called the case a \"government assault on time honored civil disobedience as practiced by Martin Luther King and thousand of other Americans.\"\n\n\"If John Ashcroft had done this in the 1960s, black Americans would not be voting today, eating at formerly all white lunch counters or sitting on bus fronts,\" Bond told reporters at a press briefing today.\n\nNot since the Nixon administration \"has contempt for political activists so clearly guided the heavy hand of the state,\" said Robert Musil, executive director and CEO of Physicians for Social Responsibility.\n\nThe indictment is a clear attack on the U.S. Constitution, according to Ralph Neas, president of People For the American Way Foundation, a 600,000 member civil liberties organization.\n\n\"This is a threat to all Americans, not just Greenpeace,\" said Neas. \"Permitting the selective prosecution of a group like Greenpeace merely because the government disagrees with its point of view would set a devastating precedent.\"\n\nThe right to disagree with the government is a cornerstone of American democracy, Neas said, and \"it is profoundly patriotic to engage in peaceful dissent when you think the government is wrong.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has a policy not to comment on pending cases, but its position on the specifics of the case could become clearer in the next few days.\n\nA federal judge will hear arguments Friday regarding several motions filed by Greenpeace, including one to dismiss the case and another to find the Justice Department is engaged in improper selective prosecution, which is prohibited by federal law.\n\nOther organizations have not faced similar prosecution, according to Greenpeace. It notes that a Cuban American pro democracy group held a protest in federal waters near Miami - the activists were charged, but the organization was not.\n\nThe environmental group has also filed motions to hold a jury trial if the case is not dismissed and to compel the government to turn over evidence that may support Greenpeace's claim the ship was carrying mahogany.\n\nPassacantando notes that the Justice Department revised its original indictment last month to remove language that asserted Greenpeace was mistaken in its belief that the ship carried Brazilian mahogany.\n\n\"Instead of indicting Greenpeace for blowing the whistle on illegal smuggling, our government should be intercepting the contraband and prosecuting the smugglers,\" Passacantando said. \"The law under which we are being charged is so archaic that we can only conclude that the Justice Department dredged it up to shut us down.\"\n\nIt is illegal to import mahogany into the United States that has been illegally exported under U.S. law and the international treaty known as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna.\n\nBrazil has had a moratorium on exporting mahogany since October 2001, but the demand in the U.S. market has prompted a flood of illegal exports.\n\nIn 2000, the United States received more than 70 percent of Brazil's mahogany exports and the administration has not had much success stemming the tide.\n\nGreenpeace says this is because the Bush administration has little desire to enforce the law - the organization has evidence the ship its activists boarded in April 2002 offloaded 70 tons of mahogany in South Carolina.\n\nThere is little doubt that Greenpeace has been a thorn in the side of the Bush administration - activists with the organization unfurled a banner at Bush's Texas ranch several months before he took office that read \"Bush the Toxic Texan, Don't Mess With Earth.\"\n\nThis past summer a Greenpeace vessel traveled up and down the Alaska coastline protesting the Bush forest policies and last month activists were arrested in Washington DC for protests against the administration's plans to relax a rule protecting roadless areas of national forests and allow logging in the Tongass National Forest.\n\n--------\nIraqi Protesters Oust Appointed Governor\nDemonstrators Defy U.S. Occupation With Demand for an Election\n\nAfter three days and nights of continuous protests, Witwit did just that. But the demonstrators have refused to budge.\n\nAs soon as Witwit resigned, the local representative of the U.S. occupation authority appointed a former Iraqi air force officer as acting governor. To the protesters, that was unacceptable. The new governor, they insisted, should be chosen not by an American but by Iraqis -- through an election.\n\n\"Yes, yes for elections!\" shouted the protesters, a collection of students, clerics and middle-aged professionals whose ranks swelled to more than 1,000 on Thursday. \"No, no to appointment!\"\n\nThe protesters have pledged to continue their sit-in outside the governor's office -- they have erected tents and dug latrines -- until their demand is met. Leaders of Hilla's largest labor unions have vowed to hold a general strike starting Saturday in support of elections.\n\nLocal leaders described the passionate but peaceful demonstration in this predominantly Shiite Muslim city as a preview of what U.S. occupiers will face if they follow through with a plan to select a provisional Iraqi government through regional caucuses instead of general elections. Although elections have become an increasingly popular rallying cry in Shiite-dominated central and southern Iraq, the protest here is the first indication that mainstream Shiites are willing to take to the streets to press the issue, adding a volatile new element to the country's impending political transition.\n\n\"It's been peaceful in Hilla until now, but if the coalition forces keep refusing what the people want, it will become a big problem that they will not be able to control,\" said Mohammed Kiflawi Abboud, chairman of the council that governs Hilla province. \"Everyone will oppose the Americans.\"\n\nProtest leaders said they have been energized by recent statements from Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, Iraq's most influential Shiite leader, calling for the provisional government to be elected. Sistani has rejected the Bush administration's plan to select a national assembly through caucuses in each of the country's 18 provinces, saying it does not give Iraqis enough of a role in the transition.\n\nWhile Sistani does not appear to have weighed in on the subject of Witwit's replacement, his pronouncements on the overall political transition have been interpreted in Hilla as a license to engage in civil disobedience.\n\n\"Ayatollah Sistani has called for elections,\" said Hussein Abdelrazzak Mehdi, a high school teacher and seminary student who was one of the protest organizers. \"We want to ensure his words are followed.\"\n\nSince Sistani voiced his opposition to the American transition plan, members of Iraq's U.S.-appointed Governing Council have been considering ways to amend the caucus system.\n\nOver the past two weeks, other Shiite leaders and even several influential Sunni Muslims -- a rival minority that had long ruled Iraq -- have urged the Governing Council to call for elections. But the council has been reluctant to do so, largely because of pressure from the Bush administration and because members believe caucuses are the best way to protect their own political interests. Some members even want the council, which U.S. officials are seeking to dissolve on June 30, to remain as a second legislative body in the provisional government.\n\nHoping to find a middle ground that will protect the interests of the council and the Bush administration while still appeasing Shiites, several members are advocating another round of caucuses to reconstitute some local and provincial councils. \"We recognize there are problems with some of the local councils, and we think some limited elections can address this issue,\" one council member said.\n\nBut if Hilla, a city of about 500,000 people about 60 miles south of Baghdad, is any indication, that approach will not fly. People here, from professors to roadside vendors, say elections are the only legitimate way to choose their governor and a provisional government.\n\n\"President George Bush promised us democracy\" said Kadhim Abbas, the owner of a carpet factory, who brought three dozen employees -- women in head-to-toe black veils -- to the protest. \"How can you have democracy without elections?\"\n\nAlthough they would have significant influence over the process, many members of Hilla's provincial council also said they objected to the caucuses, raising doubts about whether the Americans will be able to find willing local partners to back their transition plan.\n\nIbrahim said the council favors holding elections to select a new governor and to pick representatives for the transitional assembly. \"I can't understand why the Americans don't want elections,\" he said. \"We deserve to have them.\"\n\nThe Bush administration has resisted elections, contending that the absence of voter rolls and an electoral law would make a nationwide ballot time-consuming. Officials also argue that a hasty election would be vulnerable to violence and manipulation by religious militants and loyalists of former president Saddam Hussein.\n\nIbrahim and other members of the Hilla council insist a national database that is used to distribute monthly food rations could serve as a voter roll, enabling occupation authorities to hold a quick ballot. \"It would be very easy to hold elections,\" said Hamid Ibrahim Awadi, a lawyer and council member. \"We could do it right away.\"\n\nThe 22-member provincial council, comprising representatives from professional associations and community organizations, is only an advisory body. Power over the police and other government institutions rests with the governor, who rules at the behest of the occupation authority.\n\nA day before Witwit resigned, a commission purging Baath Party members from government ordered his dismissal. Council members said they discovered documents linking him to Hussein's intelligence service. He also had been criticized for appointing two of his brothers and several other relatives to top posts in the provincial government.\n\nHis replacement, Emad Lefteh, insisted there would be no way to hold elections right away. Sitting behind the governor's desk with aides at his side, he said the occupation authority \"should not bend to a few people protesting outside.\"\n\n\"If we have elections now, our enemies, the terrorists and the extremists, will take advantage of the situation,\" he said.\n\nAn official with the occupation authority in Hilla said Lefteh had proven himself to be an effective administrator in his previous job as mayor of Hilla. \"That's what this province needs,\" the official said.\n\nThe official ruled out holding elections. \"I'm not going to compromise on security, and we do not respond to mobs,\" the official said.\n\nAs the afternoon wore on, the protesters prayed, ate lunch out of large metal vats and brought in an interpreter. Using a megaphone, he addressed a dozen American and Polish soldiers standing guard on the roof of the governor's office.\n\n\"Coalition forces, don't be worried,\" he said in English. \"We are here in peace. All we want is democracy.\"\n\n\"That's what they promised us,\" Jabbar Zaid, a university student, said after the interpreter finished. \"All we want is what they promised.\""

The efficiency is of a comparable level to real plants used in the biomass energy source.\n\nThe reaction rate is completely proportional to the light power due to the low energy loss with simple structure; in other words, the system can respond to focused light. This will make it possible to realise a simple and compact system for capturing and converting wasted carbon dioxide from incinerators and electric generation plants.\n\nCarbon dioxide is one of the substances responsible for greenhouse effect and as such, efforts are being made to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide worldwide. The problem of carbon dioxide is also directly connected to an issue of the depletion of fossil fuels.\n\nArtificial photosynthesis is the direct conversion from carbon dioxide into organic materials, which would be able to solve both of these problems, according to Panasonic."

      "text": "There are pros and cons to both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic strategies. One way to get the best of both worlds is to use aqueous-organic biphasic catalysis. This approach hasn't been widely utilised so far due to interfacial resistance between the phases which causes a low catalytic activity.\n\nResearchers in China have overcome this by using tannins from Black Wattle (an acacia tree species). The tannins \"amphiphilicly\" stabilise catalytic palladium nanoparticles enabling them to catalyse reactions in the organic phase whilst remaining in the aqueous phase for subsequent re-use, without loss of activity.\n\nResearchers from Belgium have developed a self-cleaning coating for oven windows. Of the available self-cleaning coatings, only a couple are optically transparent at working domestic oven temperatures and these require at least 3 hours of heating. Using manganese and manganese-ceria oxide coatings, the team of researchers discovered that an organic lipid contaminant could be oxidised within one hour to leave transparent, contaminant-free glass.\n\nCarbon dioxide is a problem. As a greenhouse gas it contributes towards global warming, and its ever-growing concentrations in the atmosphere are cited as a cause of anthropomorphic climate change. But now a team of researchers from the University of Bath have opened up the idea of using carbon dioxide as a useful potential feedstock; a useful chemical resource rather than a troublesome waste product.\n\nDavide Mattia, who leads the research team, has taken inspiration from the well-known Fischer-Tropsh process, which uses an iron catalyst to react hydrogen with carbon monoxide, producing a mixture of alkanes that can be used as fuel. Mattia's catalyst, which works with both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, is also iron based, taking the form of iron nanoparticles embedded on carbon nanotubes. It has a rather unique method of preparation, which is not only simpler to carry out, but results in a more effective catalyst.\n\nJames Wiswall and his colleagues, working with Professor Margaret Wooldridge at the University of Michigan, USA, have been studying catalytic propane combustion. This reaction has important implications for areas such as power generation (for example, integration of catalysts directly into the internal combustion engine combustion chamber) and removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from emissions.\n\nThe group used a stagnation-point flow reactor to study the catalytic activity of platinum, palladium, tin dioxide and 90 wt% SnO2–10 wt% Pt for the combustion of propane under a variety of reaction conditions. Preliminary results suggest that the 90 wt% SnO2–10 wt% Pt catalyst provides significant activity and has similar trends in activity as a function of stagnation-plane temperature to those of Pt and Pd, whereas pure SnO2 shows no activity.\n\nThe researchers are optimistic that even better activity could be obtained if optimisation studies are carried out.\n\nThis development shows potential for Pt/SnO2 to be used as a fuel oxidation catalyst. For more detail, read the full article:Produced at any combustion site, nitrogen oxides (a mixture of NO and NO2) – common greenhouse gases – are found anywhere from industrial sites to car exhausts and are regulated by a number of international agencies. As such, several catalytic reactions can be used to reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides produced. One of the most common is selective catalytic reduction (SCR), which converts nitrogen oxides into N2 and H­2O using a reducing agent, commonly ammonia, and a catalyst.\n\nCatalytic reactions are used to reduce nitrogen oxides (a mixture of NO and NO2 – common greenhouse gases) on industrial sites\n\nFor more information about Catalysis Science & Technology, including how to submit your research, check out the journal homepage.\n\n*The Immediacy Index is a measure of how topical and urgent work published in a scientific journal is.

One revolutionary concept being pursued by a team of researchers in New Zealand involves creating \"wearable energy harvesters\" capable of converting movement from humans or found in nature into battery power.\n\n\"Imagine soft generators that produce energy by flexing and stretching as they ride ocean waves or sway in the breeze like a tree,\" says Thomas McKay, a Ph.D. candidate working on soft generator research at the Biomimetics Lab. \"We've developed a low-cost power generator with an unprecedented combination of softness, flexibility, and low mass. These characteristics provide an opportunity to harvest energy from environmental sources with much greater simplicity than previously possible.\"\n\nThis image shows a hand-pumped soft generator the researchers are using to demonstrate it.\n\nCredit: N/A\n\n\"Our team eliminated the need for this external circuitry by integrating flexible electronics—dielectric elastomer switches—directly onto the artificial muscles themselves. One of the most exciting features of the generator is that it's so simple; it simply consists of rubber membranes and carbon grease mounted in a frame,\" McKay explains.\n\nMcKay and his colleagues at the Biomimetics Lab are working to create soft dexterous machines that comfortably interface with living creatures and nature in general. The soft generator is another step toward fully soft devices; it could potentially be unnoticeably incorporated into clothing and harvest electricity from human movement. When this happens, worrying about the battery powering your cell phone or other portable electronics dying on you will become a thing of the past. And as an added bonus, this should help keep batteries out of landfills.\n\nDielectric elastomers, often referred to as artificial muscles, are stretchy materials that are capable of producing energy when deformed. In the past, artificial muscle generators required bulky, rigid, and expensive external electronics"

Massive integration of wind power to the electric grid will take breakthroughs in energy storage technologies.\n\nBy John Roach, Contributing Writer, NBC News\n\nBreakthroughs in energy storage technologies are on the horizon that could turn vast swathes of the world's sun-soaked deserts and windy plains into sources of clean, renewable energy, according to experts focused on our energy future.\n\nNo one technology — ranging from storing a portion of the sun's energy collected during the day in molten salt to run solar thermal generators at night to banks of lithium-ion batteries scattered around neighborhoods — will be the solution.\n\nRather, \"there is going to be a portfolio of energy storage\" options, Bruce Dunn, a professor of materials science and engineering at the University of California at Los Angeles, told me Thursday.\n\nDunn is the lead author of a review paper in this week's issue of the journal Science that explores the prospects for three battery technologies to become cheap, reliable and efficient enough for wide-scale deployment on the electric power grid.\n\nBattery breakthroughs Lithium-ion battery technology, for example, is enjoying a boost in research and development for the electrical vehicle market that is driving down manufacturing costs. Utilities will piggyback on those improvements and may even be able to use EVs to store excess wind and solar energy, he noted.\n\nOther technologies such as redox-flow batteries are relatively new and unproven. \"On paper it looks to be very inexpensive,\" he said, but there's very little experience using them at the scale utilities need.\n\nThe batteries are based on the use of liquid electrolytes stored in tanks and pumped through a reactor to produce energy.\n\nAs it stands now, there's plenty known about how the batteries work on the small scale, but not much about how they work on large scale. Will they maintain the right power levels? Will there be corrosion problems?\n\nAnswers to such questions should start to come within three or four years with preliminary results from demonstration projects supported by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy and the Department of Energy.\n\n\"It's an experiential thing, there's no way around it. You've got to build big stuff,\" Dunn said. \"And those things are built and they are being tested. That's the good news.\"\n\nSodium-sulfur batteries, the third technology in the Science review, are already in limited use by utilities around the world, including Japan where they are sold commercially, but the technology is costly, Dunn said. Manufacturing prices have to fall before they can be embraced.\n\nIn time, he said, prices will fall, just as they have for technologies such as personal computers. And as prices for big, utility-scale batteries fall, they'll be incorporated onto the electric grid, allowing the integration of renewable sources of power such as wind and solar.\n\nThe use of batteries on the grid will also reduce the need to construct generation capacity that sits idle most of the time but puts off excess emissions of greenhouse gases as they are cycled up and down to meet peak demands, the researchers note.\n\nHydrogen storage Another way to store energy is in the form of hydrogen, which has long been eyed for the fuel cells that some believe will power most cars in the future. A hurdle is how to cheaply and efficiently get hydrogen, which is abundant but almost always bound to something else.\n\nOne solution may come from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who are working on so-called artificial leaf technology that splits water into bubbles of oxygen and hydrogen. The hydrogen can be stored and used to power fuel cells.\n\nQuestions remain about how efficient the system is and how inexpensively they can generate hydrogen, notes Robert Service in a news story about the technology in Science.\n\nOne study, he noted, found that hydrogen can be produced from natural gas about half as cheaply using a mature technology called steam reforming than the best-case scenarios envisioned for the artificial leaf technologies.\n\n\"That's not saying artificial photosynthesis isn't worth pursuing – only that fossil fuels are the leading energy source for a reason and they won't be easy to dethrone,\" he writes.\n\nMore bang for the fossil fuel buck Eric Wachsman, a sustainable energy researcher at the University of Maryland, argues that technological improvements are making fuel cells that run on all types of fuels, including conventional fuels such as gasoline, in addition to hydrogen, a viable option everywhere from power grids to transportation.\n\nIn separate Science review article, he explains that the breakthrough comes from new electrolyte materials that allow solid oxide fuel cells to be operated at lower temperatures.\n\nSolid oxide fuel cells such as Bloom Energy's device that was rolled out last year, he told me, have a power density of about 0.2 watts per square centimeter while operating at about 950 degrees Celsius. His team has developed a solid oxide fuel cell that gets 2 watts per square centimeter at 650 degrees Celsius.\n\n\"It is an order of magnitude higher power density at a much lower temperature,\" he said, adding that his team has also developed electrolytes that make operation at 350 degrees Celsius viable.\n\nAnd if solid oxide fuel cells can operate at lower temperatures, they become attractive for use in transportation where using a fuel cell to power a car is two and a half to three times more efficient than using fuel to run an internal combustion engine, he noted.\n\nWachsman is hoping the government will continue to support research in solid oxide fuel cell technology to help bring down the costs and scale up the technology, though noted the prospects are grim.\n\n\"There is no funding for solid oxide fuel cells in the current DOE budget,\" he said.\n\nThe dearth of government funding for energy innovation is taken up by Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, in a Science editorial that plugs his call to increase R&D spending from $5 billion to $16 billion a year.\n\n\"History has repeatedly proven that federal investments in research return huge payoffs with incredible associated benefits for U.S. industries and the economy,\" he writes. \"Yet over the past three decades, U.S. government investment in energy innovation has dropped by more than 75 percent.\"\n\nWithout further government investment, will the needed breakthroughs in energy storage remain on the horizon?A reporter photographs an installation of \"Bloom Box\" energy servers at eBay's headquarters in San Jose, Calif., during the unveiling of the fuel-cell system in February. Other ventures are getting into the fuel-cell field as well.\n\nAn electricity-generating fuel-cell system known as the Bloom Box sparked a huge buzz in the energy debate six months ago - and since then, still more ventures have surfaced to promise better living through chemistry. Will future fuel cells make good on those promises? We should know in the next couple of years.\n\nOne of the concepts, detailed today at an American Chemical Society meeting in Boston, combines the environmental friendliness of solar power with the 24/7 capability of fuel-cell generation. When the sun shines, electricity from solar panels would feed into a personal power grid, and also split water into hydrogen and oxygen. When the sun isn't out, the hydrogen and oxygen can be recombined to keep the electricity flowing, producing pure water in the process.\n\n\"Our goal is to make each home its own power system,\" Daniel Nocera, a chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, explained in a news release discussing the system. \"We're working toward development of 'personalized' energy units that can be manufactured, distributed and installed inexpensively. There certainly are major obstacles to be overcome - existing fuel cells and solar cells must be improved, for instance. Nevertheless, one can envision villages in India and Africa not long from now purchasing an affordable basic system.\"\n\nNocera and his colleagues started out with the water-splitting side of the equation. They found a more efficient way to convert H2O into hydrogen and oxygen, using relatively inexpensive catalysts that contain cobalt and nickel. And it doesn't need to be pure H2O. \"Owing to the self-healing properties of the catalysts, these electrolyzers can use any water source,\" including seawater, waste water or water from the Charles River in Boston, the researchers say.\n\nThey contend that their system eliminates the need for expensive platinum catalysts - which would make the economics of fuel cells much more attractive. Prototype water-splitting systems have been built at a cost of $30 each, operating at power levels of 100 watts. The ACS news release says the catalytic system has been licensed to Sun Catalytix, an MIT commercial spin-off, and the venture aims to make super-efficient electrolyzers available for homes and small businesses within two years.\n\nPatrick Gillooly / MIT\n\nA new catalyst could help speed development of inexpensive home-brewed solar energy systems for powering homes and plug-in cars during the day (left) and for producing electricity from a fuel cell at night (right).\n\nAs Nocera noted, the big issues surrounding this system have to do with the costs for the other components: Putting solar panels on your home could cost tens of thousands of dollars, although government subsidies can reduce the price dramatically. In order to get Nocera's make-it-yourself electricity system out to villages in the developing world, the devices to turn the hydrogen into energy would also have to become cheaper and more efficient.\n\nThe Bloom Box is just one of the devices that has generated excitement among energy experts. It's generated electricity as well, in pilot projects at places ranging from eBay to Safeway. Bloom Energy's 100-kilowatt \"server\" converts natural gas and air into electricity, producing water and carbon dioxide in the process (CH4+2O2 is turned into 2H2O+CO2).\n\nThere are still a couple of worrisome factors about that equation, however: First, the Bloom Box is powered by natural gas. The energy conversion factor (50 percent efficiency or better) compares with the best rates for gas-fired power plants, but it's still a fossil fuel. There are still carbon dioxide emissions as well, although the carbon footprint is not as great as it would be for a gas-fired plant.\n\nWyoming-based NDCPower is working on a different approach: It's developing fuel cells that could take in biofuels - say, ethanol, methanol, butanol or even biodiesel that's converted to alcohol - and produce chemicals with industrial applications on the other side, along with the electricity.\n\n\"Our technology is the only existing technology that allows you to take a carbon-based fuel and make energy, and produce no CO2,\" the company's president and chief executive officer, Don Montgomery, told me during a recent sitdown.\n\nThe byproducts could range from acetic acid (which is used to make plastics and currently costs $400 a ton or more) to formic acid (a silage preservative that's even more expensive). Montgomery figures that the sale of chemicals produced by the NDCPower fuel cells, plus the no-CO2 angle, could win them some extra attention in the developing fuel-cell marketplace.\n\nThe key is in the chemicals used to make the fuel conversion - a recipe that Montgomery and his colleagues aren't talking publicly about, except in the broadest terms. \"You basically take your ethanol and pour it into Dran-O,\" he joked. Dan Buttry, a chemistry professor at Arizona State University who also serves as NDCPower's chief technology officer, would say only that the secret ingredient is \"not platinum.\"\n\nButtry also told me that the NDCPower fuel cell doesn't need a membrane - which is a plus, because in most fuel cells, the membrane \"is a pretty big component of the cost.\"\n\nRight now, NDCPower's main business is providing military-grade power systems to the, um, U.S. military. But the company is aiming to make its mark in the civilian power market as well. And that market is just getting revved up. \"The development curve has been like stepping on a rocket ship,\" Montgomery told me.\n\nFuel-cell technology isn't quite ready to reach orbit yet, and there are some big questions yet to be answered: Will the increased efficiency make up for the higher cost of fuel-cell devices? What's the right scale for fuel cells? Will we want to have a fuel cell in every garage (or in every hand, or every pacemaker), or does it make more sense to have big fuel-cell \"servers\" in office buildings or next-generation power plants? What'll it take to get to the vision of a \"power plant in every home,\" as sketched out today by MIT's Nocera. You tell me,"

      "text": "Solar cell directly splits water for hydrogen\n\nFeb 18, 2008\n\nPlants trees and algae do it. Even some bacteria and moss do it, but scientists have had a difficult time developing methods to turn sunlight into useful fuel. Now, Penn State researchers have a proof-of-concept device that can split water and produce recoverable hydrogen.\n\n\"This is a proof-of-concept system that is very inefficient. But ultimately, catalytic systems with 10 to 15 percent solar conversion efficiency might be achievable,\" says Thomas E. Mallouk, the DuPont Professor of Materials Chemistry and Physics. \"If this could be realized, water photolysis would provide a clean source of hydrogen fuel from water and sunlight.\"\n\nAlthough solar cells can now produce electricity from visible light at efficiencies of greater than 10 percent, solar hydrogen cells – like those developed by Craig Grimes, professor of electrical engineering at Penn State – have been limited by the poor spectral response of the semiconductors used. In principle, molecular light absorbers can use more of the visible spectrum in a process that is mimetic of natural photosynthesis. Photosynthesis uses chlorophyll and other dye molecules to absorb visible light.\n\nSo far, experiments with natural and synthetic dye molecules have produced either hydrogen or oxygen-using chemicals consumed in the process, but have not yet created an ongoing, continuous process. Those processes also generally would cost more than splitting water with electricity. One reason for the difficulty is that once produced, hydrogen and oxygen easily recombine. The catalysts that have been used to study the oxygen and hydrogen half-reactions are also good catalysts for the recombination reaction.\n\nMallouk and W. Justin Youngblood, postdoctoral fellow in chemistry, together with collaborators at Arizona State University, developed a catalyst system that, combined with a dye, can mimic the electron transfer and water oxidation processes that occur in plants during photosynthesis. They reported the results of their experiments at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science today in Boston.\n\nThe key to their process is a tiny complex of molecules with a center catalyst of iridium oxide molecules surrounded by orange-red dye molecules. These clusters are about 2 nanometers in diameter with the catalyst and dye components approximately the same size. The researchers chose orange-red dye because it absorbs sunlight in the blue range, which has the most energy. The dye used has also been thoroughly studied in previous artificial photosynthesis experiments.\n\nThey space the dye molecules around the center core leaving surface area on the catalyst for the reaction. When visible light strikes the dye, the energy excites electrons in the dye, which, with the help of the catalyst, can split the water molecule, creating free oxygen.\n\n\"Each surface iridium atom can cycle through the water oxidation reaction about 50 times per second,\" says Mallouk. \"That is about three orders of magnitude faster than the next best synthetic catalysts, and comparable to the turnover rate of Photosystem II in green plant photosynthesis.\" Photosystem II is the protein complex in plants that oxidizes water and starts the photosynthetic process.\n\nThe researchers impregnated a titanium dioxide electrode with the catalyst complex for the anode and used a platinum cathode. They immersed the electrodes in a salt solution, but separated them from each other to avoid the problem of the hydrogen and oxygen recombining. Light need only shine on the dye-sensitized titanium dioxide anode for the system to work. This type of cell is similar to those that produce electricity, but the addition of the catalyst allows the reaction to split the water into its component gases.\n\nThe water splitting requires 1.23 volts, and the current experimental configuration cannot quite achieve that level so the researchers add about 0.3 volts from an outside source. Their current system achieves an efficiency of about 0.3 percent.\n\n\"Nature is only 1 to 3 percent efficient with photosynthesis,\" says Mallouk. \"Which is why you can not expect the clippings from your lawn to power your house and your car. We would like not to have to use all the land area that is used for agriculture to get the energy we need from solar cells.\"\n\nThe researchers have a variety of approaches to improve the process. They plan to investigate improving the efficiency of the dye, improving the catalyst and adjusting the general geometry of the system. Rather than spherical dye catalyst complexes, a different geometry that keeps more of the reacting area available to the sun and the reactants might be better. Improvements to the overall geometry may also help.\n\n\"At every branch in the process, there is a choice,\" says Mallouk. \"The question is how to get the electrons to stay in the proper path and not, for example, release their energy and go down to ground state without doing any work.\"\n\nThe distance between molecules is important in controlling the rate of electron transfer and getting the electrons where they need to go. By shortening some of the distances and making others longer, more of the electrons would take the proper path and put their energy to work splitting water and producing hydrogen.\n\nRelevant PhysicsForums posts\n\nRelated Stories\n\nPanasonic has developed an artificial photosynthesis system which converts carbon dioxide (CO2) to organic materials by illuminating with sunlight at a world's top efficiency of 0.2%.

I think a machine could certainly do better than that, and with the added bonus of not producing the greenhouse hydrocarbons which absorb excess sunlight in the atmosphere.\n\nSo 95% of the incident sunlight is absorbed by the chlorophyl, but only 3.15% of that absorbed light energy goes into sugar production?\n\nI think that the 95% figure is plain wrong. A plant that absorbed 95% of the sunlight would be black, not green.\n\nThe plants has no reason to be more efficient than about 1-3percent, and usually it is closer to 1%. The reason is that the limited factor in nature is almost always something else than sunlight, like nutrients, water, space etc. There is in most cases no reason to be much more efficient than that.\n\nI understand that 90% of the light energy gets converted to chemical energy (ATP and NMTPH) but the total amount of energy in the fixed carbon to total amount of energy in the incident sunlite is something like 6%"

      "text": "The nonproprietary research underway at OSU's Institute for Materials Research could lead to lighter weight vehicles, but building a more sustainable car is about more than just fuel efficiency, said Glenn Daehn, a professor in OSU's Department of Materials Science and Engineering.\n\nWhile about one-third of American energy is used in homes and offices, and another third is used in transportation, the final third is consumed in industrial processes, Daehn said. Looking for more sustainable processes within that final third, Honda and OSU began years ago to study how to reduce the amount of energy used to apply paint to an automobile.\n\n\"Turns out, if you are a little smarter about how you control the temperature and humidity, you can pay massive energy benefits. This is the type of thing that is not very visible, but very, very powerful,\" Daehn said.\n\nToday, the University and Honda — with support from Alcoa — are working on ways to join different types of metals, allowing manufacturers to use lighter metals and therefore reduce the overall mass of a vehicle. Again, the benefit is not only a lighter weight vehicle but also reduced energy required to weld the metals together.\n\nThe research is led by Daehn and Anthony Luscher, who are studying how to use a decades-old process called high-velocity deformation to join different types of metal, allowing lighter metals to be used in vehicles.\n\n\"Possibly, if you do it right, you can make a vehicle that you can disassemble at the end of its life and then effectively recycle the components,\" Daehn said. \"Not only would you have a vehicle that burns less fuel, but it actually takes less energy to make it and when you are done with it, you can harvest those parts and actually get a great lifecycle of sustainability in the whole process.\"\n\nA little more than a year ago, the Alcoa Foundation began to support the long-standing partnership between OSU and Honda. Through the 25-year-old Honda Partnership, researchers at Ohio State's College of Engineering have access to an endowment that generates $1.5 million a year for research into ways to make vehicles more sustainable, both in the manufacturing process and throughout the life of the car.\n\nAlcoa's commitment to this particular project is newer, but the company shares the partnership's ideals to reduce vehicle mass, make more sustainable vehicles affordable and reduce distance in the supply chain, Daehn said.\n\nThrough its Advancing Sustainability Research program, the Alcoa Foundation has invested $4 million to support 10 research studies, including the work between Honda and OSU.\n\nThe research at OSU — like all the projects the ASR program is funding — is nonproprietary, meaning the industry as a whole can benefit as students, faculty and industry professionals work together to make processes more sustainable.\n\n\"By making it nonproprietary, it really opens up the doors and gives everybody the ability to collaborate without those restrictions or shackles that may go along with some proprietary conditions or not being able to disseminate freely the information across the parties,\" said Mario Greco, the marketing director of Ground Transportation for Alcoa. \"That is really one of the key elements of why this type of opportunity or relationship is so valuable to everybody, particularly to the students.\"\n\nHonda's investment in research at OSU remains strong after a quarter of a century; the company installed a $1 million driving simulator at the university just this month to study ways to reduce distracted driving.\n\nHonda also collaborates with OSU in the Mobility Innovation Exchange (MIX) program, which puts scientists and engineers from the auto manufacturer together with university faculty and students to work on projects that may give Honda a competitive advantage. The teams work in the MIX lab on Ohio State's Engineering Campus or at the Honda campus in Raymond, Ohio, on innovations that Honda will own.\n\nEvery year, the researchers and president of OSU meet with the heads of research and manufacturing for Honda to review what the partnership has accomplished in the previous year and where its work will go in the coming year.\n\n\"This relationship is taken very seriously on both sides. It's really a great example of an unusual public-private partnership,\" Daehn said, and students who work in the Honda lab often go to work in a sustainability field, even if their employer is a different brand. \"We are developing processes and all these processes give you a deeper tool box for smart people to go out and develop more sustainable products,\" he added.\n\nHonda continues to make strides in its efforts to increase the sustainability of its operations, including collaborating on a pilot project with IBM and PG&E to demonstrate electric vehicle and smart grid communication, and using green logistics to reduce the transportation requirements needed to support its North American production"

      "text": "PARIS (AFP) — Think of an electric car that can accelerate swiftly to cruising speed, laptop computers that can recharge in a couple of minutes rather than hours and a generation of super-miniature mobile phones.\n\nThat's the vision sketched on Wednesday by a pair of scientists in the United States, unveiling an invention that they say could lead to a smaller, lighter and more power-packed lithium battery than anything available today.\n\nCurrent batteries made of lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) are good at storing large amounts of electricity but stumble at releasing it.\n\nThey are better at dispensing the power in a steady flow than at discharging it or gaining it in a sudden burst.\n\nAs a result, electric cars perform best when travelling along the motorway at a constant speed rather than when they are accelerating, and their batteries take hours to recharge when they run down.\n\nUntil now, the finger of blame has pointed at charged lithium atoms. These ions, along with electrons, move too sluggishly through the battery material before arriving at the terminal to deliver their charge -- or so it was thought.\n\nBut a pair of materials experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) say the problem lies not with the ions but rather at how the ions gain access to nano-scale tunnels that riddle the material and transport the electrons to their destination.\n\nTheir solution was a lithium phosphate coating that, like a system of feeder roads, nudges the ions towards the tunnels. The ions then zip instantly down the tunnel entrance and to the terminal.\n\nA small cellphone battery can be recharged in just 10 seconds thanks to the improved ion flow, they report in the British journal Nature.\n\nIn theory, a large battery that would be used to power a plug-in hybrid electric car could be recharged in just five minutes, compared to up to six or eight hours at present. But this would only be possible if a beefed-up electricity supply were available.\n\nUnlike other battery materials, the tweaked LiFePO4 does not degrade as much when repeatedly charged and recharged. This opens the way to smaller and lighter batteries, which will not need such heft to deliver the same power, MIT said in a press release.\n\nThe invention, which was supported by US government funds, has already been licensed by two companies, MIT said.\n\nBecause the material involved is not new -- the difference is the way it is made -- \"the work could make it into the marketplace within two to three years,\" it said.\n\nThe invention is the latest claimed advance in the quest to replace conventional electro-chemical batteries, which are heavy, lack energy density and take time to recharge.\n\nResearch in this field ranges from updated lithium-ion technology to hydrogen batteries and combinations of a battery with so-called ultracapacitors that harness exotic materials such as barium titanate to deliver a jolt."

HOME FUSION GENERATOR IS IN THE WORKS IF THEY CAN LICK THE PLASMA DENSITY PROBLEM.\n\nFusion breakthrough\n\nBy Mark Halper\n\nA plasma vortex forms inside an aneutronic fusion device and directly carries electrical current, without the need for turbines.\n\nA small New Jersey company has reported a big step toward cracking nuclear fusion, the elusive energy source that many people regard as the Holy Grail of power.\n\nLawrenceville Plasma Physics Inc. said it has confined a gas at 1.8 billion degrees C. Its previous highest temperature was 1.1 billion degrees C, which it hit last year and which it says had stood as a fusion industry record since 1978.\n\nAs hot as the earlier 1.1 billion degrees C might sound to you and me, it was too frigid to support LPP's \"aneutronic\" approach to fusion.\n\n\"The new work shatters those long-standing records, and, most importantly, achieves the temperature needed to burn aneutronic fuels,\" the Lawrenceville, N.J.-based startup says in a press release.\n\nUnlike today's nuclear fission, nuclear fusion combines atoms, rather than splits them apart. Many people regard it as a potentially safe, cheap, CO2-free source of power that does not pose serious nuclear waste problems the way uranium-based fission does. It does not use uranium. Rather, it tends to deploy different forms of hydrogen, among other fuels.\n\nThe \"aneutronic\" form of fusion would use common hydrogen, rather than the isotopes of hydrogen on which several other fusion projects rely. (\"Aneutronic\" means \"without neutrons\" - normal hydrogen has no neutrons in its nucleus, just a proton).\n\nIf perfected, aneutronic fusion could be the ultimate of the ultimate power source, because it generates electricity directly, without using a turbine. Other forms of fusion, as well as nuclear fission, generate heat that creates steam (sometimes another gas) that drives a turbine.\n\nBut aneutronic requires severely higher temperatures than other forms of fusion, which theoretically operate at around 100 million-to-150 million degrees C. (And then there's \"cold fusion\" which we'll save for a rainy day; feel free to comment below).\n\nFacing Fusion: LPP chief scientist Eric Lerner at work.\n\nLPP's 1.8 billion degrees in principle topples the temperature barrier. The accomplishment marks the second breakthrough of three that LPP says is necessary for it to commercialize fusion. LPP had already demonstrated that it can confine fuel long enough to burn it, at tens of nanoseconds.\n\nNow for its third and final trick: \"We are still far from having sufficient density in the tiny hot regions to get net energy, but that is our next goal,\" says Eric Lerner, LPP's chief scientist.\n\nLPP director of business development Derek Shannon told SmartPlanet that once it reaches sufficient densities, it will have also achieved a net balance of energy output to commercialize a fusion device. In over half a century of research and development, the fusion industry has not yet managed to achieve an economical \"gain\" of energy out compared to the energy required to produce fusion-based electricity.\n\nShannon said that LPP could commercialize its fusion device about four years after hitting the required density. It's not clear how long that might take.\n\n\"The LPP research team is currently upgrading their fusion device to achieve the higher densities required for net energy, a goal they hope to achieve soon,\" the press release states.\n\nTo reach 1.8 billion degrees C, the company is using a technology known as dense plasma force (DPF), which fires lighting-like magnetized plasma balls of fuel at each other in a compressed space.\n\nLPP is experimenting with a hydrogen isotope, called deuterium, which is one of the two isotopes that \"common\" (neutronic) fusion uses (the other is tritium). LPP's goal is to eventually use normal hydrogen and boron as its fuel.\n\nPart of its vision is to install small, garage-sized 5 megawatt fusion devices to provide neighborhood power.\n\nOther companies working on aneutronic fusion include Tri-Alpha Energy, a stealth startup in Irvine, Calif. Startup General Fusion of Burnaby, Canada, and Helion Energy of Redmond, Wash., are chasing \"neutronic\" fusion.\n\nBetween them and LPP, it's looking more likely than ever that fusion could hit the market within a decade or so - which is faster than the large, international government backed projects like ITER in France and the National Ignition Facility at California's Lawrence LIvermore National Laboratory will accomplish ________________________________________________________\n\nElectricity Generation and Propulsion Nuclear Fusion Reactor - Power Plant If aneutronic fuels are considered, products from fusion reaction are positively charged, which can be deflected by magnetic and electric fields. Fusion products at high specific impulse values, fusion reactor with a higher power/weight ratio, implie a propulsion about a million times more powerful than a chemical rocket.\n\nA conversion to electricity is relatively simple. The conversion is done during the neutralization by a positive electric voltage to slow down and an electron gun to neutralize. A positive electric field forces the positively charged products to exchange their kinetic energy into potential energy. The positively charged products easily attract electrons from an electron gun, and the electron gun extracts electrons from a positive terminal of a capacitor increasing its positive voltage, which increase its stored energy (E=½CV²). A switching-mode power supply sends this energy to a battery bank. The current of electrons and the electric voltage is equal to electric power (P = V × I). This method of electricity conversion can exceed 95% of efficiency.[8]"

      "text": "Jul 23, 2004\n\nAs temperatures soar this summer, so do electric bills. Researchers at the University of Houston are striving toward decreasing those costs with the next revolution in power generation.\nImagine a power source so small, yet so efficient, that it could make cumbersome power plants virtually obsolete while lowering your electric bill. A breakthrough in thin film solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is currently being refined in labs at the University of Houston, making that dream a reality.\n\nOriginating from research at UH's Texas Center for Superconductivity and Advanced Materials (TcSAM), these SOFCs of the \"thin film\" variety are both efficient and compact. With potential ranging from use in the government in matters of defense and space travel to driving forces in the consumer market that include computers and electricity, this breakthrough carries tremendous impact.\n\n\"By using materials science concepts developed in our superconductivity research and materials processing concepts in our semiconductor research, we are able to reduce operating temperatures, eliminate steps and use less expensive materials that will potentially revolutionize from where we derive electrical energy,\" said Alex Ignatiev, director of TcSAM and distinguished university professor of physics, chemistry and electrical and computer engineering at UH. \"While there are a number of fuel cell research programs at the university, ours focuses on the application of thin film science and technology to gain the benefits of efficiency and low cost.\"\n\nCompared to the macroscopic size of traditional fuel cells that can take up an entire room, thin film SOFCs are one micron thick – the equivalent of about one-hundredth of a human hair. Putting this into perspective, the size equivalent of four sugar cubes would produce 80 watts – more than enough to operate a laptop computer, eliminating clunky batteries and giving you hours more juice in your laptop. By the same token, approximately two cans' worth of soda would produce more than five kilowatts, enough to power a typical household.\n\nKeeping in mind that one thin film SOFC is just a fraction of the size of a human hair with an output of 0.8 to 0.9 Volts, a stack of 100 to 120 of these fuel cells would generate about 100 volts. When connected to a homeowner's natural gas line, the stack would provide the needed electrical energy to run the household at an efficiency of approximately 65 percent. This would be a twofold increase over power plants today, as they operate at 30 to 35 percent efficiency. Stand-alone household fuel cell units could form the basis for a new 'distributed power' system. In this concept, energy not used by the household would be fed back into a main grid, resulting in a credit to the user's account, while overages would similarly receive extra energy from that grid and be charged accordingly.\n\n\"The initial applications of our thin film fuel cell would probably be for governmental entities,\" Ignatiev said. \"For instance, once the preliminary data satisfies the Department of Defense, we could see our fuel cell research in action in the backpacks of soldiers, replacing heavy batteries to power their computers and night vision goggles and such.\n\n\"NASA also is very interested in this research mainly because of the weight and size factors,\" he said. \"Thin film SOFCs offer light, compact, low mass properties of significant interest to them. Right now, the shuttle routinely uses fuel cells that require ultrapure oxygen and hydrogen, use exotic materials and are massive and large. But the thin film SOFCs we are developing at UH are not as sensitive to contaminants and are highly efficient in their design and lightweight size, which is ideal for space applications.\"\n\nInherent to the more efficient design of these \"cool\" fuel cells is quite literally the fact that they operate at a much lower temperature than other solid oxide fuel cells, yet do not need a catalyst. Despite their 60 to 70 percent efficiency, SOFCs, in general, operate at 900 to 1,000 degrees Celsius, a very high temperature that requires exotic structural materials and significant thermal insulation. However, the thin film solid oxide fuel cell has an operating temperature of 450 to 500 degrees Celsius, one half that of current SOFCs. This lower temperature is largely a result of the drastically decreased thickness of the electrolyte-working region of these thin film SOFCs and negates the need for exotic structural materials and extensive insulation. The lower temperature also eliminates the need for catalysts (known as reformers) for the fuel cell. All of these features indicate a reduced cost for the thin film SOFC and positive future impact on the fuel cell market.\n\nIgnatiev anticipates that what he and his colleagues have been developing in UH's TcSAM laboratories will advance to the testing phase within the next six months. The collaborative test bed for this thin film SOFC testing is the Houston Advanced Research Center's Center for Fuel Cell Research and ApplicationsUniversity of Utah metallurgists used an old microwave oven to produce a nanocrystal semiconductor rapidly using cheap, abundant and less toxic metals than other semiconductors. They hope it will be used) —The storage of hydrogen in the form of methanol is a highly promising method for using excess energy produced by wind and solar power plants. However, this technology requires an effective catalyst ...\n\nNew materials will have a central role in many of the energy applications of the future.

      "text": "SANDIA LAB NEWS\n\nJanuary 6,\n2006\n\nAs part of the DOE-funded FreedomCAR program, Sandia's Power Sources Technology Group is researching ways to make lithium-ion batteries longer-lived and safer. The research will lead to these batteries being used in new hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) in the next five to 10 years.\n\n\"Batteries are a necessary part of hybrid electric-gasoline powered vehicles and someday, when the technology matures, will be part of hybrid electric-hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles,\" says Dan Doughty, manager of Advanced Power Sources Research and Development Dept. 2521. \"Current hybrid vehicles use nickel-metal hydride batteries, but a safe lithium-ion battery will be a much better option for the hybrids.\"\n\nHe notes the lithium-ion battery has four times the energy density of lead-acid batteries and two to three times the energy density of nickel-cadmium and nickel-metal hydride batteries. It also has the potential to be one of the lowest-cost battery systems.\n\nDan's department receives about $1.5 million a year from the FreedomCAR program to improve the safety, lengthen the lifetime, and reduce costs of lithium-ion batteries.\n\nThe FreedomCAR program, initiated by President Bush in 2002, focuses on developing hydrogen-powered electric vehicles to free the US from dependence on foreign oil supplies. Five national laboratories — Sandia, Argonne, Lawrence Berkeley, Idaho, and Brookhaven — are involved in the program, each researching different aspects of making hybrid electric-hydrogen vehicles a reality.\n\nDept. 2521's FreedomCAR work centers on the areas of battery abuse tolerance and accelerated lifetime prediction, with abuse tolerance receiving most of the focus.\n\n\"We want to develop a battery that has a graceful failure — meaning that if it's damaged, it won't cause other problems,\" Dan says. \"We have to understand how batteries fail and why they fail.\"\n\nUnderstanding abuse\n\nThe technical goal is to comprehend mechanisms that lead to poor abuse tolerance, including heat- and gas-generating reactions. Understanding the chemical response to abuse can point the way to better battery materials. But, Dan says, there is no \"magic bullet\" for completely stable lithium-ion cells.\n\n\"Fixing the problem will come from informed choices on improved cell materials, additives, and cell design, as well as good engineering practices.\"\n\nWork in abuse tolerance is beginning to shed light on mechanisms that control cell response, including effects of the anode and cathode, electrolyte breakdown, and battery additives.\n\nThe other area of work, accelerated life test, involves developing a method to predict lithium-ion battery life.\n\nEmpirical and mechanistic\n\n\"We have two approaches in our research — the empirical model and the mechanistic model,\" Dan says. \"The empirical model generates life prediction from accelerated degradation test data, while the mechanistic model relates life prediction to changes in battery materials. Our approach provides an independent measure of battery life so we don't have to rely on what battery manufacturers tell us.\"\n\nImproved abuse test procedures developed at Sandia have led to lithium-ion test standards that the battery team has developed and recently published in a Sandia research report (SAND2005-3123). Dan anticipates that the Society of Automotive Engineers will soon adopt these test procedures as national standards, just as they adopted in 1999 (SAE J2464) the abuse test procedures that Sandia developed for Electric Vehicle batteries (SAND99-0497).\n\n\"There has been substantial progress in making batteries more tolerant to abusive conditions,\" Dan says. \"It won't be long before these batteries will be used in gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles. And the great thing is this technology will be able to transfer over to the electric-hydrogen fuel cell powered hybrid vehicles of the future.\"\n\n\"Our hope is that we're successful and that success could expand our collaboration into solar photovoltaics and other areas,\" he says.\n\nThe broader partnership between Sandia and Sharp will focus on energy technologies, specifically photovoltaics and fuel cells. It will involve research and development of Sharp's solar photovoltaic technologies, including tests and improvements on reliability, durability, calibration of solar modules, inverters, and other advanced applications.\n\nSharp is the largest producer of solar photovoltaic modules in the world.\n\nChris Cornelius (6245), principal investigator for the CRADA, says Sandia will work with Sharp on the development of technologies for direct methanol fuel cells.\n\n\"Our research team and Sharp Corporation will bring together our materials and engineering skills to develop technologies that will impact methanol-based fuel cells,\" Chris says.\n\n\"Sandia can apply its extensive materials capabilities to help Sharp bring new products to the market, and Sharp with its extensive electronics and manufacturing expertise will assure the development of commercial mobile power technology that is important for many applications, including portable power and distributed sensor networks,\" Jeff says.\n\nSandia's immediate focus is on portable power applications, such as the use of direct methanol fuel cells to power consumer electronics like laptops, cell phones, and PDAs.\n\nSharp has asked Sandia to fabricate fuel cells using Sandia's proprietary membranes and catalysts. Members of Depts. 6245, 1823, and 1815, along with researcher Akimasa Umemoto from Sharp, have begun designing the materials and membrane electrode assemblies for Sharp's specific application target. They will fabricate and test the fuel cells during the 12- to 18- month project under conditions relevant for Sharp's applications.\n\nThe Sandia research team members for this project are Cy Fujimoto, Mike Hickner (both 6245), Bill Steen (1823), Eric Coker (1815), and Chris Apbeltt (1723).\n\nJeff acknowledged the assistance of Sandia's technology transfer group in developing the CRADA, including Gary Jones, Vic Weiss, and Sherry Anderson.\n\n\"Gary and his team were instrumental in helping us navigate through many of the challenging issues associated with putting together a CRADA with a non-US company,\" Jeff says.\n\nThe arrangement was brokered by the New Mexico Economic Development Department following Gov. Bill Richardson's meeting with Sharp's executives in Tokyo.\n\nBP Chief Scientist: The end (of oil) is not near\n\nThe Stone Age didn't end for lack of stones and the Petroleum Age isn't likely to end for lack of petroleum. That was the message of Steve Koonin, chief scientist for BP, plc, speaking to a nearly full house at Sandia's Steve Schiff Auditorium in December. \"We are not running out of oil any time soon,\" he said.\n\nHis talk, the final one in a series of distinguished lecturers for 2005 presented by the Geosciences and Environment Center, was carried live on streaming video to another 1,100 Sandians.\n\nKoonin, who earned his doctorate at MIT and served as provost at Caltech until moving to BP in 2004, alluded jokingly to an earlier talk at Sandia/California's Combustion Research Facility (Lab News, Dec. 9, page 3.) At that talk, Paul Roberts, author of The End of Oil, gave his perspective on the future. Although Roberts' message that a new revolution in energy is beginning seems opposite of Koonin's, in fact the two speakers agreed on much of what lies ahead.\n\nSigning on with one of the largest multinational energy companies in the world, Koonin was assigned the job of mapping a long-range technology strategy for BP (formerly British Petroleum). He took about a year to look at mounds of data, establish limiting factors that impact technology development, and predict the energy mix of the future. He identified population growth, supply security and challenges, and environmental constraints as the key factors affecting technology.\n\nA physicist by training, Koonin cites a number of reasons for expecting petroleum's continued dominance of the energy market, including substantial petroleum reserves and the \"energy density\" of petroleum.\n\nHydrocarbon dominance\n\nAdded to 41 years of known oil reserves and 67 years of gas reserves are other petroleum fuel forms extending the reach of the oil era. An additional 200 years of coal reserves allow for even more far-reaching possibilities. Incremental price increases will allow industry to convert heavy oils, biofuels, and gas-to-liquid products to extend the hydrocarbon dominance.\n\n\"If we choose to do it, we can double vehicle efficiency with technologies like homogeneous charged compression ignition and diesel. Fifty percent of new cars in Europe are diesel,\" he said. \"If you include enhanced oil recovery, super deep reserves, tar sands, and oil shale you can extend the petroleum use curve….It depends on what you call oil.\"\n\nOn the subject of petroleum's high energy density, Koonin told the audience, \"An amazing number for me is that with your average fill-up of gasoline, you're wielding about 15 megawatts of power. That's a tremendous number, carrying that kind of power in a small space.\"\n\nKoonin focused much of his talk on the environmental consequences of his predictions for the future energy mix. While local pollution \"is a solvable problem,\" his view of global warming was less positive. There's a growing body of anecdotal and scientific evidence that \"it's getting warmer,\" he said. \"There's a plausible connection of increases of CO2 with these temperature increases.\" Although there are complicating factors, there is a strengthening scientific case, he said. \"It's over 50 percent but not 90 percent right now.\"\n\nTough problem to fix\n\n\"My own bottom line, and BP's as well, is that it is extraordinarily unwise to be putting this much CO2 into the atmosphere and that the world should do something about it.\" Limited absorption rates for CO2 in the environment, the fact that global warming is less visible than other hazards, and the mismatch of CO2 scales between human activity and life-cycle times in the environment all make it a tough problem to fix, Koonin said.\n\nGrowing energy demands also mean that, \"We would need to halve the current value of emissions to stabilize the CO2 levels because we are doubling energy use over the same time. He suggested a CO2 rate of 550 per million (twice the pre-industrial level) is workable. It would take about 45 years to stabilize the concentration. \"CO2 emissions and concentrations are going to rise unless the world does something dramatically different.\"\n\nKoonin noted several transport technologies, including hybridization of vehicles, and light-weighting of vehicles, hydrogen, and biofuels as options for the future. But transport is only about 20 percent of emissions, he noted. For stationary energy sources, he suggested that solar, hydrogen, nuclear, and wind offer potential.\n\nFor fighting global warming, Koonin said his personal choices would be carbon sequestration efforts and nuclear power. \"BP is practicing carbon sequestration at the Salah gas field in southern Algeria,\" he said. Engineers are re-injecting CO2 into the ground and monitoring to see what happens to it, where it will migrate, and \"will it stay down there?\" He estimates costs may be 30-40 percent higher than venting CO2 to the atmosphere.\n\nNuclear energy growth will be fixed and probably growing fractionally, he said. \"Nuclear and carbon sequestration are necessary to stabilize the climate. For CO2 there are two technologies necessary to have a meaningful impact on emissions: Nuclear and carbon sequestration. Without those two I don't think the world has a prayer.\"\n\nHere are some selected observations from Steve Koonin's lecture:\n\nAutomobiles increased in energy efficiency by 23 percent from 1990 to 2000. This was overshadowed by weight and performance increases that shaved 18 percent off efficiency during the same period, resulting in only a 4.6 percent net improvement. \"For the US, significantly reducing transportation energy efficiency is a question of political will, not technology.\"\n\nCurrently, half the world's population lives in urban areas. In the next 25 years, that will reach 80 percent. Along with urbanization comes higher Gross Domestic Product and energy demands, both in terms of stationary power plants and transportation fuels. \"Right now there are 2.5 billion people at the bottom of the energy curve who want to move up to levels of the industrialized world. Energy use is inextricably linked to economic growth.\"\n\nThe three largest markets — North America, Europe, and Asia — consume 80 percent of the world's oil and hold 15 percent of the reserves. The co-location of coal reserves with demand centers in these markets is likely to lead to a near-term resurgence in coal use.\n\nThere will be nine billion people on the planet by 2050, with the most growth in Africa and Asia. As people shift from walking and public transit to privately owned vehicles, transportation energy and other power demands will drive overall demand up by 60 percent over the next 25 years.\n\nBattling global warming will be difficult because there will be inevitable distractions, such as economic disruptions, high costs, and short-term cooling. The developing world is growing at the rate of 2.8 percent in terms of CO2 production, while the industrial nations are growing about 1.2 percent. Reduction in the industrial world won't counteract developing world increases. \"We have to cut emissions by a factor of two while energy demand doubles and this has to be done over the next 25 years,\" he said.\n\nSince the first US discoveries of oil in 1850, a trillion barrels have been produced. Another trillion will be needed between now and 2030. With other sources of oil, such as deep reserves in the Gulf of Mexico, \"the curve extends out for four trillion barrels.\" -- Will Keener"

Rather than continue the futile effort to tweak that material - platinum - to make it work better, Chemistry Professor Alfred Anderson urges his colleagues to start anew.\n\n\"Using platinum is like putting a resistor in the system,\" he said. Anderson freely acknowledges he doesn't know what the right material is, but he's confident that researchers' energy would be better spent seeking it out than persisting with platinum.\n\n\"If we can find a catalyst that will do this [more efficiently],\" he said, \"it would reach closer to the limiting potential and get more energy out of the fuel cell.\"\n\nAnderson's analysis as well as a guide for a better catalyst have been published in a recent issue of Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics and in Electrocatalysis online.\n\nEven in the best of circumstances, Anderson explains, the chemical reaction that produces energy in a fuel cell like those being tested by some car companies ends up wasting a quarter of the energy that could be transformed into electricity. This point is well-recognized in the scientific community, but to date efforts to address the problem have proved fruitless.\n\nAnderson blames the failure on a fundamental misconception as to the reason for the energy waste. The most widely accepted theory says that impurities are binding to the platinum surface of the cathode and blocking the desired reaction.\n\n\"The decades-old surface-poisoning explanation is lame, because there is more to the story\" Anderson said.\n\nTo understand the loss of energy, he used data derived from oxygen-reduction experiments to calculate the optimal bonding strengths between platinum and intermediate molecules formed during the oxygen-reduction reaction. The reaction takes place at the platinum-coated cathode.\n\nHe found the intermediate molecules bond too tightly or too loosely to the cathode surface, slowing the reaction and causing a drop in voltage. The result is the fuel cell produces about .93 volts instead of the potential maximum of 1.23 volts.\n\nTo eliminate the loss, calculations show, the catalyst should have bonding strengths tailored so that all reactions taking place during oxygen reduction occur at or as near to 1.23 volts as possible.\n\nAnderson said the use of volcano plots, which are a statistical tool for comparing catalysts, has actually misguided the search for the best one \"They allow you to grade a series of similar catalysts, but they don't point to better catalysts.\"\n\nHe said a catalyst made of copper laccase, a material found in trees and fungi, has the desired bonding strength but lacks stability. Finding a catalyst that has both is the challenge.\n\nAnderson is working with other researchers exploring alternative catalysts as well as an alternative reaction pathway in an effort to increase efficiency.\n\nCatalysts made of carbon nanotubes dipped in a polymer solution equal the energy output and otherwise outperform platinum catalysts in fuel cells, a team of Case Western Reserve University engineers has found.\n\nEngineers at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) have identified a catalyst that provides the same level of efficiency in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) as the currently used platinum catalyst, but at ...\n\nChemists at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory have received three patents for developing catalysts to accelerate chemical reactions in fuel cells. The newly patented catalysts, Los Alamos National Laboratory scientists have developed a way to avoid the use of expensive platinum in hydrogen fuel cells, the environmentally friendly devices that might replace current"

      "text": "German Student Creates Device That Harvests Energy From Air\n\nA German student has designed an energy harvester that derives energy from electromagnetic fields in the air to recharge small batteries and appliances. Dennis Siegel, who is studying digital media at the University of the Arts in Bremen, Germany, outlines the design of the harvester on his website.\n\nAs he explains it:\n\nThe omnipresence of electromagnetic fields is implied just by simple current flow. We are surrounded by electromagnetic fields, which we are producing for information transfer or as a byproduct. Many of those fields are very capacitive and can be harvested with coils and high frequency diodes.\n\nDennis Siegel has created an energy harvester that can be used to harvest ambient energy from electromagnetic fields in the air, such as those present near power lines, plugged-in electric appliances, or mobile phones. Siegel is studying digital design at the University of Bremen. (Source: Dennis Siegel)\n\nTo take advantage of this capability, Siegel built harvesting devices that can tap into several electromagnetic fields and harvest energy, which is then stored in a typical battery. As he continues on his website:\n\nSo you can for example gain redundant energy from the power supply of a coffee machine, a cell phone, or an overhead wire by holding the harvester directly into the electromagnetic field whose strength is indicated by a LED on the top of the harvester.\n\nWith the energy harvested, it's possible to charge a small battery in just a day depending on the size of the electromagnetic field. \"The system is meant to be an option for granting access to already existing but unheeded energy sources,\" Siegel writes. \"By exploring these sources it can create a new awareness of the invisible electromagnetic spaces while giving them a spatial dimension.\"\n\nIf you think about it, Siegel's concept is not such a complex one. Electronic devices, even when switched off, emit electricity if they're plugged in, as do any other devices that use electricity to run.\n\nIndeed, his website features photos of people holding up the device in various places where ambient energy would be present, such as in close proximity to a coffee machine, a power line, and someone speaking on a mobile device.\n\nSiegel describes two types of harvesters that can be developed -- a small one for lower frequencies below 100Hz that are found in general mains (50/60Hz, 16,7Hz), and a bigger one that can be used to harvest energy from both lower and higher frequencies, like radio broadcast (~100MHz), GSM (900/1800MHz), or Bluetooth and WLAN (2,4GHz).\n\nEnergy harvesting is emerging as one way to provide alternative energy for small, battery-powered devices. Options for harvesting are being explored for medical devices, small home appliances like smoke alarms, and a number of other applications.\n\nCompanies also are investing products that promote energy harvesting, such as Texas Instruments' new low-power converter and a low-power circuit from Dutch startup Anagear that harvests energy to provide more efficient power management.\n\nYou're welcome, notarboca. I'm quite frankly surprised by the level of comment I've received on this one. You never know as a writer what is going to provoke a response, and there are opinions and angles to this story that people have posed that I have never thought of. Thanks for reading.\n\nIf you disrupt the broadcast RF or decrease the coverage area (e.g. by using a very large antenna or array), they might have a case against you. But it would be much harder for the provider to detect the loss, if you are a distance from the transmitter.\n\nHowever, it is impractical to use RF energy transmitted at a distance. Transmitted EM waves follow the Inverse Square Law ( which states that the power density of an electromagnetic wave is proportional to the inverse of the square of the distance from a point source.\n\nThe power is reduced in proportion to the square of the distance to the source. i.e. - If you double the distance to a source, you will only have 1/4 of the power (you lose 3/4 of the power).\n\nPower is monitored at substations or below, so there are not millions of killowatts being sensed. If he was stealing enough to power his entire house, they would detect the loss.\n\nThe first electric Co-ops were formed in rural areas like Oklahoma when neighbors would pay to run power lines between themselves and a nearby distribution line. The electric companies didn't want to power scattered rural homes because they would never get a return on the line investment. Even when the small communities ran their own lines, the power companies didn't want to hook them up and become liable for their distribution.\n\nTo force the issue, the co-ops would put poles next to the electric company's line for a distance and parasitically power their homes.\n\nThe EM field of conductors is NOT wasted energy and any EE should know that. It is simply the result of passing current through the conductor. Sheilding is not an option when considering the massive currents involved in power distribution.\n\nYou can use these devices all you want behind YOUR power meter where you get charged for the energy you consume. But using power you are not being charged for, plus causing additional distribution loses to the provider (find your own EE to explain); is increasing the provider's costs and decreasing the available energy to legitimate customers. IT IS THEFT! period!\n\nNow I like this idea, shehan. If they don't like the idea of other people doing it, they should set up harvesters themselves...that way no precious energy is lost. We could perhaps solve the energy crisis this way. What a good idea.\n\nThere is still a basic misunderstanding of how transformers work. If we consider a perfect transformer with no load on it, there is only the initial surge as the first magnetic field builds up. Then the voltage is transferred to the secondary almost simultaneously. When the field collapses, the current used is put back into the system. This goes on at 50 or 60 Hz and no energy is consumed. The power company could do this all day and only have to pay for the generator's friction losses. It would see no drain on their system- no LOAD, we say. They would make no money, and they would lose no money, other than the friction losses, payment on the building, maintenance of the equipment, payroll, taxes, fuel, and payoffs to government officials.\n\nBut if Mr. Farmer comes along and runs a wire (a secondary, not primary), then when current flows through the voltage buildup in his home-made, extremely inefficient secondary copper skeleton key, the generator would know it, as the collapsing field no longer gives him his current back. There is a loss. There is a consuming of the power. But all his other bills go on with an increase in fuel costs and maintenance costs.\n\nThere, I hope that clears things up a bit. Power generation is only as expensive as the load on the system, minus the losses and bribes.\n\nThe farmer's setup was expensive because of the cost of the miles of highly insulated copper wire he had to run multiple times around the perimeter of his lot. It operated as the primary winding of a transformer and worked because one side of his lot was close to the high voltage wires and the rest was further away. It was extremely inefficient because this transformer's core was made of air.\n\n@Elizabeth - Thanks, I think collecting / harvesting this energy is not a crime. If not harvesting is a chime and a waste. At least the electricity companies need to set up stations to harvest this solutions"

But fuel cell experts say that, based on the information the company made public today, the Bloom Box technology is not revolutionary, nor is it the cheapest or most efficient fuel cell system available.\n\nThe secretive company has been operating for eight years and the 60 Minutes report was the first time the secret behind the Bloom Box has been revealed. Unlike many hydrogen fuel cells that require expensive precious metal, the Bloom box fuel cell is built from an extremely cheap ceramic material – sand. For months now, Bloom Energy has been testing refrigerator-size Bloom Boxes at campuses of major corporations—including Google, FedEx, Wal-Mart, and eBay. One of these jumbo Bloom Boxes, called Bloom Box Servers, could power a hundred homes, and four of them could power a 35,000-square-foot (3,250-square-meter) office building, Sridhar said on CBS.\n\nThe ceramic disks that form the core of the Box are painted with special \"inks\" – green on one side and black on the other. The disk acts as an electrode so that at high temperatures, a hydrocarbon fuel – ethanol, biodiesel, methane, or natural gas – on one side of the cell attracts oxygen ions from the other. As the ions are pulled through the solid core, the resulting electrochemical reaction creates electricity. The disks are stacked together separated by a cheap metal alloy. A stack of 64, which is around the size of a house brick, can generate enough power to run a small business. The size of the entire unit needs to be bigger to accommodate other components such as the fuel source supply.\n\nBloom Box reportedly proved twice as efficient as traditional power sources and produced 60% fewer emissions.According to the Guardian, Sridhar's work draws on his research on generating oxygen for Nasa's missions to Mars. Oxygen is drawn into one side of the cell, while a fuel, such as a natural gas or bio-fuel, is drawn into the other side. The two combine within the cell and produce a chemical reaction that creates energy without any burning or combustion.\n\nA 100kW Bloom Box fuel cell currently costs between $700,000 to $800,000 with a reported three-to-five-year payback. Bloom Energy hopes to mass produce home-sized units of the fuel cell product and sell each for under $3000. Company CEO K.R. Sridhar told The New York Times that when using natural gas, his devices are making cheaper electricity at 8–10 cents/kWh, which is lower than current electricity rates in some parts of the country, such as California"

This could lead to the development of a wearable cotton t-shirt that could charge your smartphone. Xiaodong Li, a professor of mechanical engineering at USC, sees a future where electronics are part of our wardrobe.\n\nLi says, \"We wear fabric every day. One day our cotton T-shirts could have more functions; for example, a flexible energy storage device that could charge your cell phone or your iPad.\"\n\nLi and post-doctoral associate Lihong Bao reported in the journal Advanced Materials how to turn the material in a cotton T-shirt into a source of electrical power. Starting with a T-shirt from a local discount store, Li's team soaked it in a fluoride solution, dried it and baked it. They excluded oxygen in the oven to prevent the material from charring or combusting.\n\nThe surfaces of the resulting fibers in the fabric were shown by infrared spectroscopy to have been converted from cellulose to activated carbon. The material retained flexibility and could still be folded without breaking. By using small swatches of the fabric as an electrode, the researchers showed that the material, which Li's team calls \"activated carbon textile,\" acts as a capacitor. Li's team then coated the individual fibers in the activated carbon textile with \"nanoflowers\" of manganese oxide. This nanometer thick layer of manganese oxide greatly enhanced the electrode performance of the fabric.\n\nThe researchers say the coated hybrid fabric improved the energy storage capability beyond the activated carbon textile alone. The hybrid supercapacitors were very resilient. The researchers found that even after thousands of charge-discharge cycles, performance didn't diminish more than 5 percent.\n\nLi says, \"By stacking these supercapacitors up, we should be able to charge portable electronic devices such as cell phones.\""

Balancing battery cost and capacity could be vital to implementing large-scale energy storage systems. Lithium-ion batteries, used in laptop computers and electric cars, are still too expensive. Sodium-ion batteries require less expensive materials, but they don't have enough capacity, and the anode collapses when it releases the larger sodium ions during discharge.

You MIGHT hear that cold-blooded reptiles also capture energy from the sun to warm their bodies.\n\nOdds are, though, your students will be surprised to learn that some wasps are solar powered, too!\n\nRecent studies of the Oriental wasp revealed that it can actually make electricity by harvesting the suns rays as described here:\n\n\"Previously, entomologists noted that Oriental wasps, unlike other wasps and bees, are active in the afternoon rather than the morning when the sun is just rising. They also noticed that the hornet digs more intensely as the sun's intensity increases.\n\nThe team determined that the brown shell of the hornet was made from grooves that split light into diverging beams. The yellow stripe on the abdomen is made from pinhole depressions, and contains a pigment called xanthopterin. Together, the light diverging grooves, pinhole depressions and xanthopterin change light into electrical energy. The shell traps the light and the pigment does the conversion.\"\n\nIsn't nature amazing?\n\nWhat's even more amazing is that nature makes these buzzing solar panels using just a handful of common chemicals found in all forms of life: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, etc. It does the manufacturing with water-based reactions and at ambient temperatures and pressures.\n\nContrast that with the typical solar panel manufactured in the United States and abroad. Though many are made from common and harmless silicon, the wafers must be processed at extremely high temperatures (3,450 degrees F!) to achieve the desired effect, consuming massive amounts of energy and resources.\n\nNewer \"thin film\" solar cells are made from elements like copper, indium, gallium, and selenium – relatively rare and expensive metals that can be toxic to people.\n\nNext time you sit down to a big salad, or bowl of vegetables, you can appreciate the fact that nature makes solar panels out of non-toxic compounds that are actually good for you. Who would've guessed that a solar panel could taste delicious with Ranch Dressing?In an effort to make solar photovoltaic (PV) technology more affordable, scientists are looking for ways to capture the sun's energy using pigment molecules that can be incorporated into glass or flexible, plastic solar cells. Currently these dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) are not as efficient as silicon-based PV solar cells but \"have higher overall power collection potential due to low-cost operability under a wider range of light and temperature conditions, and flexible application\" (Ask Nature.org).\n\nThe steps of light absorption by a pigment molecule and subsequent creation of an \"energized\" or mobile electron is shared between the process of photosynthesis that occurs within a leaf and the mechanism of a DSSC. Read more about how photosynthesis has inspired scientists to harvest solar energy using dye sensitized solar cells.\n\nThe basic science behind the operation of a DSSC, including a schematic diagram, is described by Kenneth Hanson, PhD, a chemist at UNC, in his review of this Nanocrystalline Solar Cell Kit from ICE.\n\nTo take this a step further, scientists at UNC's Energy Frontier Research Center are working to adapt dye-sensitized solar cells to produce chemical fuels, instead of electricity, just as plants use photosynthesis to convert sunlight into chemicals. This process of converting sunlight into a fuel is referred to as artificial photosynthesis.\n\nLike this:\n\nJust how does a fifty foot long humpback whale dive deep and then leap from the water to the delight and amazement of whale watchers? Certainly the whale is powerful, but there may be some other secrets to this 40 ton acrobat.\n\nScientist Dr. Frank E. Fish (yes – that's his real name) went shopping for a gift one day, and spotted a humpback whale sculpture that seemed unusual. On close examination, he discovered the sculptor had gotten the subject all wrong, carving bumps and ridges into the front of the whale's fin.\n\nFish questioned the shopkeeper, explaining that accepted engineering standards require a smooth leading edge to cut through air or water. The shopkeeper defended the sculptor, a meticulous whale watcher, and assured Dr. Fish that the humpback does indeed have bumps on the leading edge of its fins.\n\nPerplexed, Fish investigated further and found that those bumps, or \"tubercles,\" have a dramatic impact on how the fin cuts through water. It may not be a mistake after all!\n\nThink back for a moment to a childhood car trip, waving your hand and arm out the window to feel the air rush by. You noticed that if you held your hand out flat, then angled it up slightly, you could feel the lift of the air pushing against the bottom of your hand. Make the angle too steep, and your hand would \"stall,\" being pushed backwards instead of up.\n\nThat \"stall angle\" is extremely important in the field of fluid dynamics, and it must be important to the humpback whale, because over time, its fins evolved a series of tubercles that actually increase the stall angle. Put another way, the tubercles allow the whale to cut more sharply into the water, while still maintaining its forward momentum. No wonder they can leap above the surface!\n\nWhat does all of this whale talk have to do with renewable energy? Well, a lot actually.\n\nA company called Whale Power has created a wind turbine with \"tubercle technology\" built into the leading edge of the blades. Just like humpback whale's fins, the blades have a steeper stall angle and better aerodynamics, allowing them to harness more wind energy than their smooth competitors. They produce more power, can operate at lower wind speeds, and are quieter than other turbines in their class.\n\nSo next time you're outdoors and see a plant or animal with an odd shape or unusual behavior, ask yourself how it got there.

Microelectronics power a huge range of consumer goods, from greeting cards to hand-held computers.\n\n\"One could envisage being able to modify an existing semiconductor or microelectronics fabrication plant to produce fuel cells,\" Thompson said.\n\nThe high cost to build fuel cells is one of the biggest impediments to the commercialization of fuel cells, Thompson said. Lowering production cost is critical to being able to use the technology in real-world applications such as hand-held electronics, and eventually vehicles. Using the technology in cars also depends on lowering the cost.\n\nTraditionally, fuel cells are built similarly to a car, with pieces manufactured separately and then assembled. There is high variability and the process is costly and time consuming. But Thompson's research group is making proton exchange membrane fuel cells (which are the leading candidate to replace batteries in hand-held electronics and vehicles) using modern electronics microfabrication processes. Instead of assembling the separate parts, the fuels cells are made by \"growing\" layers upon layers, the same way we currently make microelectronic devices.\n\nUsing these lower-cost manufacturing methods, combined with less expensive materials, U-M scientists hope to reduce the cost of fuel cells from nearly $10,000 per kilowatt to less than $1,000 per kilowatt.\n\n\"At this lower cost, fuel cells would be competitive with lithium ion batteries, the power supply for many portable electronic devices including cell phones,\" Thompson said.\n\n\"Manufacturers should be able to reduce costs in the same way that costs for microelectronics have been reduced,\" he said.\n\n\"U-M research on using microfabrication to make fuel cells began about two-and-a-half years ago,\" Thompson said. \"The next step is to generate prototypes for third party evaluation. The first market will be for portable electronic devices, but the goal is to someday use fuel cells in automobiles.\"\n\nRelevant PhysicsForums postsCheaper clean-energy technologies could be made possible thanks to a new discovery.

Today, the largest cargo ships in the world require nothing more than powerful engines to push them forward. These engines, however, produce large amounts of CO2 gas, which is a contributor to climate change. The science, technology, and alternative energy communities have worked for years to find an alternative to these high-polluting engines with modest success. Researchers from the University of Tokyo believe that the answer may lie in sails.\n\nMetal sails could be viable alternative to high-polluting engines\n\nResearchers have developed a new metal sail system that can be used to drastically reduce the pollution emitted by conventional engines. Professor Uzawa Kiyoshi demonstrated how the sails would work during the Sea Japan trade show in Tokyo last week. The sails can reach a height of 164 feet and are 65 feet wide, and they are made of an aluminum-plastic fiber, which is resilient and flexible. When the sails are raised, they can capture strong wind currents and pull giant freighters forward. The sails can be lowered in events of turbulent weather.\n\nSail system could help lower the cost of energy for freighters\n\nAccording to tests conducted by the University of Tokyo, these metal sails could significantly reduce the cost of fuel for their freighters.

While solar photovoltaics swelter under the summer heat and lose efficiency as a result, research at Michigan Technological University (MTU) shows that heating amorphous silicon PV can actually increase its efficiency in a hybrid solar thermal PV application.\n\n\"The main problem is [amorphous silicon] degrades when light hits it,\" said Joshua Pearce, an associate professor of materials science and engineering at MTU. To help counteract the effect of degradation associated with light and heat, companies produce very thin amorphous silicon cells, lessening the impact of heat on the cell. \"But you let light go through.…By operating at higher temperatures you can accept the thicker cell [without losing much efficiency].\" While this works for amorphous silicon it won't work for crystalline silicon photovoltaics, according to Pearce.\n\nPearce conducted two studies to show how a thicker cell in a PV-thermal application can produce more power. The studies were conducted in partnership with Kunal Girotra from ThinSilicon, and Michael Pathak and Stephen Harrison, both from Queen's University, Canada.\n\nAlso, by heating the PV system up at the end of the day, it becomes more efficient, the research shows. \"If you cook the cell once a day for an hour, you will increase its overall energy generation by about 10 percent,\" Pearce said. Sunlight, he said, causes materials within the cell to degrade somewhat. But by essential baking the device at close to water-boiling temperatures once a day, it helps reverse the degradation.\n\nThe cells could be heated after peak sunlight hours by basically not running the solar thermal system and letting the modules heat up as a result, he said. Such a system could be designed much like a flat-plate solar thermal collector, which uses black paint to absorb more heat. \"What we imagine is replacing the black paint with amorphous silicon,\" Pearce said.\n\nPearce and his colleagues conducted the tests in laboratory conditions. They are now looking to incorporate such a system and build it to demonstrate the effect. Pearce said it was most likely that such a system would be tested in Canada first."

In order for the new solar cells to work, the nanotubes have to be very pure, and of a uniform type: single-walled, and all of just one of nanotubes' two possible symmetrical configurations.\n\nOther groups have made photovoltaic (PV) cells using carbon nanotubes, but only by using a layer of polymer to hold the nanotubes in position and collect the electrons knocked loose when they absorb sunlight. But that combination adds extra steps to the production process, and requires extra coatings to prevent degradation with exposure to air. The new all-carbon PV cell appears to be stable in air, Strano says.\n\nThe carbon-based cell is most effective at capturing sunlight in the near-infrared region. Because the material is transparent to visible light, such cells could be overlaid on conventional solar cells, creating a tandem device that could harness most of the energy of sunlight. The carbon cells will need refining, Strano and his colleagues say: So far, the early proof-of-concept devices have an energy-conversion efficiency of only about 0.1 percent.\n\nBut while the system requires further research and fine-tuning, \"we are very much on the path to making very high efficiency near-infrared solar cells,\" says Rishabh Jain, a graduate student who was lead author of the paper.\n\nBecause the new system uses layers of nanoscale materials, producing the cells would require relatively small amounts of highly purified carbon, and the resulting cells would be very lightweight, the team says. \"One of the really nice things about carbon nanotubes is that their light absorption is very high, so you don't need a lot of material to absorb a lot of light,\" Jain says."

      "text": "NREL Reports on 114 Percent Solar Cell Efficiency\n\nNone of the solar cells produced to date shows external photocurrent quantum efficiencies greater than 100 percent from any portion of the solar spectral irradiance band.\n\nIn fact, for math dummies like me, the possibility seems inconceivable, yet researchers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, or NREL, located in Boulder, Colorado, have reported external quantum efficiencies above 100 percent in solar cells \"excited\" with photons from the high-energy region of the solar spectrum. That is, from the near ultraviolet (350-400 nanometers) through the visible light spectrum (400-700 nanometers).\n\nIn simple terms, the solar cell in question is able to produce more energy than can be accounted for by the light hitting the cell. Researchers at NREL achieved this with a layered quantum dot cell – a surface of anti-reflective glass, a thin layer of semiconductor material like silicon, a zinc oxide layer \"textured\" at the nano level, a quantum dot (QD) layer of lead selenide (PbSE) \"doped\" with ethanedithol (a bonding agent)and hydrazine (a deposition stabilizer), and a thin layer of gold for the uppermost electrode.\n\nThe resultant efficiency, 114 percent, is the \"spectrally resolved ratio of collected charge carriers (electrons or electron holes) to incident photons\" as a result of multiple exciton generation, or MEG, which creates many electron-hole pairs from a single photon – an effect that some quantum physics experts have ascribed to superposition.\n\nThe electron-hole pairs, typically one per photon, result when a photon enters the solar cell's structure and bounces into a valence electron which is part of the semiconductor layer's material structure. This freed electron leaves behind an electron-hole, which is pulled toward the N-side, while the electron moves toward the P-side, forming the electric current.\n\nFunding for the research was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Science, which funds NREL and 11 other laboratories operated under the aegis of the DOE to extend energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.\n\nSolar experts are calling it the type of advance that will lead to Next Generation (highly efficient and cheap) Solar Cells, and an era of cheap solar energy which could rival electricity from fossil fuels or nuclear fisson. This is known as \"grid parity.\"\n\nThe abstract to the paper, called \"Peak External Photocurrent Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 100% via MEG in a Quantum Dot Solar Cell,\" is available here. The paper itself is only available for a fee. The authors are NREL scientists Joseph M. Luther, Sukgeun Choi, Hsiang-Yu Chen, Jianbo Gao, Matthew C. Beard, Octavi E. Semonin and Arthur J. Nozik; Semonin and Nozik are also affiliated with the University of Colorado at Boulder.\n\nThe secret behind the phoenomenal efficiency is attributed to the quantum dot structure of the solar cells themselves. Quantum dots (1-20 nanometers) have a number of interesting properties. For one thing, their minute size allows them to capture the excess energy that would, in other types of solar cells, be lost as heat. They also:\n\nForm wider bandgaps as size decreases\n\nCreate excitons at normal temperatures\n\nEnhance particle coupling\n\nImprove MEG processes\n\nPerhaps the most important part of this demonstration is that it opens formerly unexamined approaches to improving solar cell efficiencies. And improved solar cells can't help but achieve the grid parity so sought after by solar researchers. In fact, according to a new report from researchers at Queen's University (Ontario), residential solar PV has already achieved parity in terms of the cost of electricity"

      "text": "(Phys.org)—It may sound counterintuitive that replacing one of the most photosensitive solar cell materials with a material with less desirable photosensitive properties can improve the solar cell's efficiency, but that's what scientists have shown in a new study. By replacing the highly photosensitive titanium dioxide (TiO2) with alumina (Al2O3) in a solution-processable solar cell, the researchers have achieved a record power conversion efficiency of 10.9%. They attribute this high efficiency to the Al2O3 acting as an inert scaffold, forcing the electrons to remain within and be transported through an extremely thin absorber (ETA) layer.\n\nThe researchers, led by Henry J. Snaith at the University of Oxford in the UK, with coauthors from the University of Oxford, Toin University of Yokohama in Japan, and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Ibaraki, Japan, have published their study on the highly efficient solar cells in a recent issue of Science.\n\n\"This is a new technology, so in essence a new record,\" Snaith told Phys.org. \"All solar cell technologies have different efficiencies, with GaAs being the highest at over 28%. This is not an absolute world record, but probably the highest for a solution-processable solid-state solar cell. And the real excitement is where it may reach over the next few years; it should have a steep improvement curve.\"\n\nThe choice of electrode material in a solar cell is one of the most important factors contributing to solar cell efficiency, and TiO2 is often used as an electrode material in solution-processable solar cells due to its good ability for photoexcitation, or converting photons into electrons, as well as its strong electron-accepting properties when photosensitized with a dye or absorber.\n\nBut in order to improve solar cell efficiency, the scientists here addressed the fundamental energy losses that arise throughout the photovoltaic process of absorbing photons and generating electrons. As they explain, energy is lost during the photogeneration of electron-hole pairs (excitons), the separation of tightly bound excitons, and the extraction of free electrons from highly disordered networks.\n\nIn attempts to overcome these losses, previous research has investigated the use of coating an ETA layer, 2 to 10 nm in thickness, on the internal surface of the TiO2 electrode in order to increase the current density and voltage. So far, solar cells with ETA layers have achieved power conversion efficiencies of up to 6.3%.\n\nHere, the researchers have investigated the possibility that TiO2 may be hindering the effectiveness of the ETA layer due to its electronic disorder and low mobility. Because Al2O3 is a wide band gap insulator, the researchers found that, when it's used as the electrode, the photoexcited electrons remain in the ETA layer and do not drop to lower energy levels in the oxide as they do in the TiO2 electrode.\n\nThis difference offers several advantages. For instance, the researchers found that using Al2O3 significantly speeds up the electron transport process, forcing electrons to quickly travel through a perovskite ETA layer, and also increases the voltage. These improvements increased the power conversion efficiency from 8% with the TiO2 electrode to 10.9% with the Al2O3 electrode. Because the Al2O3 is mainly acting as a meso-scale scaffold, and does not play a role in photoexcitation, the researchers call this device a \"meso-superstructured solar cell\" (MSSC).\n\n\"The alumina is acting as a scaffold for the perovskite layer, and subsequently the hole-conductor which is coated on top of the perovskite layer,\" Snaith said. \"It is not electronically active, but purely acting as a physical support.\n\n\"It is very surprising and would not have been predicted,\" he added. \"However, in hindsight we can see where the efficiency gains come from. The real surprise is that the perovskite layer is so effective at transporting charge and generating high photovoltage in the solar cell.\"\n\nThe scientists expect that the efficiency can be further improved in the future by various means, such as experimenting with new perovskites, using other semiconductors, and extending the absorption range.\n\n\"This work moves low-cost solution-processable solar cells significantly closer to the performance of perfectly crystalline semiconductors, while at the same time opening extensive possibilities for future research and development,\" Snaith said.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nSolar energy is one of the most promising forms of renewable energy, but the high cost of conventional solar cells has so far limited its popularity. To increase the competitiveness of solar energy, scientists ...\n\nEuropean scientists studied electron flow in systems of organic photosensitive dyes and titanium-based materials. Results are particularly relevant to increasing the efficiency of a cost-effective class of ...\n\nResearchers of the Chemical Engineering department and the Kavli institute of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands have demonstrated that electrons can move freely in layers of linked semiconductor nanoparticles don't understand people who boo green technology. From what I can tell, even though it cannot be used as a reliable constant baseload energy source, it works on a domestic level for individual homes. To boo it altogether seems as little Luddite-ish. I would have edited my previous comment but I ran out of time.\n\nIf they increase solar cell 300% they will be close to a coal power plant.\n\nComparing this efficiency to burning a lump of coal does no good for the point you are trying to make. That is everyone should want energy to be relatively cheap. Like many \"green\" sources, solar PV is more expensive than conventional existing electricity production for most cases, especially in dealing with the nagging problems of night and shortened winter or cloudy days. Yet better & cheaper solar is a needed part of an overall energy plan, even if this one finds it's home primarily in our electronic \"toys\".\n\nNot to worry - in a few years, there will be so much demand for graphene that there will be a carbon shortage.

      "text": "Study: Sunflowers Could Supply Hydrogen Fuel\n\nOne of these days you might find yourself tooling down the highway in a car that runs on flower power.\n\nOr maybe not.\n\nBut at least that's the goal of British researchers who say they have come up with a way to extract hydrogen from sunflower oil — the same stuff you might put on your salad — which in turn could be used as the fuel of the future, powering everything from our cars to our cell phones.\n\nHydrogen holds great promise as a clean-burning fuel that could free us forever from fossil fuels. But it has been hyped so much recently that it is often seen as the answer to all our energy problems so we don't need to worry about potentially catastrophic global oil shortages.\n\nDon't bet on it.\n\nThere are nightmares associated with the acquisition and distribution of hydrogen that could kill this dream in its infancy. Despite the fact that hydrogen is found just about everywhere, it doesn't travel alone. And separating it from other elements, such as oxygen, requires processes that also use energy.\n\nAnd where does that energy normally come from? It is produced by burning fossil fuels — the stuff we're trying to get away from — in processes that use more energy than the extracted hydrogen is likely to produce. That's called a net energy loser, and until someone solves that problem hydrogen power isn't going to go anywhere.\n\nWhat If …\n\nYet, there is a glimmer of hope. Researchers around the globe are fine tuning a \"breakthrough,\" if we dare use that overworked word, that came out of Japan a quarter of a century ago. It just may be possible to get all the hydrogen we need by using ordinary sunlight to drive something called \"artificial photosynthesis.\"\n\nKenichi Honda and Akira Fujishima were researching photochemical processes at the University of Tokyo in the late 1960s when they made a remarkable discovery. They hooked an electrode coated with titanium dioxide to another electrode coated with platinum and exposed it to sunlight.\n\nIn a process that is similar to photosynthesis, by which living cells use sunlight to grow, the researchers were able to split water into its two components, hydrogen and oxygen. Honda and Fujishima announced their findings in what has been called a \"milestone paper\" in 1971, for which they recently received the 2004 Japan Prize for their pioneering work.\n\nEver since then scientists and engineers around the world have been trying to build upon that early research and create machines that can carry out artificial photosynthesis and produce hydrogen efficiently enough to make it worth the effort. If we're going to switch to a hydrogen economy we're going to need lots of the stuff, and we can't pave the planet with solar collectors to get it.\n\nIt seems to be one of those situations where all the right pieces are there, but putting them together has been a real challenge.\n\nTitanium dioxide, for example, is readily available. It's probably in the toothpaste you used this morning. It's found in beach sand, and certain rocks, and it's widely used as a whitening agent in everything from paint to cosmetics.\n\nAnd of course there's no shortage of water. So all you need is sunshine, and where can you find a lot of that? How about Australia?"

      "text": "While any photosynthetic organism contains PSI, the researchers chose to work with algae.\n\nMolecular structures extracted from plants could become the key both for making electrons out of sunlight and hydrogen for fuel cells, a concept that's continuously being explored by scientists.\n\nIn an interview, biochemist Barry D. Bruce of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville told EcoSeed that a key protein complex (or photosystem) in photosynthesis known as photosystem-I or PSI can be extracted and integrated in devices that either convert light into electricity or that produce hydrogen fuel when exposed to sunlight.\n\nIf it works out well, these kinds of devices can satisfy low-power energy needs such as small electronics, or can be sources of low-cost power for developing countries.\n\nConverting light to power\n\nMr. Bruce is a professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Tennessee. He is a leading faculty at the university's Bredesen Center for Interdisciplinary Research and Graduate Education, a joint UT-Oak Ridge National Laboratory academic unit.\n\nWith colleagues from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the 'Ecole Polytechnique F'ed'erale de Lausanne in Switzerland, he recently released a paper describing their work with PSI.\n\n\"We take out the components that are the basis for photosynthesis,\" Mr. Bruce explained to EcoSeed. \"Then we integrate them - through a relatively simple step - into an inorganic semiconductor known as titanium oxide.\"\n\nMr. Bruce said they bioengineer the PSI complex to self-assemble and bond with the titanium oxide semiconductor material in a relatively simple process.\n\nWhile any photosynthetic organism contains PSI, the researchers chose to work with blue-green algae because it's easier to work with and is also thermophilic, or capable of living in and withstanding very high temperatures.\n\nAccording to Mr. Bruce, the PSI preserves its biological activity and, when exposed to photons of light, they generate and transfer electrons into the semiconductor material and produce electricity.\n\nAlthough many other researchers have used photosystems for solar power generation (see EcoSeed articles here, here and here), this is the first time scientists used titanium.\n\nThough the current technology only has an efficiency of about .08 percent, or almost one in a thousand photons getting converted into electrons, Mr. Bruce is confident that this can be improved to the point that devices using PSI could be a relatively low-cost alternative to current solar energy generating technology.\n\n\"We've proven that we can do it better and easier. Easier is one of the more important things,\" said Mr. Bruce.\n\n\"The idea is, if you're ever going to make things cheap, it has to be easy,\" he explained. \"I think the fact that the technology is capable of self-assembly is a really good breakthrough.\"\n\nProducing hydrogen\n\nBut this is not the first time Mr. Bruce worked with PSI in chemical systems to revolutionize alternative energy sources. In 2009, he led a team of researchers from UT Knoxville and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to use PSI as part of a catalyst for the production of hydrogen fuel.\n\nMuch like how they now combine PSI with titanium oxide, Mr. Bruce and his colleagues coupled PSI with a platinum catalyst to produce a steady supply of hydrogen when it is exposed to light.\n\n\"We demonstrated a very robust, self-organized nanoparticle that - if you shine light on it - makes hydrogen,\" said Mr. Bruce.\n\nAccording to Mr. Bruce, not only was the nanoparticle robust and easy to assemble, it also demonstrated an ability to keep producing hydrogen over a long period of time.\n\n\"We worked with it for over three months, and it kept making hydrogen all that time,\" he said.\n\nPhotosystems have actually been used previously to produce hydrogen, the point being to mimic plant photosynthesis to produce the needed resource. (See a related EcoSeed story here). The problem has been the huge cost of platinum.\n\nBut currently, for both hydrogen production and solar energy production, another goal is to increase the amount of fuel and energy that can be generated by the systems.\n\n\"We're trying to make it where we can absorb more solar radiation. Right now, we only take in a small portion of the sun's light - that which the plants absorb - but maybe we can expand that to absorb more wavelengths of light,\" said Mr. Bruce.\n\nSolar quote provider Here at Solar Quote Provider we provide a central hub for consumers to search and compare renewable energy installers and find a wealth of information as well as direct access to our renewable energy experts."

      "text": "Research priorities are indeed cyclical. In the 1980s, Oak Ridge National Laboratory was a leader in the development of solar-cell fabrication techniques. The work's focus was laser processing, using light from a pulsed high-power laser instead of high-temperature heat to create solar cells. For a brief time in 1986 under Richard Wood's leadership, ORNL's 19.5% single-crystal silicon solar cell fabricated with laser processing held the world record for efficiency in converting sunlight's energy into electrical energy.\n\nAfter 1987, the programmatic direction of the Department of Energy, and subsequently ORNL, changed. The Laboratory abandoned research on photovoltaics, or PV. Twenty years later, the challenges of the changing energy sector are putting ORNL back into the PV business.\n\nDOE's Solar America Initiative recognizes that materials researchers at ORNL and other national labs could help industry raise solar-cell efficiencies and lower the costs of manufacturing PV materials and devices. As a result, ORNL researchers are encouraged to request funding for solar projects.\n\nThrough a project sponsored by ORNL's Laboratory Directed Research and Development program, researchers led by Ron Ott demonstrated that pulsed thermal processing using the Laboratory's plasma arc lamp could increase the collection efficiency of thin-film amorphous silicon solar cells by introducing a nanocrystalline microstructure within the amorphous material. As a result of this successful LDRD-funded collaboration with a leading manufacturer of thin-film amorphous silicon solar cells, the ORNL researchers received funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Their mission for DARPA is to help develop methods to increase solar-cell efficiencies on polymer substrates, reduce fabrication costs and improve productivity.\n\nThis type of thin-film solar cell is fabricated using amorphous silicon-germanium alloys consisting of three layers. Amorphous, or noncrystalline, materials are considerably cheaper to manufacture but are less efficient than standard crystalline silicon solar cells. The top layer is pure amorphous silicon, while the underlying layers consist of different silicon-germanium alloys. Each layer absorbs a different portion of the solar wavelength range.\n\nThe amorphous silicon-germanium layers are deposited on a metal substrate along with a transparent conducting layer that forms the topside electrical contact, as well as an anti-reflective coating that reduces the amount of light reflected from the cell. The entire device is placed under a protective cover layer. All the cells are then connected to make a PV module.\n\nThe Oak Ridge team believes the solar cells' efficiency might be improved by changing the amorphous silicon to nanocrystalline silicon. To explore this idea in the DARPA project, Ott will \"flash\" amorphous silicon thin-film specimens with the plasma arc lamp.\n\n\"We have shown that pulsed thermal processing will initiate solid-phase crystallization, which will introduce a nanocrystalline structure with fewer defects and higher efficiencies,\" says Ott, ORNL's program manager for solar energy technologies. \"Our process will produce a purer structure faster than what an in-situ, deposition process can provide.\"\n\nORNL seeks funding from DOE to work with Georgia Institute of Technology on improving the university's process for increasing the efficiency of multicrystalline silicon solar cells. Georgia Tech researchers add to multicrystalline ribbon—grown silicon cells a hydrogen—containing silicon nitride antireflective layer. The researchers have tried using currently available rapid thermal annealing to drive the hydrogen from the antireflective layer into the multicrystalline silicon to \"passivate,\" or reduce, defects and increase electron travel distances.\n\n\"They found their process cannot heat silicon nitride to high enough temperatures fast enough to force the hydrogen into the multicrystalline silicon,\" Ott says. \"Pulsed thermal processing has higher heating rates and higher processing temperatures that should take the material to the next level in efficiency.\"\n\nThe findings are encouraging enough to warrant further funding. To characterize these new PV materials, ORNL has invested in the Center for Advanced Thin-film Solar Cells, managed by Jay Jellison. The center will house several instruments to measure solar-cell efficiency, spectral response, thin-film thickness and other parameters used to evaluate the recordbreaking potential of PV materials.—Carolyn Krause"

      "text": "Recent reports from university researchers highlight work in developing more energy-efficient, energy-generating, and environmentally sound technologies for treating wastewater. While these technologies are still being tested, the research suggests realistic potential for changing how future wastewater treatment plants are designed and operated.\n\nFuel cell technologies Engineers at Oregon State University (OSU) in Corvallis, Ore., recently announced a breakthrough in the performance of microbial fuel cells that can produce electricity directly from wastewater. The new technology can now produce 10 to 50 times the electricity per volume than most other approaches using microbial fuel cells, researchers said, and 100 times more electricity than some. This eventually could replace the activated sludge process that has been in use for almost a century Experts estimate that about 3 percent of the electrical energy consumed in the United States and other developed countries is used to treat wastewater.\n\nWith new concepts – reduced anode-cathode spacing, evolved microbes, and new separator materials – the technology can now produce more than 2 kilowatts per cubic meter of liquid reactor volume. This amount of power density far exceeds anything else done with microbial fuel cells.\n\nThe OSU system has now been proven at a substantial scale in the laboratory, Liu said, and the next step is a pilot study. Once advances are made to reduce high initial costs, researchers estimate that the capital construction costs of this new technology should be comparable to that of the activated sludge systems now in widespread use today – and even less expensive when future sales of excess electricity are factored in.\n\nIn this new technology, bacteria oxidize the organic matter and, in the process, produce electrons that run from the anode to the cathode within the fuel cell, creating an electrical current. Almost any type of organic waste material can be used to produce electricity, including grass straw, animal waste, and byproducts from operations such as the wine, beer, or dairy industries.\n\nOn a smaller scale, Caitlyn Shea Butler, a civil engineering professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, has designed and is now field-testing a \"green latrine\" that purifies human waste, turning it into compost for farming and generating electricity. Her multipurpose invention is called a \"Microbial Fuel Cell Latrine.\"\n\nButler's latrine is similar to a fuel cell where a fuel is oxidized at an anode and an oxidant is reduced at a cathode. After solid wastes are first filtered in a composting chamber, dissolved waste organic matter is oxidized in an anode chamber. Oxidation is assisted by bacteria on the anode surface and uses the anode as an electron acceptor to complete their metabolic reaction. Electrons released in this biological process are conveyed through a load-bearing circuit, producing electricity, to the cathode compartment. There a different community of bacteria uses the cathode as an electron donor, capturing the energy from the electrons, to reduce harmful nitrates in the waste stream.\n\nButler said her inexpensive green latrine can be deployed in places such as rural Africa, transforming the way human waste is treated in areas where sanitation facilities are poor or nonexistent. At the same time, the device can play a key role in preventing waterborne diseases, including diarrhea.\n\nThe primary nitrogen compound found in human waste is ammonium, which can be broken down by oxidation, or nitrification. In Butler's latrine, nitrification takes place thanks to bacteria living in an intermediate chamber that separates the anode and cathode chambers. The result is effluent water that is quite low in organic matter and nutrients.\n\nRemoving phosphorus A professor at Michigan State University is part of a team developing a new method of removing phosphorous from wastewater – a problem seriously affecting lakes and streams across the country. Steven Safferman, an associate professor of biosystems and agricultural engineering, and colleagues at Columbus, Ohio-based MetaMateria Technologies, are devising a cost-effective way of recovering the phosphorous, which then can be reused for fertilizer products.\n\nDuring the last 10 years, MetaMateria Technologies and Safferman have tested methods to produce a media, enhanced with nanoparticles composed of iron, that can more efficiently remove larger amounts of phosphorous from water.\n\n\"Phosphorous that is dissolved in wastewater is hard to remove,\" Safferman said. \"We found that a nano-media made with waste iron can efficiently absorb it, making it a solid that can be easily and efficiently removed and recovered for beneficial reuse.\"\n\nThe material should be commercially available for use within two years, said J. Richard Schorr, MetaMateria CEO. \"Phosphorous is a finite material,\" Schorr said, \"Analyses show that the supply of phosphorous may become limited within the next 25 to 50 years. This is an economical way to harvest and recycle phosphorous"

(Source: Purdue University)\n\nPictures of the alloy in water, reacting to produce hydrogen, as evidenced by bubbling. (Source: Purdue University)\n\nThe byproduct of the process is a recyclable mix of aluminum and gallium-indium-tin ores. (Source: Purdue University)\n\nHere a Purdue researcher uses the hydrogen produced by the process to power an internal combustion engine. (Source: Purdue University)\n\nWhile some hydrogen research focuses on simulating nature, a new metal reagent developed by Purdue University promises economic viability\n\nJerry Woodall, a distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue University, is firmly ground in the world of commercial production. When he began researching ways to improve hydrogen production using aluminum reagents, his goal was simple -- if it wasn't commercially viable, it wasn't a success.\n\nFortunately Purdue's Woodall developed a more down to Earth method of hydrogen production that promises a feasible infrastructure and short term commercial viability. Woodall states, \"We now have an economically viable process for producing hydrogen\non-demand for vehicles, electrical generating stations and other\napplications.\"\n\nThe key to the method is a new aluminum reagent, which Woodall invented. The new reagent is composed of 95 percent aluminum and then a critical 5 percent mixture of gallium, indium and tin to improve its reactive character. Previous similar alloys used far more gallium, which is very expensive. By cutting down the gallium, Woodall greatly reduced the costs of hydrogen production.\n\nWhen the new alloy is exposed to water, it reacts to create hydrogen gas and oxygen. The oxygen then bonds to the aluminum to form aluminum oxide, also known as alumina. It is cheaper to recycle alumina back to aluminum than it is to refine aluminum from bauxite ore, which is another element contributing to its efficiency. Woodall illuminates, \"After recycling both the aluminum oxide back to aluminum and the inert\ngallium-indium-tin alloy only 60 times, the cost of producing energy\nboth as hydrogen and heat using the technology would be reduced to 10\ncents per kilowatt hour, making it competitive with other energy\ntechnologies.\"\n\nControl of the microscopic structure of the solid aluminum and the gallium-indium-tin alloy mixture is critical to the technology's success. The mixture is a \"two-phase\" mixture, meaning that it features abrupt changes in composition between one constituent to another. Woodall explains this challenge stating, \"This is because the mixture tends to resist forming entirely as a\nhomogeneous solid due to the different crystal structures of the\nelements in the alloy and the low melting point of the\ngallium-indium-tin alloy. I can form a one-phase melt of liquid aluminum and the\ngallium-indium-tin alloy by heating it. But when I cool it down, most\nof the gallium-indium-tin alloy is not homogeneously incorporated into\nthe solid aluminum, but remains a separate phase of liquid. The constituents separate into two phases just like ice and liquid water.\"\n\nResearchers had two options -- fast cooling to leave separate alloys or slow cooling to yield a single solid alloy brick. At first they tried fast cooling, which required a puddle of gallium-indium-tin to initiate the reaction. However, when they turned to the slow-cooled alloy, they were impressed to discover that it reacted just as well, or better, eliminating the need for the liquid gallium-indium-tin alloy. Woodall adds, \"That was a fantastic discovery. What used to be a curiosity is now a real alternative energy technology.\"\n\nThe Purdue team is currently completing work on developing a production method to produce briquettes of the alloy. These briquettes could be dropped into a tank of water, producing pure hydrogen. This would eliminate both the need for hydrogen storage and hydrogen transportation, two critical obstacles for the hydrogen industry.\n\nThe gallium-indium-tin alloy in the process is inert and is able to be recovered with almost 100 percent efficiency. Woodall says even the less efficient aluminum recycling produces much less carbon emissions than traditional fuel. He states, \"The aluminum oxide is recycled back into aluminum using the currently\npreferred industrial process called the Hall-Héroult process, which\nproduces one-third as much carbon dioxide as combusting gasoline in an\nengine.\"\n\nIn order to fully realize the technology on a national scale for fuel use, alumina recycling infrastructure would need to be dramatically expanded. Additionally, gallium-indium-tin recycling would need to be added. This infrastructure would be expensive, but according to Woodall \"the economic risk is large, but the potential payoff is also large.\"\n\nWoodall won the 2001 National Medal of Technology, the highest award for technological achievement in the U.S. Woodall his fellow researchers will present their findings on Feb. 26, 2008 at the Materials Innovations in an Emerging Hydrogen Economy conference in Cocoa Beach, Fla. The alloy production process's primary patent title is owned by the Purdue Research Foundation. Purdue has licensed the technology to an Indiana startup company, AlGalCo LLC., which Purdue hopes will be the first company to implement the technology commercially.\n\nPurdue's solution is similar to the University of Leeds' new method of producing hydrogen from biofuel waste sludge, in that both solutions are economically feasible, but require the development of production infrastructures. However the new method from Purdue can make hydrogen from a far more plentiful source -- pure water.\n\nComments\n\nThreshold\n\nUsername\n\nPassword\n\nremember me\n\nThis article is over a month old, voting and posting comments is disabled\n\nit takes a LOT of energy to refine bauxite into aluminum. While recycling of the used material will eventually become the norm for this process, it will require a HUGE investment in mining and refining initially. Transportation of the mass quantities of recycled material will require energy (how much hydrogen is produced from a 50,000 pound truckload of aluminum alloy?) Also, aluminum is a widely used building material (cans, jet airliners, etc) so there will be an impact on the world market of aluminum prices if this hits wide production. What impact will this have on the economy? I don't believe we want to fall into the same trap as we are with ethanol, competing with an industrial food crop (corn) for fuel.\n\nthat's a good point, you can easily pipe hydrogen in a gas form I suppose, unless there's some technical problem with hydrogen transports that I'm unaware of...but I think their idea is to have the material at the gas station (for lack of a better term) and use piped water to make the hydrogen, which there's already an infrastructure for. But, water is not plentiful everywhere. This won't be as popular in dry states like California, Arizona, New Mexico, Wyoming, etc. Many of these states are facing large water crisis' of their own. Using that water to make fuel rather than for consumption, industry, or agriculture has issues. If this process could be adapted to be used with sea water that would be the \"gold ring\" in my book.\n\nSea water shouldn't be a problem, since it's water and aluminum that react. Though, there could always be other side reactions with salts and iodine in sea water they would have to test for. You can distill all that out of sea water, but that does cost a bit.\n\nThe beauty of using hydrogen too is that it just reacts with oxygen to form water all over again.\n\nvery good technical analysis, but if it was adapted to be used with sea water, wouldn't that open things up to someone crazy just dropping a truckload of these \"brickettes\" into...\n\n1) the ocean. turn the ocean into gaseous components, thusly destroying the world.\n\n2) more viable. drop a truckload of bricks into the cooling lakes for nuclear plants (or any others for that matter that use water from nearby lakes) decreasing water levels critically quickly and then causing shutdowns/blackouts minimum, meltdown maximum?\n\n3) a tiny bottle of water and creating a water grenade on an airplane - kablooie!\n\nI think the amount of alloy you'd need to convert a reservoir or cooling pond would draw notice...see my analysis below. Either way, I doubt it would happen so fast that it would lead to a catastrophic meltdown of a nuclear electric plant. likewise any doomsday scenario of converting the ocean to gas. That's the idea behind using seawater instead of freshwater, sewater is so much more abundant.\n\nDo you even begin to realize how much aluminum it would take to \"boil away\" (react with) even a small lake of water? To react with just 50 tons of water (45,359,237 grams, or 2,519,957.6 moles) you'd need about 50 tons of aluminum (since very 2 moles of aluminum react with 3 moles of water). Now, 50 tons of water is the amount an adult blue whale swallows in a single gulp--not much at all in the grand scheme of things. Consider it takes about 1000 tons of water to grow 1 ton of grain and you'll begin to see you'd need so much raw, refined aluminum to even begin to affect the amount of water in this world substantially that it's not even funny.\n\nBut then, you do realize that the hydrogen will (if not captured and put to work as in say a fuel cell) just react with oxygen to form water all over again? It's because hydrogen and oxygen have such a low free energy for forming water that you don't find raw hydrogen naturally occurring anywhere on the globe.\n\nAlso, reacting water in a bottle into hydrogen would make a nice loud \"boom\" with the bottle finally burst, but that's it. It wouldn't be enough to take out a plane.\n\nThe genius of this system is that you don't need to really transport Hydrogen. Just solids. Then, at any filling location just drop this into local water and poof hydrogen at some predetermined wieght.\n\nIsn't storage of hydrogen one of the biggest challenges preventing the use of hydrogen? This neatly transfer the problem to storage of semi-reactive metals and water, both which we have solutions too....\n\nBecause hydrogen leaks out of everything in gaseous state. It will actually leak out of a sealed gas bottle. The atoms are so small they permeate everything. A weld or joint that is liquid tight will probably not be hydrogen tight. Keeping it liquid would be a nightmare as well.\n\nI'm no chemist, but I don't think hydrogen can leak through solid metal. A joint yes. But if you put hydrogen in a sealed metal container, I don't see it getting out.\n\nRegardless of the practicality of this, the real problem is getting the oil industries to embrace it. Because really, they're the ones who have to. The government isn't going to put down the cash to replace oil. It's not really their business to either. And the oil industry is really the only ones with the billions it'll cost to convert our gasoline base infrastructure to a hydrogen one.\n\nEven if it does happen, then the only downside is that a car is going to go far fewer miles on a gasoline tank sized hydrogen fuel cell than it would go on the tank of gas since you have to use a lot more hydrogen to get the same bang as with gas.\n\nI don't think it'd leak out at a rate of or in the sense of noticable loss of volume during piping. It'll just slowly destroy the pipes. It is a potential issue, which is why this reactive alloy technology is so cool and great.\n\nYou are right you aren't. Hydrogen diffuses through \"solids\" at fairly low temperatures. The diffusion constant is just proportional to temperature, so at 300K it isn't what it is at say 600K but if you are going to have a lot of it, a lot of it will get out. Hydrogen is one of the hardest things to hold on to.\n\nAren't pipelines always being tested for microcracks (etc)? Seems like things would leak. But it's more than that, recall that for energy density the hydrogen has to be at really high pressures, something an oil pipeline wouldn't have been built for. Hydrogen also may be a bit more volatile than crude oil.\n\nAll gases create pressure vessal situations. To create the required density through put of Hydrogen, well, the gas will need to be at significant pressure. That pressure will put alot of strain (that is signiciantly different than Oil mass loading) on current pipe lengths and joints. The pumping mechanisms that work well for oil, they are not the most efficient for Hydrogen.\n\nThen, the \"last mile\" that takes the hydrogen to \"filling station\"... the truck would need to be very strong indeed to withstand the PSI. To get current amount of energy storage as in a modern gastank type volume... that volume would be at 10,000 psi!. Aircraft typically operate at ~10 psi interal gage pressure for a point of reference.\n\nSorry folks, entire pipeline/gasoline infrastructure would need to be examined, reanalyzed, and potentially replaced to use it for Hydrogen transportation. Thats before Hydrogen Embrittlement and other issues.\n\nMy take on this one is shown in the photo ... You fill the car's tank with water, drop in a few briquettes and drive away. Remember the biggest headache in desingning an H2 powered car is how to store the fuel safely.\n\nFilling Stations will sell briquettes and water instead of gasoline and diesel. Transportation of the alumina to the Filling Stations is much easier and safer than oil. Trains can carry bulk alumina, a good way to recycle the current fleet of coal trains :) Hopper trucks will deliver the final mile. Several designs for this kind of load exist. One is for potatos and simply scoops from the bottom of a hopper out the back gate. Another is the classic dump truck...Just back up to the briquette bin and upend the bed :)\n\nFilling Stations will also buy back spent briquettes and send them back to the recycling center. The current recycler infrastructure will also welcome this new commodity that will need to be collected and returned for refining.\n\nThe H2 generator will need some refinement for use with 'dirty' water but that is a refinement that will be improved on in years to come.\n\nIn arid areas this will be a problem due to water shortage, but I can forsee \"fuel\" pipelines carrying water to \"fueling depots\"/tank farms and \"fuel\" trucks delivering water to Filling Stations just as is done today with petroleum fuels.\n\nI don't think you'll have a \"spent briquette\" left after you put this alloy on a tub of water. To react all of the aluminum you'd be breaking down the alloy atom by atom, so you'd likely be left with a slurry of alumina and other metals. This would then need to be resmelted to remove the metals, process the alumina back to aluminum, and then resmelt the alloy.\n\nTo get this started several small scale factories are set up to process recycled aluminium into pellets of reactant and to reprocess spent reactant. Ideal sites would be existing recycling facilities or, if it can be done small scale, existing filling stations.\n\nThese pellets are then loaded into small ~5-10kg canisters with an inlet for water and an outlet for hydrogen. The canisters could be made from a material with a sufficiently higher melting point than the fuel so that the canister could be used as a crucible in which the spent fuel is melted.\n\nAs you drive water is added to the canister to produce hydrogen. The hydrogen could either be used to top up a bank of capacitors and batteries via a fuel cell or burnt in an internal combustion process or both in a hybrid drive-train. Either way you would have a vehicle with a hydrogen fuel line supplied by the canisters output and a water tank whose size would be governed by the power-to-weight ratio of the vehicle. Since a canister would have a maximum output the minimum number of canister ports would be governed by the maximum hydrogen output required at peak load. The problem of filling up with water is much less of an issue as water is the output of both hydrogen combustion and fuel-cells. This 'waste' is simply recycled from the exhaust though occasional top ups would be necessary as it is unlikely that every water molecule successfully reacts to produce one alumina and two hydrogen atoms or that each hydrogen atom successfully binds to form a water molecule. However, it might be possible to minimise losses by using a liquid oxygen tank (hmmm... liquid oxygen direct injection internal combustion engine, could work underwater or in vacuum) but I digress.\n\nWhen the reactant is depleted you simply replace the empty canister. Obviously any vehicle would have to have at least two of these replaceable fuel tanks. If peak output was more than a single can could provide then the minimum is three but range would be poor. Exceeding this max load +1 minimum would increase vehicle range. The +1 minimum exists because it is wasteful to dispense of a can before it is depleted and you cannot guarantee that you will run out of fuel at a filling station. In my twelve years on driving this has only happened to me once, I stopped at a diesel only pump in a petrol car and had to push it to the next one.\n\nUsed cans would be emptied, cleaned and refilled with pellets made from the waste product ideally in small automated micro-factory at filling stations.\n\nAs for the size of the tanks, well that would depend but keeping them under 10kg would help.\n\nOnce the infrastructure was in place there would be very little need for additional raw materials except to allow for surplus stock and cope with an expanding fleet and lost cans. Most of this could be obtained from recycled materials.\n\nWhether this model is feasible depends on how far you can get in a typical car on this fuel, maybe it only scales up to portable electronics or down to heavy haulage. The inventors clearly believe it is commercially viable and I think this is an elegant and efficient way of doing it without the need for quarries or pipelines.\n\nWe have to mine aluminum anyways for cans, cars, planes, etc. It's also the most abundant metal in the earth's crust, so what metal would be better, and why would this process affect the economy that much? As with any new tech, you have to have to invest a lot to get it started, how is that different from anything else?\n\nAlumina has the formula of Al2O3, so that for every 2 aluminum atoms, you'll make 3 molecules of hydrogen gas (H2). That being, 2 tons of aluminum should make 3 tons of hydrogen gas. You still need a relatively small amount of that inert catalyst in the alloy too, and that actually will be the most expensive part according to what they say.\n\nStill, after 60 recycles, it comes out to 10 cents per kilowatt hour to pay for this technology, and recycling is almost 100% efficient? It's pretty dang good, better than most things, and thus it is commercially viable.\n\nso it takes 54 tons of aluminum to make 6 tons of hydrogen gas (9 truckloads of aluminum to make 1 truckload of Hydrogen, roughly) and that's discounting the weight of the catalyst material.\n\nseems its much cheaper to ship the gas than the new alloy. and the AL2O3 is about twice the weight of the original allow by adding the oxygen. So you're creating roughly 18 truckloads of used material to be recycled, assuming a closed loop system where only the aluminum oxide from the fuel station is used to make the alloy down the line. If its isn't, then you add a third leg to the transport loop where the refined aluminum is taken somewhere to be made into the alloy. It seems far easier to ship the hydrogen by truck or pipe, on the surface. As I said, there may be some unknowns in piping hydrogen gas I'm unaware of.\n\nShipping the gas is actually rather difficult. You have to pressurize it into a liquid as H2's gas volume is 0.08988 g/L (the greatest there is, after all). Furthermore, H2 only goes into liquid form at around 2-4 kelvin (or -271 to -269 degrees C). The new honda fuel cell car has to pressurize to 5,000 psi for 171 liters I believe it was. On top of this, being that hydrogen is just two protons and two electrons, it can pass through most materials, including metal, which can lead to steel becoming brittle and failing.\n\nNow, how much hydrogen do you actually need to produce a certain amount of power via a fuel cell? If the new honda really does use 171 liters for... was it 270 miles? Since liquid hydrogen is 0.070 kg/L, you have 13.2 kg of hydrogen in one of those cars and 1 metric ton = 1000 kg, so 1 ton of liquid H2 could fuel 75 of those cars for 270 miles (if I got the car's figures right). Doesn't seem like too much for 1 ton? If there's \"About 450 million passenger cars travel the streets and roads of the world\" as of 2001 (  ), you'd need 6,000,000 tons of H2 (or 54,000,000 ons of aluminum) to power them for 270 miles (if they were all that honda fuel cell car). That seems like a lot, except cars output 6.9 billion metric tons in of CO2 in 2004 (  ) into the air per year, so you can imagine how many tons of oil and gas we consume. So it seems roughly on par then. I don't have time to really finish the calculations (how much gas do we consume? How far does the average car drive per year? etc) as I have to go.\n\nI think that puts things in perspective? Should check my work to make sure. But, it will certainly take a TON (haha) of aluminum to fuel such an economy--but shouldn't be anything more than what we have to spend on gas?, and thankfully aluminum is the most abundant metal in the crust. No one said making energy to fuel our life styles would be a cake walk ;)\n\nI estimate the average driver's personal car is about 14-15,000 miles a year. Possibly more than that for business ues. assuing 13.2 kg = 270 miles, 15,000 a year, that's 733 kg per vehicle, per year. If you assume it takes 2 weeks to complete a circuit in the recycling loop (just a wild guess) you need 1/26 of that in kg to power that car, or about 28kg per car. multiply that by 450million, you get 12,692,307,692 kg or about 12.7 million metric tons of the worlds aluminum wrapped up in the loop., which according to world-aluminum,org, is a little more than the total amount scrap recycled in 1998.\n\nAnother way of looking at it is that if the 11.6 million tons of aluminum recycled in 1998 fulfilled 40% of the world's demand for aluminum, then that demand was 29 million tons for the year. Cars using 12.7 million tons would make the 1998 levels of world demand for aluminum increase by 70% to 41.7 million tons. Quite the jump in world demand, if this was done for all cars, instantly, overnight. Fortunately, the switch would obviously be gradual. However, one thing to consider is how much new aluminum would have to be added to the system per year, over what would be recycled (loss in conversion, increase in cars, how much we can expand our recycling abilities by)? That I can't begin to speculate on, but it would certainly be less and less with each year, so the picture only gets better as time goes on.\n\nSo, on the one hand, based on 1998's standards, our aluminum infrastructure would be strained a bit by the demand if all the cars in the world switched to hydrogen produced by this aluminum alloy reagent right at this moment. Sure, we could put all our recycled amounts immediately into it, but that'd leave all the other sectors needing mined aluminum, meaning an increase of 40% in mining would have to be done. By 1998's standards. However, on the other hand, this isn't going to happen over night for all the cars of the world instantly.\n\nBut then, compared to how much gasoline we consume, the amount of aluminum it would take to run our cars on hydrogen via this method would be nothing. Nothing at all, in comparison. By the time this method became wide spread, our infrastructure would be more than capable of handling it (recycling is what would go up mostly, after the initial load of raw aluminum gradually leaked into the hydrogen production pool). Again, none of this would happen over night.\n\nOur figures are probably pretty far off from reality, but they give a good perspective and picture. Just looking at that gasoline consumption.. always leaves me shaking my head in awe. Still, the biggest cost factor, especially initially, will be that 5 percent mixture of gallium, indium and tin. If we use 12.7 million tons of aluminum, that'd be 635,000 tons of that stuff (it can be nearly 100% recycled too, thankfully).\n\nIn any case, this has been very interesting to research. Thank you for getting me on this kick. Ultimately, we'll just have to see what comes in the future--if this stuff gets commercialized well, if it is presented to the market in a competitive way against gasoline (i.e. how it's priced and how that changes over time), and how the technology matures.\n\nVery true, which I am unable to take into consideration in my calculations, unfortunately. But that is an extremely important point, and why this tech is so very cool. Reusable and renewable in almost every sense.\n\nFrom the post I just made: \"Therefore, in the United States, something like 400 million gallons (1.51 billion liters) of gasoline gets consumed every day\" (  ) which then comes to 1.1 million tons of gasoline used by the US alone per day. Quite a bit more than the aluminum we'd need, even if we couldn't recycle it!\n\nquote: The oxygen then bonds to the aluminum to form aluminum oxide, also known as alumina. It is cheaper to recycle alumina back to aluminum than it is to refine aluminum from bauxite ore, which is another element contributing to its efficiency.\n\nYour very first con does not apply to this tech. Converting the alumina back to aluminum is cheaper than bauxite(at least, according to the article), however I'd like to see the comparison of those two conversions quantified, as that would really put this into perspective.\n\nSecondly: What is the likely energy source for turning the alumina back into aluminium? Answer -- the usual suspects (used in current aluminium production): hydroelectricity, nuclear, fossil fuels. The synthetic photosynthesis development is a far more interesting development.\n\nThirdly (and following on from the above): What is the advantage of this process compared to the current main sources of hydrogen (steam reformation of petrochemicals, electrolysis of water, etc.)? In particular, if alumina is being reprocessed using power from coal/petrochemical sources, how is this new process an improvement on steam reformation of petrochemicals?\n\nI too would like to see come comparisons. I'd want to see energy budget and pollution comparisons with the other H2 production systems before accepting this as an advance forward (at the moment I'd call it an advance sideways).\n\nThose are some very good points that have to be looked at in evaluating this potential technology.\n\nThe first point is easy to address at least. You are absolutely right it isn't a catalyst, however, the aluminum isn't \"used up\" into an unusable form, but simply must be reconverted. That is, nothing is lost physically (theoretically, but it'll never be 100% and some aluminum will slip from our notice along the way, even if just by human choice).\n\nNow, the really important question that sums everything up is how much energy will we get back from the evolved hydrogen verses how much energy is used to turn alumina and raw ore (whatever ratios of both are needed to keep up our supplies) into aluminum? I haven't the foggiest in answering that. But that seems to me to be the real clincher in deciding if this is viable or not.\n\nThird: This process is far more efficient than any yet. That is, as the inventor stated (though I don't know how he calculated it) after 60 recycles it'll cost us only 10 cents to produce a kilowatt hour of energy from this technology. That is very cost effective. It's like a fluorescent light bulb verses incandescent: the former is more expensive initially, but over time pays for itself and even saves you money if you have it around long enough. I think that's the crux of this technology, though I can't even start to evaluate if the inventor's claims are true. Still, it's the most viable and commercially competitive way of producing hydrogen yet (all other techs will take quite a while longer to reach the point were they may be commercially possible, let alone viable), or so it would appear.\n\nOk, here's something. Talking about theoretical maximums in energy production from hydrogen (notice, these values can never be reached because of inefficiencies in capturing and transferring energy, and heat loss): the energy produced by the formation of water is 400 kJ/mol. So, say we have 6 metric tons of hydrogen (from 54 tons of aluminum). That gives us 3,000,000 moles, so reacting all of that to water would give off 1,200,000,000 kJ of energy. Since Joules Per kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 3.6*10^6, we get 333,333 kilowatt-hours from this 1 ton of hydrogen.\n\nNow Chernobyl68 pointed out \"it takes some 15.7 kWh of electricity to produce one kilogram of aluminium from alumina\". So to recycle 54 tons (54,000 kg) it would take 847,800 kilowatt hours. Therefore, in the end, we would lose 514,467 kilowatt hours . That's how much we'd have to put into this process to keep it going. Since the average cost of electricity is something like 10¢/kWh in the U.S. (  ), roughly anyways, that's $51,446.70 we'd be spending on energy to make 6 tons of hydrogen if all of the hydrogen's energy was being put right back into the grid and recaptured. A complete waste to do that.\n\nLooking at it from another way for cars (and a more practical way, since the energy from the hydrogen isn't going back into the electrical grid if it's being used in a car), it costs $2,520 per 1 ton of aluminum (  ), or $136,080 to buy the 54 tons we used to make 6 tons of hydrogen. From earlier, I calculated 1 ton of hydrogen could fill 75 of the honda fuel cell cars. 6 tons would obviously fill 450 cars. This comes out to $302.40 per car to fill the 171 liter tank for a rang of 270 miles ! Not good at all. For a little over 20 bucks I could fill my Kia Rio and go about 350 miles if on the highway.\n\nLooking at it this way, this tech doesn't seem good in the least as it is now (as aluminum is processed and costs now). So, you're right, as it stands it's a move sideways, or worst, backwards. (At least if my calculations are correct or anywhere near reality)\n\nWhile, I have not had the time or inclanation to double check your numbers. Regardless of our personal opinions regarding global warming, we all agree that reliance on fossils fuels has to come to and end sometime.\n\nI put forth the idea that energy needed to recycle the alumina would come from Nuclear sources rather than coal and/or gas. A nuclear infrustructor could make up the gap you calculations have pointed out.\n\nI also submit that since refinement of alumina to aluminumum requires a large amount of contant electricity. This is the type of power which is acceled by nuclear power plants since demand is constant.\n\nI agree with you fully. However, this is too far out of my league. Still, there should be a way to close the gaps on these figures. For instance, increasing aluminum production and expanding recycling systems should quickly drop the price of aluminum and potentially make the solution competitive. As things are right now, they are not set up for the sort of infrastructure and systems as would be needed by this technology--it is not optimized as gasoline as become from a century of use.\n\nOur reliance on combustion engines does have to end, period. The question is how and when. It won't be easy because gas is so cheap, and it's so hard to move away from what we've already established. I've gone as far as I can in analyzing this, though it still is the best option for making hydrogen yet as far as I see and know; I leave it up to the future to decide.\n\nHydrogen is not a high \"energy density\" fuel like gasoline or diesel. Ethanol is better, but still not as good as a refined fuel like gasoline as far as energy density (this is why your mpg goes down while driving with ethanol fuel)\n\nMy belief is still, that the best course is to pursue all electric cars, or hybrids to help develop the bettery technology to better energy density. We need a paradigm (sp?) shift in energy production, and hopefully will achieve commercial Fusion power in the next 50 years. Chemical energy production (largely fossil Fuels) will simply change the atmospheric content of our planet over the long term, and will have environmentally damaging effects at some point (when that point is is for better minds than mine).\n\nFirstly: Gallium, indium and tin are the catalyst (note [i]almost 100% recovered[/i]). Aluminium reacts but can be recovered easily as the article clearly states.\n\nSecondly: Once infrastructure is in place vehicle emissions (including water) are eliminated and fleet CO2 emissions drop by 66% (reprocessing makes 1/3 as much as petrol) or more while city air gets cleaner and 20th century smog becomes as quaint as London's legendary 'Pea-soup' smog. BTW cities are a great source of scrap aluminium.\n\nThirdly: The advantages are that the H2 is stored as water in the vehicle (safety) and the energy required is stored as a solid which is intrinsically easier to transport, store, handle and safer than H2 in a pressurised container and it would exist as H2 for a very short time before becoming water again in the engine/fuel-cell so leakage would be minimised. Also steam reformation of petro-chemicals [i]requires[/i] fossil fuels.\n\nI very much doubt that this method of producing H2 is useful for anything but producing H2 at the point of use as in transportations ever changing point of use.\n\nThe aluminium requirement (13 tonnes for the world fleet) is not going to happen in a year given that the average car has a lifespan of more than twelve years it would probably take more like 50, look at how long it's taken Diesel's more efficient and flexible engine to gain consumer acceptance.\n\nThe material [i]available[/i] for recycling is far greater than the material [i]collected[/i] and recycled. e.g. did you recycle your stock cooler when you upgraded to a better one? So discounts for the cans/fuel could be given to customers who supply scrap aluminium. If the filling stations incorporate small spent fuel recycling stations then there is minimal 'material transportation cost' and it would be in their economic interest to ensure this is done well as it would be their product quality that would encourage repeat purchases. Possibly more of a cottage industry than the globally fixed cartel we have now. e.g. the more your city recycles it's aluminium the less it has to buy in, the cheaper the fuel.\n\nWhat really strikes me with this is it's simplicity and sustainability. I hope it has a place in the hydrogen economy.\n\nquote: On average, around the world, it takes some 15.7 kWh of electricity to produce one kilogram of aluminium from alumina. Design and process improvements have progressively reduced this figure from about 21kWh in the 1950's.\n\nPoking around on that same site I found this:  it would appear that our current process of obtaining aluminum is to mine bauxite and convert that into alumina. So in essence, this new method of hydrogen production is eliminating the first step of a standard process, a step other methods require. That is a significant difference.\n\nThe only problem is that there isnt enough Indium to make this viable. We're already running out of Indium because of the rising demand for LCD monitors, which is used in small amounts for color filters"

There must be a better option, right?\n\nEnter Christiana Chang and her colleagues at the University of Houston in Texas. The researchers are developing self-heating roads that would melt off the snow and ice without resorting to a powdery mess of road salt. There are a number of ways to go about heating the road, including coating it in fly ash or steel shavings and sending electricity through it or pumping heated water through the concrete, but the system favored by Chang is predictably a bit more high-tech.\n\nSheets of cone-shaped carbon nanofibers are embedded in paper and placed under the roadway. Electricity heats these sheets, thereby melting the sloppy wintery mix. According to Chang, this system consumes less power than other options and the carbon nanotube-embedded paper sheets are cheap and plentiful. Will it ever see the light of day? We hope so, for the sake of our salt-covered buddies out east, of course.\n\nExcept a lot of that heat energy is lost to the air, not used to melt the ice. And even after melting the snow and ice , the road would need to be continued heating in order to prevent the melt from refreezing. Plus many times only small sections or even patches on the road would need to melting but to do that the whole road would need to be heated. That's a lot of wasted energy not going to the desired task.\n\nHow can it be more efficient than any of these other road-heating methods? An electric heater, by definition, is 100% efficient. All of that electricity gets turned into waste heat, which is what the system is trying to accomplish. There is no net work accomplished, you're just increasing entropy.\n\nWhat about when we have to re-surface roads that have severely degraded due to extreme weather conditions? Are we supposed to buy more of this stuff to re-lay? Figures this idea would come out of Texas. This is problem that should be solved in Russia, Canada or north-eastern US!\n\nI love the idea, and the technology is sound that it would eliminate the need for salt as well as preserve the road surface by reducing/eliminating \"frost heave\".\n\nHowever, I think the major issue is the use of power. As we are still relying on an outdated power grid in this nation, the idea of using even a minute amount of juice to constantly heat millions of miles of asphalt during the winter months makes me shudder. If the midwest states could rely on alternative sources of electricity (wind, solar, etc) during the winter months for power, I would believe this could work."

And maybe heading that league table of promising, but odd, green energy technologies is the idea of turning bacteria into batteries. That's something a team from the UK's University of East Anglia believes is closer, thanks to its new research. In a paper out in today's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, UEA scientists claim to have nailed the precise mechanisms by which 'rock-breathing' bacteria generate energy.\n\nThe UEA team, led by Dr Tom Clarke, worked in collaboration with scientists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, to assess what was going on on the cell surface of a bacterium known as Shewanella oneidensis. This is a member of a large group of rock-dwelling bacteria that have evolved to survive deep underground, using iron as a source of energy.\n\nRather than breathing using oxygen as most multi-celled animals do - a process known as respiration - the 'rock breathing' bacteria literally wire themselves into particles of iron, in a process of 'iron respiration'. It enables them to get by without oxygen, but it is the details of the mechanism - which involves pumping electrons from the bacteria into the iron - which most excites researchers.\n\nBecause the bacteria are able to generate electrical current by attaching to metallic particles, they could be hooked up to electrodes, so creating microbial fuel cells - also called 'bio-batteries'. These could be driven be something as widespread - and as bizarre - as animal or human waste.\n\nBut for these most natural of waste batteries to become a reality, scientists need to understand the mechanism by which the bacteria's tiny organic cell 'wires' work. And that's exactly what the team from UEA believe they have done, using x-ray crystallography to discover the detailed structure of the proteins involved.\n\n''This is an exciting advance in our understanding of how some bacterial species move electrons from the inside to the outside of a cell,'' said Clarke, ''Identifying the precise molecular structure of the key proteins involved in this process is a crucial step towards tapping into microbes as a viable future source of electricity.''\n\nAnd not only could these fascinating bacterial engines drive new approaches in power generation - they could also allow for the development of novel techniques for cleaning up toxic pollution, such as oil spills or radioactive material like uranium. It seems that it can often be the darkest and furthest flung corners of the planet that can be most enlightening for researchers"

To further increase the efficiency of solar collectors, Taylor and his colleagues have mixed nanoparticles, a billionth of a metre in size, into the heat-transfer oils normally used in solar thermal power plants, according to an Arizona statement.\n\nThe researchers chose graphite nanoparticles, in part because they are black and therefore absorb light very well, making them efficient heat collectors.\n\nIn lab tests with small dish collectors, Taylor and his colleagues found that nanoparticles increased heat-collection efficiency by up to 10 percent.\n\n\"We estimate that this could mean up to $3.5 million dollars per year more revenue for a 100 megawatt solar power plant,\" he says.\n\nWhat`s more, Taylor adds, graphite nanoparticles \"are cheap\" - less than $1 per gram - with 100 grams of nanoparticles providing the same heat-collecting surface area as an entire football field."

This allows hydrogen storage to be more easily used in mobile applications. Baldé discovered that 30 nanometre particles of the metal hydride sodium alanate make the favourable extraction and storage of hydrogen possible.\n\nHydrogen is considered to be a clean storage and transport medium for energy. Therefore many future scenarios are based on the storage and transport of hydrogen. Various obstacles need to be overcome before this so-called hydrogen economy can be used on a large scale. One of these is the storage of hydrogen.\n\nA highly-promising method for storing hydrogen is its absorption in a metal hydride. A disadvantage of this method is that hydrogen uptake and release rates are low for metal hydrides. Reducing the particle size of the metal hydride to a nanometre scale is a possible solution to this problem.\n\nBaldé demonstrated that 30 nanometre particles of sodium alanate store hydrogen in a highly efficient manner. With the addition of a titanium catalyst, a further reduction in the particle size to 20 nanometres is possible and this leads to an even more efficient storage of hydrogen.\n\nThe deactivation process of the titanium catalyst was also studied because this inhibits the uptake and release rate of hydrogen. Structural characteristics that exert an influence on the catalyst's activity were found. This knowledge can be used to develop an improved catalyst"

In nature, photosynthetic organisms use light-capturing enzymes nicknamed Photosystem I and II, which absorb light and excite electrons to a higher energy state. Another enzyme called FNR then uses these electrons to produce an energy-storage molecule. This molecule is used to make sugars to keep the organism alive, and that's your basic photosynthesis process.\n\nLubner et al replaced the FNR enzyme with a hydrogenase enzyme, which combines electrons with hydrogen ions to make molecular hydrogen (instead of a sugar-producing system). Then they used this enzyme to stitch together iron-based terminals of a Photosystem I enzyme from each of the bacteria. This stitch served as a molecular wire, easily and quickly transferring electrons. The researchers doped it with vitamin C, which served as the electron feedstock.\n\nThe result was a high-throughput hydrogen-producing system — electron flow was more than twice as high as the bacteria's individual rates, the authors say. It produced hydrogen molecules for several hours, as long as it had vitamin C to use. The system is easily adaptable to other enzyme terminals and other bacteria, the authors say. As such, it could be used to produce a wide range of potential biofuels.\"\n\nJust a quick reminder, we will have a BMCDB holiday celebration in LSA 1022 at 5:30 today.

The elements are flerovium and livermoreium also known as Fl and Lv.\n\nLawrence Livermore National Labs\n\nLIVERMORE — The city of Livermore and Lawrence Livermore Laboratory may soon have an element named in their honor.\n\nLab scientists and colleagues at a Russian institute synthesized a superheavy element a decade ago and it landed a spot as No. 116 on the periodic table — the master list of elements.\n\nTemporarily called ununhexium, it will become \"livermorium,\" an international chemistry organization announced this week. The name honors the scientists who helped create it and the city hosting the national security lab.\n\nIf approved after a five-month public comment period, it will be the second element associated with the laboratory.\n\nIn 1997, \"Lawrencium\" was named for the lab's founder, E.O. Lawrence.\n\nLivermorium would have the atomic symbol Lv.\n\nLivermorium was first made in Dubna, Russia, in July 2000. The work was a collaboration between science teams led by Yuri Oganessian at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna and Ken Moody at the Livermore lab.\n\nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry reviewed the work over a decade and in June accepted the discovery of ununhexium and another element, No. 114, also created in joint work of the two labs.\n\nIn June 2011, the chemistry union officially accepted elements 116 and 114 as the heaviest elements.\n\nElement 114 will be named flerovium, to honor Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, where superheavy elements, including element\n114, were synthesized.\n\nSummary\nInduced expression of the Flock House virus in the soma of C. elegans results in the RNAi-dependent production of virus-derived, small-interfering RNAs (viRNAs), which in turn silence the viral genome. We show here that the viRNA-mediated viral silencing effect is transmitted in a non-Mendelian manner to many ensuing generations. We show that the viral silencing agents, viRNAs, are transgenerationally transmitted in a template-independent manner and work in trans to silence viral genomes present in animals that are deficient in producing their own viRNAs. These results provide evidence for the transgenerational inheritance of an acquired trait, induced by the exposure of animals to a specific, biologically relevant physiological challenge. The ability to inherit such extragenic information may provide adaptive benefits to an animal.\n\nIn this June 16 photo, the moon exhibits a deep orange glow as the Earth casts its shadow in a total lunar eclipse as seen in Manila, Philippines, before dawn.

Viewers in the western half of the United States will have the best views Saturday well before dawn, Pacific and Mountain Standard Time.\n\nBullit Marquez/AP\n\nA total lunar eclipse will occur early Saturday morning (Dec. 10), casting the moon into shadow and making it appear bright red and supersized.\n\nInA total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon, throwing the moon into shadow.\n\n\"For people in the western United States, the eclipse is deepest just before local dawn,\" NASA scientists said in a statement. \"Face west to see the red moon sinking into the horizonas the sun rises behind your back. It's a rare way to begin your day.\"\n\nObservers in Alaska, Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand, and central and eastern Asia should also be well placed for the celestial show. [Video: Return of the Blood Red Moon]\"We're all looking at this together,\" MacRobert said in a statement.\nThe reddened moon is only partially eclipsed, before the total eclipse stage begins, MacRoberts said. Unfortunately, people farther east will also miss out on the opportunity due to the setting moon and rising sun.\n\nBut for those who are favorably placed, this eclipse promises a stunning show, NASA officials saidEmpathy lets us feel another person's pain and drives us to help ease it. But is empathy a uniquely human trait? For decades researchers have debated whether nonhuman animals possess this attribute. Now a new study shows that rats will free a trapped cagemate in distress. The results mean that these rodents can be used to help determine the genetic and physiological underpinnings of empathy in people.\n\nA few years ago, neuroscientist Jeffrey Mogil of McGill University in Montreal, Canada, reported in Science that mice possess a simple kind of empathy called emotional contagion. They sense what another mouse is feeling and feel it themselves. For example, when one mouse receives a painful chemical injection into its paw, the mouse and its cagemate lick their paw to ease the pain.\n\nThat's a necessary first step toward empathy, but it's not sufficient, says neuroscientist Jean Decety of the University of Chicago in Illinois, a co-author of the new study. To truly empathize, one needs to understand on some level what the other individual is experiencing, as when a mother senses what's upsetting her child. Only then can she help, Decety says.\n\nTo find out whether rats can feel true empathy and act on it, Decety and his University of Chicago colleagues, neuroscientist Peggy Mason and graduate student Inbal Bartal, placed pairs of unrelated rats in plastic cages for 2 weeks so they became familiar with each other. They then put one of the rodents into a small Plexiglas container inside the cage. Using a commercial bat detector, the team showed that many of the trapped rats emitted high-pitched squeaks, indicating that they were distressed. The small container was outfitted with a door that was rigged to fall to the side when the free rat bumped or nudged it.\n\nAfter running rat pairs through a week of daily testing sessions, the researchers found that three-quarters of the rats with trapped cagemates had learned how to open the door (see video), whereas only one rat in six without a trapped cagemate learned to do this. This difference showed that rats with trapped cagemates were motivated to learn how to free them.\n\nBut what motivated the rats in the first place? To find out, the Chicago team kept up daily tests on the rodents that had learned how to open the container. Each free rat kept liberating its trapped cagemate for a month, which ruled out simple curiosity as a motivation. What's more, the free rat would liberate its cagemate even when the trapped animal exited into a separate cage, which showed that the free rat wasn't simply seeking the reward of schmoozing with its friend. The rats also freed trapped cagemates even when they had the option of bumping open an identical container and obtaining five chocolate chips for themselves, which showed that their motivation to help was on par with their desire for a tasty treat. In fact, half of the time they even shared chips by leaving one or two for the trapped rat, the team reports online today in Science.\n\nIn a PNAS paper by Phoolcharoena, Dye et. al titled \"A nonreplicating subunit vaccine protects mice against lethal Ebola virus challenge\" they report that using Ebola glycoproteins coupled antibodies to create Ebola immune complexes (EICs), and coupling these EICs with the Toll-like receptor antagonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC) resulted in an 80% survival rate of mice infected with a lethal challenge of Ebola virus. This is significant because the biggest challenge to making an effective Ebola vaccine has been cost and long term stability, this research shows immense promise that a synthetic vaccine will be cheaper, and far more stable than deactivated Ebola viruses.\n\nOur data show evidence for arsenate in macromolecules that normally contain phosphate, most notably nucleic acids and proteins.\n\nOne year ago those 18 words ignited quite a media controversy when Felisa Wolfe-Simon and her colleagues held a press conference to announce the discovery of a bacterium that not only survived high levels of arsenic in its environment but also seemed to use that element in its DNA. Five months later, the debate resurfaced with the publication of critical comments on the original research.\n\nLast week, the genome of the bacterium, known as GFAJ-1, was posted in Genbank, the public repository of DNA sequences for all who care to take a look. But it doesn't settle the debate over whether arsenic is used in DNA.\n\nSimon Silver, an arsenic microbiologist at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and one of the most vocal critics of the arsenic bacterium research, and his colleagues sequenced the bacterium and found 3400 genes in its 3.5 million bases. Of note is that even the common gut bacterium, Escherichia coli, has more of the genes known to help it survive arsenic exposure than GFAJ-1, Silver said in a phone interview. Silver didn't expect the genome to address the core of the controversy, but then again, he doesn't think any test will convince Wolfe-Simon and her co-authors that they are wrong. \"This sort of stuff never gets resolved,\" he says. \"It eventually goes away.\" Silver and his colleagues intend to compare this genome with three others from other microbes living in arsenic-rich environments to better understand arsenic-related chemistry."

      "text": "21 February 2008\n\nAluminum alloy produces hydrogen on demand\n\nA new aluminum-rich alloy that produces hydrogen by splitting water can be economically competitive with conventional fuels.\n\n\"We now have an economically viable process for producing hydrogen on demand for vehicles, electrical generating stations, and other applications,\" said Jerry Woodall, a distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue University, who invented the process.\n\nThe new alloy contains 95% aluminum and 5% of an alloy made of the metals gallium, indium, and tin. Because the alloy contains significantly less of the more expensive gallium than previous forms of the alloy, they can produce hydrogen less expensively, he said.\n\nWhen immersed in water, the alloy splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, which immediately reacts with the aluminum to produce aluminum oxide, also called alumina, which can recycle back into aluminum. Recycling aluminum from nearly pure alumina is less expensive than mining the aluminum-containing ore bauxite, making the technology more competitive with other forms of energy production, Woodall said.\n\n\"After recycling both the aluminum oxide back to aluminum and the inert gallium-indium-tin alloy only 60 times, the cost of producing energy both as hydrogen and heat using the technology would be reduced to 10 cents per kilowatt hour, making it competitive with other energy technologies,\" Woodall said.\n\nA key to developing the alloy for large-scale technologies is controlling the microscopic structure of the solid aluminum and the gallium-indium-tin alloy mixture.\n\n\"This is because the mixture tends to resist forming entirely as a homogeneous solid due to the different crystal structures of the elements in the alloy and the low melting point of the gallium-indium-tin alloy,\" Woodall said.\n\nThe alloy has two phases because it contains abrupt changes in composition from one constituent to another.\n\n\"I can form a one-phase melt of liquid aluminum and the gallium-indium-tin alloy by heating it. But when I cool it down, most of the gallium-indium-tin alloy is not homogeneously incorporated into the solid aluminum, but remains a separate phase of liquid,\" Woodall said. \"The constituents separate into two phases, just like ice and liquid water.\"\n\nThe two-phase composition seems to be critical for the technology to work because it enables the aluminum alloy to react with water and produce hydrogen.\n\nThe researchers had earlier discovered that slow-cooling and fast-cooling the new 95/5 aluminum alloy produced drastically different versions. The fast-cooled alloy contained aluminum and the gallium-indium-tin alloy apparently as a single phase. In order for it to produce hydrogen, it had to be in contact with a puddle of the liquid gallium-indium-tin alloy.\n\n\"That was a very exciting finding because it showed that the alloy would react with water at room temperature to produce hydrogen until all of the aluminum was used up,\" Woodall said.\n\nThe engineers were surprised to learn late last year, however, that slow-cooling formed a two-phase solid alloy, meaning solid pieces of the 95/5 aluminum alloy react with water to produce hydrogen, eliminating the need for the liquid gallium-indium-tin alloy.\n\n\"That was a fantastic discovery,\" Woodall said. \"What used to be a curiosity is now a real alternative energy technology.\"\n\nResearchers are developing a method to create briquettes of the alloy they could place in a tank to react with water and produce hydrogen on-demand. Such a technology would eliminate the need to store and transport hydrogen, two potential stumbling blocks in developing a hydrogen economy, Woodall said.\n\nThe gallium-indium-tin alloy component is inert, which means researchers can recover it and reuse it an efficiency approaching 100%, he said\n\n\"The aluminum oxide is recycled back into aluminum using the currently preferred industrial process called the Hall-Héroult process, which produces one-third as much carbon dioxide as combusting gasoline in an engine,\" Woodall said.\n\nThe aluminum splits water by reacting with the oxygen atoms in water molecules, liberating hydrogen in the process. The gallium-indium-tin alloy is a critical component because it hinders the formation of a \"passivating\" aluminum oxide skin normally created on pure aluminum's surface after bonding with oxygen, a process called oxidation. This skin usually acts as a barrier and prevents oxygen from reacting with bulk aluminum. Reducing the skin's protective properties allows the reaction to continue until all of the aluminum generates hydrogen, Woodall said.\n\n\"This skin is like an eggshell,\" he said. \"Think of trying to fry an egg without breaking the shell.\"\n\nFor the technology to work in cars and trucks or for power plants, a large-scale recycling program would be required to turn the alumina back into aluminum and to recover the gallium-indium-tin alloy. Other infrastructure components, such as those related to manufacturing and the supply chain, also would have to be developed, he said."

Among many other traits, graphene has now been shown to dramatically boost the efficiency of artificial photosynthesis. Next week, someone will publish a paper about how eating pure graphene will make you live forever as young and beautiful.\n\nWhen you're talking photosynthesis, artificial or not, there is an important part of the process called the photocatalyst. Essentially, this is exactly what it sounds like; it's a material that facilitates the fuel creation of the photosynthesis process without getting depleted in the actual process. In plants, the photocatalyst is chlorophyll. In labs it's a little trickier, but graphene may be the answer.\n\nBecause 46% of the total sunlight that hits the Earth is in the visible spectrum — as opposed to just 4% in the UV range — an artificial photocatalyst that gets its jollies from normal visible sunlight is optimal. In the past, scientists have tried graphene-semiconductor composites, but it turns out that these aren't the best option because they're bad at transferring their electrons, which sort of bottlenecks the whole process. You know what material is significantly better at that part? Just take a guess.\n\nAs it turns out, plain old graphene coupled with a little porphyrin enzyme is highly functional in the visible light spectrum and highly efficient overall, making it the best suited candidate for an artificial photocatalyst found so far.\n\nWhat it all comes down to is that with graphene in your artificial solar cells, you'll have a reasonably efficient way to take sunlight and carbon-dioxide, and turn it into formic acid — which is used in the plastic industry, and also as a kind of fuel for fuel cells. A paper on the research has yet to be published, but the researchers involved seem pretty excited about the findings so far. \"The photocatalyst-enzyme coupled system is one of the most ideal artificial photosynthesis systems that utilize solar energy for the synthesis of various chemicals and fuel,\" coauthor Jin-Ook Baeg told Phys.org."

Researchers have experimented with flexible plastics and have found that this new kind of solar cell can be used in a variety of applications. These flexible plastics can be shaped to suit a myriad of purposes, which means they could be used anywhere and could generate electricity wherever sunlight can be found.\n\nNanocrystal solar cells less expensive but also less efficient\n\nResearchers note that nanocrystal solar cells are more affordable than conventional solar cells. They are, however, somewhat less efficient than their counterparts, a problem that researchers have been working to rectify. To this end, researchers have developed synthetic ligands, small molecules that are capable of building bridges that unify the structure of nanocrystals. These bridges can conduct electricity efficiently, allowing the nanocrystal solar cells to produce increased amounts of electricity.\n\nResearchers to continue investigating the applications of nanotechnology to solar energy\n\nSolar energy is becoming a popular alternative to fossil-fuel, especially in California, where the state government has begun throwing financial support to the solar energy industry. Researchers believe that the new nanocrystal solar cells could help the industry reach commercializing, but this may not be for several years due to the problems these solar energy systems still face. USC is still conducting tests regarding the relationship between nanotechnology and solar energy and believes to continue making breakthroughs in the years to come"

      "text": "The image on the left shows an array of model Fischer-Tropsch catalyst particles, as seen using a special scan- ning tunneling microscope at NETL. The image on the right is an enlargement of the surface of one of these particles showing a regular array of closely packed oxygen atoms, which appear as small circular 'bumps' in the images.\n\nThe Fischer–Tropsch (F-T) process is a set of chemical reactions that historically has been used to produce a petroleum substitute from coal, natural gas, or biomass by nations looking for an alternative to importing it. The F-T process has received intermittent attention as a source of low-sulfur diesel fuel whenever the cost of petroleum gets sufficiently high, but can also be used to create hydrogen from the same raw materials, and are therefore of interest to researchers who are developing new technologies for powering a fuel cell more economically.\n\nCatalysts are a key component of the F-T process. A common catalyst is iron oxide, Fe2O3 (commonly referred to as rust), which is transformed into Fe3O4, FeO, Fe, and Fe-carbides during the F-T process. The arrangement of the surface atoms on the iron compounds dictates how reactive these catalysts are, but although F-T catalysts have been in use for several decades, there is no experimental data on how the arrangement of atoms on the surface of these catalysts evolves during the F-T process.\n\nResearchers at NETL have recently used an advanced instrument called a scanning tunneling microscope to image how the arrangement of surface atoms on these catalysts evolves during the F-T process. This special instrument allowed researchers to directly \"see\" individual atoms on the surface of these catalysts and compare them to computational models that predict what arrangements of atoms should exist. The combined approach of using advanced instrumentation and computational models has shed new light on how these F-T catalysts can transform gasified coal into useful fuels. The results indicate that these catalysts appear to have a tightly packed arrangement of oxygen atoms on their surface and that the more reactive iron atoms reside below this layer of oxygen atoms. This suggests that large facets of the catalyst surface are unreactive towards F-T chemistry and that imperfections in this oxygen arrangement are responsible for the activity of these catalysts. This NETL research suggests that smaller catalyst particles with more defects and particle edges may be more efficient for the F-T process.\n\nPublication on CO2 Reuse Photocatalysts One of Top 10 Most Accessed Papers in 2010\n\nIt is always nice to learn that your work is appreciated. The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, published by the American Chemical Society, recently announced that one of NETL's publications, titled \"Visible Light Photo Reduction of CO2 Using CdSe/Pt/TiO2 Heterostructured Catalysts\" was one of its top 10 most accessed journal articles in 2010. This distinction illustrates the scientific community's interest in NETL's development of new carbon dioxide (CO2) management technologies. Whereas much of NETL's carbon management research is oriented towards capture and long-term storage of CO2, as a means of abating global warming, NETL is also conducting research on alternative ways to convert some of the CO2 that we produce into useful products. The trick, of course, is to find a way to do this at a reasonable cost.\n\nThe paper that has received all of this attention describes the synthesis and characterization of a new light-activated catalyst, and the potential of this catalyst to enable conversion of CO2 into value-added fuels, such as methanol and methane, and other chemicals. Ideally, the money made by selling these products will be used to offset some of the costs of capturing, storing, and monitoring the stored CO2. Previously investigated catalysts for this application were activated by ultraviolet light, which makes up only 1–5% of the sunlight reaching Earth's surface, but the new catalyst is activated by visible light, which makes up most of the sunlight that reaches us. Visible light activation will thus increase the efficiency of the catalytic process, an advance of paramount importance for CO2 reuse applications. Furthermore, the activity of the catalyst can be systematically tuned to use different colors of visible light by controlling the size of the semiconductor nanocrystals that make up the catalyst.\n\nFigure 2. NETL's HSPI system is being used in medical applications to accurately image blood flow, which closely resembles the high concentration particle flow of fossil energy processes. Image courtesy of the Medical Devices Laboratory--McGowan Institute\n\nImagine following a particle smaller than a grain of salt among millions of particles moving randomly in a high-speed liquid or gas stream. High concentration particle flows are not only microscopic, they are opaque, and their high speed has made them very difficult to study. So, although high concentration particle flow is critically important to many chemical, energy, biological, and food processes, until recently, researchers could not see how particles moved within them. NETL had developed computational fluid dynamics models of HCPFFs that can be used to design and optimize new fossil energy systems, but they could not tell how accurate their models were.\n\nNETL has studied high concentration particle flow fields (HCPFFs) because they are important in fossil energy applications such as fluidized beds, pulverized coal combustion, advanced gasification, CO2 capture and sequestration, and gas stream clean-up. Now, NETL has developed a new high speed particle imaging system (HSPI) that allows researchers to observe, measure, and study particle motion via thousands of high-speed video frames. The HSPI system measures the velocity of fluids and can accurately recognize and measure particle motion inside HCPFFs (Figure 1).\n\nA patent application for the HSPIV software has been filed with the U.S. Patent Office, and discussions are underway with private sector companies who may be interested in licensing the technology. Additionally, the HSPI system has left the laboratory and is currently being used at a chemical/energy industry research lab in Chicago (PSRI), and at the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine in Pittsburgh to study blood flow—a mixture of fluid and high particle concentrations (blood cells)—in a respiratory assist catheter (Figure 2)."

      "text": "Researchers from the Pennsylvania State University have created a new fuel cell that could be a great boon for impoverished communities around the world. It is called the microbial reverse electrolysis cell (MRC), and is a kind of microbial fuel cell that generated electricity by consuming hydrogen gas. Penn State researchers believe that their new fuel cell serves a dual purpose of water-treatment and energy generation. As with other hydrogen fuel cells, the MRC creates clean water as a byproduct of energy production, though at much greater quantities than its conventional counterparts.\n\nThe MRC is, essentially, a microbial fuel cell, using bacteria to produce hydrogen gas, which is then converted into electricity through chemical reactions with the fuel cell's catalyst. This process produces water vapor, which can be captured, cooled and used for other purposes. The benefits of being able to produce water clean enough to drink are apparent to communities that do not have access to clean water. This kind of fuel cell would also give these communities the ability to generate their own electricity.\n\nResearchers claim that their fuel cell is powerful enough to provide energy for 11,000 people per day. The problem, however, is that the fuel cell requires a significant amount of water to be able to produce results. It also requires a fairly large financial investment. Researchers at Penn State built their experimental fuel cell for $1,100. They suspect that a commercial version would be much more"

The REF believes it can double that endurance, by outfitting the drone's wings with these flexible solar cells.\n\nThe paper-thin cells are space-grade, with three layers of gallium arsenide semiconductors built inside.

Thermodynamic consideration of carriermultiplication leads to new efficiency limits for photovoltaic energy conversion. An efficiency of 43% is theoretically possible for cells which are illuminated by the sun's unconcentrated black body radiation. For sun light of full concentration, the new limit is 85%. These ideal values are thermodynamically possible with a single semiconductor which makes optimum use of carriermultiplication and shows radiative recombination only. The theoretical description of the thermodynamics of radiative recombination in a cell with carriermultiplication leads us also to a novel mathematical description of the saturation current density."

      "text": "Textured Silicon for Cheaper Solar Panels\n\nSilicon is a very useful material thanks to its semiconducting properties. These not only allows for modern electronics but also some forms of solar panels. Unfortunately silicon is not always cheap as solar panels need highly purified silicon. This alone can account for 40% of the cost of modern solar cells. Researchers at MIT recently found a way to reduce the thickness of silicon used by 90% without sacrificing much efficiency.\n\nThe battle between cost and efficiency for solar panels has been going on for about as long as they have existed. This has led to the development of solar panels that use cheaper materials than silicon, but silicon still offers the highest efficiency. Researchers have considered shaving off some thickness to the silicon, to cut costs, but the thinner the silicon the fewer photons it can trap. The MIT researchers got around this by making pyramid-shaped indents in the silicon. This texturing increases light absorption of the cell without greatly increasing the surface area, which is important. The more surface area there is the more likely electrons are to lose their energy.\n\nThis new design has not yet been tested, but the researchers expect it will be able to convert 20% of the light that hits it into electricity. That is respectably close to the 24% we see with the most efficient silicon solar panels currently on the market. If this textured design ever comes to market itself, it will come without a great additional cost, because the tools used to etch the texture are standard equipment for etching silicon already."

Inside, lithium ions shuttle back and forth between the anode and cathode of the battery –Previously, the researchers used NDP to study the cathodes and anodes of six off-the-shelf lithium-ion car batteries – one new battery and five batteries which they aged themselves in the laboratory – and found that lithium builds up on the anode surface over time.\n\nTo understand more about how these batteries degrade, the researchers have been studying the batteries further, at various scales ranging from the millimeter (millionths of a meter) down to the nanometer (billionths of a meter) with different techniques.\n\nIn the NDP technique, researchers pass neutrons through a material and capture the charged particles that emerge from the fission reaction between neutrons and lithium in the electrodes. Since different chemical elements emit a certain signature set of particles with specific energies, NDP can reveal the presence of impurities in a material.\n\nIn this latest study, NDP detected the presence of lithium in the copper current collector from one of the aged batteries. The detection was measured as a ratio of the number of copper atoms in the collector to the number of lithium atoms that had collected there. The test yielded a ratio of up to 0.08 percent, or approximately one lithium atom per 1250 copper atoms in the collector.\n\nThat's a small number, but high enough that it could conceivably affect the electrical performance of the current collector – and, in turn, the performance of a battery, a researcher said. He hopes that battery makers will further investigate this phenomenon and use the information to design new materials that might prevent lithium from escaping the electrode material.\n\nNext, the researchers will study the impedance, or internal electrical resistance, of lithium-ion batteries on the nanoscale"

      "text": "Jul 04, 2012\n\nHydrogen gas (H2) is an ideal energy carrier for fuel cells, but finding sustainable ways to produce large quantities of hydrogen continues to be a technological challenge. Jia Zhang at the A*STAR Institute of High Performance Computing and co-workers have now used sophisticated calculations to uncover a critical chemical mechanism that may make catalytic transformation of safe, renewable liquid ethanol into hydrogen fuel easier than ever before.\n\nCurrently, steam reforming is the popular method for producing hydrogen gas from ethanol. In this technique, ethanol is injected into a hot, steam-filled chamber containing a catalyst such as rhodium. The catalyst promotes the dissociation of ethanol molecules into smaller molecules, such as carbon monoxide and H2. Although chemists have had good success in using steam reforming to 'crack' ethanol, they have had difficulties in improving the efficiency of the catalyst because of the many diverse and complex chemical reactions at play in the system.\n\nAccording to Zhang, catalysts need to selectively crack the carbon–carbon bonds of surface-adsorbed ethanol to be viable for steam reforming. Recent experimental efforts have shown that 'stepped' catalyst surfaces — tiny staircase-like defects present in a normally flat rhodium surface — are unusually active at both carbon-hydrogen and carbon–carbon bond cleaving. One problem, however, is that the actual mechanism of ethanol decomposition on stepped surfaces is still unclear.\n\nThe research team overcame this challenge by using high-powered computer simulations to work out which ethanol decomposition pathways are most probable on a particular stepped rhodium surface known as rhodium (211). Exhaustive calculations using density functional theory (DFT) methods revealed that there were two ways of breaking ethanol down into H2, and both shared a common intermediate species with the chemical formula CH3COH.\n\nCrucially, the team found that this CH3COH intermediate exists only on stepped rhodium surfaces. While flat catalyst surfaces fracture ethanol through an oxametallacycle intermediate, the step-type defects preferentially absorb the alcohol and then activate the decomposition cycle by sequentially removing hydrogen atoms from the intermediate. The researchers note that the surface-sensitivity of ethanol steam reforming is an important finding because step-defects are extremely common on state-of-the-art nanoscale rhodium catalysts.\n\n\"Steam reforming is a very complicated chemical process, and our current DFT study on ethanol decomposition mechanism is just the tip of the iceberg — many factors such as temperature, concentration, substrate influence, and water effects can influence the results,\" says Zhang. \"However, this work is an important first step for establishing theoretical rules to guide development of new, high-performance catalyst materials.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nVehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells generate no exhaust emissions other than clean water vapor. Unfortunately, producing and distributing large quantities of hydrogen gas is impossible with current infrastructures. ... Scientists have created an entirely natural and renewable method for producing hydrogen to generate electricity which could drastically reduce the dependency on fossil fuels in the future. There are many ways to generate hydrogen, such as water electrolysis and steam reforming of gas, but the hydrogen produced by these methods tends to be combined with other byproduct and residual"

      "text": "Journalists have to be very careful when talking about physics. Especially when physics promises the possibility of abundant, cheap, clean energy...but doesn't offer any explanation to those of us without PhDs. These things are holy grails...and extremely exciting, but they generally turn out to be hooey.\n\nThat's the whole point of the Holy Grail right? No one ever found it.\n\nSo I don't write about these energy Grails, or at least I didn't, until now. I guess there comes a point when we've got to break down and start talking about these things, even if we still aren't really sure whether or not their going to pan out. In terms of physics-defying energy generation, Blacklight power is the first company I've ever written about, and I do it very carefully.\n\nBlacklight Power says that they can knock the electron of a hydrogen atom into a lower energy state than the 1s orbital. Coming from a chemistry background this sounds to me like saying you can throw a noodle at the sky and have it bore through a concrete wall on the surface of Mars. It's not just that it's impossible, it simply doesn't fit into my view of the world. The resulting atom would be a smaller particle which Blacklight calls a hydrino. They claim that the resulting release in energy creates more than enough energy to create more hydrogen, which can then be forced into lower energy states to release more energy.\n\nIf true, it would be a cheap, clean way to create electricity from water. The problem is, the entire scientific establishment has rebelled against the idea and believes that Blacklight is run by con men.\n\nBut the story is a heck of a lot more interesting than that. Though scientists have almost universally denied Blacklight's claims, veteran investors have taken the bait. Michael Jordan, the former CEO of Westinghouse sits on the board as does the CFO of Credit Suisse and Blacklight has taken over $60 M in investment from mutual funds, utility companies and private investors.\n\nWhile Blacklight has claimed for over a year to have a working prototype of it's 50 kW reactor operational, they've just cleared another hurdle. Scientists at Rowan University just recreated the 50 kW reactor in their laboratories, and found that it indeed produces more energy than could be explained by any currently understood or studied physical process. Enough energy, in fact, to provide clean power for several dozen homes without putting anything except water in.\n\nSo if this is for real...what does this mean? Well, for physicists, I'm not sure. It's possible that the \"hydrino\" idea is bunk...but if that's true, it looks as if everyone might have some serious explaining to do. As for what it means for the rest of us, it could very well mean cheap, clean, abundant energy for less than half of what we're paying today.\n\nOf course, I'm not willing to make any judgments today. I am obviously neither a theoretical physicist or a CEO of a major energy company. All I can tell you is that I've decided to write about it because it's the first time one of these holy grail ideas has ever seemed to have the possibility of truth in it. Which is pretty exciting, even with a grain of salt.\n\nCold Fusion returns in all its glory! written by HankM,\nOctober 21, 2008\n\nAll joking aside this is really cool if it works.\n\n+0\n\n... written by Steve N. Lee,\nOctober 21, 2008\n\nOther researchers seeming to replicate results is always a major step forward in authenticating new technologies. But, as you say, Hank, let's tread carefuly. I'm not a physicist either but I can tell that this sounds pretty darn weird and nigh on impossible.\n\nStill, it was once impossible to travel around the world without falling off its edge, wasn't it?\n\nThis is an interesting story so I'm pleased you brought it to people's attention. More articles like this would be welcome - tempered by common sense, of course!\n\nFrom the Blacklightpower site: Dr. Randell Mills holds a Doctor of Medicine degree from Harvard University and a BA degree in Chemistry from Franklin and Marshall College. ..

That said, I'm keeping my ear out - I'm not an advanced enough physicist to call 100% BS on this, and it's too powerful to ignore if it's true. However I do believe if it is true, its very lucky not to be swallowed up behind the closed doors of military intelligence, and that is just one more reason to be wary.\n\n+0\n\n2nd Law Violation written by MikeCJ,\nOctober 21, 2008\n\nI have a feeling someone has their equations wrong. The second law of thermodynamics essentially states you will always put more energy into a system than what you will get out of it.\n\nAlso, just because someone puts money behind a project does not mean the project is valid and/or viable. See Ponzi and Edsel.\n\n+0\n\n... written by EV,\nOctober 21, 2008\n\nAh, I remember a science fiction story that mentioned this theory once. The problem is, it relies on a physics model of the univese that is significantly different one from the traditionally used. It goes along with the 'Electric Universe' model, I think. Now, if this is true, then we would have to re-write all the known laws of nuclear physics, quantum mechanics and possibly the Riemann zeta function. So, call me skeptical for now.\n\n+0\n\nI'm a physicist... and this IS total BS. written by Kris,\nOctober 21, 2008\n\nWell, I'm in the 3rd year of my PhD (physics) and this really does sound like a classic case of bunkum. Seriously... Anyone who's taken a course on relativistic quantum mechanics (or even better, quantum field theory) will be able to do the precise energy level calculations for the hydrogen atom; there is no level below the well known ground state. Honestly... how does these rediculous ideas survive? The ground state is called the \"ground state\" because it's the lowest there is! And it's no use claiming that the current theories are insufficient; quantum field theory is well known as having produced the most accurate theoretical predictions for any physical phenomena measured to date (namely, the energy levels of the Hydrogen atom).\n\nAs for violations of the 2nd law of thermodynamics, that argument isn't sufficient to debunk this. Supposing energy could be produced by a decay of the electron to a lower state in this fashion, the energy would have come from the level decay. i.e. internal to the system. In other words, \"you\" wouldn't be putting energy into the system and would still be getting more out. Energy conservation still holds, you just have to be careful about how you define the second law of thermodynamics in this situation.\n\nAlso, just looking up the Wikipedia entries on this Blacklight junk will give even the casual reader an idea that the people behind this are far less than honest.\n\n+0\n\n2nd Law Violation written by Lee Cage,\nOctober 21, 2008\n\nI thought science was about testing laws and theories; if this breaks the 2nd law of thermodynamics, then maybe the law needs updating. If more energy comes out than goes in, and this is independantly varified, then the 2nd law does need testing.\n\nWith the price of energy, state of the world economy and the threat to our civilisation from global warming; this is the wrong time to get all hoity-toity about scientific laws.\n\nI'll believe it when I see a working prototype that's been verified by third parties.\n\n+0\n\nI'll believe it when my electric bill go written by bob bobberson,\nOctober 21, 2008\n\nI think its bunk,\n\nLets say I give you a machine and it somehow generates more power than what you put in it. But the machine is huge and not easily measured. Could your sham company hide something in the machine to produce more heat or energy? Say they hid something radioactive deep in the machine and it was naturally heating the water but its so complex and big that they fool you into thinking its making more power?\n\nClaiming to find the Grand unification theory is one thing, but to have that claim and then do nothing with that theory for many years while you develop this clean reactor seems a little suspicious to me.\n\nHowever everyone thought it was impossible to fold a sheet of paper more than 8 times, but it was only recently demonstrated by a high-schooler that you can in fact fold a sheet of paper only 12 times.\n\nWhat a bunch of drones. Especially the pseudo-physicist above. Look, if you invest the time, you will learn that:\n\na) BLP's board reads like a Fortune 50 company, including all sorts of ex-CEO's from Fortune 50 companies and ex senior officers from CIA. These are not con-men. They have staked their quite reputable carriers on the success of this venture.\n\nb) I has been replicated by a third party. Gees Jordan, what did you think the announcement yesterday was about? Is English a second language for you?\n\nc) It works folks. Peter Jansson is an MIT and Oxford PhD. He's not making any claims about Mills' hydrino theory. He's just inviting people to look at their verification work. It's all out there for anyone to look at and it just is not helpful to say stupid things like \"I'm a physicist and I know electrons can't go below the ground state because. . .well. . .because!\" What a drone. . .\n\n+0\n\nKris above is right for all the right re written by eldereft,\nOctober 21, 2008\n\nIf hydrinos were to exist, they would show up whenever we look at the light from distant stars (the universe is mostly hydrogen, after all). These spectra are in nigh perfect accord with theories which exclude any \"state below the ground state\". The complete technical analysis from a physicist is at: A critical analysis of the hydrino model, A Rathke 2005 New J. Phys. 7 127 doi: 10.1088/1367-2630/7/1/127\n\nThese free energy things, except for the occasional run-of-the-mill fraud, always turn out to be an illusion from trusting equipment outside of its range of applicability. Sometimes the system produces a weird spiky voltage, sometimes they are trying to measure a high frequency AC current with a DC ammeter, and sometimes they are measuring millimeters with a yardstick.\n\nStill, thank you for providing the most open and honest take that I have found to date on this latest chapter in the hydrino saga.\n\n+0\n\nCan we have a bottle of Hydrinos? written by Mark Bartosik,\nOctober 21, 2008\n\nAn alternative way to verify this is for them to product a bottle full of hydrinos (the waste product from this process).\n\nIt strikes me that shipping some bottles of hydrinos to various labs for validation would be a more simple way to validate. Thus avoiding the charge that they've hidden an extra power source inside the machine.\n\nWell, we can talk about this technology more then we can imagine since we can just \"guess\" what's behind the scene. This over unity technology is just like the other one of it's kind such as ZPE, cold fusion and other exotic projects you can find all over the internet. There is nothing convincing until the first product comes to the market or at least a proved-to-work prototype is presented to the public. Until then we will still talk about it like we do in the case of alien existence.\n\n+0\n\nthe proof is in the pudding written by Alex,\nOctober 21, 2008\n\nThe part that I don't understand is why, with $60M in investors and a product that is ready for the market, anybody is worried about physicists verifying whether this should work or not. Let Mr Mills start generating power and selling it. If he can make it for less than 2 cents per kilowatt hour (as he claims) and sell it for more than 8 cents he should do it. The working model generates about 50 kilowatts, he's got 20 of them - fire 'em up! If he can generate a reliable megawatt for 6 months and this thing is prices competetively, I don't see why he shouldn't be able to sell them regardless of what the scientific community says.\n\nI also have a background in chemistry, and this is clearly nonsense. Besides the obvious rules of thermodynamics being broken. There is also the fact that these \"hydrinos\" have all of the sudden become discovered. There has been an incredible amount of research done in quantum chemistry in the past 80 years which would have uncovered something this simple years ago. I hate to discredit discoveries based on the \"it would have already been discovered\" ploy, but I seriously do not foresee this power source coming to fruitation.\n\n+0\n\nCount me amongst the drones and pseudo-p written by Teetor,\nOctober 21, 2008\n\nThis reeks of cold fusion and \"run your car on water\" advertisements.\n\nI don't care who the *bleep* is on their board; some of the best financial minds in the world were on the boards of many Wall Street institutions, and where has that gotten us? A negative 40% return on my 401k and a solar stock trading at 35% of its purchase value (thank you Lehman Brothers).\n\nIf some 3rd party has already verified this, then non-scammers would be selling them already.\n\n+0\n\nHow narrow minded written by eidylon,\nOctober 22, 2008\n\nTo Kris, and those blindly agreeing... all i can say is to open your minds. Yes, this may go against all current understanding ... that doesn't mean it's false. It just means we may not understand fully.\n\nYou say nothing can be lower than ground state because that's the definition of ground state. Well, that's exactly what they said before ... nothing can be smaller than the atom, after all, that's why it's called an atom! Yet, they cracked it open and a bunch of stuff came out. Then they cracked all THOSE open, and a whole bunch MORE stuff came out.\n\nAnd as for saying it can't POSSIBLY work, because it would mean our understanding is all wrong, that's just bunk. Sure, it would mean that, BUT... guess what. At one time, people wouldn't have thought ANYthing that defied Newton's laws could ever exist... yet, they do, and hence why the modern theories were developed.\n\nTo say that we should summarily dismiss any idea simply because it doesn't fit in with your understanding of the world is AMAZINGLY ignorant and narrow-minded. If that were how science progressed, people would still worry about falling of the edge of the planet, airplanes never would've been invented (remember the argument if men were meant to fly, God would've given us wings).\n\nA science that cannot objectively question itself and adjust itself as it learns new things about the universe is really not much of a use to anybody.\n\nThat said... I admit this does all sound almost too good to be true, but it is looking more and more likely as it is now being reproduced (so we hear). I will remain skeptically hopeful.\n\n+0\n\nOh... p.s. written by eidylon,\nOctober 22, 2008\n\nTo the idea that this would've been discovered already if it were real, that is also pretty simple-minded. History, invention and science are all FILLED with those \"EUREKA\" moments, and those ideas that prompt others to say \"DOH! That's so simple, why didn't anyone do that before??\"\n\nThat is no argument against an idea.\n\n+0\n\nLook at the papers written by Peter W,\nOctober 22, 2008\n\nThe BLP process has no problem with the laws of thermodynamics. Mills claims that \"dark matter\" is in fact hydrinos, not observable easily because the states below the \"ground state\" can not be reached by radiating energy, as the ground state is stable. Mills claims that the hydrino process explains the high temperature of the solar corona. He has published a mass of data which could easily be verified - or disputed - were anyone willing to try tyo repeat his experiments. For details, the best is to study, on the BLP web site, only those papers marked \"accepted - in press\" as they are more succinct than his huge book. Clearly most commenters have not done that. Recent astrononomical studies of dark matter tend to support Mills. In fact, in 1995 he predicted that the expansion of the universe is accelerating: ridiculous! Two or three years later, measurements by two teams supported this idea. So it might be unwise to bet against Mills.....\n\n+0\n\nNeil written by Neil Ferguson,\nOctober 22, 2008\n\nThank you Kris for defending clarity, anyway. People who mention Newton's second law here are drones. Get a clue about Dr. Mills' claims. Fermi and Szilard weren't claiming \"free energy\" or perpetual motion for nuclear fission, either, any more than Mills claims it for Millsian chemistry.\n\nHis theories may be incorrect. But Rowan University is a reputable institution. Its faculty can't be assumed to be fools. If their observations of substantial excess heat are reproduced (chances are good) and can't be explained by conventional science (chances are fair), something's got to give.\n\n+0\n\n... written by Ken Roberts,\nOctober 22, 2008\n\nAs a guy with a BS in EE, I am extremely dubious about these claims. The hydrogen atom is the simplest atom, and so is the most well known by models. If there indeed was a lower ground state for hydrogen, then it would inevitably occur naturally, through collisions and other sources of energy. Once it reached that more stable state, it would be predisposed to stay there.\n\nBut it's not my money, so I'll withhold judgment.\n\n+0\n\nJoe written by Joe,\nOctober 22, 2008\n\nCan anyone post a link to the verification work? Something from Rowan university researchers that can be verified? Just a reference, a name...something?\n\nWell as physicists, we need to keep open minds. We are tought that the lower energy state is 1s (ground state). We are also taught that energy is quantized (packetized). On first sight, I would tend to completely dismiss this claim based on what I've learnt.\n\nBut what if energy is not exactly quantized in lower energy states? If this hypothesis leads to simpler and universal mathematical representations, we need to take a look. Theories have been created (and later proven to be correct) from just a guess.\n\nAnd someone please explain how the 2nd law is violated. If an electron in the H2 molecule is \"pushed\" \"let\" into a lower energy state it gives off energy (a quantum of energy, but I will call it a \"fractum\" in this case :) ) and a dihydrino. The H2 molecule is provided probably by electrolysis of water (the generator needs water to run) That's it. Energy production by lowering electron orbit is everywhere around you.\n\nSo, if there is indeed an energy state lower than the ground state, this has a chance. We need to see experimental data.\n\n+0\n\nBig Claims require Big Proof written by Dave W,\nOctober 22, 2008\n\nA lot more proof would be needed before I would even begin to believe.\n\n+0\n\n... written by madi,\nOctober 22, 2008\n\nI'm way out of my league when talking about physics and chemistry, but having just taken a test on this topic the article caught my attention: Right now, without any further information, I'm inclined to dismiss it, but I have to agree with Hank that this really does sound good on the surface. I would like to see the experiment replicated more than just once, and on a larger scale. From what I've been taught, the possibility that this actually works would cause a major overhaul in traditional theories and thinking, but the fact that such a change would be necessary does not make the theory impossible. But with the backing of so many, it does seem like something to keep an eye on.\n\n+0\n\n... written by Obvious BS,\nOctober 22, 2008\n\nYou don't have to think about this one too hard.\n\nIt is such obvious BS. Mills and his gang are whooping it up on investor money for as long as they possibly can.\n\nThey only get away with these scams because of 3 factors:\n\n1) The potential rewards are so tempting, people deperately want to believe.\n\n2) All kinds of people part with vast sums of money for all kinds of reasons. Happens all the time.\n\n2) The technology and claims are beyond the understanding of all but a handful of nutty professors who nobody listens to anyway.\n\nEestor is another one.\n\n+0\n\nDrones? Please... written by Kris,\nOctober 23, 2008\n\nTo the flamers above: I'm certainly not being a drone when I say that quantum field theory doesn't predict any Hydrogen electron energy states below the ground state. In order for the hydrino theory to be correct, one would have to either disprove or generalize upon a theory devised by one of the most brilliant minds to ever have existed: Richard Feynman. QFT has been experimentally verified to more significant figures than any other physical theory to date. This is a serious hurdle for these explanations of the Blacklight effect.\n\nHyperspaced, yes, open minds are what science is all about. If these experiments are in fact legitimate, there must be an explanation, it's just that Hydrinos won't be it.\n\nI also agree with you regarding the 2nd law of thermo (see my first post).\n\n+0\n\nBlacklight Power a bunch of Black Pile G written by nanokiwi,\nOctober 23, 2008\n\npaint that children will apply to themselves in Africa, charging lights and tourist's cellphones just by holding them to their bodies\n\nand isn't that the kind of world we all want? one of children, running round, carrying an electrical charge?\n\n+0\n\nTo all the \"academic\" types written by HankS,\nOctober 23, 2008\n\nI'd like to start by saying I don't believe this claim, however I'm more astonished by your attitude.\n\nFrankly you're acting as though your formulas, laws, and rules are backed up by both common sense and the laws of the universe, and never subject to change or revision.\n\nSome things to note:\n\n1) your formulas aren't being directly used by the universe, instead they were created by fallible humans and are the closest thing you have that mimics how the universe actually works.\n\n...it's no use claiming the current theories are insufficient... they have produced the most accurate theoretical predictions to date\n\nKris, exactly thanks for inadvertently proving my point.\n\n2) saying something is impossible and backing that claim up with references to rules and laws is as BS as the free-energy claim. You were taught those rules and laws, if they're wrong or flawed then so is the entire foundation of your argument.\n\n3) being a student, chemical engineer, or electrical engineer is really not relevant. Though sharing a lot of the same laws and rules no one expects a student, CE, or EE to land the Nobel Prize for re-writing the fundamental laws of physics.\n\n4) if you want to have credibility stop throwing around the quotes about laws and rules, go test the mechanism and either prove it doesn't work or, more likely, prove the extra energy is from some other source or reaction.\n\nScience is not fixed, it constantly evolves. The truly revolutionary discoveries are made by people exploring the edges of what's accepted, not those quoting books.\n\n+0\n\nYou're clearly not a Scientist written by Kris,\nOctober 23, 2008\n\nHankS, you're clearly not a scientist (or Hank, the EcoGeek site admin). If you were you'd have realised that we're actually in AGREEMENT with one another. My point was that the best thing we have to model the relevant behaviour is QFT. I didn't say it's the precise way the universe works - that's not science. I said it's the best game in town and has been experimentally verified to better precision than any other theory (they're called theories for a reason - as you pointed out). It's essentially chemistry. And please don't try saying that maybe this is an effect of quantum gravity...\n\nTo finish with a blanket statement like \"science is not fixed...\" doesn't do you any favours. No it isn't fixed by it sure has a lot of inertia; to disprove the predictions of QFT would be extraordinarily difficult and very very unlikely (NOTE: I didn't say impossible) for the hydrino model. We're not talking about changing a pair of socks here. We're talking about revisions to the most precise physical thoery ever to have been invented.\n\nAnd as for claiming I'm just regurgitating laws and formulas learnt in school: don't insult me. No honest scientist could live with themselves if they just relied on memorised facts (most would fail doing so). Science is founded upon objective rationalism: the never-ending questioning of our current understanding of the universe. Yes, our understanding changes but (and I feel I'm repeating myself here) the hydrino model has a lot ahead of it if it wishes to do so. If you read the works by Mills, there is no hint at reformulating QFT, just fanciful claims of reching a state lower than the ground state - simply from observing CHEMICAL reactions. Classic case of bunkum. c.f. all cold fusion literature to date.\n\n+0\n\ntypo written by Kris,\nOctober 23, 2008\n\nOf course, I meant \"reaching a state ...\".\n\nAlthough, interpreting it as \"retching a state ...\" wouldn't be unreasonable, either ;)\n\n+0\n\nI never claimed to be either one... written by HankS,\nOctober 23, 2008\n\nAnd as stated in my last post I don't claim this theory is correct.

You've just incorrectly interpreted my statement. I never said it was impossible. I basically said that the Hydrino theory violates QFT. In doing so, any theory that can accomodate the Hydrino must generalise upon QFT; a monumental task (and one clearly not fit for Mills). This is something completely different to saying the Hydrino theory is plain incorrect/impossible.\n\nMy comment regarding \"your clearly not a scientist\" was a retort to your flippant attitude towards what you appeared to think of as the scientific body. It's not an exclusive club. Anyone can think scientifically. Your comment just came across a little conspiratorial.\n\nBrian, that comment doesn't help. The flat-world hypothesis was disproven over time against a political/religious body that simply couldn't imagine it being wrong and was willing to kill to keep it that way. Thankfully this kind of societal attitude has (almost; c.f. I.D.) disappeared. These days, those dismissive of Mill's ideas would welcome evidence of their validity with open arms. All `evidence' thus far has been marvelously underwhelming. I've stated above what the Hydrino theory has to accomplish in order to be accepted as science. Almost everything points to it being very unlikely (save for some dodgy high-school grade experiments and some rediculous theory: \"grand unification of classical quantum mechanics\" - seriously, WTF?). Until these issues are addressed, the Hydrino model (like every other budding theory) simply IS NOT SCIENCE. e.g. does not pertain to observed reality.\n\n+0\n\n... written by Mack,\nOctober 27, 2008\n\nBlacklightpower must demonstrate several repeatable and testable experimental results to make its case. There is nothing inherently difficult about this. It does not depend on belief or ideology:\n\n1. Do the spectal lines predicted by his theory said to arise from hydrino transitions show up in his cells? (And can any other source of those lines properly ruled out?) 2. Is his claim that the sun's corona is powered by hydrino transitions verified by detectable spectral lines predicted by his theory emitted from the corona? 3. If dark matter is hydrinos or di-hydrinos can interstellar clouds of dark matter be detected via UV or x-rays emitted from hydrino transitions occuring within such clouds? 4. Do NMR scans of hydrino compounds demonstrate (or indicate) that the electron exists closer to the proton? 5. Can he generate an amount of heat far in excess of anything that could be based on the most efficient chemical fuel? 6. Does his molecular modelling software (Millsian) which is based on his theory exhibit accuracy (matches experimental results), speed and simplicity compared to the best available QM based molecular modelling software?\n\nIf he can do the above (and depending on what you read, he has done a number of them) then he has fulfilled the requirement of proof. He still needs to have more duplication by external parties like the Rowan effort and this is as it should be.\n\nEither way it's going to be fun to see this played out. Mills is privately fully funded and doesn't want anyone's money and his business plan envisages charging power companies that retrofit their powerplants to use his solid fuel and process a license based on percentages of the money saved on fuel costs. If it doesn't work, then he will get zip.\n\n+0\n\nMills' theory is nonsensical cherry-pick written by Kris,\nOctober 28, 2008\n\nI agree with your points, Mack. Blacklight power might very well exist. However, I think you underestimate the gravity of his claims that his \"grand unified theory of classical quantum mechanics\" theory is correct (hence, apparently, the Hydrino).\n\nIf Blacklight power does prove to work, the Hydrino theory would still be horribly insufficient as it would violate all theory to date, and as I've said ad nauseum above, the reconciliation of his theory with modern science would be highly unlikely; he uses Newtonian mechanics for goodness' sake! We KNOW classical mechanics is insufficient for describing the behaviour of molecular/atomic systems, and have known for almost a century. This would imply that his theory is IRRECONCILABLE with our current understanding (which has been tested time and time again to the point where it only breaks down under extreme regimes - e.g. quantum gravity). END OF STORY!\n\nThis is not ideology or belief. It's science. Any new theory must be able to explain all preceding phenomena. Mills' theory fails at the outset: classical mechanics can't describe quantum phenomena. It's just ridiculous.\n\nI also have no doubt at all that his software would epically fail under any serious application to modern molecular modeling.\n\n+0\n\nLubos speaks sense written by Kris,\nOctober 28, 2008\n\nI've found Lubos Motl to be aggressive at times but he's usually right in the end. He discusses Hydrinos here:\n\n\n\nThe comments after the post demonstrate, in a horribly cat least briefly, what would be required to describe Hydrinos in a modern scientific framework (and Mills' theory isn't it); failing in each scenario.\n\n+0\n\n... written by Kris,\nOctober 28, 2008\n\nSorry. Read: \"in a horribly confusing fashion\". There's no place for cats in Mills' theory as it necessarily does away with the uncertainty principle all together.\n\n+0\n\n... written by Mack,\nOctober 28, 2008\n\nCheers Kris. There's no question Mills is arguing that classical physics be reinstated as applying at both the macro and micro levels and that he honestly believes that classical physics can explain everything that has gone before. That massive GUT of his claims to cover all existing observed phenomena as well as the new stuff like the hydrino. I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of those huge downloadable files :)\n\nIf you go back to 1986 when he was a student you find that he read his EE Professor's (Haus') paper on the classical explanation for the radiation of electrons in the free electron laser and sought to apply that to explain the non-radiation of the single electron when it was bound in the hydrogen atom. From that he developed his classical model of the electron - the dynamic extended two dimensional spinning particle of charge with complex current patterns that changes its shape in the presence of electric fields and forms what he calls the \"orbitsphere\" around the proton.\n\nQuantization is said to arise from this perfectly conducting sphere acting as a resonator cavity, able to absorb and emit specific photons which alter the radius of the sphere due to the properties of the absorbed photon. Excited states aren't stable because the absorbed photon creates \"fourier components\" in the sphere that are synchronous with waves travelling at the speed of light and thus the sphere will radiate and reduce in radius.\n\nThis model led him to be belief that the orbitsphere can't radiate and lose energy but it can non-radiatively transfer energy to a catalyst by resonant energy transfers that can absorb multiples of 27.2ev and this would make the orbitsphere unstable, causing it to emit large amounts of energy as the orbitsphere shrinks until it hits the next stable hydrino state.\n\nThe main question for me is why does this orbitsphere only couple to and transfer energy to a catalyst atom, ion or molecule that can absorb an integer multiple of 27.2ev? I know it is the potential energy of H but is that the reason? Anyone? Plus the energy release is huge compared to normal chemistry. Obviously the energy comes from the collapse of the radius but can the reduction in radius of the sphere explain the amount of energy claimed?\n\nI don't have a problem with resonant energy transfers. They are a well studied energy tranfer mechanism that usually occurs between an excited donor atom or ion and an acceptor atom or ion that can exactly absorb the energy the donor wants to give up. I just don't know why the ground state H atom wants to lose that particular energy. Does he consider the H atom to be a metastable excited state? If it truly is a classical system than a proton and electron at a radius other than that of the proton should want to lose energy and perhaps his electron extended particle model prevents it from doing so. I think I will have to read a lot more to understand this part...\n\nMills doesn't accept that you can't model atomic and molecular systems classically which I suspect is why he created and released his modelling software based on his orbitsphere concept to prove that it could be done. It'd be good if someone with experience in molecular modelling could look at this and get back to us. He is offering a time limited free trial of Millsian.\n\nKris, I don't have your absolute conviction that he must be wrong. The idea of a single classical theory that covers everything and explains everything does have huge appeal. I just want to base my decision on whether he is right on hardcore physical evidence and this is what he slowly appears to be supplying. If the hydrino exists and it was predicted from his theory and not from mainstream theory, that is a strong argument that the theory is correct- to a certain degree anyway. Not sure I can accept his anti-gravitation hypothesis just yet :)\n\n+0\n\nMillsian software test written by Kris,\nOctober 29, 2008\n\nGood point, Mack. I, too, would be very interested in finding out the results of an independent review of the Millsian software.\n\nPutting the fundamental issues I mentioned above aside, a test of his software against other well-developed QM numerical models would certainly answer many questions about his theory, as you mentioned earlier. Since the QM-based models are known to correlate well with observed spectra, failure of Millsian to produce the same results should put arguments about the validity of his theory to rest (namely, the grave).\n\nI wouldn't say my conviction is absolute (absolute convictions are anti-science) but it's certainly strong enough to not warrant my attention any further, which is no real loss to the subatomic physics community any way :)\n\n+0\n\nBlacklight did publish results of spectr written by dg,\nNovember 16, 2008\n\nMack,  does seem to provide data that addresses several of your points: 1. Do the spectal lines predicted ... 2. Is his claim that the sun's corona ... 6. Does his molecular modelling software ...\n\nA significant part of the problem here has a good deal to do with \"basic symantics\" rather than quantum mechanics. The conceptual vocabulary does not yet exist that will provide a convenient bridge that can be accessed from ground level to span the seeming gap, much less for framing it all up with a tidy packaging to hand it across in a form recognizable to the impirically finite assignments that bottom out into a \"ground state\" and leave it there, impirically well reasoned and sound.\n\nIf you ponder infinity, does that pondering extend \"outward\" radially with no bounds, centered from where your thought begins? Or do you also ponder the infinite within? Just as infinity has no end, it also has no beginning. Just as there is the infinitely \"larger\", so is there the infinitely \"smaller\", --dense/rarefied, expansive/contractive.........\n\nWhatever can be seen and sensed becomes measured, quantified, hypothesized and exercised mathematically into working models and impirical formulations that explain it ALL from every angle yet known for perception, until the senses are extended and can see more than they could before and the process starts in again with its weights and measures to take it all in as again seems fitting for a time. Using the misnomer, the \"laws of physics\", can get a person hide-bound! The formulation is an ongoing process, one that is ALWAYS and ever an infinite work in progress. It is certainly NOT an ultimatum. When locked up in a dark closet of \"either/or\" it becomes stunted and retarded until serendipity blows through and sets it free again! There is always more to encompass, an infinity of inclusiveness to grasp on the way to Universal Inclusiveness which itself is an Infinite adventure.\n\nLet me try a simple little alegorically reflective illustration, even if it may seem to wander a bit off the wall: Always I have been highly energetic, highly charged with energy that kept the \"get up and go\" ready to go again as if wired with 440 instead of a normal 110. I could though, also relax fully, in an instant, at need or whim. This was not explainable calorically, nor with the ease of letting into a fully relaxed state, could it be cast into the \"nervous energy\" of someone \"high strung\".. With a slow metabolism, it took few calories to keep me going and in childhood my mother often complained that I didn't eat enough to keep a bird alive! Still, I was also athletic and shortly after joining the highschool swimteam the coach fast-tracked me suddenly into swimming the distance events by the second swim meet, then by the third meet, I began, and from then on, to place first. The energy level has generally been quite noticeable to others, often remarked upon by people, even in passing, again and again across time. Even so, if my caloric intake exceeded the metabolic rate, it soon showed! It didn't take much. Still, the energy just kept freely streaming through. That's highly FUNCTIONAL, WORKING energy! I guarrantee you though that I wasn't breaking any \"laws\" of thermodynamics! If you ever have the opportunity to see and hear Rep. Dennis Kucinich, go, and be sure to take the opportunity while there to shake his hand; you could then see and likely feel this same sort of \"phenomena\" for yourself, though he may well be plugged in beyond 440! He usually does extend his hand to meet people wherever he goes.\n\nOne cannot stick the end of some tubing into a gas tank and expect to see gas start running out the other end, but after enough pressure has been applied, to draw it up the tube and get it going, it will continue to stream on through the tube and out the other end as long as the liquid lasts and the flow remains unbroken. Now, without a pump or steady pressured push, it seems incredible that liquid should flow up a tube and out like a continuous feed. Applying the conditions necessary to draw the liquid up the tube at the outset though, is all that is required for it to continue running even long after that, \"like magic\", on its own---\n\nSo, just let it go and let in more possibility! You needn't get sloppy about it, just relax and allow more of what IS the space to come through to be seen. Keep those working hypotheses in motion and well lubricated too, with healthy imagination! Try working up a program geared toward exercising and building into a knack for holographic perception!

I am asking you to consider a hydrino model where the zero state is unchanged but the orbital instead twists on the time axis in the vacancy provided by the larger virtual particles in Casimir exclusion field. I believe much of the experimental evidence is correct but everyone wrongly assumed change in the electron radius instead of time(planks'maybe not so constant?).  . Doctors Haisch and Moddel from Cal-Tech were quietly awarded a patent for a much more plausible description and patent of hydrino formation on May 8, 2008. They correctly identify the exclusion of large virtual particles in Casimir cavities as the exploitable property behind hydrino formation. They use multiple conducting and insulating plates with submicron channels drilled through the stack forming an array through which they circulate monatomic hydrogen. I disagree with both Cal-Tech and Black light Power describing the orbital as falling to below zero state inside the Casimir exclusion field but at least Cal-Tech realized this is a quantum effect where as BLP still persists in pushing their Grand Unified Theory (they may have no recourse since their patent would be in peril if they admit Casimir effect now that Cal-Tech has filed a correct patent). I believe both parties misinterpreted the energy gain as occurring when the atom enters a Casimir cavity. I believe the orbital's are free to twist into a novel orientation on the time axis due to the missing larger virtual particles and if they happen to form a molecule while inside the exclusion field the orientation will be preserved when exiting the field. This forces normally chaotic virtual particles to organize when they discover these arrogant little orbital's projecting out into the time stream. They form boundary conditions with these orbital's trying to break the covalent bond and release energy as the signature black light plasma from which BLP takes their name or for lesser orientations form an energy transport suitable for throwing in your car or heater for combustion to release the stored energy.\n\nVR Francis X Roarty\n\n+0\n\nread their meter written by Dennis,\nAugust 02, 2009\n\nI have a simple question - is Blacklight Power paying their electric bill or producing their own.

Compared to many other methods of storing energy, especially fossil fuels, batteries aren't very energy dense—that is, a 1-pound battery stores far less energy than is contained in a pound of gasoline. That wouldn't be so bad if the energy in a battery were easy to replenish—your Tesla might still go only a couple hundred miles on a single charge, but if you could fully recharge it in five minutes rather than several hours, the low capacity wouldn't bother you as much.\n\nScientists have spent decades trying to create the perfect battery—a battery with great energy density or, at least, one that doesn't take so long to charge. If we could somehow make this perfect battery, pretty much every gadget you use, from your phone to your laptop to your future electric car, would be amazing, or just less annoying than they are today. The perfect battery might also help with some other important stuff: climate change, oil wars, pollution, etc.\n\nOne approach for improving the battery is to forget about the battery and instead improve capacitors. A capacitor, like a battery, is a device that stores electrical energy. But capacitors charge and discharge their energy an order of magnitude faster than batteries. So if your phone contained a capacitor rather than a battery, you'd charge it up in a few seconds rather than an hour. But capacitors have a big downside—they're even less energy dense than batteries. You can't run a phone off a capacitor unless you wanted a phone bigger than a breadbox. But what if you could make a dense capacitor, one that stored a lot of energy but also charged and discharged very quickly? Over the past few years, researchers at several companies and institutions around the world have been racing to do just that.\n\nThey're in hot pursuit of the perfect \"supercapacitor,\" a kind of capacitor that stores energy using carbon electrodes that are immersed in an electrolyte solution. Until recently, though, supercapacitors have been expensive to produce, and their energy densities have fallen far short of what's theoretically possible. One of the most promising ways of creating supercaps uses graphene—a much-celebrated substance composed of a one-atom layer of carbon—but producing graphene cheaply at scale has proved elusive.\n\nThen something unexpectedly amazing happened. Maher El-Kady, a graduate student in chemist Richard Kaner's lab at UCLA, wondered what would happen if he placed a sheet of graphite oxide—an abundant carbon compound—under a laser. And not just any laser, but a really inexpensive one, something that millions of people around the world already have—a DVD burner containing a technology called LightScribe, which is used for etching labels and designs on your mixtapes. As El-Kady, Kamer, and their colleagues described in a paper published last year in Science, the simple trick produced very high-quality sheets of graphene, very quickly, and at low cost. (via Graphene supercapacitors: Small, cheap, energy-dense replacements for batteries. - Slate Magazine)\n\nMetabolic pathways are extremely complex, but here I will give a snapshot of a cross section of the pathway for Vitamin B12. At the center of the molecule there is a cobalt atom which is first converted to Co3+ and then to Co+ by flavoprotein reductase enzymes. Co+ is a very strong nucleophile: read, it has a very strong attraction for positive charges. It thus attacks the number five carbon on ATP causing a reaction which forms 5'-deoxyadenosyl-cobalamin. This active form of the vitamin can be used in other metabolic pathways for a plethora of things.\n\nIt should be noted that Vitamin B12 does not occur commonly in nature but can be converted through the above pathway into an active molecule which can then be run through other metabolic pathways to be used in biological systems.\n\nThe standard model describes all of the known particles of matter and how they are affected by 3 particular forces (I will explain these 3 forces later). To start, I'm going to assume that I have to explain everything from scratch so sorry if you already know…\n\nOkay. Today is one of the really rare days when I'm going to talk about my country's own history and politics.\n\nThe Gwangju massacre, also known as the Gwangju uprising or Gwangju democratization movement, was an event where citizens rose up against Chun Doo Hwan's dictatorship and took control of the city. This was later crushed by the South Korean army, leading to massive civilian deaths. This damaged Chun Doo Hwan's popularity and ultimately led to other democratization movements in June, which later overthrew the government.\n\nI'd like to say that this is what people like Hyosung are making fun of when they say shit like \"democratization\" in the wrong context.\n\nI'd like to say that this is a traumatic event still for Koreans from Gwangju even to today, and that today, the current politician, Park Geun Hye, refused a song called \"임을 위한 행진곡\" which is a song that symbolizes the movement, to be played at the memorial."

The process takes place through light-induced electron transfer reactions in a membrane protein complex photosystem II, but so far the resolution of structural studies on the protein complex has been too limited to ascertain the mechanism of these reactions in detail.\n\nNow Jian-Ren Shen at Okayama University in collaboration with researchers at Osaka City University in Japan has solved the structure of the photosystem II complex at an unprecedented resolution. They improved the quality of the photosystem II crystals significantly, and obtained X-ray diffraction data with a resolution of 1.9 Å.\n\nTheir studies revealed the detailed structures of amino acid residues and a number of cofactors involved in light absorption, energy transfer, and electron transfer reactions in this protein complex. The most significant finding of their work is elucidation of the detailed structure of the Mn4CaO5 cluster, which catalyses the light-induced water-splitting reaction. The cluster is shaped like a distorted chair and the distances between atoms in the structure provide insights into the role of oxygen and nearby water molecules in dioxygen formation.

Peter Vollhardt and collaborators at the University of California, Berkeley, have discovered molecules composed of organic material and metal that store sunlight in the form of usable thermal energy.\n\nThe direct conversion of solar photons (tiny particles of light) to power the planet is one of the most important challenges of this century. Although many efforts focus on photovoltaics, the approach taken by these researchers follows a relatively unexplored path: Trapping solar energy in the form of high-energy chemical bonds using light.\n\nBecause these molecules store absorbed sunlight as heat, they can use the energy at a later time and place. This strategy has several key advantages over traditional approaches:\n\nI dont understand why people are so infatuated with storing sunlight or electricity which is cost prohibitive at current technology levels. Maybe in the future whenever we make new discoveries.. For now, we should focus on daylight hour usage first. When the sun shines, we can and should switch to solar usage with whatever we can design for current live usage. After the sunset, we can fall back on the old grandaddy, the grid! This way, we can make immediate headway toward reducing our overdependence on hydrocarbons . Lets just hope and cross fingers that we will discover more economical means of storing electricity or solar heat whatever it is.. in the future. I feel that those people who push storage technologies used to store solar energy are doing it to confuse the public and create needless delays in our purusits toward increased energy independence with solar energy.

According to Fast Company, professor Daniel Nocera used solar power captured during the day to split a water molecule into its basic elements -- oxygen and hydrogen. The hydrogen gas is stored in a fuel cell, which is used to provide energy at night. Although splitting a water molecule isn't revolutionary, this system's ability to split any type of water -- even waste water or drinking water -- is what makes Nocera's system noteworthy. He recently said, \"We have the capability to power a household with just two bottles of water from any source.\"\n\nNocera's company, Sun Catalytix, has received a multi-million dollar investment from India's Tata group, and in just a little more than a year, the energy system could, according to Business Standard, become available to consumers for as cheap as $20."

During manufacture of lithium-ion batteries, a paste is spread over a metal foil. This paste contains NMP (N-Methylpyrrolidone) – a solvent that can cause genetic damage. It also contains a fluorinated polymer which may cause environmental damage during production. The ceramics group has a great deal of experience in creating water based systems for ceramic pastes and this knowledge is being used in the development of water based pastes for lithium-ion batteries.

In the 3D image, the yellow region denotes the paired backbones and the blue region denotes the liquid-like side chains. Image: Brookhaven National Laboratory\n\nDetailed studies of one of the best-performing organic\nphotovoltaic materials reveal an unusual bilayer lamellar structure that may\nhelp explain the material's superior performance at converting sunlight to\nelectricity and guide the synthesis of new materials with even better\nproperties. The research, published in Nature Communications, was conducted by\nscientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Brookhaven National\nLaboratory, in collaboration with researchers from Stony\nBrook University,\nSeoul National\nUniversity in Korea, the Max Planck Institute for Polymer\nResearch in Germany,\nand Konarka Technologies.\n\nThe material, known by the handle PCDTBT, is an example of a \"polycarbazole conjugated polymer,\" a molecule composed of a chain-like carbon\nbackbone with alkyl side chains. Its ability to move electrons around—both \"donating\"\nand \"accepting\" them—makes it among the best organic photovoltaic materials\ncurrently in use, able to convert sunlight to electricity with efficiency as\nhigh as 7.2% in organic solar cells.\n\n\"Despite the fact that this material has been extensively\nstudied, no one has reported detailed structural features to provide a basis\nfor its superior performance,\" said Brookhaven physicist Benjamin Ocko, who led\nthe current research. \"Understanding why this material performs so well will\nhelp scientists harness its essential attributes to engineer new materials for\na wide range of applications, including displays, solid-state lighting, transistors,\nand improved solar cells,\" he said.\n\nTo probe the molecular structure, the team exposed thin films of\nPCDTBT to intense beams of X-rays at Brookhaven's National Synchrotron Light\nSource (NSLS) using a high-resolution X-ray scattering technique. Unlike\nprevious studies, which used less-intense X-rays, these studies revealed the\nformation of a crystalline-like phase at elevated temperatures. Furthermore,\nthe patterns produced by the diffracted X-rays indicate that the structure is\ncomprised of layers of conjugated backbone pairs, a pattern quite different\nfrom the single backbone constructions observed in all other organic\nphotovoltaic materials studied to date.\n\nXinhui Lu, the paper's lead author, noted that by analyzing the\nscattering patterns, they discovered undulations along the polymer's backbone,\nand how the undulations in neighboring backbones are shifted with respect to\neach other. By carrying out molecular modeling simulations, the authors were\nable to predict which polymer backbone configuration would be most stable.\n\nIn a conjugated polymer, the backbone provides the path for\nelectrical conductivity and the alkyl side chains, similar to simple oils,\nprovide the solubility required for processing. Though necessary, these side\nchains interfere with the polymer's electrical performance. PCDTBT is novel,\nthe scientists say, since it is predominately composed of the backbone with\nlittle alkyl material. \"Similar to oil and water, the polymer's conjugated\nbackbone pairs 'phase separate' from their alkyl side chains and this gives\nrise to the bilayer structure,\" said David Germack, one of the paper's\ncoauthors. It is this structural motif that likely contributes to the\nmaterial's excellent electrical properties, and this understanding could guide\nthe design of new organic solar materials.\n\n\"While we have significant in-house expertise in synthetic\nchemistry and organic solar device fabrication, we lack the in-depth structural\ncharacterization tools available at Brookhaven Lab,\" said Jeff Peet, a senior\nscientist at Konarka Technologies, a world leader in the development and\ncommercialization of organic solar cells. \"These kinds of tools and\ncollaborative studies with research partners at Brookhaven can elucidate very\nsubtle differences between materials, giving us critical insights into how we\nshould design our next generation of solar cell materials.\""

The breakthrough has led theorists to predict that plastic solar cells could one day become five times more efficient than current solar cell technology.\n\nLike paint, the composite can be sprayed onto other materials and used as portable electricity. A sweater coated in the material could power a cell phone or other wireless devices.

Sargent is one of the inventors of the new plastic material.\n\n\"If we could cover 0.1 percent of the Earth's surface with [very efficient] large-area solar cells,\" he said, \"we could in principle replace all of our energy habits with a source of power which is clean and renewable.\"\n\nInfrared Power\n\nPlastic solar cells are not new. But existing materials are only able to harness the sun's visible light. While half of the sun's power lies in the visible spectrum, the other half lies in the infrared spectrum.\n\nThe new material is the first plastic composite that is able to harness the infrared portion.\n\n\"Everything that's warm gives off some heat. Even people and animals give off heat,\" Sargent said. \"So there actually is some power remaining in the infrared [spectrum], even when it appears to us to be dark outside.\"\n\nThe researchers combined specially designed nano particles called quantum dots with a polymer to make the plastic that can detect energy in the infrared.\n\nWith further advances, the new plastic \"could allow up to 30 percent of the sun's radiant energy to be harnessed, compared to 6 percent in today's best plastic solar cells,\" said Peter Peumans, a Stanford University electrical engineering professor, who studied the work."

Even then, I find myself wanting more. Maybe it's because I've been spoiled by my iPad's amazing battery life, but I wish that both my smartphone and my laptop could hold at least half a day's worth of charge without me having to shut off absolutely every useful function on either electronic.\n\nIt looks like my hopes and dreams for my electronics might be fulfilled in the near future.\n\nA team of Stanford researchers have found the solution to make lithium-ion batteries hold ten times the charge they currently can. How? By replacing the battery's anode, usually constructed out of graphite, with silicon. It sounds like a simple fix, but scientists haven't been able to do so until now because the silicon would be quickly destroyed in a process called decrepitation. Even though silicon atoms would allow more lithium ions to bind than carbon atoms, therefore allowing the battery to store more charge, the silicon would expand and retract as ions flowed through the battery. These expansions and retractions caused cracks in the silicon. Another problem is that the lithium ions would sometimes react with the silicon, removing the battery's ability to charge.\n\nThe Stanford team has developed a technique to strengthen the silicon anodes by making them out of nanowires and hollow nanoparticles. The anode is also coated with an outer layer of silicon oxide, a ceramic material that prevents the silicon from expanding.\n\nFor now, these batteries are able to operate for more than 6,000 cycles, well beyond current lithium-ion battery cycle life standards.\n\nThe team's given no timetable for when this technology will be commercialized. For now, they're working on simplifying the process of creating the new silicon anodes and creating better cathodes to match the new silicon anodes on lithium-ion batteries. I can only hope that such technology will trickle down to the consumer level soon."

EcoFaeBrick is meant for developing regions in Indonesia, where cow dung is plentiful but traditional brick-making materials like firewood and clay are not. According to the Prasetiya team, the EcoFaeBrick is 20% lighter than a clay brick and 20% stronger in compressive strength.

As a fix, Osaka Gas developed activated carbon capable of absorbing methane at low pressure. When methane is put into the gas tank filled with this type of carbon -- under a pressure of around one megapascal (equivalent to the pressure at a depth of 100 meters under water) -- the tank can hold around 30 times the tank's volume of methane, thereby eliminating the need for high-pressure filling.\n\nIn Katori, there is a place called \"Biomass Town,\" where citizens promote the use of cow dung for local biofuel, and it was here that the city looked for users of dung-derived methane.

It is known that light is generated by chemical reactions in which oxygen molecules play an important part. In the animal world, these chemical reactions take place in special luminescent cells called photocytes. These are aggregated into complex light organs, in which the intensity of light is regulated by nerve impulses, and in which light can be modulated with the help of reflectors, lenses and filters. By these means, organisms can adjust the wavelength, diffusion and intensity of light according to need. But the exact mechanisms behind these processes remain shrouded in mystery. Jenny Krönström, a researcher at the Department of Zoology of the University of Gothenburg has put another piece of the jigsaw puzzle in place by investigating the light organs of marine jellyfish, crustaceans and fish. In her thesis she reveals that krill, the luminescent crustacean, is equipped with special muscles that regulate light intensity through contraction and relaxation.\n\nWhich fibers and fabrics are more sustainable than others is always open for debate.

The bamboo enclosure creates a dialogue between the interior and the dramatically changing landscape. The natural landscape changes from a dense brightly green coloured jungle-like forest during the monsoon months to a pale brown shrubby wasteland during the dry and hot summer months. The building has to respond to these extreme conditions by allowing enough shade and breeze during the summer and providing a waterproof indoor environment during the stormy monsoons. The screen of columns creates an ever-changing pattern of light and shadow throughout the seasons and times of the day, making the building a 'sensor' of light.\n\nOrganic farming was among the fastest growing segments of U.S. agriculture during the 1990s.

It is used as a living fence to protect gardens and fields from animals. It is resistant to a high degree of aridity it can be planted even in the desert and as such does not compete with food crops. The seeds contain 30% oil that can be processed to produce a high-quality biodiesel fuel, usable in a standard diesel engine.\n\nCultivation is uncomplicated. Jatropha curcas grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant can grow in wastelands and grows on almost any terrain, even on gravelly, sandy and saline soils. It can thrive on the poorest stony soil and grow in the crevices of rocks. Complete germination is achieved within 9 days. Adding manure during the germination has negative effects during that phase, but is favorable if applied after germination is achieved. It is usually propagated by cuttings as this yields faster results than multiplication by seeds. The flowers only develop terminally (at the end of a stem), so a good ramification (plants presenting many branches) produces the greatest amount of fruits. Another productivity factor is the ratio between female and male flowers within an inflorescence (usually about 1 female to 10 male flowers - more female flowers mean more fruits . Jatropha curcas thrives on a mere 250 mm (10 in) of rain a year, and only during its first two years does it need to be watered in the closing days of the dry season. Ploughing and planting are not needed regularly, as this shrub has a life expectancy of approximately forty years. The use of pesticides and other polluting substances are not necessary, due to the pesticidal and fungicidal properties of the plant.\n\nThe new Times Square New Year's Eve Ball is a 12 foot geodesic sphere, double the size of previous Balls, and weighs 11,875 pounds.

A new generation of lighting devices based on light-emitting diodes (LEDs) will supplant the common light bulb in coming years, the paper suggests. In addition to the environmental and cost benefits of LEDs, the technology is expected to enable a wide range of advances in areas as diverse as healthcare, transportation systems, digital displays, and computer networking.\n\nA big step towards energy-saving OLED lighting with efficiency of more than 60 lm/W.\n\nInternational standard for white color requirements met BASF and Osram Opto Semiconductors have developed a highly efficient white organic light-emitting diode (OLED): for the first time an OLED not only is able to achieve a light yield of over 60 lumens per watt (lm/W), but also, at the same time, meets the international Energy Star SSL Standard with regard to color requirements. Lighting efficiency on this scale had been achieved previously. Lighting efficiency describes the ratio of luminous flux given off by a lamp to the amount of power consumed; the greater the yield, the less energy is lost. However, up until now the color values of OLEDs have not been within the acceptable band for color coordinates around the Planck curve, as defined by the Energy Star SSL Standard. The color values of the new OLED are within this band – its light retains the white color at different levels of intensity.\n\nThe European Union is considering a ban on trade in seal products.

Earth Overshoot Day marks the day when humanity beings living beyond its ecological means. Beyond that day, we move into the ecological equivalent of deficit spending, utilizing resources at a rate faster than what the planet can regenerate in a calendar year. Globally, we now now require the equivalent of 1.4 planets to support our lifestyles. But of course, we only have one Earth. The result is that our supply of natural resources -- like trees and fish -- continues to shrink, while our waste, primarily carbon dioxide, accumulates.\n\nPETA's upset Giorgio Armani used fur in his fall collection after he told them he wouldn't, according to the New York Post. And it's not just a fur collar here and there — Armani designed floral-printed fur coats, fur-hemmed skirts, and fur-trimmed jackets. But the best part of his collection? Fur coats for babies. It might seem impractical to drape fur over a person who could spit up or drool at any moment, but let's be real — they're warm, and those plastic stroller bags are terribly unbecoming.

The municipality, along with Cree, Inc, a maker of LED lights, are planning to change 16,000 municipal roadway lights with high-efficiency LED fixtures (about 1/4 of total streetlights).\n\nBigger Benefits Up North Because Anchorage has 85 days a year with less than 8 hours of daylight, any benefit over the tradition lighting architecture are compounded. Read on for technical benefits of LED streetlights.\n\nBenefits of LED streetlights The LED fixtures are expected to use 50% less energy than current streetlights, which could save the city $360,000 per year at the current energy prices. The cost of the project is 2.2 million dollars. \"The LED fixtures, based on performance-leading Cree XLamp(r) LEDs, typically last up to seven times longer than high-pressure sodium fixtures, allowing Anchorage to better utilize maintenance resources.\" And the quality of light should also be better, though people will need to get used to it at first.\n\nFoster + Partners presented designs for a new waterfront development in Rimini. Revealed at a public presentation to the City last week, the proposal is designed to strengthen the relationship between the town centre and the seafront and to create a year-round attraction for an international tourist industry.\n\nThe scheme comprises a new seafront promenade with a mix of related activities and public spaces including a hotel tower, which will extend Rimini's historic beach culture and continue the existing urban grain. The project celebrates Rimini's tradition of green boulevards, best characterised by the Via Vespuci. The waterfront will be pedestrianised at certain times and will link directly to a linear public park – or green spine – which will provide much needed shade during the hotter months. This currently links the seafront to the historic city and will be enhanced with improved connections to the new promenade area.\n\nA new hotel tower includes space for a Fellini film museum at its base. Its curving form anchors the wider project, while the building extends out to sea along a new 300m long pier, continuing the dialogue between the city and the water and referring to Rimini's tradition of piers.\n\nThe scheme will use new technologies, such as rainwater collection and photovoltaics, to establish a long-term, sustainable commercial and environmental strategy for the town that is balanced with its rejuvenation in the short-term.\n\nTED is a simple, yet extremely accurate, home energy monitor that allows you to see electricity usage in real-time.

John Mason, the executive director and founder of the Ghana based organization Nature Conversation Research Council (NCRC) believes that in 20 years times, chocolate will be much like caviar today.\n\n\"[Chocolate] will become so rare and so expensive that the average joe won't be able to afford it.\"\n\nThis fate of chocolate is terrifying news for two parties. The chocoholics of the world, but more importantly the producer countries that depend greatly on the sale of the cocoa beans as a portion of their GDP.\n\nThe main cause for the decline in cocoa bean growth is unsustainable farming in Ghana and other nations known for their cocoa plants. Also cocoa is naturally a rainforest plant that grows in shady conditions surrounded by a high biodiversity, until recently. Now, hybrid varieties have been grown on cleared land as mono-cultures and in full sun.\n\nAlthough this hybrid seeds fills the demand for the short term, the soil quickly becomes degraded and the lifespan of plants can be cut from 75 or 100 years, to 30 or less. When the trees die and the land is exhausted, farmers must move on and clear more rainforest to plant cocoa.\n\nThe decline in West African cocoa is not only a problem for farmers and chocolate producers, one of which is Cadbury who uses 100 percent of West African cocoa beans to produce their chocolate, but environmentalists are increasingly concerned about the destruction of the rainforest for short-term gain.\n\nThe motion starved environments we live in are the antithesis of our being.

Into what form will this new kind of gym evolve?\n\nEnvironmental technology: Desalination turns salty water into fresh water. As concern over water's scarcity grows, can it offer a quick technological fix? THERE are vast amounts of water on earth.\n\nUnfortunately, over 97% of it is too salty for human consumption and only a fraction of the remainder is easily accessible in rivers, lakes or groundwater. Climate change, droughts, growing population and increasing industrial demand are straining the available supplies of fresh water. More than 1 billion people live in areas where water is scarce, according to the United Nations, and that number could increase to 1.8 billion by 2025.\n\nOne time-tested but expensive way to produce drinking water is desalination: removing dissolved salts from sea and brackish water. Its appeal is obvious. The world's oceans, in particular, present a virtually limitless and drought-proof supply of water. \"If we could ever competitively—at a cheap rate—get fresh water from salt water,\" observed President John Kennedy nearly 50 years ago, \"that would be in the long-range interest of humanity, and would really dwarf any other scientific accomplishment.\"\n\nHow safe are eggs? The risk of getting a foodborne illness from eggs is very low. However, the nutrients that make eggs a high-quality food for humans are also a good growth medium for bacteria. In addition to food, bacteria also need moisture, a favorable temperature and time in order to multiply and increase the risk of illness. In the rare event that an egg contains bacteria, you can reduce the risk by proper chilling and eliminate it by proper cooking. When you handle eggs with care, they pose no greater food-safety risk than any other perishable food.\n\nThe inside of an egg was once considered almost sterile. But, over recent years, the bacterium Salmonella enteritidis (Se) has been found inside a small number of eggs. Scientists estimate that, on average across the U.S., only 1 of every 20,000 eggs might contain the bacteria. So, the likelihood that an egg might contain Se is extremely small – 0.005% (five one-thousandths of one percent). At this rate, if you're an average consumer, you might encounter a contaminated egg once every 84 years.\n\nOther types of microorganisms could be deposited along with dirt on the outside of an egg. So, in the U.S., eggshells are washed and sanitized to remove possible hazards. You can further protect yourself and your family by discarding eggs that are unclean, cracked, broken or leaking and making sure you and your family members use good hygiene practices, including properly washing your hands and keeping them clean.\n\nBamboo timber can be harvested every year after 7 years, compared to 30 to 50 years for trees. With 10-30% annual increase in biomass versus 2-5% for trees, bamboo can yield 20 times more timber than trees on the same area. Bamboo can be selectively harvested annually and regenerates without replanting. Bamboo generates 30% more oxygen than trees. It helps reduce carbon dioxide gases blamed for global warming. Some bamboo sequesters up to 12 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare, which makes it an efficient replenisher of fresh air. Bamboo is a natural water control barrier. Because of its wide spread root system and large canopy, bamboo greatly reduces rain run off, prevents massive soil erosion and keeps twice as much water in the watershed. Bamboo helps mitigate water pollution due to its high nitrogen consumption, making it a solution for excess nutrient uptake of waste water from manufacturing, livestock farming and sewage treatment.\n\nWith expanded and tougher criteria on toxic chemicals, electronic waste and new criteria on climate change only Sony and Sony Ericsson score more than 5/10 in our latest Guide to Greener Electronics.

The laws of thermodynamics dictate that conversion efficiency will never be 100 percent, because heat is lost at every step of the conversion process. But new technologies may be able to greatly increase conversion efficiency, moving from an overall rate of 36 percent to closer to 50 percent.\n\nAt present, coal — in all its carbon-belching inefficiency — is king because it's cheap. Still, the use of natural gas to create electricity has been rising rapidly, in part because of more-efficient gas turbines.\"High fossil fuel prices will drive technology and innovation, because they respond to price signals,\" said Frank A. Wolak, an economist at Stanford. \"Technology can improve efficiency by working the margin, gaining 10 to 15 percent. That's money.\"\n\nSapphire Energy has built a revolutionary platform that uses photosynthetic microorganisms to produce a renewable, high-value replacement for fossil fuel petroleum.

If the pace continues, a total of 5,600 megawatts of generating power will be installed in 2008, eclipsing the record of 5,300 megawatts, according to figures from the American Wind Energy Association. The new wind power plans installed in the first quarter of this year produce enough electricity to serve the equivalent of 400,000 homes. AWEA Executive Director Randall Swisher said he expects a big swell of projects to go on line by the fourth quarter as utilities and others hedge against the possibility that the production tax credit expires by the end of the year with no renewal from a divided Congress. The AWEA maintains that 76,000 jobs and more than $11.5 billion in investment could be at risk if the measure doesn't pass.\n\nThe 11 Fast Food Junkies are the biggest and baddest fast food companies responsible for this waste.

Having spent time with community leaders and displaced residents determined to return home, Pitt realized that an opportunity existed to build houses that were not only stronger and healthier, but that had less impact on the environment.\n\nPreviously, Pitt sponsored an architecture competition organized by Global Green with the goal of generating ideas about how to rebuild sustainably. Several of those designs are currently under construction in the Lower 9th Ward and the project inspired him to expand his efforts. After discussing the hurdles associated with rebuilding in a devastated area, the group determined that a large-scale redevelopment project focused on green affordable housing and incorporating innovative design was indeed possible.\n\nThe group settled on the goal of constructing 150 homes (one of the larger rebuilding projects in the city), with an emphasis on developing an affordable system that could be replicated. To demonstrate replicability, Pitt determined to locate the project in the Lower 9th Ward, one of the most devastated areas of New Orleans, proving that safe homes could and should be rebuilt. Pitt hopes that this project would be a catalyst for recovery and redevelopment throughout the Lower 9th Ward and across the city of New Orleans. Having listened to one former resident's plea to help \"make this right,\" Pitt was inspired to name the project \"Make It Right\" (MIR).\n\nA coalition of environmental groups, religious leaders and energy companies is asking people to curb climate change by turning off devices not in use.

The Spanish engineering firm Abengoa has announced that it's sealed a deal with the Arizona Public Service (APS) Company to build the largest concentrating solar plant in the whole world about 70 miles southwest of Phoenix, Arizona. It will be one of the first cases where a utility relies on solar power for its day-to-day operations. And at a build cost of $1 billion, it will generate 280 MW of electricity and be capable of powering around 80,000 homes -- in just three years.\n\nThe good news: this morning Plenty Magazine editor Jessica Tzerman was on CBS's The Early Show promoting eco-fashion, including a number of brands we love. The bad news: she provided misleading information about bamboo, saying that it's harvested and woven similarly to linen, and that it's \"completely sustainable and renewable.\"\n\nBamboo is becoming more and more popular as a \"green\" fabric despite the flailing economy as this recent Women's Wear Daily article shows:\n\nAn ongoing interest in anything \"green,\" combined with the fact that the higher end of the market seems to be holding firm, is providing accessories vendors with what they need to remain optimistic going into the 2008 season.\n\nWhile numerous vendors agree that the economy is softer and demand in certain categories has flattened, they believe they can get a jump on the season by offering competitive prices, ensuring quick deliveries and, whenever possible, tapping into the trend for all things organic and eco-friendly.\n\n\"We introduced a bamboo scarf last fall that has been one of our premier products for the season,\" said Wesley Knitter, sales manager of Berkeley, Calif.-based Zazou, a maker of shawls, scarves and gloves.\n\n\"We've been one of the first to put bamboo scarves on the market, and we've seen demand get bigger and bigger.\" Knitter attributes much of that to the going-green initiative that is taking hold in the arena of accessories. That view is certainly borne out by the fact that a new line of fingerless gloves, also in bamboo, sold out immediately. Bamboo seems to be everywhere! It's clear that consumers are eating it up. But they aren't getting straight info, and the \"green media\" doesn't seem to be helping. Here's the skinny:\n\nTextile expert Coral Rose explains that, contrary to what Jessica said on the Early Show, bamboo is not simply harvested and woven like linen. Rose points out that the fabric we see in the U.S. labeled as \"bamboo\" can't technically even be called that since it goes through a process that transforms it into rayon/viscose.\n\nTata is linked to European launch of the air propelled car Plans by Indian car giant Tata Motors to produce a car this year powered only by compressed air have been delayed until further notice, but unofficial sources say Tata may have come to the rescue of the air car's french inventor MDI by investing $30 million in the project.\n\nTata originally signed the deal to use technology developed by French inventor Moteur Development International (MDI), in February 2007, with the hope of launching the new 'air-car' in India in 2008.\n\nMONTE DOURADO, Brazil (Reuters) - Buzzing chain saws and heavy machinery hauling logs through the Amazon jungle look at first like reckless destruction. But a forestry project on the Jari River in northern Brazil is being hailed as a model for preserving the world's largest rain forest.\n\nEvidence in January that the pace of Amazon deforestation has increased after falling for nearly three years renewed a fierce public debate over saving the forest. It also opened a rift in President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government - Earth Hour. This massive collective effort reduced Sydney's energy consumption by 10.2% for one hour, which is the equivalent effect of taking 48,000 cars off the road for one hour.\n\nWith Sydney icons like the Harbour Bridge and Opera House turning their lights off, and unique events such as weddings by candlelight, the world took notice. Inspired by the collective effort of millions of Sydneysiders, many major global cities are joining Earth Hour in 2008, turning a symbolic event into a global movement.\n\n\"Power dressing\" may soon have a very different and literal meaning.

Thieken says that LEDs work well in that application since they remain efficient in cold environments, can be dimmed easily when lighting is not needed, and require little maintenance. Although LED household fixtures exist, Thieken predicts that new lighting applications are likely to be very different from the typical light bulb and will provide an opening for LEDs to rewrite the rules of how lighting is used.

      "text": "Share this:\n\nIn an article appearing this week in the journal Science, UC Berkeley chemists show how to construct a catalyst composed only of edges and demonstrate that it can catalyze the production of hydrogen from water as readily as the edges and defects in regular catalysts.\n\n\"This is a conceptual advance in the way we think about generating hydrogen, a clean burning fuel, from water, a sustainable source,\" said Christopher Chang, associate professor of chemistry and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator at UC Berkeley. \"Our new catalyst is just first generation, but the research gives us and the community a path forward to thinking about how to increase the density of functional active sites so that molecules and materials can be more effective catalysts.\"\n\nAt the moment, creating these catalysts in the lab is not cheaper than using traditional catalysts, but efforts by Chang and others to simplify the process and create materials with billions of active sites on a ridged wafer much like a Ruffles potato chip could allow cheaper, commercially viable fuel cell catalysts.\n\n8 thoughts on \"Breakthrough Could Make Fuel Cells More Efficient\"\n\n…could have a profound impact on the growing market for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.\n\nWhat growing market for hydrogen fuel cells? The problem with hydrogen fuel cells is that they need hydrogen to make them work. And hydrogen is difficult to handle as either a high-pressure or cryogenic liquid. Plus the cost of building a hydrogen distribution system would be daunting.\n\nBetter solutions that I have never read about in Domestic Fuel would be ammonia or methanol fuel cells. Both types of fuel cells are possible, and ammonia and methanol are much easier and would be less expensive to handle than either liquid or high-pressure hydrogen.\n\nFarmers should be especially excited about ammonia fuel cells. Almost every farm in the Midwest already has ammonia storage tanks, or is close to an ag supply company that stores and sells ammonia.\n\nBioleux Polska has the PARS technology to reform bio-ammonia and bio-methanol into hydrogen with a +99% efficiency, on-demand. Thus the hydrogen storage issue is entirely avoided.\nThat means that the fuel cells can use a renewable feedstock which is as cheap as biomass/wastes it's made of.\nSounds revolutionary ? We've been preaching that for a while now.\nShould the fuel cell companies notice ?\n\nBob Canfield is correct. Either ammonia (NH4) or methanol would be a better choice for fuel cells than hydrogen. Especially considering how daunting and expensive building a hydrogen distribution infrastructure would prove.\n\nBoth ammonia and methanol are much easier to handle than hydrogen, are useable in fuel cells, and ammonia also has the advantage of counting no carbon. The emissions from an ammonia fuel cell are nothing more than water and nitrogen — and the earth's atmosphere is already 78% nitrogen.\n\nI too have to wonder about the money and research going towards hydrogen fuel cells, when the possibility of ammonia and methanol fuel cells seem so obvious.\n\nWhy not use the hydrogen as it comes off the catalyst in a self contained system? Water goes in, is converted there to hydrogen, which is piped to the fuel cell and moves the vehicle. How does this concept take away from what the researchers at UC Berkley are doing? Based only on reading this article are there not many potentials that may be gleaned from applying any findings from this research? Is this that far-fetched? Who can argue ammonia is easier to store and use compared to water?"

The results are a step toward designing catalysts for use in hydrogen energy applications such as fuel cells.\n\nScientists from the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory combined experimental and theoretical studies to identify the characteristics of the catalyst, a cluster of rhodium, boron and other atoms. The catalyst chemically reacts with ammonia borane, a molecule that stores hydrogen densely, to release the hydrogen as a gas. Their results, which reveal many molecular details of this catalytic reaction, appear August 5 in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.\n\n\"These studies tell us what is the hardest part of the chemical reaction,\" said PNNL chemist and study author Roger Rousseau. \"If we can find a way to change the hard part, that is, make it easier to release the hydrogen, then we can improve this catalyst.\"\n\nMolecular Tank\n\nResearchers and engineers are trying to create a hydrogen fuel system that stores hydrogen safely and discharges hydrogen easily, which can then be used in fuel cells or other applications.\n\nOne way to achieve such a fuel system is by \"storing\" hydrogen as part of a larger molecule. The molecule that contains hydrogen atoms, in this case ammonia borane, serves as a sort of structural support. The catalyst plucks the hydrogen from the ammonia borane as needed to run the device.\n\nThe PNNL chemists in the Institute for Interfacial Catalysis study a rhodium-based catalyst that performs this job fairly well, but might have potential for improvement.

      "text": "Moulton45's comments below are interesting. This user assumes he has understood the science of electrochemistry and calorimetry after studying wikipedia for 4 days and that he can therefore conclude that the reported excess heat is due to simple measurement mistakes.\n\nWhat he hasn't explained though, is why his assumed measurement mistake only happens every now and then (excess heat is observed only sometimes).\n\nWhat he also hasn't understood is that if his explanation were correct (which isn't so), all previous electrochemistry experiments in the history of science would have had the same systematic experimental error. And Moulton45 has now uncovered it, well done, please collect your Nobel Prize for this significant advancement.\n\nThis is not about chemistry or energy, it's about politics and the power of billions of dollars and people in power with that money backing them every step of the way. This is basically 'free' energy or nearly free with very little amount of money needed to get a tremendous amount of energy. Just think what would happen to all the green energy research, the solar panel companies, the oil and gas, drilling, mining for coal, etc. etc... This would make all those industries come to a screaming halt as well as all the jobs and all the revenue, people would lose trillions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs. I believe this was debunked years ago by the people making large sums of money from these industries. It wasn't until they reproduced it in 27 labs at once and all came forward that they were successful because they can't go after 27 labs at once. And I'm guessing the experts debunking the scince were paid large sums of money to fight this. I've been a scientist for over a decade and I can tell you that most everything you know about science is incorrect, especially if it involves large amounts of money to any one party. Billions upon billions of dollars can push a lie so far that everything just takes it for granted that it's the truth. Politics and money distort science to the point where I don't believe anything I hear anymore. I'm surprised this made the media and I wouldn't be surprised if this was debunked, deleted, and banned from the main stream media. There's just too much money and power at risk.\n\nThe University of Idaho (Moscow, ID) have been developing D2O in larger quanties. This D2O is then sent by guarded vehicles to a small airport just west of the university in Washington state - flown to 3 stations in Alaska (Port Clarence, Attu, and one not specified) to continue the experiments. Small laboritories left from old WWII Coast Guard bases have been working dilligently (and Secretly) on this process thanks to the U.S. Government and a few private corporations that supply materials. These stations in Alaska often change temporarily to Hawaii and on to other Pacific islands where secrecy, again, can be easily maintained. Not even the highest government officials know about these bases since there is no interest nor government monies going into the experiments. The only direct involvement from the Government is the use of transporting materials, equipment, and personnel by military air and sea-going vessels. And since the materials and personnel are quite minimal, these movements are easily substantiated in budget or fiscal expenditures as \"routine.\"\n\nI am not a scientist, but I find this story very interesting, as I am very much into \"energy issues.\"\n\nCertainly the comments by Moulton45 are interesting, even though I don't have the background to really critque or even understand some of the terms he uses. But whether or not he and the other skeptics are correct is obviously beyond me.\n\nIt seems obvious to me though that one easily determine whether excess electrical energy is ultimately created by using a battery of a certain known amp-hour rating as the souce of electrical energy, and after heating water (or a refrigerant in an ORC process for a more efficient conversion) and turning a turbine to produce electricity, charge (if possible) several such virgin batteries with this electricity. This would be \"real world\" experiment -- not just one in lab conditions. Obviously if the water wasn't heated enough to produce the requisite electricity, then the virgin batteries wouldn't be charged (whether it is one battery, or a hundred or more).\n\nFocardi and Rossi recently held a public demonstration of a desktop-sized reactor that produces 11 kW of net power for extended periods of time. Both the fuel and residues are clean and free of radioactivity. The fuel is a nickel powder and a tiny amount of hydrogen. A gram of nickel generates 2000 kilowatt-hours in this prototype. On January 14, 2011 a public demonstration was held at the University of Bologna with about 50 attendees. The US press totally ignored this momentous event. Perhaps 60 Minutes should do an update on this story. The disaster in Japan makes it painfully clear that our current nuclear power, which was adapted from bomb technology, is a disastrous mistake. Focardi and Rossi plan to deliver a one million watt power station to a Greek company this October. A true \"black swan\" event, this technology will change the world.\n\nScott Pelley, when you were in McKubre's lab at SRI with your CBS News film crew, did it occur to you to slap a VU Meter (or a European style Peak Power Meter) across the terminals of his cell, to measure the AC (audio) power going into his cell?\n\nMcKubre might not bother to measure AC (audio) power, but the technicians at CBS surely know how to measure the peak-to-peak audio power using an ordinary VU Meter.\n\nIn McKubre's best results, he reports an excess power of about 500 to 1200 mW. My calculations, treating the AC (audio) power as a 2 volt peak-to-peak triangle wave, yield an audio power going into his cell of roughly 500 to 1800 Mw.\n\nIs this the missing input power that Michael Garwin suspects that McKubre left out of his model when he (McKubre) assumed there was only constant current DC power going into his cell?\n\nIt turns out that the missing correction for AC power doesn't depend on any capacitive load in the cell. The correction applies even to a pure resistive load, if the ohmic resistance is fluctuating (as it does when the cell is bubbling).\n\nIt's ironic that McKubre is funded by EPRI, the Electric Power Research Institute, which depends on funding from the electric power utilities, whose revenues depend on calculating AC power consumption correctly.\n\nMcKubre (like most researchers in CF) is using a precision constant current power supply. When the ohmic resistance of the cell fluctuates (as it does when it's bubbling), the constant current power supply has to adjust the drive voltage to maintain the constant current. In an ideal constant current power supply, this adjustment is instantaneous. But in a real power supply it takes a small but finite time for the power supply to adjust. The speed at which it adjusts is called the slew rate. But no matter how fast the slew rate, there is a transient in which the voltage and current are perturbed and ramp to a new value.\n\nIt turns out that the AC power from this transient isn't that hard to compute. It can be modeled as a linear ramp, which replaces the ideal square wave (instantaneous correction) with a sawtooth (or triangle wave). When you integrate the power over the rise or fall of the triangle wave, you get the AC power that McKubre left out of his model.\n\nI took the data from two of McKubre's experimental runs where he reports significant excess heat, and computed the AC power, assuming a peak-to-peak voltage fluctuation of 2 volts. I get AC power almost exactly equal to his anomalous excess heat.\n\nSo Michael Garwin was right. McKubre neglected to account for the AC power pumped into his cell when it's bubbling furiously and taxing the power supply to maintain a constant current as fast as it can.\n\nThere's a slew of AC electrical energy in that slew rate that McKubre neglected to account for.\n\nThere is yet another issue with these cells that seems applicable to all of them using an electrolyte driven by a constant current power supply.\n\nWhen the cells are fully loaded, and evolving D2 and O2 gas, there is some (variable) amount of gas that clings to the electrodes, forming an irregular thin layer of gassy foam separating the electrode from the electrolyte.\n\nA thin layer of dielectric material separating the electrode from the electrolyte introduces a phenomenon known as an electrochemical double layer. In effect, it turns the electrodes into double-layer capacitors, which can store energy the way an electronic flash does when it charges up.\n\nBecause McKubre and others are using a constant current power supply, the voltage into the cell fluctuates significantly once the bubbles start forming and wreaking havoc with the conductivity of the interface between the electrolyte and the electrodes. This fluctuating voltage drives an AC noise current into the cell, rapidly charging and discharging the double-layer capacitors formed by the presence of the thin layer of gas on the surface of the electrodes. This AC noise current is not included in McKubre's energy budget, but it appears to be large enough to account for the otherwise unexplained heat.\n\nIn other words, his cell is a large Electrolytic Capacitor with a Teflon dielectric.\n\nHere is a quick explanation from the Wikipedia article on Types of Capacitors:\n\n\"Electrolytic capacitors have a larger capacitance per unit volume than other types, making them valuable in relatively high-current and low-frequency electrical circuits, e.g. in power-supply filters or as coupling capacitors in audio amplifiers.

      "text": "ORNL has developed a monolithic adsorbent that is described as a \"carbon fiber composite molecular sieve\" (CFCMS). It is a rigid, permeable carbon structure that exhibits high surface area, large pore volume, and significant electrical conductivity. The unique combination of high adsorptive capacity, permeability, good mechanical properties, and electrical conductivity represents an enabling technology for the development of a novel system for scrubbing carbon dioxide from a diverse range of gas streams. By coupling the CFCMS technology with an electrical swing adsorption (ESA) technique, the CFCMS adsorbent is readily regenerated through resistive heating. Through simultaneous operation of two or more CFCMS/ESA units, cycling between adsorption and regeneration, CO2-free gas streams can be continuously produced. Key advantages of this technology over other gas separation methods based on adsorption phenomena, such as pressure swing adsorption (PSA), include regeneration of the monolithic adsorbent through passage of an electrical current, which affords rapid cycling of a relatively small gas separation system with reduced energy consumption."

      "text": "Instant insight: Fuel cells get cooler\n\n27 June 2008\n\nBrett, Atkinson, Brandon and Skinner of the Imperial College Fuel Cell Network, London, UK, look at how advances in materials and engineering are presenting new opportunities for solid oxide fuel cells.\n\nFuel cells are electrochemical energy conversion devices that convert the chemical energy in fuel directly into electricity and heat without combustion. Simplistically, a fuel cell can be viewed as a cross between a battery, which converts chemical energy directly into electrical energy, and a heat engine, a continuously fuelled, air breathing device. There is a range of different fuel cell technologies, each with its own materials set and operation temperature, ranging from room temperature to over 1000 degrees Celsius. However, they all share the characteristics of high efficiency, no moving parts, quiet operation and low or zero emissions.\n\n\"Operating at intermediate temperature opens up a new range of applications and opportunities for solid oxide fuel cells\"\n\nThere is no consensus as to the optimal operating temperature of fuel cells; the preferred temperature of operation depends to a large extent on the application. However, there is significant effort to raise the operating temperature of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) and reduce the operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). PEFCs currently operate at around 80 degrees Celsius and are used in automotives, mobile phones and laptops. SOFCs operate at more than 800 degrees Celsius and use a ceramic oxide ion-conducting electrolyte to generate energy on a large scale.\n\nAdvances in the chemistry and processing of materials are allowing the operating temperature of SOFCs to be lowered into the so-called 'intermediate temperature' (IT) region of 500 to 750 degrees Celsius. The IT-SOFC opens up a new range of applications and opportunities for SOFCs in areas formally dominated by PEFCs, while maintaining the ability to operate on hydrocarbon fuels and produce high quality heat.\n\nOperation in the IT range expands the choice of materials and stack designs that can be used compared to conventional high temperature (HT) SOFCs. Lower temperature operation affords more rapid start-up, improved durability, reduced system cost and more robust construction through the use of compressive seals and metallic construction materials (as opposed to the all-ceramic HT-SOFCs).\n\nThere are two main routes by which SOFCs can be used at lower temperatures while still attaining comparable performance to the higher temperature technology. The first involves reducing the thickness of the electrolyte to the order of a few 10s of micrometres, so ions can travel more easily through the fuel cell. Alternatively, the same result can be achieved by improving the electrolyte's ionic conductivity at lower temperatures and the electrodes' electrochemical performance.\n\n\"Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells are a strong contender to be the first fuel cell technology to reach mass market\"\n\nThe range of new applications for the IT-SOFC includes soldiers' personal power supplies, traction power for vehicles, remote telecommunications, power for isolated communities and back-up power units for trucks. However, it is the small-scale combined heat and power market where the IT-SOFC is particularly well suited. Operating on natural gas and with a heat-to-power ratio close to one, IT-SOFCs with an electrical power rating of about one kilowatt are expected to be popular as combined heat and power sources for use in the home. Indeed, IT-SOFCs have the potential to be the simplest fuel cell system and are a strong contender to be the first fuel cell technology to reach mass market.\n\nAs with all fuel cells, the cost of IT-SOFCs must be reduced for them to compete in the market with current technologies. Using less, and cheaper, material is necessary; moving to lower temperature operation represents a significant step in this direction. Scientists still need to develop IT-SOFCs with commercially meaningful levels of durability. Fundamental studies are improving our understanding of processes such as electrode sintering, anode-fuel interaction, electrocatalyst poisoning and the mechanical properties of electrolytes and support structures."

      "text": "Videos\n\nThis is the latest in a series of profiles of our MIT Energy Fellows—graduate students who are supported by MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI) members to participate in faculty-led research and become part of a long-term community of students and alumni.\n\nTodd Ferguson, Enel-MIT Energy Fellow, is creating a computer model for lithium batteries that, he hopes, will point to new ways to modify battery technology, design, and materials. By simulating processes inside a lithium battery, the model can help guide the development of batteries that can generate more power, recharge faster, and degrade more slowly.\n\nThere's a lot going on inside a battery. Making sure it all works smoothly and efficiently could help the next generation of battery-powered cars zoom ahead to play a key role in a de-carbonized future transportation system.\n\n\"In electric cars, you really want high power output and quick recharge time. You want to get the power you need to accelerate,\" said Todd R. Ferguson. \"This all depends on good energy storage materials.\" Ferguson, one of 40 MIT Energy Fellows, is sponsored by MITEI sustaining member Enel Produzione SpA, Italy's largest power company, a producer, distributor, and seller of electricity and gas.\n\nElectric cars and consumer electronics are pegging their future on rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, in which a lithium ion moves between two electrodes, the battery's anode and cathode. Researchers are experimenting with a variety of materials for electrodes to see which ones help the batteries generate the most power, recharge the fastest, and degrade the least.\n\nAt the moment, there's no simple way to model batteries to better understand their processes and see if they're operating at optimal levels. Ferguson is working to change that.\n\nIn the laboratory of Martin Z. Bazant, associate professor of chemical engineering, Ferguson is creating a computer model for lithium batteries that, he hopes, will point to new ways to modify battery technology, design, and materials. The model could \"eliminate areas that shouldn't be focused on, and point toward potentially small modifications that will boost the battery's performance and efficiency,\" he said.\n\nThe goal is a battery that achieves the maximum potential for its given materials while minimizing losses. The problem is, there are always losses.\n\nA power boost\n\nIn Li-ion batteries, a lithium ion moves from the anode to the cathode during discharge and in reverse when recharging. The flow of lithium ions out of the battery's anode and into its cathode places stresses on their materials that can affect the lifetime and performance of the battery.\n\nAs the battery discharges, mechanical stresses such as cracks and deformations occur, hindering performance. In addition, the electrode materials, for example lithium iron phosphate or lithium cobalt oxide, degrade as the battery is charged and discharged.\n\nResearchers are seeking new materials that will hold up better under these stresses. Even a minute improvement could translate into a faster, more efficient recharge and longer battery life.\n\n\"If we can modify current battery technology and change small things—using smaller particles of different materials in the electrodes, changing the particles' geometries, or maybe chemical changes—we can get better results,\" Ferguson said. Depending on the choice of material for the anode, cathode, and electrolyte, the voltage, capacity, life, and safety of a lithium ion battery can change dramatically.\n\nFor instance, MIT researchers recently announced that they had modified lithium iron phosphate to allow electrons and ions to move into and out of it much more quickly. The material is not new—the researchers simply changed the way they make it—but this tweak could result in batteries that discharge in 10 seconds versus a minute and a half, paving the way for rapid bursts of power.\n\n\"It's hard to model the voltage versus the capacity with so many processes going on at once. Chemical diffusion of ions and other processes all come together to produce voltage at a certain current,\" Ferguson said. \"The model might show how enhancing diffusion in one area of the battery affects how the battery discharges.\"\n\nThe model plots on a graph the voltage of the battery against the capacity, using existing thermodynamic and experimental data. The ideal scenario—a battery generating its highest possible voltage over time—would have a capacity equal to that of the theoretical capacity. Internal limitations in the battery lead to drop-offs in voltage and prevent the battery from reaching its maximum capacity.\n\nWhile researchers often use experiments to determine a battery's performance, Ferguson said, the model will reveal the inner workings of the battery and help researchers determine which parts of the battery are limiting the battery's capacity.\n\nA future in energy\n\nAs a student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, NY, Ferguson thought at first he would major in biotechnology. He even did research on controlled drug delivery systems for multiple sclerosis. But while growing up in nearby Albany, Ferguson was the kind of kid who asked a lot of questions about how things worked—often while he was busy taking them apart and putting them back together. \"My parents always knew I would be an engineer,\" he said.\n\nOnce Ferguson acknowledged that engineering was his calling, he wasn't sure which discipline to pursue until he happened to hear MIT chemist Daniel Nocera speak at RPI. Nocera is working on making unlimited hydrogen from the sun by doing what plants do. \"I started seeing energy as the future of where technology is going,\" Ferguson said. Graduating with honors in 2008 with a bachelor of science in chemical engineering, he heard that MIT was investing money and time in energy research and education, and he decided to apply.\n\nSo far, Ferguson is pleased with the program. \"In my department, there are quite a few researchers working on these (energy-related) problems, so there's a good array of different problems to work on,\" he said. When Bazant moved from the math department to chemical engineering in November 2008, Ferguson thought his strong math and computation background would be \"a good fit\" for Bazant's modeling research.\n\nFerguson is motivated by his potential contribution not only to future cars and electronics but also to the future of the planet. \"Within 50 to 100 years, we're going to need to solve a lot of problems related to energy,\" he said. \"The entire world is depending on us solving them.\""

      "text": "As the initial implementation phase of its MicrocellTM foam grid technology, Firefly's 3D cell architecture involves replacing the conventional lead metal-based negative plate with a foam electrode. These products are configured in such a way as to be easily incorporated into existing lead acid manufacturing processes possessed by all existing lead acid manufacturers.\n\nBecause of this relatively seamless integration into established manufacturing techniques, it is Firefly's intention to manufacture the pasted foam negative electrodes and furnish them to existing lead acid manufacturing partners who will incorporate them into finished battery products. To all outward appearances, these batteries will be indistinguishable from currently available products. Furthermore, they will have similar charge / discharge performance and other fundamental properties. Due to the use of an electrolyte compatible with conventional lead acid cell designs, the open circuit voltages and recharge float voltages correspond to those of conventional lead acid batteries. This condition permits the use of conventional lead acid chargers with Firefly Energy's 3D batteries.\n\n3D Technology Performance Attributes\n\nSurface Area\n\nThe real quest for performance improvements in lead acid batteries is all about surface area. Although selective, incremental enhancements have led to some gains over the last several decades, the overwhelming restriction to lead acid battery efficiency has always been the lack of interface area between the active chemistry and the electrodes. With chemistry capable of delivering approximately 170 Watt Hours per Kilogram (Wh/kg), why are today's batteries only averaging around 30-50 Wh/kg? The answer to this question lies in the century-old paradigm that lead electrodes are necessary in lead acid batteries. Unfortunately, lead corrodes, so increasing surface area increases corrosion and decreases life.\n\nFirefly's technology does increase surface area, tremendously. This has the obvious benefit of increasing the interface area between the active chemistry and the electrode, yielding better and faster utilization of the chemistry. Beyond that, fast charge and discharge rates are now achievable, and a higher percentage of active material is accessible, so efficiency goes up. In fact, utilization efficiencies can potentially rise over 90%.\n\nUtilization and Spatial Efficiency\n\nTraditional lead flat-plate and spiral-wound electrodes can be thought of as \"two-dimensional\" in terms of reactivity and \"one-dimensional\" in terms of electrolyte diffusion. In a conventional battery, roughly only one-half of the active materials are available for reaction to produce energy, due to the plate structure where diffusion must take place through previously-discharged material in order to sustain the energy-producing electrochemical reactions.\n\nThe Firefly Energy architecture goes well beyond the traditional lead acid construction. Firefly's three-dimensional MicrocellTM composite plate will result in a significant increase in active material utilization levels. The key lies in the basic construction of the Firefly composite plate. Lead plates have a linear structure that requires electrolytic diffusion over relatively large distances. Firefly's diffusion paths are much shorter, which means that under very high current loads, the effect of electrolyte diffusion would not be significant unless a full discharge was carried out in ~5 seconds or less. In addition, if the proper balance of active materials and electrolyte is achieved in the Firefly design, utilization levels well in excess of the practical limit of ~67% should be achieved due to the dispersed nature of lead sulfate (PbSO4) buildup.\n\nThus, lead sulfate buildup is not as likely to \"shut down\" the discharge reaction by choking off electrolyte diffusion. Moreover, since electrolyte diffusion paths in the Firefly electrodes are on the order of microns rather than millimeters (– a potential improvement of 2-3 orders of magnitude) – this change in electrode design should result in large increases in active-material utilizations and high-rate discharge capacities, as well as sharp reductions in recharge times.\n\nLow and High Temperature Advantages\n\nCold Temperature\n\nThough economical in many applications, lead-acid batteries have a relatively low specific-energy and, similar to competitive current batteries, are severely affected by cold temperatures. This effect, or increase in internal resistance, is due to the \"slowing down\" of the battery's chemical-reaction and ion-diffusion rates. As a \"rule of thumb\", reaction rates are cut in half for each 10ºC drop in temperature. \"Cold cranking\" is a discharge which needs a high current, and reaction-rates are critical to sizing a battery. A high current implies a lot of active material conversion in a short time, and this is related to the amount of electrode surface area covered with active-material that is available for conversion. Therefore, a starter battery needs a lot of surface area (meaning a large number of lead plates).\n\nSizing a lead-acid battery for starting applications at -18ºF, for example, requires an approximate 200% size increase over room temperature operation. Because of an acknowledged corrosion rate for the positive lead grids in lead-acid batteries, attempts to increase cold temperature starting power by increasing electrode surface area without \"sizing up\" the overall battery, results in short warm temperature life.\n\nFirefly's 3D (and 3D2) products have outstanding discharge performance at low ambient temperatures relative to commercial flooded lead-acid and VRLA batteries. This is due to the extremely high electrochemically-available surface area of the MicrocellTM foam coated with sponge lead. The Firefly 3D negative, with hundreds or thousands of tiny cells, each with its own complement of sponge lead and electrolyte, is ideal for discharge (and charge) conditions where electrolyte diffusion is limited by surface area, distance or temperature. Diffusion rates at low temperatures are reduced in a 3D cell just as they are in conventional commercial products, but the distances traveled to react with the sponge lead are much smaller. This enhanced electrolyte supply also results in higher, flatter voltage-time curves on discharge, which means higher energy outputs when combined with the lower current densities that accrue from the high foam electrochemical surface area.\n\nAs the temperature is lowered, it takes more power to start the engine (due mainly to increased oil viscosity) at the same time that the available power from the battery drops to only 40% of what can be provided at ambient when the car is started at –18oC. By comparison, a Firefly 3D battery will provide almost 70% of its ambient-temperature power at –18oC. This means that Firefly's 3D engine-start battery could be smaller to have the same cold-crank amps, or it would be more powerful and last longer if its size were comparable to a commercial product.\n\nThe Firefly composite plate technology is distinctly different from traditional batteries, and the net result is Firefly's battery does not need to be \"sized up\" for cold weather performance.\n\nHot Temperature\n\nThe optimum operating temperature for a Lead-acid battery is 25°C (77°F). As a rule of thumb, every 8-10°C (14-185°F) rise in temperature will cut the battery life in half. This is a simple calculation based on field observations and on the increased chemical activity at higher temperatures. Lead grids corrode in the acidic electrolyte in the presence of lead dioxide, the positive plate's active material.\n\nFirefly batteries have superior performance in terms of thermal management. The heat-transfer characteristics of the MicrocellTM foam are even better than metals such as aluminum and copper, and approach that of diamond.\n\nEven though the Firefly 3D design utilizes a standard lead grid positive plate, the Firefly negative foam plate operates much cooler, and generates a \"calming\" influence to reduce the temperature of the lead grid positive.\n\nThe thermal response patterns for these materials used mean that the heat transfer performance of Firefly's carbon-graphite foam-based battery technology is outstanding. Thus, batteries made with MicrocellTM foam electrodes will transfer heat out of the battery rapidly as it is generated by the electrochemical reactions taking place, thus making thermal runaway less likely, and enabling overall \"cool\" battery operation compared to conventional lead-acid batteries. The fact that heat is generated more uniformly and dissipated rapidly translates to longer life in many applications.\nDramatic Cycle Life Improvements\n\nA full discharge of today's lead acid battery causes extra strain, and each cycle robs the battery of a small amount of capacity. In lead-acid batteries, deeper discharges convert larger amounts of charged active-material into lead sulfate. Lead sulfate has a significantly larger volume (about 37% more) than the charged material, and this volume change stresses the electrode structures. This expansion induces mechanical forces that deform the grid, and ultimately result in the lead grid \"disappearing\" into the paste.\n\nThe resulting expansion and deformation of the plates also causes active material to separate from the electrodes with a commensurate loss of performance. Additionally, over time, sulfate crystals can grow together, resulting in large lead sulfate crystals that are difficult or impossible to convert back into the charged state. This wear-down characteristic also applies to other battery chemistries in varying degrees. To prevent the battery from being stressed through repetitive deep discharge, a larger lead acid battery and shallower discharges are typically recommended. Depending on the depth of discharge and operating temperature, the sealed lead-acid battery provides 200 to 300 discharge/charge cycles. Short cycle life also results from grid corrosion of the positive electrode, which undergoes extensive oxidative stress during extended recharge conditions. These changes are exacerbated at higher operating temperatures.\n\nIn contrast, Firefly's composite plate technology provides a design which fully accommodates the volume changes of the active material during charge and recharge. Within each Firefly plate is contained a full compliment of active materials, electrolyte, and volume which will allow complete discharge without causing physical stress on the plate itself. This results in an electrode plate which does not undergo volume change during deep discharges. Firefly's electrode material is not reactive in the lead-acid chemistry and so does not corrode. This is in part due to a natural stability of the base material, but is also due to the formation process used which maximizes exposure of the most chemically resistive surfaces and minimizes exposure of chemically less-stable surfaces.\n\nThe growth of large sulfate crystals is also restricted, resulting in a low incidence of crystals which are too large to recharge. The strong resistance of Firefly's electrode material to corrosion also severely reduces the deleterious effects of long recharges. Because of the removal of grid corrosion as a life-limiting factor, the Firefly approach offers significant improvements over conventional lead-acid technologies in both float and deep-cycle applications.\n\nCycling in irregular applications such as partial-state-of-charge (PSoC) regimes used in hybrid vehicles and photovoltaic energy storage are also well suited to 3D technology. This is because the conditions of partial or heavy sulfation of the negative plate – a process that can render present-generation lead acid products unrecoverable – are easily reversed in 3D products, even after long periods of storage. Sulfation reversal is achieved because the nature of the lead sulfate deposits in 3D cells is fundamentally different from those in traditional lead acid cells. In the latter, lead sulfate is deposited on the surfaces of the plates in dense layers of relatively large crystals, somewhat remote from the lead grid members. Because the sponge lead active material in a 3D cell is deposited on the walls of the many small pores in thin layers, and the high surface areas in the foams result in relatively low current densities, the lead sulfate deposits are comprised of small, porous crystal structures (on the order of 3-10 microns, much smaller than in commercial products) that are easily dissolved on the subsequent recharge. Moreover, these very small crystal sizes grow only slowly over time. A final factor that facilitates recharge is the proximity of the composite foam (as well as residual sponge lead) that can act as efficient current-carrying paths during recharge for the small, local deposits of lead sulfate crystals. This resistance to the effects of sulfation make Firefly 3D batteries ideal for seasonal applications where devices and their associated batteries (electric lawn mowers, boats, RVs, motorcycles, etc.) may go unused for months on end, often in a partially or fully discharged state. Conventional batteries are difficult or impossible to recover from these conditions, and are often replaced far short of their potential life span. With 3D products this problem is greatly reduced.\n\nThe low self-discharge rate and easy recovery from sulfation also mean that 3D batteries are not subject to the distribution chain and inventory time constraints of conventional lead acid products. 3D batteries can be subjected to much longer periods of inactivity without damaging effects. Conventional lead acid batteries are limited to storage times of 3 – 6 months at most before requiring a recharge – often with great logistical difficulty and expense.\n\nFloat and cycle lifetimes for 3D batteries have yet to be fully determined, but it is anticipated that they will be superior to those of comparable lead acid products due largely to the superior thermal conductivity levels of the composite foam relative to conventional lead electrodes, in combination with lower cell impedances and negative plate current densities.\n\nVibration Resistance\n\nA final life characteristic of the 3D cells is that, because of their use of light weight carbon-graphite foam, their low mass makes them highly resistant to vibration. 3D cells subjected to vibration testing at Caterpillar's Technology Center have exceeded Caterpillar's stringent specifications by a wide margin, at which point they still had not failed. Clearly, foam robustness under the abusive conditions found in commercial, off-road, military, and many other applications will not be an issue for Firefly products."

      "text": "Self-charging power cell converts and stores energy in a single unit\n\nWednesday, August 22, 2012\nAt the heart of the self-charging power cell is a piezoelectric membrane that drives lithium ions from one side of the cell to the other when the membrane is deformed by mechanical stress. The lithium ions driven through the polarized membrane by the piezoelectric potential are directly stored as chemical energy using an electrochemical process.\n\nBy reported Aug. 9, 2012 in the journalNano Letters. The\nThe power cell consists of a cathode made from lithium-cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) and an anode consisting of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanotubes grown atop a titanium film. The two electrodes are separated by a membrane made from poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) film, which generates a piezoelectric charge when placed under strain. When the power cell is mechanically compressed, the PVDF film generates a piezoelectric potential that serves as a charge pump to drive the lithium ions from the cathode side to the anode side. The energy is then stored in the anode as lithium-titanium oxide.\n\nCharging occurs in cycles with the compression of the power cell creating a piezopotential that drives the migration of lithium ions until a point at which the chemical equilibriums of the two electrodes are re-established and the distribution of lithium ions can balance the piezoelectric fields in the PVDF film. When the force applied to the power cell is released, the piezoelectric field in the PVDF disappears, and the lithium ions are kept at the anode through a chemical process.\n\nThe charging cycle is completed through an electrochemical process that oxidizes a small amount of lithium-cobalt oxide at the cathode to Li1-xCoO2 and reduces a small amount of titanium dioxide to LixTiO2 at the anode. Compressing the power cell again repeats the cycle.\n\nWhen an electrical load is connected between the anode and cathode, electrons flow to the load, and the lithium ions within the cell flow back from the anode side to the cathode side.\n\nUsing a mechanical compressive force with a frequency of 2.3 Hertz, the researchers increased the voltage in the power cell from 327 to 395 millivolts in just four minutes. The device was then discharged back to its original voltage with a current of one milliamp for about two minutes. The researchers estimated the stored electric capacity of the power cell to be approximately 0.036 milliamp-hours.\n\nSo far, Wang and his research team – which included Xinyu Xue, Sihong Wang, Wenxi Guo and Yan Zhang – have built and tested more than 500 of the power cells. Wang estimates that the generator-storage cell will be as much as five times more efficient at converting mechanical energy to chemical energy for as a two-cell generator-storage system.\n\nMuch of the mechanical energy applied to the cells is now consumed in deforming the stainless steel case the researchers are using to house their power cell. Wang believes the power storage could be boosted by using an improved case.\n\n\"When we improve the packaging materials, we anticipate improving the overall efficiency,\" he said. \"The amount of energy actually going into the cell is relatively small at this stage because so much of it is consumed by the shell.\"\n\nBeyond the efficiencies that come from directly converting mechanical energy to chemical energy, the power cell could also reduce weight and space required by separate generators and batteries. The mechanical energy could come from walking, the tires of a vehicle hitting the pavement, or by harnessing ocean waves or mechanical vibrations.\n\n\"One day we could have a power package ready to use that takes advantage of this hybrid approach,\" Wang said. \"Almost anything that involves mechanical action could provide the strain needed for charging. People walking could be generating electricity as they move redesign transportation networks (see \"African Bus Routes Redrawn Using Cell-Phone Data\") and provide a boon to epidemiology (see \"Big Data from Cheap Phones\")."

After 11 years of development work, they want the last of the lenses and mirrors for the laser to be put in place and the tedious task of adjusting and aiming the laser to be over, a process they fear could take up to a year before they can successfully achieve fusion.\n\nJeff Wisoff, a former astronaut who is deputy principal associate director of science at the NIF, said: \"Everyone is keen to get started, but we have to get the targeting right, otherwise it won't work.\n\n\"We will be firing laser pulses that last just a few billionths of a second but we will be creating conditions that are found in the interior of stars or exploding nuclear weapons.\n\n\"I worked on the building of the International Space Station, but this is a far bigger challenge and the implications are huge. When we started the project, a lot of the technology we needed did not exist, so we have had to develop it ourselves.\n\n\"The next step is looking at how ignition can be used to deliver something of value to the world. It has the potential to be one of the biggest achievements mankind has made.\"\n\nAlthough other experiments have attempted to create the conditions needed for nuclear fusion, lasers are seen as the most likely technique to be able to provide a viable electricity supply.\n\nIf all goes well, the NIF will be able to fire its laser and ignite a fusion reaction every five hours, but to create a reliable fusion power plant the laser would need to ignite fusion around 10 times a second.\n\nThe scientists are already working with British counterparts on the next step towards a fusion power station. A project known as the High Powered Laser Research facility aims to create a laser-powered fusion reactor that can fire once every couple of minutes.\n\nProf Mike Dunne, director of the central laser facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory near Oxford, said: \"The National Ignition Facility is going to finally prove fusion can be achieved with a laser. It will start an exciting new period in physics as it will prove what we are trying to achieve is actually be possible.\"\n\nThe fly above is 65 days old (roughly equivalent to 65 years old for a human).

Retailers could track genes related to craving as shoppers moved about a store. \"The Bachelor\" would enjoy yet one more secret advantage over his love-struck dates.\n\nA new study in BMC Biotechnology correlates real-time gene expression with movement and behavior for the first time. The proof-of-concept experiment in fruit flies opens a new door for the study of genes' influence on behavior.\n\nThe authors, from the University of Southern California and Cambridge University, tagged genes with a harmless molecule known as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).\n\nWhen a gene was active, the flies gave off a fluorescent glow. A camera fitted with a special filter detected the glow, whose intensity was then measured automatically.\n\nAt the same time, a multiple-camera system designed by first author and USC graduate student Dhruv Grover tracked the movement of each fly in three dimensions.\n\nThe result: an exact picture of gene activity at every point and time of a fly's life.\n\n\"We can correlate behavior with certain genes and find genes that may be responsible for certain behaviors,\" Grover said.\n\nThe 3-D tracking and real-time measurement of gene activity are both firsts in live animal studies, the researchers said.\n\nThe methods also delivered new insights on aging in the fruit fly, long a model organism for the study of biological processes.\n\nThe levels of two genes, hsp70 and hsp22, spiked in the hours before the death of a fly.\n\nThe genes are known to respond to oxidative stress. Lead author John Tower, associate professor of molecular and computational biology at USC, speculated that the genes were reacting to a sharp increase in oxidative stress as the fly began dying of natural causes.\n\n\"We're really interested in why the fly is dying, and this is potentially a good inroad to being able to study that,\" he said.\n\nOxidation – the chemical process behind rust and food spoilage – takes place constantly in the body as a byproduct of metabolism.\n\n\"Burning that fuel to produce energy is toxic,\" Tower said.\n\nThe real-time methods developed by Tower's group painted the poignant picture, even if only for flies, of an animal's last attempt to fight off death.\n\nOther animals soon will be studied the same way, Grover predicted.\n\n\"The beauty of it is now, if GFP can be linked to any gene … you could track it over time, and you could look at the expression of that gene. It's much easier than looking at it through the microscope, having a grad student sit there and take pictures every few hours and look at the (gene) expression change. This is just running on its own,\" he said.\n\nIt was Grover's thesis adviser Simon Tavare, a professor of molecular and computational biology at USC and faculty member at Cambridge, who suggested how to track flies in three dimensions.\n\n\"After that we started to think about, 'Can we look at the expression of certain genes over time, as they're moving?' \" Grover recalled.\n\n\"That would be really interesting.\"\n\nEven more interesting, for everyday life, would be a mosquito zapper guided by the tracking system – an application that Grover and Tower say just might be feasible.\n\nAs a Stanford undergraduate in computer science, Grover took no biology courses. After earning a master's at USC in computer science, he switched to the doctoral program in molecular and computational biology. The project to correlate movement and gene expression became his nearly complete Ph.D. thesis.\n\nJunsheng Yang, another USC graduate student, contributed to the study. Computer vision expert Isaac Cohen, who has since left USC for Honeywell, assisted Grover in the early stages of the project.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services and the Southern California Environmental Health Sciences Center supported the research.\n\nCharles Darwin: His observations undermined the traditionally held view of 'stability of species'\n\nThere is a strange object sitting on my desk as I write. It is a shiny sphere of fossilised, primeval slime. Known technically as stromatolites, this blue-green slime was the original ooze from which all life on this planet evolved.\n\nThis painfully slow process began about 3,000 million years ago and has led, ultimately, to us, the extraordinary human species.\n\nWhenever my gaze happens to fall upon my lump of fossilised slime I experience a strange sensation, a deep respect, for I am looking at my most ancient ancestor.\n\nYours, too, unless you still believe in the tale of Adam and Eve and a talking serpent in the Garden of Eden.\n\nIn a few weeks, on February 12 to be exact, the scientific world will be celebrating the bicentenary of the birth of Charles Darwin, the man whose theory of the gradual evolution of living things has changed the way in which most of us see the world in which we live.\n\nThanks to him, we see ourselves as part of nature, instead of separate from it and superior to it. If it weren't for him, we would not be concerned about the way we have, in our arrogant past, ravaged the small planet on which we live.\n\nWhat kind of a man was Charles Darwin? To the naive mind he is sometimes pictured as a giant intellect of Victorian England, with his long, flowing white beard and his solemn expression, the product of a brilliantly studious education and intense academic application.\n\nWell, no. In reality he was a mess, both physically and mentally, which makes his gigantic contribution to human understanding even more extraordinary.\n\nHe was the son of a sickly mother who died when he was eight.\n\nHer lack of impact on him is clear when, as an adult, he wrote a letter of condolence to a grieving friend that opened with the remarkable statement: 'Never in my life having lost one near relation, I dare say I cannot imagine how severe grief such as yours must be.'\n\nDarwin (inset) and an artist's impression of the Beagle, the ship which took him to all parts of the world\n\nHis father, a doctor, was a giant of a man, weighing more than 24 stone and capable of cutting sarcasm and tyrannically enforced views. He had been disappointed by his son's failure to do well at school, an education that Charles later described as 'simply a blank'.\n\nThe young Darwin had instead taken great pleasure in collecting shells and watching birds in his spare time, but his father decided his son must attend Edinburgh University to study medicine and follow in his own footsteps.\n\nCharles found the lectures there either 'awful' or 'dull', but was too scared of his father to tell him that he did not wish to become a physician.\n\nAfter two years his exasperated father gave up this attempt, stating that Charles was 'doing no good' at his studies.\n\nUnassuming beginnings\n\nInstead the old man decided his son should become a clergyman and must go to Cambridge to read for Holy Orders. This was an even bigger failure. Charles later wrote: 'My time there was wasted - as completely as at Edinburgh and at school.'\n\nHe fell in with a dissipated sporting set and spent a great deal of time in the countryside on shooting trips. Luckily, one of Charles's teachers at Cambridge had spotted the young man's interest in field studies and recommended him for the unpaid role as naturalist on board the Beagle, a ship that was about to set off to explore the world.\n\nHis father refused, forcing Charles to turn down the offer, but a supportive uncle intervened and in December 1831 the Beagle sailed with Darwin on board.\n\nDesmond Morris's interest in evolution was inspired by his hero, Darwin. This photo is from the 1950s\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history. Away from has father's domineering presence and from failed attempts to embrace medicine or theology, Charles was at last in his element.\n\nHe described the first day on the Beagle as 'a birthday for the rest of my life'. He spent the next five years sailing around the world on that small (only 90ft long) ship, collecting specimens wherever he was able to land.\n\nHe was astonished at the huge variety of exotic creatures that he encountered, and little by little began to formulate his ideas about their relationships and the way they had managed to adapt to so many environments.\n\nAt any interesting landfall he would rise before daylight and often travelled long distances on horseback. On one occasion he had ridden 80 miles in a burning sun, but commented that he was 'but little fatigued'.\n\nMore...\n\nHis health was robust and he often out-stripped his companions when on collecting expeditions. He was a man on fire with an all-consuming curiosity about the natural world. He wrote home saying: 'I literally could hardly sleep at night through thinking of my day's work.'\n\nIn 1835, four years after leaving home, he had travelled all around South America to the Pacific, where he was able to spend four crucial weeks on the Galapagos Islands.\n\nIt was there that he first sensed that the traditional idea of the 'stability of species' - that all animals have always been the way they are now, created by God in some distant past - was being undermined by his observations.\n\nA land iguana in the Galapagos Islands\n\nHe saw how a variety of birds, apparently with a common ancestor, had adapted to the slightly different conditions on each of the Galapagos Islands.\n\nThis was the moment when the concept of evolution by natural selection first began to form in the mind of the young Charles Darwin - who was still only in his mid-20s. It would take nearly a quarter of a century before it would see the light of day in his book The Origin Of Species.\n\nAfter five years away, in 1836 the Beagle returned home to England. Despite his fear that a wife would mean a 'terrible waste of time' because of the need for socialising, Charles was soon married and, significantly, within a few months of his wedding was already complaining about being too tired to go out to parties.\n\nAn honest, objective observer\n\nThe third phase of his life was about to begin, and how different it would be - a long period of almost constant illness accompanied by slow, painstaking work on his many scientific investigations.\n\nFor much of the rest of his life he was a walking textbook of stress symptoms. He suffered from sweating hands, heart palpitations, a swimming head, swoonings, flatulence, gastric pains, vomiting, boils, chronic anxiety, fits of depression, panic attacks and hyperventilation.\n\nOn bad days he would lie on his sofa for hours, groaning and grumbling. After 30 years of robust, vigorous good health, this change was bizarre and has led to much debate as to its cause.\n\nThe author of this essay, Desmond Morris, says Darwin's contribution to human understanding should be celebrated\n\nSeveral explanations have been offered. The first sees him as the victim of a parasitic disease picked up in the tropics, but the symptoms do not quite fit with this idea.\n\nThe second sees him simply as a poor physical specimen who inherited his weaknesses. His mother had been a chronic invalid, his brother, Erasmus, was constantly ill, and he had a grandfather who suffered nervous breakdowns and an uncle who was a depressive.\n\nWith relatives like that, he may simply have been following in his family's footsteps.\n\nThe third explanation saw him as being intensely neurotic about his theory of evolution and the devastating impact it would have upon the deeply religious Victorian society in which he lived.\n\nOn his travels, he had, almost by accident, been thrust up against an inescapable truth: that life forms had not been rigidly created by God, but had been slowly evolved from ancestral types, forever changing as they competed with one another and adapted to environmental changes.\n\nAs an honest, objective observer, he could not allow himself to gloss over this biological truth, even if it meant causing untold outrage among devout Christians of his day.\n\nThe mental pressure under which this put him is thought to have caused all the classic stress symptoms from which he suffered for the last 40 or so years of his life. In other words, he was sick, but his ailments were all the result of his inner emotional conflicts, rather than by some tropical parasites.\n\nFinally, there is the view that he was a malingerer and hypochondriac, using his ailments to give him an excuse to stay shut away in his country house, while the furious debate about his theory of evolution raged elsewhere.\n\nYes, he was sick, but not as sick as he made out. This enabled him not only to avoid the public controversy, but to escape the heavy social duties of Victorian life, too, and therefore to have more time to devote to his studies.\n\nDarwin's great-grandson, Randal Keynes, and National History Museum bird curator Jo Cooper examine mockingbirds Darwin brought back to England from the Galapagos Islands\n\nThe truth is, he was bitten by some nasty bugs in South America and was probably left with a residue of physical weakness. Add to that his family background and his understandable horror at the profoundly anti-religious message of his discoveries, and you have the perfect setting for the magnification of his ailments.\n\nAnd if he found that, to his delight, his condition left him greater time for the solitary scientific studies that meant more to him than anything else, you have a perfect recipe for constant ill-health - a weakened condition that nevertheless allowed him to work for three or four hours most days.\n\nA rare individual\n\nThe point is, Charles Darwin was one of those rare individuals who devoted themselves entirely to the pursuit of knowledge, to the detriment of everything else in their lives. He was, and remains, one of our greatest ever thinkers - a man whose discovery changed the way we see the world.\n\nAs a lifelong naturalist myself, he is not only a personal hero but the root from which all my own professional studies stemmed. Which is why I feel it so important to celebrate the anniversary of his birth - if only because I fear many of his core discoveries are in danger of becoming muddled through the prism of modern spiritualism.\n\nFor there are plenty of people today - not all of them religious fundamentalists - who seem to think Darwinian evolution cannot explain why, for the most part, humans are a uniquely civilised species.\n\nAfter all, they posit, how can Darwinism explain empathy, charity or self-sacrifice? How can it explain the 'good deeds' of humans, whether religious or not?\n\nWith its emphasis on 'the survival of the fittest', isn't Darwinism simply an excuse for rampant capitalism and personal greed?\n\nTo answer this attack, we need to take a closer look at the biology of our species. In our ancient past, when we were evolving as a tribal species, the competition between individuals had to be tempered by a greatly increased urge to cooperate with our companions if our tribe was to flourish.\n\nDarwin's observations led him to formulate his Theory of Evolution - that all creatures, including man, have evolved in their environments over time\n\nBy a division of labour and by assisting one another, we also helped ourselves to succeed. And one of our great survival weapons was our ability to communicate with one another in much greater detail than other species.\n\nWhen we developed language, we also became greatly interested in symbolism. The word 'tree' did not look like a tree or sound like a tree, but it nevertheless conjured up an image of a tree in our minds.\n\nMaking one thing stand for another in this way was a habit that spread through all aspects of our lives. If we feel protective towards a kitten, it is because the little animal acts as a symbol of a human child and stimulates our parental urges.\n\nIf a nun sees each human being as one of 'God's children', then she will want to help them all, as though they were real children. Our good deeds are extensions of our powerful parental feelings, or our inborn urge to co-operate with the members of our tribe.\n\nWe are not helpful to one another because of some sophisticated moralising, but because we have evolved that way. It is as much a part of our animal nature as is our urge to compete with one another.\n\nThat is the way we are, and there is no need to introduce the pious teachings of the Church to make us good - it is already in our genes.\n\nCreationists will have none of this, and insist that all of nature is the work of what they now call an 'intelligent designer'.\n\nIf such a being existed, this monstrous designer would have to accept the responsibility for having created all the wonderful life forms we see around us, and then of cruelly inventing countless unspeakable agonies for them in the shape of leprosy, cholera, cancer, syphilis, plague, malaria, AIDS, fevers, parasitic worms and the rest.\n\nWhat a charmer this designer must be; creationists are welcome to their hideous creation.\n\nNo, Darwinian competition is a much more reassuring scenario. In this, we will, as a species, devote more and more energy to defeating these viruses, bacteria and other parasites. Eventually, we will eradicate them.\n\nWe will refuse to accept that it is God's design that we should be made to suffer from these afflictions forever more. We will do our best to improve our lot on this small planet, and to see ourselves as part of a larger, natural environment.\n\nThen, one day, when a major crisis occurs - a massive epidemic that nearly wipes us all out, or a huge asteroid that strikes Earth - we will be ready to evolve a little further and to survive this disaster because natural selection will be able to find just enough of us who can cope with whatever new environment comes our way.\n\nSooner or later, inevitably, there will be a gigantic planetary upheaval of some kind and Homo post-sapiens will eventually emerge from the chaos.\n\nLet's just hope that it turns out to be Homo super-sapiens, and not Homo sub-sapiens.\n\nGender differences may help explain why males are more attracted to, and more likely to become 'hooked' on video games than femalesPhoto: CLAIRE LIM\n\nPlaying on computer consoles activates parts of the male brain which are linked to rewarding feelings and addiction, scans have shown. The more opponents they vanquish and points they score, the more stimulated this region becomes.\n\nIn contrast, these parts of women's brains are much less likely to be triggered by sessions on the Sony PlayStation, Nintendo Wii or Xbox.\n\nProfessor Allan Reiss of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences Research at Stanford University, California, who led the research, said that women understood computer games just as well as men but did not have the same neurological drive to win.\n\n\"These gender differences may help explain why males are more attracted to, and more likely to become 'hooked' on video games than females,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's fair to say that males tend to be more intrinsically territorial. It doesn't take a genius to figure out who historically are the conquerors and tyrants of our species – they're the males.\n\n\"Most of the computer games that are really popular with males are territory and aggression-type games.\"\n\nIn the study, published recently in the Journal of Psychiatric Research, scientists wired up a series of men and women to an MRI scanner while they played a video game, which involved competing to win on-screen territory by clicking on a series of balls.\n\nAfter analysing the MRI data, the researchers found participants showed activation in the brain's mesocorticolimbic centre, the region typically associated with reward and addiction.\n\nMale brains, however, showed much greater activation, and the amount increased as they gained more territory. This was not the case with women.\n\nThree structures within the reward circuit – the nucleus accumbens, amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex – were also shown to influence each other much more in men than in women.\n\nRat pluripotent stem cells - the essential ingredient for making genetically engineered versions of the animals - have finally been created after decades of effort in the field.\n\nScientists have long been able to alter the DNA in mouse embryonic stem cells, routinely creating mice with missing, added or altered genes. But the same techniques have not worked in rats, whose larger size can make them better models for certain disorders in humans. Although some techniques do exist for genetically manipulating rats, they are far more limited than those used in mice.\n\nTwenty-seven years ago, researchers thought that genetically engineered rats would follow quickly after the development of the technique in mice. \"We and others worked very, very hard [on rats] and got nowhere,\" recalls Martin Evans of Cardiff University, who won the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Mario Capecchi and Oliver Smithies for work that made 'knockout' (loss of function) and 'knockin' (gene replacement or addition) mice possible.\n\nResearchers led by Austin Smith of the University of Cambridge, UK, and Qi-Long Ying of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, now report in Cell that they have derived rat embryonic stem (ES) cells that can transfer their genome into the sex cells of a growing rat1,2. Smith's team has also shown that the rat ES cells can be genetically manipulated. Neither has produced a genetically engineered rat yet. But Stem Cell Sciences, a company Smith co-founded, is already in discussions with pharmaceutical companies and animal providers to create and distribute knockout rats, says the company's chief executive Alastair Riddell. Ying says that the first genetically engineered rat from ES cells could be born within as little as six months.\n\nRat switch\n\nBoth Evans and Capecchi agree that moving from rat embryonic stem cells to genetically engineered rats should be swift and straightforward. However, they think mice have now become so well studied and well established that knockout rats may be less appealing. \"Does this mean that everyone will switch to rats? I doubt it,\" says Capecchi, explaining that the cost of keeping laboratory rats is about ten times as great as for mice.\n\nBut some researchers are eager to apply the development in their own work. \"Having access to genetically engineered rats would allow us to design more sophisticated experiments,\" says Viviane Tabar, a scientist and neurosurgeon at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. \"I definitely would use such rats in some of my experiments.\" Mouse spinal cords and other organs are so small that they make cell-transplant studies very difficult, she says. Moreover, rats are capable of more complex behaviour, making them better suited for studying some brain diseases.\n\nStem Cell Sciences has patent claims covering both the conditions used to derive the cells, as well as rat pluripotent stem cells themselves, says George Schlich, the company's intellectual-property lawyer. However, it is uncertain whether the company could control scientists' use of the technique.\n\nAnd a complementary technique for making rat stem cells has recently been developed. Earlier this month, researchers led by Sheng Ding of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, Hongkui Deng of Peking University and Lei Xiao of the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, created induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from cultured rat cells3,4. Along with genetic-engineering techniques like those used to create mouse and human iPS cells, culture conditions used by Deng and Ding were similar to those reported by Ying and Smith. Though these iPS cells have not yet been used to produce sex cells, the availability of both rat ES and iPS cells should enable a greater variety of experiments to be devised to compare the potential of the two cell types.\n\nCulture club\n\nSmith and Ying made their breakthrough by adapting the way ES cells are cultured. Mouse ES cells are generally grown in cultures containing proteins and cell extracts that prevent the cells from differentiating too quickly, conditions that proved unsuitable for rat ES cells. But while working as a postdoc in Smith's lab, Ying identified combinations of small molecules that allow mouse ES cells to grow stably, without the proteins and cell extracts. Both Smith and Ying applied these culture conditions to making rat ES cells after Ying established his own lab.\n\nYing thinks that these small molecules could allow ES cells to be derived in species beyond mice and rats. He is currently working with collaborators at the Second Military Medical University in Shanghai, China, to generate ES cells from large animals such as cows and pigs. Besides helping to create genetically engineered livestock, ES cells for large animals could help scientists study potential stem-cell therapies in species closer in size to the human patients who might receive them.\n\nYing says the next key step is to optimize the enzymes and reagents used to manipulate mouse ES cells so that they work better in rat cells. The researchers are also trying to identify the best rat strains to use for generating ES cells and host embryos, as well as to identify better culture conditions.\n\nAn Australian teacher who stuffed his luggage with 2,000-year old animal mummies and religious figurines wrapped as gifts has been arrested, an Egyptian airport security official said.\n\nThe man was heading to Thailand when a security official became suspicious of the wrapped figurines that were placed amid souvenir ceramic pots in his suitcase.\n\nWhen security officials opened the case, they found two mummies of a cat and an ibis, a long-beaked bird, both dating back to 300 B.C.\n\nA mummy like this one was discovered in the teacher's luggage\n\nThe confiscated collection also included 19 figurines of the revered ancient Egyptian gods of Horus and Thoth, wrapped as gifts.\n\nHorus is a falcon-headed god, who represented the greatest cosmic powers for ancient Egyptians. Thoth is believed to have given the Egyptians the gift of hieroglyphic writing.\n\nThe man was arrested and has been charged with smuggling antiquities, which can carry a penalty of as much as 15 years.\n\nThe Egyptian antiquity chief Zahi Hawass said later in a statement that the seized artifacts altogether weighed about 12lbs.\n\nAn antiquity official at the airport described the bust as rare because of the number of items involved and the age of the items.\n\nAnimal mummification was a common practice throughout Egyptian history.\n\nThousands of mummified animals and many animal deity figurines were found from Egypt's Late Period, between 330 B.C. and 30 B.C.\n\nCertain animals, such as ibises, falcons, and cats, were thought to be holy, the living representatives of Egyptian gods.\n\nAnother unlucky traveler in Cairo's airport was stopped Wednesday with 56 cartridges, 20 pieces of live ammunition and an old bayonet that dates back to World War II.\n\nThe Canadian passenger, who was heading to Switzerland, was freed. He told the authorities he picked up the ammunition in the Egyptian north coast town El Alamein, the site of one of the most decisive battles in World War II.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO – The Apple computer was invented in a garage. Same with the Google search engine. Now, tinkerers are working at home with the basic building blocks of life itself.\n\nSo far, no major gene-splicing discoveries have come out anybody's kitchen or garage.\n\nBut critics of the movement worry that these amateurs could one day unleash an environmental or medical disaster. Defenders say the future Bill Gates of biotech could be developing a cure for cancer in the garage.\n\nMany of these amateurs may have studied biology in college but have no advanced degrees and are not earning a living in the biotechnology field. Some proudly call themselves \"biohackers\" — innovators who push technological boundaries and put the spread of knowledge before profits.\n\nIn Cambridge, Mass., a group called DIYbio is setting up a community lab where the public could use chemicals and lab equipment, including a used freezer, scored for free off Craigslist, that drops to 80 degrees below zero, the temperature needed to keep many kinds of bacteria alive.\n\nCo-founder Mackenzie Cowell, a 24-year-old who majored in biology in college, said amateurs will probably pursue serious work such as new vaccines and super-efficient biofuels, but they might also try, for example, to use squid genes to create tattoos that glow.\n\nCowell said such unfettered creativity could produce important discoveries.\n\n\"We should try to make science more sexy and more fun and more like a game,\" he said.\n\nPatterson, the computer programmer, wants to insert the gene for fluorescence into yogurt bacteria, applying techniques developed in the 1970s.\n\nShe learned about genetic engineering by reading scientific papers and getting tips from online forums. She ordered jellyfish DNA for a green fluorescent protein from a biological supply company for less than $100. And she built her own lab equipment, including a gel electrophoresis chamber, or DNA analyzer, which she constructed for less than $25, versus more than $200 for a low-end off-the-shelf model.\n\nJim Thomas of ETC Group, a biotechnology watchdog organization, warned that synthetic organisms in the hands of amateurs could escape and cause outbreaks of incurable diseases or unpredictable environmental damage.\n\n\"Once you move to people working in their garage or other informal location, there's no safety process in place,\" he said.\n\nSome also fear that terrorists might attempt do-it-yourself genetic engineering. But Patterson said: \"A terrorist doesn't need to go to the DIYbio community. They can just enroll in their local community college.\"\n\nContrary to popular belief, recent studies have found that there are probably ways to regenerate brain matter.\n\nAnimal studies conducted at the National Institute on Aging Gerontology Research Center and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, for example, have shown that both calorie restriction and intermittent fasting along with vitamin and mineral intake, increase resistance to disease, extend lifespan, and stimulate production of neurons from stem cells.\n\nIn addition, fasting has been shown to enhance synaptic elasticity, possibly increasing the ability for successful re-wiring following brain injury. These benefits appear to result from a cellular stress response, similar in concept to the greater muscular regeneration that results from the stress of regular exercise.\n\nAdditional research suggests that increasing time intervals between meals might be a better choice than chronic calorie restriction, because the resultant decline in sex hormones may adversely affect both sexual and brain performance. Sex steroid hormones testosterone and estrogen are positively impacted by an abundant food supply. In other words, you might get smarter that way, but it might adversely affect your fun in the bedroom, among other drawbacks.\n\nBut if your not keen on starving yourself, there are other options. Another recent finding, stemming from the Burnham Institute for Medical Research and Iwate University in Japan, reports that the herb rosemary contains an ingredient that fights off free radical damage in the brain. The active ingredient, known as carnosic acid (CA), can protect the brain from stroke and neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's and from the effects of normal aging.\n\nAlthough researchers are patenting more potent forms of isolated compounds in this herb, unlike most new drugs, simply using the rosemary in its natural state may be the most safe and clinically tolerated because it is known to get into the brain and has been consumed by people for over a thousand years. The herb was used in European folk medicine to help the nervous system.\n\nAnother brain booster that Bruce N. Ames, Ph.D., a professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of California, Berkeley, swears by his daily 800 mg of alpha-lipoic acid and 2,000 mg of acetyl-L-carnitine, chemicals which boost the energy output of mitochondria that power our cells. Mitochondrial decay is a major factor in aging and diseases such as Alzheimer's and diabetes. Elderly rats on these supplements had more energy and ran mazes better.\n\nOmega-3s fatty acids DHA and EPA found in walnuts and fatty fish (such as salmon, sardines, and lake trout) are thought to help ward off Alzheimer's disease. (In addition, they likely help prevent depression and have been shown to help prevent sudden death from heart attack).\n\nTurmeric, typically found in curry, contains curcumin, a chemical with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In India, it is even used as a salve to help heal wounds. East Asians also eat it, which might explain their lower rates (compared to the United States) of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, in addition to various cancers. If curry isn't part of your favorite cuisines, you might try a daily curcumin supplement of 500 to 1,000 mg.\n\nPhysical exercise may also have beneficial effects on neuron regeneration by stimulating regeneration of brain and muscle cells via activation of stress proteins and the production of growth factors. But again, additional research suggests that not all exercise is equal. Interestingly, some researchers found that exercise considered drudgery was not beneficial in neuronal regeneration, but physical activity that was engaged in purely for fun, even if equal time was spent and equal calories were burned, resulted in neuronal regeneration.\n\nExercise can also help reduce stress, but any stress-reducing activity, such as meditation and lifestyle changes, can help the brain. There is some evidence that chronic stress shrinks the parts of the brain involved in learning, memory, and mood. (It also delays wound healing, promotes atherosclerosis, and increases blood pressure.)\n\nIt should go without saying that short-term cognitive and physical performance is not boosted by fasting, due to metabolic changes including decrease in body temperature, decreased heart rate and blood pressure and decreased glucose and insulin levels, so you're better off not planning a marathon or a demanding work session during a fasting period.\n\nAs part of a healthy lifestyle the prescription of moderating food intake, exercising, and eating anti-oxidant rich foods is what we've long known will boost longevity, but it's good to know that we can bring our brains along with us as we make it into those golden years without being the 1 in 7 who suffers from dementia. Keep your fingers crossed and eat some rosemary chicken.\n\nAccording to the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), US wind producers enjoyed another record year of growth in 2008—the third in a row. The country now has an installed wind power capacity well in excess of 21,000 megawatts (MW), enough to supply electricity to over 5.5 million American homes.\n\nAccording to Randall Swisher, AWEA Executive DIrector, \"Wind energy installations are well ahead of the curve for contributing 20% of the U.S. electric power supply by 2030 as envisioned by the U.S. Department of Energy.\"\n\nAmazingly, this rapid progress was achieved under a governing administration that to many seemed, at best, indifferent to the plight of the renewable energy industry. If the US wind power industry is capable of becoming a world-leader during such times, it seems quite likely that the picture could improve even further with a more sympathetic leader at the helm.\n\nTOKYO (AFP) – Militant environmentalists said they had pelted stink bombs at a Japanese whaling ship in Australian waters in their latest bid to disrupt hunting of the protected creatures.\n\nThe Sea Shepherd Conservation Society said it \"pursued and delivered 10 bottles of rotten butter and 15 bottles of a methyl cellulose and indelible dye mixture\" to the Kaiko Maru vessel Friday evening.\n\nA Japanese government-backed whaling body claimed that the activists' ship rammed into the left side of the Japanese vessel, damaging a bulwark.\n\n\"We cannot tolerate disruptive activities that threaten the safety of the crew members,\" Minoru Morimoto, head of the Institute of Cetacean Research, which carries out Japan's whale hunting operations, said in a statement.\n\nSea Sepherd said in an online statement however it was the Japanese ship that \"steered hard\" and struck the group's ship \"Steve Irwin\", although neither vessel suffered serious damage.\n\nPaul Watson, the captain of the activists' ship, said in the statement that his crew was trying to push the Japanese whalers out of Australian waters. Sea Shepherd is an international group with headquarters in the United States and Australia.\n\nJapan kills hundreds of whales a year in the name of research despite an international moratorium on commercial whaling.\n\nTokyo makes no secret of the fact that the meat ends up on dinner tables and accuses Westerners of insensitivity to its whaling culture.\n\nFor the past four years Watson has led a Sea Shepherd vessel trying to impede the whaling ships during their hunting season.\n\nWatson claimed earlier this year that his ship's hounding of the Japanese whalers last season had saved the lives of 500 of the giant mammals.\n\nBut the activists' repeated attacks have led Japan to label them as \"terrorists.\"\n\nAfter an earlier attempt to pelt a Japanese harpoon boat with stink bombs, Watson told AFP on Monday that the activists would continue trying to hamper the whalers.\n\n\"We will just harass them, blockade them, do everything to prevent them from resuming whaling,\" he said at the time.\n\n\"Most likely they will run and we will chase and they'll run and we'll chase and that's fine. As long as they are running they are not killing whales.\"\n\nKyle Buck of Sugarloaf, Pa., fills a stove with anthracite coal as his wife, Kelly, plays with their daughter Lila.\n\nBy TOM ZELLER Jr. and STEFAN MILKOWSKI\n\nSUGARLOAF, Pa. — Kyle Buck heaved open the door of a makeshift bin abutting his suburban ranch house. Staring at a two-ton pile of coal that was delivered by truck a few weeks ago, Mr. Buck worried aloud that it would not be enough to last the winter.\n\n\"I think I'm going through it faster than I thought I would,\" he said..\n\n\n\n\"Back in the 1980s, we sold hundreds a year,\" said Rich Kauffman, the sales manager at E.F.M. Automatic Heat in Emmaus, Pa., one of the oldest makers of coal-fired furnaces and boilers in the United States, in a nod to the uptick in coal sales that followed the oil crises of the 1970s.\n\n\"But that dwindled to nothing in the early 1990s — down to as many as 10 a year,\" he said. \"It picked up about a year ago, when we moved about 60 units, and then this year we've already sold 200.\"\n\nDean Lehman, the plant manager for Hitzer Inc., a family-owned business in Berne, Ind., that makes smaller, indoor coal stoves, said his stoves were on back order until March. And Jeffery Gliem, the director of operations at the Reading Stove Company and its parent, Reading Anthracite, in Pottsville, Pa., which supplies coal and stoves to 15 states in the Northeast and Midwest, said the uptick in interest was the largest he had seen in 30 years.\n\nThe coal trend is consistent with steep increases in other forms of supplementary heating that people can use to save money — most of them less messy than coal. Home Depot reports that it has sold more than 80,000 tons of pellet fuel, a sort of compressed sawdust, for the season to date. That is an increase of 137 percent compared with the same period last year, said Jean Niemi, a company spokeswoman.\n\nCoal may never make economic sense in areas far from where it is mined. But in places within reasonable delivery range, the price tends to be stable, compared with heating oil or natural gas. Prices for natural gas more than tripled in recent years before plunging in the last few months amid the downturn.\n\nCoals vary in quality, but on average, a ton of coal contains about as much potential heat as 146 gallons of heating oil or 20,000 cubic feet of natural gas, according to the Energy Information Administration. A ton of anthracite, a particularly high grade of coal, can cost as little as $120 near mines in Pennsylvania. The equivalent amount of heating oil would cost roughly $380, based on the most recent prices in the state — and over $470 using prices from December 2007. An equivalent amount of natural gas would cost about $480 at current prices.\n\nMr. Buck said he could buy coal for $165 a ton. On a blustery afternoon recently, he was still studying the manual for his $2,300 Alaska Channing stoker, which gave off an intense heat in the den. An automated hopper in the back slowly dispensed fine anthracite coal chips into the stove's belly, and every couple of days, Mr. Buck emptied the ash. He said he hoped the stove would cut his oil consumption in half.\n\n\"Now, somewhere, you've got to take into account the convenience of turning up your thermostat, versus having two tons of coal to shovel and the hopper and ashes to deal with,\" Mr. Buck said. But if the $330 worth of coal in his makeshift bin \"heats the house for the winter,\" he added, \"you can't beat it.\"\n\nWesley Ridlington, a homeowner in Fairbanks, Alaska, bought an outdoor coal furnace for $13,000 in March and uses it as his main source for heat and hot water.\n\nOn a recent evening, as the temperature hovered around 23 below zero, Mr. Ridlington worked to free up the rotating burning plate inside the furnace, which he figured was jammed by a pebble. He did not seem to mind the glitch, or, for that matter, loading the furnace twice a week and emptying the ash pan every night. \"It takes a little bit of time,\" he said, \"but for the savings, it's worth it.\"\n\nMr. Ridlington said he was typically burning 1,500 gallons of oil each winter to heat his 3,300-square-foot home. At last year's prices, that would have cost about $7,000, he said. This winter, he expects to burn nine tons of coal at a cost of about $1,400.\n\n\"The initial cost was expensive,\" he said. \"But in three to five years, it'll be paid for, even with prices going down. And if fuel goes back up again, it'll be even more savings.\"\n\nRob Richards, who owns a business in Fairbanks that sells spas, pool tables, and now outdoor coal furnaces, said that when oil prices were higher, he could promise fuel cost savings of more than 75 percent and a payback of 18 months for an outdoor coal furnace. With oil prices down again, orders for furnaces have dropped off, and the savings are closer to 50 percent with a few years' time to recoup the cost, he said.\n\n\"Still, you're looking at a quick payback,\" Mr. Richards added.\n\nCoal was a dominant source of heat for American homes for much of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Americans were still burning more than 50 million tons for heating in 1950, according to the federal statistics.\n\nBut coal, primarily used today in power plants and steelmaking, has not been used for heating on a large scale for decades. Cleaner and more easily distributed forms of heating fuel — including natural gas, electricity and oil — displaced coal, and residential use dropped precipitously, to 2.8 million tons by 1975, and then to less than 500,000 tons by 2000.\n\nEven with the recovery of the last couple of years, residential use of coal in the United States, at less than 300,000 tons today and representing a fraction of 1 percent of all coal use, is \"not even a blip on the screen,\" said Carol Raulston, a spokeswoman for the National Mining Association.\n\nStill, even amid the steep decline, small upticks similar to the current one have appeared from time to time, and residential use of coal never entirely went away.\n\nIn Homer, Alaska, fall storms wash crude coal onto the beach from underwater deposits. In the mountains of eastern Kentucky or the hills of central Pennsylvania, residents can simply dig it out of the ground.\n\n\"As long as people have been mining coal up there,\" said John Hiett of Kentucky's Office of Mine Safety and Licensing, \"people have burned coal in their houses.\"\n\nGovernment data suggest that about 131,000 households use coal as their primary source of heat, with perhaps 80,000 more using it as a secondary source. Those numbers are small enough that issues relating to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions have remained largely off the radar.\n\nBurning coal does throw fine particles into the air that can pose problems for some people, similar to the problems involved in burning wood — though wood stoves and fireplace inserts are increasingly subject to regulation to cut down on pollutants.\n\n\"Coal stoves don't have that,\" said James E. Houck, the president of Omni Environmental Services, a firm in Portland, Ore., that tests air quality. \"And there's no regulatory pressure for them to have it.\"\n\nIn some localities where residential coal burning is becoming a factor, that might be changing. In Fairbanks, air quality experts suspect the increase in coal burning — along with increased wood burning — is contributing to concentrations of fine particles well above federal limits.\n\n\"We see it as a real health hazard to Fairbanks,\" said Jim Conner, the Fairbanks North Star Borough's air quality specialist.\n\nConcerns like these have not deterred companies marketing coal. Back East, the Blaschak Coal Corporation, a midsize supplier of anthracite in Mahanoy City, Pa., still emblazons company trucks and baseball caps with images of Santa Claus lugging a sack of coal.\n\n\"Everybody's looking at wherever they can to save money,\" said Daniel Blaschak, a co-owner of the company. \" 'Cause guess what? We no longer have disposable income. We are up to our necks in debt. And there's very few things we can't live without, but heat is one of them.\""

      "text": "MIT creates plant-inspired solar cell\n\nResearchers in the US are hoping to improve the efficiency of solar power cells using plant-inspired technology that repairs itself when damaged by the sun.\n\nSunlight can degrade the materials used in many new non-silicon solar generation systems, reducing their efficiency to as little as 10 per cent of their initial performance, according to scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nTo combat this problem, the team has created a complex structure of molecules that turns sunlight into electricity and that can break down and then reassemble itself with replacement molecules when another chemical is added.\n\n'In the solar energy field, there is this focus on the immediate efficiency of new devices,' team leader Prof Michael Strano told The Engineer. 'But few people are asking questions about what happens after several hours or even weeks.\n\n'It's a tedious problem but the truth is that in photoelectrochemical cells you see a precipitous drop-off in efficiency in just a few hours.'\n\nStrano's solar cell contains a synthetic complex of seven components in solution with electrochemical mediators ferrocyanide and ubiquinone, which help to carry electrons to and from the cell's electrodes.\n\nThe complex itself consists of molecules that release electrons when struck by particles of light, held on discs of other molecules called phospholipids. These spontaneously attach themselves to carbon nanotubes, which hold the discs in uniform alignment and conduct the charge away from them.\n\nUnder Strano's system, a surfactant similar to oil-dispersing chemicals is periodically added to the cell, causing the complex to break down. The solution is then passed through a membrane, removing the surfactant and allowing the complex to reassemble, with new molecules replacing any that were damaged by the sun.\n\nThe idea was inspired by the natural repair system used by plants when they photosynthesise. When sunlight damages the proteins in chloroplasts – the part of plant cells where photosynthesis happens – the molecules naturally reassemble to restart the process.\n\n'The human approach is to filter out damaging parts of the sun,' said Strano. 'What nature does is harnesses the full solar spectrum, but has figured out a scheme to continuously rebuild the parts that degrade.'\n\nAlthough Strano's cell had to go through periods of repair and so electricity production was intermittent, the process helped increase energy efficiency by 300 per cent.\n\nThe next step will be to increase the concentration of the complex in solution while maintaining the repair mechanism.\n\n'For that, we're looking at plants as well,' said Strano. 'Plants have interesting structures that they form to display these proteins to harvest light. So we think we're going to be able to continue to learn from nature and make man-made equivalents.'\n\nHe hopes to have a desktop prototype device ready in two to three years, after which it could begin to be developed commercially.\n\nThe research, published in Nature Chemistry, was supported by grants from the MIT Energy Initiative and the Department of Energy, as well as funding from Italian oil company Eni.\n\nA low-cost solar cell that imitates photosynthesis opens up new applications for photovoltaics.

      "text": "Improved efficiency is another reason MCFCs offer significant cost reductions over phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFCs). Molten carbonate fuel cells can reach efficiencies approaching 60%, considerably higher than the 37–42% efficiencies of a phosphoric acid fuel cell plant. When the waste heat is captured and used, overall fuel efficiencies can be as high as 85%.\n\nUnlike alkaline, phosphoric acid, and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, MCFCs don't require an external reformer to convert more energy-dense fuels to hydrogen. Due to the high temperatures at which MCFCs operate, these fuels are converted to hydrogen within the fuel cell itself by a process called internal reforming, which also reduces cost.\n\nMolten carbonate fuel cells are not prone to poisoning by carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide — they can even use carbon oxides as fuel — making them more attractive for fueling with gases made from coal. Because they are more resistant to impurities than other fuel cell types, scientists believe that they could even be capable of internal reforming of coal, assuming they can be made resistant to impurities such as sulfur and particulates that result from converting coal, a dirtier fossil fuel source than many others, into hydrogen. Alternatively, because MCFCs require CO2 be delivered to the cathode along with the oxidizer, they can be used to electrochemically separate carbon dioxide from the flue gas of other fossil fuel power plants for sequestration.\n\nThe primary disadvantage of current MCFC technology is durability. The high temperatures at which these cells operate and the corrosive electrolyte used accelerate component breakdown and corrosion, decreasing cell life. Scientists are currently exploring corrosion-resistant materials for components as well as fuel cell designs that increase cell life without decreasing performance.\n\nContents\n\nThe German company MTU Friedrichshafen presented an MCFC at the Hannover Fair in 2006. The unit weighs 2 tonnes and can produce 240 kW of electric power from various gaseous fuels, including biogas. If fueled by fuels that contain carbon such as natural gas, the exhaust will contain CO2 but will be reduced by up to 50% compared to diesel engines running on marine bunker fuel.[1] The exhaust temperature is 400 °C, hot enough to be used for many industrial processes. Another possibility is to make more electric power via a steam turbine. Depending on feed gas type, the electric efficiency is between 12% and 19%. A steam turbine can increase the efficiency by up to 24%. The unit can be used for cogeneration."

      "text": "Splitting hydrogen and oxygen from water using conventional electrolysis techniques requires considerable amounts of electrical energy. But green plants produce oxygen from water efficiently using a catalytic technique powered by sunlight – a process that is part of photosynthesis and so effective that it is the Earth's major source of oxygen.\n\nIf mimicked by artificial systems, this photocatalytic process could provide abundant new supplies of oxygen and, possibly hydrogen, as a by-product of producing electricity. However, despite its importance to the survival of the planet, scientists don't fully understand the complex process plants use to harness the sun's energy.\n\nA paper to be published April 2 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences moves scientists closer to that understanding by showing the importance of a hydrogen bonding water network in that portion of the photosynthetic machinery known as photosystem II. Using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) on photosystem II extracted from ordinary spinach, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology tested the idea that a network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules plays a catalytic role in the process that produces oxygen.\n\n\"By substituting ammonia, an analog of the water molecule that has a similar structure, we were able to show that the network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules is important to the catalytic process,\" said Bridgette Barry, a professor in Georgia Tech's School of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Biosciences. \"Substituting ammonia for water inhibited the activity of the photosystem and disrupted the network. The network could be reestablished by addition of a simple sugar, trehalose.\"\n\nThe research was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and published in the Early Online edition of the journal.\n\nIn the chloroplasts of green plants, algae and cyanobacteria, oxygen is produced by the accumulation of photo-induced oxidizing equivalents in a structure known as the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). The OEC contains manganese and calcium ions. Illumination causes oxidation of manganese ions in the OEC. Short laser flashes can be used to step through the reaction cycle, which involves four sequential light-induced oxidation reactions. Oxygen is produced on the fourth step, and then is released from the OEC.\n\nThis so-called S state cycle resets with the binding of the substrate, water. Scientists have proposed that a hydrogen bond network, which includes multiple water molecules bound to manganese ions, calcium ions, and protein amide carbonyl (C=O) groups, forms an electrostatic network surrounding the OEC. In this scenario, the extensive hydrogen-bond network would then serve as a component of the catalyst, which splits off oxygen.\n\nTo study the process, Barry and graduate student Brandon Polander used precision FT-IR spectroscopy to describe how the network reacts to a short laser flash. The second harmonic of a pulsed Nd-Yag laser was used as the light source. This illumination causes the OEC to undergo one step in its catalytic cycle, the so-called S1 to S2 transition. An infrared spectrum was recorded before and after a laser flash to the photosystem sample, which was isolated from supermarket spinach.\n\nThe exquisite sensitivity of FT-IR spectroscopy allowed them to measure changes in the bond strength of the protein C=O groups. The energies of these C=O groups were used as markers of hydrogen bond strength. The brief laser flash oxidized a manganese ion and caused a change in the strength of the C=O bond, which reported an increase in hydrogen bonding to water molecules. When ammonia was added as an inhibitor, a decrease in C=O hydrogen bonding was observed instead. Addition of trehalose, which is known to change the ordering of water molecules at the surface of proteins, blocked this effect of ammonia.\n\nThe study describes the coordinated changes that must occur in the protein to facilitate the reaction and shows that the strength of the hydrogen-bonded network is important.\n\n\"This research helps to clarify how ammonia inhibits the photosystem, which is something that researchers have been wondering about for many years,\" Barry explained. \"Our work suggests that ammonia can inhibit the reaction by disrupting this network of hydrogen bonds.\"\n\nThe research also suggests that in design of artificial devices that carry out this reaction, sustaining a similar hydrogen-bonding network may be important. The stabilizing effect of trehalose discovered by Polander and Barry may also be important.\n\nBeyond the importance of understanding the photosynthetic process, the work could lead to new techniques for producing hydrogen and oxygen using sunlight. One possibility would be to add a biomimetic photocatalytic process to a photovoltaic system producing electricity from the sun.\n\n\"In terms of providing new sources of energy, we still have lessons to learn from plants about how they carry out these critical processes,\" Barry said. \"It would be a great advance for the planet to have new, sustainable, and inexpensive processes to carry out this reaction.\"\n\nUltimately, she hopes the full water oxidizing cycle can be explored and potentially harnessed or imitated for oxygen and energy production.\n\n\"We are only looking at a single part of the overall reaction now, but we would like to study the entire cycle, in which oxygen is produced, to see how the interactions in the water network change and how the interactions with the protein change,\" Barry said. \"The work is another step in understanding how plants carry out this amazing series of photosynthetic reactions.\" 8 years yearswhat are you mentally challenged????? did i say this? coudl you POSSIBLY construe what i wrote to mean this? i've been reading photosynthesis research for a long time. i am very much IN FAVOR OF IT. and in fact, it's probably extremely worthwhile to study. the point is. we are not going to be able to look at it as a model for making a synthetic reaction using our own catalysts.\n\nwe MUST understand photosynthesis, but the 'sell' that we are going to get to a certaint point with it, is just not an honest sell. alas , you always have to make promises in your grant proposal that are unrealistic to get funding. basic science and understanding of basic phenomena is the best science.\n\nWe are not going to have much suuccess mimicing let alone improving a billion years of R&D infused into the photosynthetic process.\n\nYou'd be surprised. Evolution doesn't optimize for optimization's sake. Evolution only happens as long as there is any evolutionary pressure. So plants don't need to be stellar at photosynthesis - they just need to be better than the plant next to them.\n\nAdd to that that plants also have a host of other roles to fill besides doing photosynthesis (growth, reproduction, pest resistance, .. ) and you can see that some strategies which can hinder the ability to photosynthsize optimally can still be beneficial for the plant.\n\nOur needs are much simpler than that of the plant: Get as much energy out of a molecule capable of photosynthsis as possible. Within such a limited scope trumping evolution is indeed possible.\n\nIn the mean time we could plant lots of seeds and care of our environment. If we manage to help our planet to become brimming with life again we have a good chance of sustaining an oxygen rich atmosphere.\n\nIncorporating loads more plant life into urban areas is just logical.\n\nI think that scientific understanding and respect for Earth's nature go hand in hand.\n\nOn what scientific basis do we assume that photosynthesis evolved? What is the empirical evidence (observable, testable, repeatable, falsifiable) that supports such a conclusion?\n\nGranted, I understand there are various theories of how oxygenic photosynthesis arose. But the level of confidence among many that it DID evolve, based on what we know, is essentially faith disguised by scientific words.\n\nMany, but not all, believers in evolution are atheists who are determined to explain the beauty and complexity of life using only natural processes. I posit to you that is not science, it is the philosophy of scientism.\n\nIf it is true that the natural world is all there is, then our lives have no overarching meaning, no purpose. We live, we die, end of story.\n\nIronic then, that these same people reserve their fiercest vitriol for creationists who see the ingenious design of a loving Creator on display. All worked up over something that really doesn't matter. Their emotions say otherwise.\n\nSubstituting ammonia for water inhibited photosynthesis. I guess we can rule out photosynthesis by floating organisms in the ammonia laden clouds of Jupiter then. :)\n\nStudying how nature solved the problem through billions of years of blind watchmaker trial and error could give us ideas on how to optimize the process. Evolution does not work to a purpose as we understand it so there's always the possibility of an upgrade, the iPhone 4 of photosynthesis, so to speak"

Then how is it that plants show little wear and tear though they too capture the Sun's energy during photosynthesis? The secret lies in the ability of light-capturing molecules in plants to break down and reassemble all the time.\n\nScientists at the Massachusets Institute of Technology (MIT) have managed to copy this constant self-repair process in plants. They have created synthetic molecules that assemble themselves into sunlight harvesting-structures to produce electricity. The assembly of molecules or complex could replace conventionally used materials in solar cells.\n\nChemical engineer at MIT, Michael Strano, and his team have described the complex and how it functions in Nature Chemistry on September 5. The complex comprises recombinant proteins, phospholipids, and carbon nanotubes (minuscule wire-like hollow tubes made of carbon atoms). The phospholipids cluster on the surface of a nano tube and provide a platform for a light converting protein isolated from purple bacteria (Rhodobacter sphaeroides).\n\nThe proteins that attach themselves to the phospholipids act as reaction centres and release electrons when struck by light particles. The electrons are channelised through the carbon nanotube to produce electricity.\n\nThe complex is kept in a solution that breaks down when surfactant is added. When it is removed, the molecules quickly reassemble to create a new reaction centre. This increased the photoconversion efficiency by 300 per cent. It might be sometime before the technology could be used, as M Irfan Qureshi, assistant professor of biotechnology at Jamia Millia Islamia, pointed out. Such solar cells would require special design; large transparent tanks to keep the solution.\n\nBut the authors say that once these problems are taken care of the technology would be a boon for developing countries because these systems decrease maintenance cost"

      "text": "Britain has joined forces with America to investigate a hi-tech new way of producing 'clean energy' - not from wind or waves, but from firing huge arrays of high-powered lasers at pellets of hydrogen.\n\nThe process causes the hydrogen atoms to fuse together into helium - the same reaction found in hydrogen bombs and stars such as our Sun - but in a controlled reaction that could power homes and businesses.\n\nRecent experiments at America's National Ignition Facility (NIF), have produced huge bursts of energy from the technology - using a stadium-sized building housing an array of 192 lasers which fire a 500-terawatt flash at a drop of hydrogen atoms just 1mm across.\n\nHere's what it looks like, or is supposed to look like:\n\nEven more cool:\n\nLaser fusion was expected to take longer to achieve than magnetic containment fusion, but recent results from NIF have hinted that the break-even point in laser fusion might happen earlier than was thought possible. A similar project in the UK, called HIPER, the High Power Laser Energy Research began work in 2005.\n\n'NIF director Ed Moses said, 'Our goal is to have ignition within the next couple of years.'\n\nIgnition would be a self-sustaining reaction that would release vast amounts of energy far surpassing the 'break even' point.\n\nLast week, a single shot of NIF's laser released, for a tiny fraction of a second, more power than was being consumed in the entire world.\n\nTo hit the point of 'ignition', that energy release needs to rise by a factor of around 1,000. The technology challenges are considerable.\n\nAnd even better:\n\nJohn Parris, of Europe's HiPER project, said 'This is save-the-world science. Fusion is the only serious answer to future energy demands - this is the energy Holy Grail. The human race has a massive, ravenous demand for power. Fusion will be an ideal solution in the clean energy mix for the future.'\n\nNIF, however, is working already. The facility uses pellets of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium - found in 'heavy water' - and tritium, and fires lasers to compress the pellets to a few hundredths of its starting size.\n\nAnd of course, you guessed it:\n\nEnvironmental groups such as Greenpeace claim that research into fusion diverts funding from research into proven technologies such as wind and wave power.\n\nThis is why the Cold Fusion experiments of Fleishmann & Pons were taken so seriously back in 1989. Too, bad their results could not be replicated.\n\nSeparate question: Why is a pipeline required to send crude from Canada to Louisiana? Why not just build the required refinery in Canada? It can't be any more work to build a refinery than to build a 2000+ mile pipeline and all it requires.\n\nEnvironmental groups such as Greenpeace claim that research into fusion diverts funding from research into technologies, such as wind and wave power, that have proven to be failures.\n\nI've wondered for the last decade what was happening with laser fusion research. It was starting to show great promise as far back as the 80's, then suddenly sometime in the 90's it seemed to completely disappear. It's very encouraging to hear that the research may actually be approaching fruition.\n\nWe could make the enviroweenies briefly happier if we used wind/solar to power the lasers. That could work to get this past the break-even point, after which they would be furious that abundant energy became available and crushed their dreams. By then it would be too late!\n\nI have often thought that our most pressing foreign policy issue is energy independence. Imagine if the middle east had the same foreign policy significance as Bangladesh or Rwanda. It would be very clarifying.\n\nEnergy independence means we have no interest in any resources anywhere in the sand; neither as a customer, nor an imperialist, nor a colonizer. See also Mr. Gilley's post re: Ron Paul, and the long thread earlier today delving into the concept of \"occupation\". Our only necessary connection to the region would be the treaty obligations with Israel.\n\nIt has long pained me to know that our money goes to Saudi Royals, who contribute to erstwhile Islamic charities, who build madrassas in pakistan, who then develop the next generation of jihadis.\n\nGwen Novak: Except as far as I know we get most of our oil from Canada and Mexico. · Sep 12 at 2:04pm\n\nGwen,\n\nYou are probably correct; however even if we only currently import 10 % (or whatever the %) from the middle east, my point still holds. Our NATO allies also rely heavily on those oil resources, so we still are tied up with the region. Just imagine if Hussein's invasion of Kuwait had the same importance as the civil war in the Congo. The Congolese people are suffering, but our boots are not on the ground there.\n\nIf cold fusion works, share it with the world, and maybe the Iranian nuclear party runs of cash.\n\nBack in December, 1971, when I was a Rhodes Scholarship candidate, I met at the interviews a physics major from the University of Texas who was working on this. We both got the award, and he did a D.Phil. on fusion at Oxford. But nothing came of it for forty years. If this time the hopes are justified, it is very big news, and it will strengthen us immeasurably vis-a-vis the Arabs and the Iranians. It might even free Europe from its dependence on the Russians and the Arabs. This is no small thing.\n\nLaser (inertial confinement) fusion is promising, but after decades of work magnetic confinement fusion is also approaching the stage where one can envision it coming on line as as practical energy source in the latter half of this century. With proper funding, we'd probably have had plasma fusion by 1990. The leading project in the world is ITER, which is presently under construction in France."

Salty water to be desalinated is placed in the central chamber.\n\nSeawater contains about 35 grams of salt per liter and brackish water contains 5 grams per liter. Salt not only dissolves in water, it dissociates into positive and negative ions. When the bacteria in the cell consume the wastewater it releases charged ions -- protons -- into the water. These protons cannot pass the anion membrane, so negative ions move from the salty water into the wastewater chamber. At the other electrode protons are consumed, so positively charged ions move from the salty water to the other electrode chamber, desalinating the water in the middle chamber.\n\nThe desalination cell releases ions into the outer chambers that help to improve the efficiency of electricity generation compared to microbial fuel cells.\n\n\"When we try to use microbial fuel cells to generate electricity, the conductivity of the wastewater is very low,\" said Logan. \"If we could add salt it would work better. Rather than just add in salt, however in places where brackish or salt water is already abundant, we could use the process to additionally desalinate salty water, clean the wastewater and dump it and the resulting salt back into the ocean.\"\n\nBecause the salt in the water helps the cell generate electricity, as the central chamber becomes less salty, the conductivity decreases and the desalination and electrical production decreases,"

The projects seek to advance electric vehicle technologies, help improve the efficiency and reliability of the electrical grid, and provide important energy security benefits to America's armed forces.\n\nThe new projects are supported through two new ARPA-E programs: Advanced Management and Protection of Energy Storage Devices (AMPED) and Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR). AMPED projects aim to develop advanced sensing and control technologies that could dramatically improve and provide new innovations in safety, performance, and lifetime for grid-scale and vehicle batteries.

To date it has been dogged by three criticisms: the market is overstated (projects have been announced but are not online); energy storage is too expensive; and advanced storage technologies are dependent on government support. Nevertheless, according to a new tracker report from Pike Research, the number of projects deployed on a global basis continues to rise as technologies move at a variety of speeds toward commercialization. The total number of energy storage projects deployed and announced (including inactive projects) rose 8%, from 600 to 649 during the first half of 2012, the tracker report finds. The number of deployed projects increased over those 6 months from 482 to 514.\n\n\"Considerable momentum is building behind newer energy storage technologies, such as advanced batteries, particularly as the renewable energy community embraces storage as a means of mitigating risks associated with variable power generation resources,\" says research analyst Brittany Gibson. \"High costs remain a significant hurdle for newer technologies, but market interest is growing rapidly as government-funded programs encourage the deployment of a wide variety of technologies.\"\n\nThe region with the largest base of energy storage is Asia Pacific, which has just over 60 gigawatts of cumulative installed capacity. Reflecting the large domestic base of R&D and manufacturing for battery technologies, the technical diversity of energy storage projects in Asia Pacific is quite wide. While advanced batteries are staged to play a large role in the development of power systems across Asia Pacific, bulk energy storage technologies such as pumped hydro will play an increasingly important role in emerging markets like China.\n\nAn Executive Summary of the report is available for free download on the firm's website.\n\nTuesday, July 3, 2012\n\nLithium-ion and molten-salt battery costs will approach $500/kWh by 2022, reducing the high capital cost of emerging grid storage technologies. However, expectations of half that level will remain unrealistic for at least a decade, according to Lux Research.\n\nTechnology developers make bold claims about performance enhancements and economies of scale that will lead to dramatic cost reductions. Lux Research's baseline scenarios for grid-tied systems indicate that by 2022 Li-ion batteries will reach $506/kWh; sodium nickel chloride, or ZEBRA, batteries will approach $473/kWh; and vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) will hit $783/kWh.\n\n\"Molten-salt batteries hold the most potential to be the cheapest large-scale systems, with manufacturing improvements playing the largest role, accounting for 95% of the cost reduction,\" said Brian Warshay, Lux Research Associate and the lead author of the report titled, \"Grid Storage Battery Cost Breakdown: Exploring Paths to Accelerate Adoption.\"\"Li-ion batteries are dependent on cost reductions from mass production,\" he added, \"while molten-salt batteries and VRFBs rely on long discharge durations to reduce costs.\"\n\nTo gain an understanding of the key cost components for each technology, Lux Research analysts built production cost models of Li-ion, ZEBRA, and VRFB systems for small- to large-scale grid storage systems, and assessed drivers that will facilitate cost reduction and constraints to innovative material and manufacturing approaches. Among their findings:\n\n·Cost of Li-Ion batteries will dip 45% by 2022. Li-ion batteries may lose market share to cheaper molten-salt batteries for large projects but will remain the system of choice for space-constrained projects because of their high energy density.\n\n·ZEBRAs need productivity gains. ZEBRA battery manufacturing accounts for between 50% and 60% of the total system costs, primarily because of the cost of processing its key raw materials. Improved manufacturing productivity and better capacity utilization will account for 95% of the expected reduction in costs by 2022 to $473/kWh.\n\n·Vertical integration is key to VRFB costs. Vertical integration and exclusive supply agreements will be key to managing the cost of vanadium pentoxide, a metal with a widely variable historical market price and uncertain future. Future cost estimates for vanadium pentoxide range from $15/kg to $30/kg, from the current $13.20/kg. At the upper end of the range, VRFB cost will actually increase to $1,205/kWh.\n\nWednesday, May 30, 2012\n\nElectricity grids are becoming increasingly unstable due to strong electricity demand growth and increasing penetration of intermittent energy generation sources. In order to manage this, large amounts of inefficient spinning reserves are required to quickly be added to or removed from power supply according to demand patterns. Every grid network must be able to supply peak power, which is only required for a small part of the day, meaning grid networks are somewhat wasteful. Even in more developed economies loss of energy from generation to consumer can easily reach 7%, causing unnecessary extra carbon dioxide emissions and a greater use of costly fossil fuels.\n\nEnergy storage technologies can thus provide a number of solutions in both more efficiently controlling the flow of electricity through a grid network and improving the consistency of intermittent generation feed-in. By storing energy when demand is low and releasing it when demand is high, transmission will be smoother and generation capacity can be optimized. However, there are a large number of different applications which energy storage technologies can perform, and a large number of different technologies competing to manage these tasks. The Energy Storage Technologies (EST) Market 2012-2022 looks at the prospects of each of these technologies discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each with detailed forecast for each technology. Visiongain has calculated the global market for energy storage technologies in 2012 will reach $1.66bn.\n\nVisiongain provides global energy storage market forecasts for the period 2012-2022, which is broken down into 7 energy storage technology submarkets. In addition, 11 national energy storage technologies markets are forecast and analyzed over the period 2012-2022, along with countries in the rest of the world. All global national and submarket forecasts are also accompanied by corresponding capacity forecasts for the 2012-2022 period. The report contains 173 tables, charts and graphs that add visual analysis in order to explain developing trends within the energy storage technologies market. Interviews with 3 company experts in the energy storage technology industry are included adding key insight to visiongain's analysis, as well as profiles of 62 of the leading companies working in the energy storage technologies market.\n\nThis year, Intersolar North America will feature a new special exhibit that promotes energy storage technologies. The exhibit, called PV Energy World (sounds like the name of a magazine but isn't), located in the Moscone Center, North Hall - Booth 5135, will offer expert presentations on energy storage and grid integration. According to the organizers, \"the informative exhibits and display boards will stimulate discussion among visitors.\"\n\nPV Energy World is supported in part by the California Energy Storage Alliance (CESA), an advocacy coalition committed to expanding the role of energy storage to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy. CESA counts storage technology manufacturers, renewable energy component manufacturers, developers and system integrators among its members, and this year marks the first time Intersolar will partner with CESA. Additionally, the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE joins PV Energy World as a partner. Fraunhofer ISE is one of the world's leading research institutes in the field of renewable energy and energy efficiency.\n\n\"Energy storage offers the solar industry the opportunity to bring several goals to fruition, including faster grid interconnection, more precise timing of output, fewer curtailment and imbalance penalties, and the potential to secure valuable new revenue from wholesale ancillary services and capacity markets,\" said Janice Lin, Executive Director of the California Energy Storage Alliance. \"Advanced energy storage is poised to have a huge, positive impact on the solar industry in California and beyond, and the storage industry is very excited to see Intersolar North America cover this formative topic in such depth at this year's conference and on the exhibition floor.\"\n\nSeveral conference sessions at Intersolar will feature discussions with leaders and technical experts in energy storage, and provide attendees with first-hand information from the energy storage industry to help navigate opportunities in the fast changing marketplace. Speakers will provide an overview of the changing regulatory landscape; highlight new storage technologies; discuss the opportunities smart grid technology offers; and explain how new business models are improving the economics of storage and solar projects.\n\nIntersolar North America takes place annually in San Francisco's Moscone Center. Since its establishment in 2008, the exhibition and conference have developed into the premier platform for the solar industry in North America.

The research demonstrated a new type of atomic force microscopy that can 'see' down into a working organic photovoltaic cell and relate its three-dimensional nanoscale structure to its performance.\n\nPhotovoltaic solar cells have become a much more common sight over recent years, often installed on rooftops where they quietly convert sunlight into clean electricity for homes and businesses.\n\nAn organic photovoltaic cell is a type of solar cell that uses organic (carbon-based) electronics and could potentially be a cheaper, more efficient and flexible alternative to today's photovoltaic systems. The technology is on the verge of commercialisation but several obstacles remain, including a necessary increase in performance.\n\nMany recent advances have occurred due to recognition of the pivotal role that morphology plays in efficiency, but it was previously difficult to measure exactly how form and structure affect electrical characteristics and therefore performance.\n\nThis research demonstrated that it is possible to obtain structural and electrical information, both on the surface and below the surface to a depth of at least 20 nanometres in operating organic solar cells. The new measurement method is based on a technique called photoconducting atomic force microscopy (pc-AFM) that uses a nanoscale probe to measure topography and photocurrent generation at the same time.\n\nThis technique can provide direct correlation between the nanometre scale morphology of a working organic solar cell and its performance characteristics.\n\nThis breakthrough will improve understanding of the technology, allowing manufacturers to improve the efficiency of their products by optimising the nanometre scale structure of the organic photovoltaic material.\n\nThe work has benefited from strong links with Imperial College London, who contributed with their material and device fabrication expertise.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nNational Energy Renewable Laboratory (NERL) has announced Konarka Technologies' organic-based photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells have demonstrated the highest performance for an organic photovoltaic cell at a Mitsubishi Chemical Corp has created an organic photovoltaic (PV) cell that can boast a cell conversion efficiency of 8.5% and while that may not sound like a lot to those of us who do not ...\n\nIn the solar energy field researchers are using the latest developments in nanotechnology to work on very small solar cells.

But the new study shows that there might be much simpler alternatives to hand.\n\n\"The hardest part about turning water into fuel is splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen, but the team at Monash seems to have uncovered the process, developing a water-splitting cell based on a manganese-based catalyst,\" Professor Spiccia said.\n\n\"Birnessite, it turns out, is what does the work. Like other elements in the middle of the Periodic Table, manganese can exist in a number of what chemists call oxidation states. These correspond to the number of oxygen atoms with which a metal atom could be combined,\" Professor Spiccia said.\n\n\"When an electrical voltage is applied to the cell, it splits water into hydrogen and oxygen and when the researchers carefully examined the catalyst as it was working, using advanced spectroscopic methods they found that it had decomposed into a much simpler material called birnessite, well-known to geologists as a black stain on many rocks.\"\n\nThe manganese in the catalyst cycles between two oxidation states. First, the voltage is applied to oxidize from the manganese-II state to manganese-IV state in birnessite. Then in sunlight, birnessite goes back to the manganese-II State.\n\nThis cycling process is responsible for the oxidation of water to produce oxygen gas, protons and electrons.\n\nCo-author on the research paper was Dr Rosalie Hocking, Research Fellow in the Australian Centre for Electromaterials Science who explained that what was interesting was the operation of the catalyst, which follows closely natures biogeochemical cycling of manganese in the oceans.\n\n\"This may provide important insights into the evolution of Nature's water splitting catalyst found in all plants which uses manganese centres,\" Dr Hocking said.\n\n\"Scientists have put huge efforts into making very complicated manganese molecules to copy plants, but it turns out that they convert to a very common material found in the Earth, a material sufficiently robust to survive tough use.\"\n\nThe reaction has two steps. First, two molecules of water are oxidized to form one molecule of oxygen gas (O2), four positively-charged hydrogen nuclei (protons) and four electrons. Second, the protons and electrons combine to form two molecules of hydrogen gas (H2).\n\nThe experimental work was conducted using state-of-the art equipment at three major facilities including the Australian Synchrotron, the Australian National Beam-line Facility in Japan and the Monash Centre for Electron Microscopy, and involved collaboration with Professor Bill Casey, a geochemist at UC Davis.\n\n\"The research highlights the insight obtainable from the synchrotron based spectroscopic techniques – without them the important discovery linking common earth materials to water oxidation catalysts would not have been made,\" Dr Hocking said.\n\nIt is hoped the research will ultimately lead to the development of cheaper devices, which produce hydrogen.\n\nRelated StoriesFor decades, scientists have been trying to replicate the process of photosynthesis -- the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy. The Economist reports that Angela Belcher and her colleagues at the Massachusetts ...Emory University chemists have developed the most potent homogeneous catalyst known for water oxidation, considered a crucial component for generating clean hydrogen fuel using only water and sunlight. TheSounds like something simple enough to have been figured out hundreds of times already by many different chemists over the years. Anyone got a Pelican Brief on coincidental deaths of chemists in related fields of research?\n\nThe author didn't need to limit the applications of this to renewable energy which immediately suggests hydrogen as a transportation fuel. The ability to make hydrogen less expensively than from fossil fuels and far away from refineries would be very important for many applications.\n\nBullshit. Stan Meyer was a hopeless crank who claimed to have discovered free energy(in the sense of perpetual motion machines of the second kind); his investors took him to court and he was found guilty of \"gross and egregious fraud\".

Photo courtesy/MIT\n\nDr. Jacobson leads a team of 20 researchers for this project, and they are drawn from several disciplines, including MIT's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the MIT Gas Turbine Laboratory, the Laboratory for Electromagnetic, and Electronic Systems Microsystems Technology Laboratories. \"Working with researchers from other departments is what makes the project fun—intellectually, it has been a great experience to work with others,\" notes Dr. Jacobson. \"When I was a graduate student, I remember working alone on research projects most of the time. Today, many students have the opportunity to see and work with students from different disciplines.\"\n\nWhile Dr. Jacobson notes that the MIT Microengine Project is a MEMS project, nanotechnology does play an important role in their project. \"We want to know, 'What happens when you shrink down to this size? Do good things happen?'\"\n\nWhen it comes to interdisciplinary projects, Dr. Jacobson offers the readers of NWN some advice:\n\nWhen working with complex systems that integrate components from various fields, there needs to be a collaborative effort from the start.\n\nBoth a \"top-down\" and \"bottom-up\" approach is needed to understand where you are going to be and to make the right progress.\n\nIn the first years of the project, simplify down to the sub-system component level. Starting with too complex of a design will result in low fabrication yield, limiting advancement. At the same time, it is absolutely critical to be concerned with integration from the start, since the sub-system interactions can dictate overall system performance. Balancing these conflicting concepts is the key to ultimate success."

      "text": "Some people are happy to learn simply for the sake of learning. Megan Burger would rather use her education to create cutting-edge inventions with important uses.\n\nThat's exactly what the 18-year-old has done. At this year's Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) in Phoenix, Ariz., the high school senior from The Woodlands, Texas, was one of several students who investigated fuel-cell technology. Her work might eventually help make Earth a cleaner place.\n\nFuel cells power this car, which runs on hydrogen.\n\nU.S. Department of Energy\n\nFuel cells generate electricity through chemical reactions between hydrogen and oxygen. The process is an efficient way to produce energy with no toxic waste.\n\nFuel cells already power spacecraft and a few cars. In the future, experts suggest, they will also be used in homes and other buildings and even in devices such as laptops and cell phones.\n\nThe technology has \"the potential to transform the [U.S.] energy industry,\" Megan says.\n\nStill, there are problems. Even though there's more hydrogen in the universe than any other element, it's difficult to gather and store.\n\nOn Earth, most hydrogen is attached to oxygen (as in water molecules, which contain two atoms of hydrogen for every atom of oxygen) or to other atoms, and energy is required to separate them. That's an issue if the point is to generate energy without the pollution produced by burning gasoline, oil, coal, and other fuels used today, which might be needed to free up hydrogen.\n\nStronger, safer\n\nFor her project, Megan wanted to create a fuel cell that would be stronger and safer than those now available.\n\nFirst, she did a lot of background reading, using books and the Internet, just to understand the basics of such a complicated topic. \"I had to do a lot of research,\" she says.\n\nMegan Burger and her fuel cell project.\n\nEmily Sohn\n\nOne of the first things Megan learned is that a fuel cell has three main parts that fit together like a sandwich. The \"bread\" on one side is called an anode. The other slice of \"bread\" is called a cathode. The \"meat\" squished between the cathode and the anode is called an electrolyte. There are lots of different types of fuel cells, which differ mainly in the kinds of electrolytes they use.\n\nIn her experiments, Megan worked with a type of fuel cell called a solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC), which has a solid electrolyte. SOFCs, which are stronger and safer than liquid versions, are used today in power plants, and engineers are looking for ways to use them in laptops and cell phones, Megan says. The downside is that they require high temperatures—around 1,000 degrees Celsius—to work. This limits where the fuel cells can be used.\n\n\"I thought maybe I could make them operate at lower temperatures,\" Megan says.\n\nAs hydrogen and oxygen flow through a fuel cell, they generate electricity and produce water. The fuel cell's core is an electrical sandwich that consists of an anode, an electrolyte, and a cathode.\n\nU.S. Department of Energy\n\nFor 2 years, Megan experimented with various electrolyte materials to lower the temperature at which an SOFC operates. Eventually, she ended up with solid pellets of a material called bismuth strontium barium oxide. No one had ever used this material before in a fuel cell, she says. Her tests showed that a fuel cell based on that material would be able to operate at a mere 650 degrees Celsius.\n\n\"That's already 350 degrees less than before,\" Megan says. \"It gives me hope that we can have another step down.\"\n\nHer research continues. In the meantime, she has already learned more than she ever expected to learn—and not just about fuel cells.\n\n\"One of the biggest lessons is perseverance,\" she says. \"If you want to find something exciting, you have to keep trying, no matter how many things around you are breaking, exploding, or not working. Thousands of things that people call failures are still things you can learn from.\"\n\nCold start\n\nISEF participant Wade Miller learned some important lessons from his fuel cell project, too. And like Megan, Wade didn't know where he was going to end up when he began.\n\n\"It was really confusing when I first started learning about it,\" says Wade, a 17-year-old senior from Albert Lea, Minn. Still, the concept was exciting enough to keep him going.\n\nWade Miller holds his fuel-cell-powered toy vehicle.\n\nEmily Sohn\n\nBecause Wade lives in Minnesota, a state with hot summers and cold winters, he wanted to test a fuel cell's ability to withstand temperature extremes. His main goal was to figure out whether cars powered by fuel cells might some day be practical where he lives.\n\nUnlike Megan, Wade used a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell. These types of fuel cells work at relatively low temperatures, and they use sheet-like electrolytes that resemble plastic wrap.\n\nTo test efficiency at various temperatures, Wade built a toy car and attached a PEM fuel cell to it. That way, he could measure how much energy the cell produced. He tested the system under heat lamps at 80 degrees F, indoors at 65 degrees F, outdoors at 27 degrees F, and in the school's freezer at –10 degrees F.\n\nWade had predicted that the fuel cell would work best at higher temperatures. Instead, it produced the most electricity at –10 degrees F.\n\nPolymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells use sheets of plastic as electrolytes. The cathode and anode are typically made from carbon, with a layer of platinum, which serves as a catalyst to speed up the separation of electrons from hydrogen atoms.\n\nU.S. Department of Energy\n\n\"I ended up proving myself completely wrong,\" he says. \"If you start a car in Minnesota when it's really cold, it takes a while for the engine to turn over. I thought the fuel cell would do the same. But I guess not.\"\n\nIn the end, Wade concluded that fuel-cell-powered cars would run just fine in Minnesota. Still, he predicts, it'll be another 10 or 15 years before we actually see them on the streets.\n\n\"This is probably something we will deal with in the future,\" he says. \"It's a good thing to get into. We will be seeing this in the news.\"\n\nAnd today's young scientists are already on the case. As usual, taking a walk around the exhibition hall at this year's ISEF was like taking a walk into the future."

Its capacity is nearly four times higher than that of a conventional battery and it can power a typical laptop computer for eight to sixteen hours.\n\nThe unit features a device that extracts hydrogen from a methanol and sends the hydrogen to the main fuel cell. Casio has been working with Akira Igarashi, an engineering professor at Kogakuin University, and has succeeded in making the device as small as a 500 yen coin so that the entire unit would fit into a laptop. Casio overcame the problem of extreme heat, caused by the device that extracts the hydrogen, by wrapping the unit in a heatproof case, among other methods.\n\nFuel cells that use methanol are also under development, but require pumps to handle liquid methanol, making the entire unit to large to fit into a laptop. Under current law, methanol is treated as a dangerous substance because it is flammable; this makes it difficult for manufactures and causes them to take excessive safety measures.\n\nGovernment regulators, including the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, are considering deregulation as early as 2007 so that fuel cells may be able to then be used widely. Casio hopes to bring its fuel cell to the market after the deregulation occurs."

While there can be no doubt that the world of clean energy is expanding, there is still a serious problem that could ultimately stop the use of renewable energy entirely. The problem is storage. While there are currently a variety of ways to store electrical power, few of them are suited for the energy generated from a renewable source, such as hydrogen fuel. This problem has prevented the widespread adoption of clean power, but chemists at Rutgers University in New Jersey are hard at work in finding a solution.\n\nResearchers developing processes to produce hydrogen gas\n\nRutgers University chemists are working to develop new, inexpensive materials that can separate water into its hydrogen and oxygen components. In order for this to be efficient, the process must use as little electricity as possible. The hydrogen generated by this process will be used by a fuel cell to produce electricity. Chemists are currently working on developing a formula that will lead to the efficient storage of this electricity.\n\nPotential energy storage possible through new black powder material\n\nChemists have created what appears to be a form of black powder. By itself, the powder is benign. When it is applied to a surface which is submerged in water and fed an electrical current, the powder boosts the effectiveness of producing hydrogen gas. The electrical current triggers the process of separating the oxygen and hydrogen molecules that create water and researchers have found that their black powder can make this process exponentially more effective.\n\nPotential energy storage gaining traction in science community\n\nRutgers University researchers believe that this is a promising method of energy storage. This concept is akin to the notion of storing potential energy. The potential energy of a process, chemical, or other material, represents its untapped electrical power. Potential energy storage is becoming a popular idea because it has, thus far, proven proficient in reducing the costs associated with energy storage"

It's also\npowerful, as much as ten times more efficient at carrying out\nphotosynthesis than a natural leaf.\n\nWith a single gallon of water, Nocera says, the chip could\nproduce enough electricity to power a house in a developing country\nfor an entire day. Provide every house on the planet with an\nartificial leaf and we could satisfy our 14 terrawatt need with\njust one gallon of water a day.\n\nThose are impressive claims, but they're also not just\npie-in-the-sky, conceptual thoughts. Nocera has already signed a\ncontract with a global megafirm to commercialise his groundbreaking\nidea. The mammoth Indian conglomerate, Tata Group has\nforged a deal with the MIT professor to build a small\npower plant, the size of a refrigerator, in about a year and a\nhalf.\n\nThis isn't the first ever artificial leaf, of course.

The first, built more than ten years ago by John\nTurner of the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory, was\nefficient at faking photosynthesis but was made of rare and hugely\nexpensive materials. It was also highly unstable, and had a\nlifespan of barely one day.\n\nFor now, Nocera is setting his sights on developing\ncountries. \"Our goal is to make each home its own power station,\"\nhe said. \"One can envision villages in India and\nAfrica not long from now purchasing an affordable basic power\nsystem based on this technology.\"\n\nEdited by Duncan Geere\n\nComments\n\nWhat about the world's ever-decreasing water supply?\n\nAdam\n\nMar 28th 2011\n\nIn reply to Adam\n\nNot to worry.

Not only that, a large amount of land at the moment is going to produce biofuel. That could all be freed up to produce crops for starving families. In addition with energy sources more readily available in LEDC's, electrical water purification becomes possible. Meaning the clean water problem might be solved very quickly. Here's hoping that this is all true and not some under performing expensive technology!Not only that think about how many scientific ideas haven't been made the transition from lab to product purely because of the high energy costs making them economically unfeasible. Heck this could do a lot more than solve our energy problems, it could renovate economies, spur innovation and help solve world hunger and basic needs!\n\nAstridax\n\nMar 28th 2011\n\nI'm liking what i'm reading!Thia is a Wonderful Technology if it does what it Promises and remains Affordable for the Developing countries if so I really would like to Put it into work in my Home country in Africa, let me know when its ready to hit the market.Please use this Knowledge to make a diffrence to Mankind and the Nature,I'm curious to know where I can see it for myself.\n\nFrancis\n\nMar 29th 2011\n\nWhy only developing countries? Could not every house in the world have this leaf? I hope this idea get improved... and become really revolutionary. World needs it. And what about non-potable water? Does it work too?\n\nPedro\n\nMar 29th 2011\n\nSounds like everyone should have a few of those leaves, would be good if it grew on a GM tree nearby as my x iph is always running flat on the runJust kidding .. what happens after 45 hrs?Can we recycle, return, use it as compost on the hypothetical garden from which it might one day come from?\n\nDJ\n\nMar 29th 2011\n\nDoes it works also with fishes (especially those special fishes from 1st April ?)\n\ngeve2009\n\nMar 29th 2011\n\nThe article dances around what the efficiency actually is. So, I look up the efficiency of a leaf (different from the efficiency of photosynthesis, as they quote 'leaf' as their reference point) ( sorry, its only wikipedia, but just to get the right ball park. you can follow the references from there), and it turns out to be about 0.1%. Making this device 1% efficient. It's reasonably routine to construct photo voltaic cells with about 30% efficiency. So, why did they call it a leaf, instead of a solar cell, which is pretty much what it is? I suspect its an attempt at a sneaky press release, because they get to compare it to a crappy inefficient leaf, rather than a sweet sweet photovoltaic cell. Power a household? Ok, lets take 1kW as a fairly conservative average energy consumption. Solar intensity ~ 1kw/m^2, divide by 3 to take into account night time and clouds, and we find that we need 300 m^2 of this material. But of course they don't mention that, they quote the amount of water (1 gallon) it needs as its figure of merit. Surely the water isn't the limiting factor here. Why not also quote the amount of radiation emitted into the atmosphere, or the number of dolphins that get caught in drift nets during its construction while they're at it? Solar cell, now completely dolphin safe!It might have other advantages (cheep, short energy pay back time), but those weren't explained in any meaningful way, and were lost on me due to this lousy uninformative scientific reporting.\n\nNow, if only I believed we could set aside the penchant for greed and monetization to see a revelation like this through to ground level use. I don't, sadly. One wonders how many great inventions are ground under the heel of greed that never see the light of day - is no one else seeing a giant banner on this that suggests the removal of the need for electrical companies? Nuclear plants? Coal? What happens to every good idea? Mysterious disappearance. I expect this patent to be bought for what amounts to a single person's wildest dreams and then languish in a filing cabinet somewhere til the sun burns out.\n\nHank Single\n\nMar 29th 2011\n\nIn reply to Hank Single\n\nI agree that this could remove the need for electrical companies and that more than likely it will be swept under the rug. No one will even remember this in America a week from now, or even a day from now. I would love to buy one myself and if it needs purified water then I could just use my Berkey, which purifies even the nastiest water. Go Berkey! Anyway with my fingers crossed maybe this one invention will sweep past the Greedy.\n\nAmy\n\nMar 30th 2011\n\nWhy do tech writers always make the story of electrolysis (turning water into hydrogen & oxygen) sound as though everything will be powered by water in the future? Like if you have a gallon of water, and nothing more, you can power a town. Come on! The energy doesn't come from water, it comes from THE SUN.This leaf is a form of solar power. Water doesn't do anything except capture the solar energy, like a fuel tank. For there to be any impact on fresh water supply, there would have to be utility-scale solar farms covered with these leaves, along with a huge \"hydrogen economy\". If needed, the same solar energy could power desalination plants to remove salt from seawater.Meanwhile solar technology that simply focuses sunlight on pipes to heat water into steam, which feeds into a conventional generator, is already being deployed. Is anyone worried about how much water is \"used up\" as steam in conventional power plants?\n\nMarco\n\nMar 30th 2011In reply to DarkFlib\n\nWOW - 500 Watts, sounds tiny, but i need a couple more unit terms to be meaningfulis that 500W / hrs? 500W /sec? 500W /years over what time period? A day? A month? A year?I have a big old house, build in the 1950's that with everything turned on will draw about 250 Amps of Current at 240 Volts of EMF at 60Hz. That is my peak demand. My average demand is much lower. It is an all electric house, in a month averaged over the year, lights, heating, cooling, pool, computers, appliances, etc give me the effective rate of about 3200kW/h. That works out to 107 kiloWatt /hours per day or 4.5 kWatts per hour average consumption. Very high based on world wide average, Not so high for large older homes in the American north east.Good luck with your \"50 Watts\" on the boat, my HP laptop draws 67 watts/per unit time according to the label on the power supply.\n\njim\n\nOct 6th 2011\n\nIn reply to jim\n\nyou don't need more terms you need to refresh your knowledge of si unitswatts is a unit of power and time is inherent in its valuewatt hours (a bit counter intuitively) are units of energy\n\nnick\n\nNov 22nd 2011\n\nIn reply to DarkFlib\n\nYou've missed the fact that this \"invention\" is at best 1/15th as good as an ordinary PV cell PV cells themselves are a very expensive source of electricity.Last I calculated, electricity from PV costs about 5x more than conventional sources. Multiply that 5x by the leaf's inferiority factor of 15, and you can safely figure the \"leaf\" output costs at least 75 conventional sources. (That's ignoring the loss from hydrolysis, which makes the leaf even less attractive.)Too bad the article didn't give us any information on which to base a real assessment, but then if it had, the article never would've been printed.\n\nJamesUSA\n\nOct 29th 2011\n\nIf this is truly as effective as it claims, and not just another case of \"too good to be true\", I see a Nobel Peace Price in this guys future!...Assuming it's effectively implemented worldwide and cost efficient for everyone. I know I would be ecstatic to water my \"energy tree\" everyday!"

This technology would make it possible to use\nhydrogen as a clean alternative to traditional hydrocarbon-based fuels in\naeroplane and car engines.\n\nHydrogen is a clean fuel which produces only water on combustion or when\ncombined with oxygen in a fuel cell to produce electrical power. However, it can\nbe expensive and difficult to store safely. In addition, to store hydrogen as a gas\ndemands high volumes, while to store as a liquid increases weight and the\nenergy requirement (to compress it).\nStorage of hydrogen in a solid is, therefore, very attractive but minimising\nweight and volume of the store is challenging and the rate of transfer from the\ntank to a fuel cell or engine is often slow. These barriers are currently holding\nback the use of hydrogen on an industrial scale in fuel cells to provide power for\naeroplanes and road vehicles.\nChemists at the University of Glasgow are working with EADS by using\nnanotechnology to alter the design and material composition of a storage tank\nwith the aim of making it so efficient that it will be feasible to use solid state\nhydrogen on an industrial scale for aeroplanes and cars.\nIf the developments to the tank structure are successful, EADS is planning to fly\nan un-manned hydrogen-powered test plane in 2014 with a longer term view of\nintroducing commercial aeroplanes powered by hydrogen.\n\n\"Replacing traditional hydrocarbon-based fuels with pollution-free hydrogen in\naeroplane and car engines would deliver huge benefits to the environment\nbecause carbon emissions would be dramatically reduced\" said Dr.-Ing. Agata\nGodula-Jopek, Fuel Cells Expert in the EADS Power Generation Team, which is\ncoordinating the programme for the company.\nDuncan Gregory, Professor of Inorganic Materials at the School of Chemistry at\nthe University of Glasgow, is leading the research. He is using nanotechnology\nto alter the structure of the Hydrisafe Tank, which is a new design under\ndevelopment by Hydrogen Horizons, a Scottish-registered start-up company.\nThe University and EADS IW have secured funding from the Materials\nKnowledge Transfer Network – part of the UK Technology Strategy Board – and\nthe Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). This will\nallow a student to carry out a four year PhD project, spending time at the\nUniversity and the company's German offices in Ottobrunn.\nThe research will involve testing the Hydrisafe tank with alternative hydrogen\nstorage materials. The tank currently uses the established and commercially\navailable lanthanum nickel (LaNi5) storage alloy. The research will look into\nreplacing LaNi5 with other hydride materials such as magnesium hydride\n(MgH2), which has been modified at the nanoscale to allow it to receive and\nrelease the hydrogen at an even faster rate.\n\nModifying the construction of the tank will extend its longevity, making it suitable\nto have a solid state hydrogen storage system that can feed a fuel cell at the\nrequired energy densities required on an aeroplane.\nProfessor Gregory said: \"Using new active nanomaterials in combination with\nnovel storage tank design principles presents a hugely exciting opportunity to\naddress the considerable challenges of introducing hydrogen as a fuel for\naviation. This collaboration between engineers and chemists and between\nindustry and academia provides the pathway to achieve this\"\nEADS IW and Prof Gregory's team are seeking funding from the European\nUnion to build a European-wide team of academic and industrial partners to\nexamine the wider issues relating to using hydrogen on an industrial scale to\npower aeroplane and car engines.\nThere is a recognition that while there is a strong potential for the adoption of\nfuel cells into the portable fuel cells market, key barriers to delivering this are\nthe safe, efficient and cost-effective storage of hydrogen.

      "text": "UCLA demonstrates desktop nuclear fusion\nBy Lester Haines\nPublished Thursday 28th April 2005 11:30 GMT\nScientists at the University of California in Los Angeles have demonstrated desktop nuclear fusion by simply heating a lithium tantalate crystal soaked in deuterium gas. However, the technique produces far too few neutrons to be practical for commercial use, so it's sadly not a matter of free-power-for-everyone next week, New Scientist reports.\n\nSeth Putterman's UCLA team used previous research by James Brownridge at the State University of New York - which produced X-rays from lithium tantalate by heating the crystals in a dilute gas - as the basis for its experiment. When Brownridge turned up the heat on the lithium tantalate, the pyroelectric properties of the crystal created an electric field provoked by the migration of positive and negative charges to opposite ends of the crystal. As NS explains, the electric field \"strips electrons from the gas molecules and accelerates them to huge energies. The electrons then collide with stationary nuclei in the crystal and generate X-rays.\"\n\nThe recipe for UCLA nuclear fusion is as follows: Bathe lithium tantalate in deuterium gas. Cool to -33°C. Heat to 7°C over three-and-a-half minutes. Wait for electric field to \"accelerate deuterium nuclei over a distance of 1 centimetre to energies in excess of 100 kiloelectronvolts\". Watch as nuclei then collide and fuse with deuterium nuclei that had \"permeated the surface of the crystal lattice\".\n\nAnd, if you get your recipe right, you should cook up \"400 times more neutrons than found in background measurements\".\n\nSounds good, but this represents a few hundred neutrons per second - way short of the millions of neutrons a second you'd need for a commercial neutron generator. Accordingly, hopes for the technique are at present modest. Putterman says it might one day power microthrusters for miniature spacecraft, while Nigel Hawkes, a nuclear physicist at the UK's National Physical Laboratory, cautioned: \"It's too early to say where this might lead.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Putterman hopes to up the neutron yield by \"operating at lower temperatures and by using an array of crystals\".\n\nCharlieP\n\nApril 29th, 2005, 02:11 PM\n\nDoes that mean the next step is laptop nuclear fusion?\n\nalphaxion\n\nApril 29th, 2005, 02:30 PM\n\nnah, mobile nuclear fusion\n\ngothicform\n\nApril 29th, 2005, 02:30 PM\n\nultimately you could have a micro generator in every piece of electrical equipment around - no need for a plug to a power socket\n\nEnglishman\n\nApril 29th, 2005, 03:41alphaxion\n\nApril 29th, 2005, 03:47 PM\n\npower over ethernet.. we use that to power our wifi access points.\nyou'll either need a switch with built in poe ports or a little box that sits inbetween the ethernet switch and the rest of the cable to the pc that is connected to a wall socket.\n\nSy\n\nApril 29th, 2005, 04:07Interesting as I know some power companies have been testing a system of delivering broadband through a power socket."

Immersing the alloy in freshwater or saltwater causes a spontaneous reaction, splitting the water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules. The hydrogen could then be fed to a fuel cell to generate electricity, producing water in the form of steam as a byproduct, he said.\n\n\"The steam would kill any bacteria contained in the water, and then it would condense to purified water,\" Woodall said. \"So, you are converting undrinkable water to drinking water.\"\n\nBecause the technology works with saltwater, it might have marine applications, such as powering boats and robotic underwater vehicles. The technology also might be used to desalinate water, said Woodall, who is working with doctoral student Go Choi.\n\nA patent on the design is pending.\n\nWoodall envisions a new portable technology for regions that aren't connected to a power grid, such as villages in Africa and other remote areas.\n\n\"There is a big need for this sort of technology in places lacking connectivity to a power grid and where potable water is in short supply,\" he said. \"Because aluminum is a low-cost, non-hazardous metal that is the third-most abundant metal on Earth, this technology promises to enable a global-scale potable water and power technology, especially for off-grid and remote locations.\"\n\nThe potable water could be produced for about $1 per gallon, and electricity could be generated for about 35 cents per kilowatt hour of energy.\n\n\"There is no other technology to compare it against, economically, but it's obvious that 34 cents per kilowatt hour is cheap compared to building a power plant and installing power lines, especially in remote areas,\" Woodall said.\n\nThe unit, including the alloy, the reactor and fuel cell might weigh less than 100 pounds.\n\n\"You could drop the alloy, a small reaction vessel and a fuel cell into a remote area via parachute,\" Woodall said. \"Then the reactor could be assembled along with the fuel cell. The polluted water or the seawater would be added to the reactor and the reaction converts the aluminum and water into aluminum hydroxide, heat and hydrogen gas on demand.\"\n\nThe aluminum hydroxide waste is non-toxic and could be disposed of in a landfill.\n\nA cartoon illustrates the potential uses of a new theoretical type of mobile technology that would use an aluminum alloy to convert non-potable water into drinking water while also extracting hydrogen to generate electricity. Such a lightweight, portable system might be used to provide power and drinking water to villages and also for military operations.

I do have a better idea for the use of this fabric, why not make various lengths of five, ten, and fifteen foot lengths hose them on flag poles and see how much electricity they produce. Instead of having wind mills you would have wind flags that generate power ( can not say with less moving parts;since the flag is one moving part). Can you imagine a field full of moving flags (of various colors) flapping in the breeze along a mountain side or on a shoreline. It would be kinder to the environment that wind mill generators and would cost less to produce. Who would not like a sea of moving flags; rather that a sea of wind mills?\n\nAnother case of misleading and downright wrong headline. ShadePlex had solar cell fabrics for three years now, and this is simply another in the long line of RESEARCH products, while ShadePlex actually has commercial products.

This is the kind of innovation that gets me excited about the future. This kind of material on bags, briefcases, umbrellas -- the potential is unlmited\n\nNot actually possible. The surface area, surface normals, and panel efficiency are so small that this can't even charge your phone, let alone power a laptop. On top of that, the current methods mean limited flexibility and very fragile connections, so this technology will be used on static covers premolded and possibly cured into shape, not soft, flexible uses.\n\nThere's a reason they mentioned blinds but not coats, and that's because it's just not possible using current solar cell technology. Future ink dye based methods might be able to be used for minor electrical generation, but it's actually cheaper and more efficient to use motion based micro-generators instead.\n\nbut it just may very well be these folks are working on something that lies outside your perview. I know, I know. Hard to believe, I'm sure, but it just might be possible.\n\nWhatever they are working on is not groundbreaking. They have exactly what ShadePlex has three years ago, which is something that cannot be commercialized past a few rich people wanting to cash in on \"green\" tax rebates."

Its only problem is that it is made with lithium, which is not cheap. It could get even more expensive if more electric vehicles powered with lithium ion batteries hit the road and drive up demand.\n\nReza Shahbazian-Yassar with students in his laboratory. He is conducting basic research aimed at making an inexpensive, sodium-based battery that could make electric vehicles more affordable.\n\nMichigan Technological University\n\n\"Some people think lithium will be the next oil,\" says Shahbazian-Yassar, an associate professor of mechanical engineering–engineering mechanics at Michigan Technological University.\n\nSodium may be a good alternative. \"After lithium, it's the most attractive element to be used in batteries,\" Shahbazian-Yassar said. It's also cheap and abundant; seawater is full of it.\n\nIt has just one drawback: sodium atoms are big, about 70 percent larger in size than lithium atoms. \"When the atoms are too big, that's problematic,\" says Shahbazian-Yassar, because they can cause a battery's electrodes to wear out faster. \"Imagine bringing an elephant through the door into my office. It's going to break down the walls.\"\n\nBefore a long-lasting rechargeable sodium battery can be developed, scientists need to better understand these challenges and develop solutions. With a $417,000 National Science Foundation grant, Shahbazian-Yassar is leading that effort at Michigan Tech. \"We have an opportunity to tackle some of the fundamental issues relating to charging and discharging of batteries right here,\" he said. \"We have a unique tool that lets us observe the inside of a battery.\"\n\nUsing a transmission electron microscope, Shahbazian-Yassar and his team can peer inside and see how a battery is charging and discharging at the atomic level. \"We will study these fundamental reactions and find out what materials and electrodes will do a better job hosting the sodium.\"\n\nSodium ion batteries would not have to be as good as lithium ion batteries to be competitive, Shahbazian-Yassar notes. They would just need to be good enough to satisfy the consumer. And they could make electric cars more affordable, and thus more attractive. Plus, they could reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, particularly if the batteries were charged using renewable energy sources. That would lead to two laudable goals: greater energy independence and less pollution worldwide"

      "text": "The search for new materials for hydrogen storage\n\nSep 20, 2012\n\n(Phys.org)—Hydrogen is the ideal fuel for new types of fuel cell vehicles, but one problem is how to store hydrogen. In his doctoral dissertation Serhiy Luzan studies new types of materials for hydrogen storage. He also shows that new materials with interesting properties can be synthesized by the reaction of hydrogen with carbon nano-structured materials.\n\nNew car engines that run on hydrogen produce only water as exhaust and are three to four times more efficient than ordinary internal combustion engines. Just one \"small\" problem is hampering the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles: there is no good method for storing sufficient amounts of hydrogen, as it is a gas of very low density.\n\nSerhiy Luzan devotes the first part of his dissertation to studies of hydrogen storage in exciting new types of materials: metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). They consist of zinc- and cobalt-based metal clusters linked together via organic linkers, and they are extremely porous. One gram of MOF has a hydrogen-absorbing surface that is larger than a football field! Dozens of new MOF materials are synthesized each year, which is highly promising for the next generation of hydrogen storage materials.\n\nSerhiy studied the hydrogen absorption of several new MOFs and researched the effects of different surface areas, pore volumes, and pore forms on the hydrogen storage parameters. MOFs can store record amounts of hydrogen at very low temperatures, but the hydrogen capacity at room temperature is not good enough. Luzan therefore studied new methods to enhance this capacity. Addition of metal catalysts has previously been reported to improve hydrogen storage considerably.\n\n\"But in my study, the effect of metal catalysts addition on hydrogen absorption in MOFs was not confirmed,\" says Serhihy Luzan.\n\nHydrogen is of interest not only as a fuel but also for chemical modification of nano-structured carbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, and graphene. Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms. Carbon nanotubes also consist of pure carbon, in the form of graphene layers rolled into a cylinder. Fullerene, C60, consist of sixty carbon atoms arranged in five- or six-vertices figures, just like the pattern on a soccer ball. There are carbon materials that are stronger than steel, conduct current better than copper, and diffuse heat better than diamond.\n\nIn the second part of the dissertation Luzan describes the materials he created by the reaction of hydrogen with fullerenes and carbon nanotubes.\n\nLuzan studied the reaction between fullerene C60 and hydrogen at elevated temperatures and hydrogen pressures, with and without the addition of metal catalysts. The reaction resulted in the formation of hydrogenated fullerenes, C60Hx. Upon extended hydrogen treatment, the fullerene structure fragmented and collapsed. This outcome shows that it is possible to break down fullerenes stepwise into smaller cup-like molecules, which are stabilized by hydrogen atoms. This is a structure that was previously difficult to achieve.\n\n\"With this method, we should be able to use fullerenes as a relatively inexpensive source material for creating new molecules that hopefully would retain interesting properties from the original carbon nano-material,\" says Serhihy Luzan.\n\nHydrogenated graphene (graphane) is expected to be an ideal material for new carbon-based electronics, but graphane is difficult to synthesize by a direct reaction between graphene and hydrogen. It is much easier first to hydrogenate carbon nanotubes and then to cut them along the tube axis into so-called nanoribbons, which have hydrogen covalently bonded to the surface.\n\nLuzan's experiments showed that the reaction between single-wall carbon nanotubes and hydrogen is possible if a suitable catalyst is used, and he was able to observe that some of the nanotubes were converted to graphene or graphane nanoribbons.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- An international research team has discovered a new method to produce belts of graphene called nanoribbons. By using hydrogen, they have managed to unzip single-walled carbon nanotubes.

The production of hydrogen, a fuel with remarkable properties, through sunlight-driven water splitting appears to be a promising and appealing solution. While the active sites of enzymes involved in the overall water-splitting process in natural systems, namely hydrogenases and photosystem II, use iron, nickel, and manganese ions, cobalt has emerged in the past five years as the most versatile non-noble metal for the development of synthetic H2- and O2-evolving catalysts.

      "text": "(Phys.org) -- By taking advantage of graphene's favorable electrical and optical properties, and then adding an organic dopant, researchers have achieved the highest power conversion efficiency yet for a graphene-based solar cell. The 1.9% power conversion efficiency of the undoped devices increases by more than four times to 8.6% after doping.\n\nThe researchers, led by Sefaattin Tongay and Arthur F. Hebard at the University of Florida in Gainesville, have published their study on the high-efficiency graphene solar cells in a recent issue of Nano Letters.\n\n\"Here, not only we have taken advantage of graphene's beautiful optical transparency, but also we have reduced graphene's electrical resistance by adjusting the Fermi level of graphene using a cheap and environmentally stable organic coating layer,\" Tongay told Phys.org. \"During this step, Nature favored us by yielding a higher rectification and electric field at the interface, further improving the solar cell's efficiency.\"\n\nIn the new solar cells, a single layer of graphene placed on top of a silicon wafer serves as a Schottky junction, the main component of simple photovoltaic devices called Schottky junction solar cells.\n\nUnder illumination, electron-hole pairs are photogenerated in the silicon. The photogenerated electrons and holes are separated by the Schottky junction's built-in electric potential and collected by the oppositely charged graphene and semiconductor contacts. This one-way flow of current (electrons flowing in one direction and holes in the other) is a defining property of the Schottky junction and enables the generation of power from the device.\n\nWhile graphene-based Schottky junction solar cells have been demonstrated in the past, here the researchers took an extra step and doped the graphene with the organic chemical TFSA using a simple spin-casting method.\n\nDoping allowed the researchers to adjust graphene's Fermi level (a measure of electron potential energy), which resulted in two changes that improved the solar cells' overall efficiency: a reduction in the graphene's resistance and an increase in the solar cell's built-in potential, which leads to a more efficient separation of the electron-hole pairs generated by the absorbed photons.\n\nWith their 8.6% efficiency, the doped devices provide a significant efficiency improvement over other graphene-based Schottky junction solar cells, which have so far demonstrated power conversion efficiencies ranging from 0.1% to 2.86%.\n\nCompared with Schottky junction solar cells that use indium tin oxide, those that use graphene have several advantages. For instance, the ability to tune graphene's properties enables researchers to optimize solar cell efficiency and use the graphene layer on other semiconductors besides silicon.\n\nThe researchers hope that the methods used here, which are simple and scalable, can lead to further device improvements and practical applications in the future.\n\n\"We expect that the efficiency can be further improved by engineering the interface, using different organic coating layers yielding higher doping effects, improving the graphene quality and graphene transfer procedure, using anti-reflection layers, and numerous other methods known by the solar cell community,\" Tongay said. \"This is just a beginning.\"\n\nHebard added that further discoveries of graphene physics should lead to more efficient and inexpensive solar cells.\n\n\"Our described power conversion efficiency increase with the simple application of a stable organic overlayer is just a beginning,\" he said. \"Graphene and its derivatives continue to surprise us with unusual properties (strength, flexibility, diffusion barrier, tunable Fermi energy, linear electronic spectrum, etc). Further advances will come with a deeper understanding of the physics of how incoming photons efficiently create electrons and holes, which are then separated and collected in our described configuration. This knowledge should be applicable to finding alternative substrates to silicon (organics and polymers come to mind), which are less expensive and can be applied to large areas.\n\n\"It's clear that research on graphene and its derivatives is already in the sunlight; we expect that our work on solar cells will keep it there.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nForty times stronger than steel and conducting electricity ten times better than silicon, graphene is the wonder material that could one day replace silicon in microchips.

Reporting in the journal Nanoscale, the team said nanowires, which are made from abundant natural materials like silicon and zinc oxide, also offer a cheap way to deliver hydrogen fuel on a mass scale.\n\n\"This is a clean way to generate clean fuel,\" said Deli Wang, professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering.\n\nThe trees' vertical structure and branches are keys to capturing the maximum amount of solar energy, according to Wang. That's because the vertical structure of trees grabs and adsorbs light while flat surfaces simply reflect it, Wang said, adding that it is also similar to retinal photoreceptor cells in the human eye. In images of Earth from space, light reflects off of flat surfaces such as the ocean or deserts, while forests appear darker.\n\nWang's team has mimicked this structure in their \"3D branched nanowire array\" which uses a process called photoelectrochemical water-splitting to produce hydrogen gas. Water splitting refers to the process of separating water into oxygen and hydrogen in order to extract hydrogen gas to be used as fuel. This process uses clean energy with no green-house gas byproduct. By comparison, the current conventional way of producing hydrogen relies on electricity from fossil fuels\n\nBy harvesting more sun light using the vertical nanotree structure, Wang's team has developed a way to produce more hydrogen fuel efficiently compared to planar counterparts where light is simply reflected off the surface. Image Credit: Wang Research Group, UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering.\n\n\"Hydrogen is considered to be clean fuel compared to fossil fuel because there is no carbon emission, but the hydrogen currently used is not generated cleanly,\" said Ke Sun, a PhD student in electrical engineering who led the project.\n\nBy harvesting more sun light using the vertical nanotree structure, Wang's team has developed a way to produce more hydrogen fuel efficiently compared to planar counterparts. Wang is also affiliated with the California Institute of Telecommunications and Information Technology and the Material Science and Engineering Program at UC San Diego.\n\nThe vertical branch structure also maximizes hydrogen gas output, said Sun. For example, on the flat wide surface of a pot of boiling water, bubbles must become large to come to the surface. In the nanotree structure, very small gas bubbles of hydrogen can be extracted much faster. \"Moreover, with this structure, we have enhanced, by at least 400,000 times, the surface area for chemical reactions,\" said Sun.\n\nIn this experiment, nanotree electrodes are submersed in water and illuminated by simulated sun light to measure electricity output of the device. Photo Credit: Joshua Knoff, UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering.\n\nIn the long run, what Wang's team is aiming for is even bigger: artificial photosynthesis. In photosynthesis, as plants absorb sunlight they also collect carbon dioxide (CO2) and water from the atmosphere to create carbohydrates to fuel their own growth. Wang's team hopes to mimic this process to also capture CO2 from the atmosphere, reducing carbon emissions, and convert it into hydrocarbon fuel.\n\n\"We are trying to mimic what the plant does to convert sunlight to energy,\" said Sun. \"We are hoping in the near future our 'nanotree' structure can eventually be part of an efficient device that functions like a real tree for photosynthesis.\"\n\nThe team is also studying alternatives to zinc oxide, which absorbs the sun's ultraviolet light, but has stability issues that affect the lifetime usage of the nanotree structure.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- In a move that demonstrates Apple's determination to create an ever lighter Macbook that is also more environmentally friendly, the company has applied for two different patents that ...\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Hydrogen fuel cells, in which the chemical energy of hydrogen is converted into electricity, offer the potential for a wide variety of applications, especially in transportation and power ...\n\nWorking with the Universities of East Anglia, York and Nottingham and using nanotechnology 100,000 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair, the researchers are working on harnessing the vast energy of the Sun to"

This has been achieved by applying atomic layer coating. The results advance the development of devices that require high sensitivity light response such as high efficiency solar cells.\n\nThis method provides extremely good surface passivation. Simultaneously, it reduces the reflectance further at all wavelengths.These results are very promising considering the use of black silicon (b-Si) surfaces on solar cells to increase the efficiency to completely new levels, tells researcher scientist.\n\nMore effective surface passivation methods than those used in the past have been needed to make black silicon a viable material for commercial applications. Good surface passivation is crucial in photonic applications such as solar cells.

They soaked it in a fluoride solution before drying it and heating it to a high temperature. Oxygen was removed during the baking process to ensure the material didn't burn or catch fire.\n\nOn close inspection using an infrared spectroscopy, the researchers noticed that the fibers within the material had converted from cellulose to activated carbon. However, the material was still flexible enough to wear without breaking.\n\nOnce modified, the material was able to store electricity in the same way as a capacitor. Nanostructured manganese oxide was used on the fabric, which created a supercapacitor. The fabric also performed beyond expectation. It only lost about 5 percent of its performance after being charged and discharged several thousand times.\n\nThe process is environmentally friendly and inexpensive to recreate, making it ideal for an alternative energy source that could one day be used to charge our cell phones.

      "text": "U.S. Department of Energy - Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy\n\nSunShot Initiative\n\nAmorphous Silicon\n\nDOE has a proven track record of funding successes in amorphous silicon (a-Si)research. A list of current projects, summary of the benefits, and discussion on the production and manufacturing of this solar technology are below.\n\nBackground\n\nThin-film a-Si solar cells are commonly known as hydrogenated amorphous silicon, or a-Si:H. Currently, laboratory-scale cells achieve conversion efficiencies of 12.5%, whereas cells manufactured in high-volume processes have efficiencies ranging from 6% to 9%. Although these efficiencies are significantly lower than those of crystalline silicon solar cells, these thin-film cells are lighter, more flexible, and less expensive to produce. Amorphous silicon solar cells represented about 3% of the 2011 world market.\n\nResearch Directions\n\nThe efficiency of amorphous silicon solar cells decreases rapidly on its first exposure to sunlight, reaching a relatively steady state after about 1,000 hours of illumination. This phenomenon, first described in 1977 by D.L. Staebler and C.R. Wronski, results from the creation of additional dangling bonds that act as recombination centers.\n\nCurrent research is focused on improving thin-film quality and reducing the Staebler-Wronski effect, by improved manufacturing techniques, as well as developing thin, flexible, waterproof roof shingles.\n\nLearn more about the DOE SunShot awardees and the projects involving amorphous silicon below.\n\nBenefits\n\nLess material: Amorphous silicon is a direct-bandgap material, which means that less silicon is needed for a-Si cells.\n\nInexpensive substrates: Amorphous silicon can be deposited on inexpensive substrates, such as glass, stainless steel, or even plastic (compared to bulk silicon wafers), which lowers costs.\n\nManufacturing options: Amorphous silicon can be deposited at temperatures below 300°C, making it a good candidate for flexible substrates and roll-to-roll manufacturing processes.\n\nProduction\n\nBy nature, amorphous silicon contains numerous crystal defects and requires hydrogen atoms to passivate the intrinsically high concentration of dangling bonds. Doping is detrimental to the quality of the absorber layer because it may lead to silicon dangling bonds—and therefore, to recombination centers. The minority-carrier diffusion lengths are only about 0.1 micrometer and amorphous silicon has a low carrier mobility; therefore, diffusion alone does not provide sufficient carrier collection. To increase the carrier collection, the concept of the \"p-i-n solar cell\" was introduced by Carlson and Wronski in 1976. The p-i-n structure generates an electric field across the thicker intrinsic (i) layer of the device, which possesses the best characteristics for absorption, photogeneration, and carrier lifetime. Carrier collection across the intrinsic region is via a drift mechanism—i.e., assisted by the electric field.\n\nThe most efficient commercial amorphous silicon PV cells are typically produced by silane-based glow discharge induced by radio-frequency (RF) voltages, or plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition (PECVD), with other gases added for doping and alloying. The silane decomposes spontaneously at temperatures above 450°C, forming polycrystalline silicon. The concentration of hydrogen in silane can be used to control the growth of the material. Although there are multiple methods of producing amorphous silicon, such as hot-wire glow-discharge deposition and indirect microwave deposition, the most-common method remains RF PECVD."

Drivers still feel skittish about the idea of setting out on longer trips on batteries lasting too few miles and then losing time seeking a recharge. New developments in battery research may brighten the picture somewhat.\n\nEyes are trained on researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, because they are doing research that may influence battery design.\n\nPaul Braun, a professor of material science and engineering, working with graduate student Xindi Yu and postdoctoral researcher Huigang Zhang, has come up with a 3-D nanostructure for battery cathodes. The result is a battery that can charge and discharge rapidly without compromising energy-storage capacity. Carry that into car talk, and it means a kind of battery that can be charged in as little time as it takes to fill up a car at a gas station. As important, the rapid charge and discharge method does nothing to diminish the battery capacity.\n\nDrivers, if empowered with a five-minute charge capability, would think of the task of charging in the same way they would an internal combustion engine, said Braun. \"You would just pull up to a charging station and fill up.\"\n\nThe battery looks like a normal battery but the difference is inside. Braun and team wrapped a thin film into a 3-D structure and achieved high active volume and large current. Battery electrodes charged and discharged in a few seconds--ten to 100 times faster than equivalent bulk electrodes, in their demonstrations, but can perform normally in existing devices. Besides use in vehicles, the fast-charge battery design might also be useful in medical devices, lasers and military applications.\n\nUniversity of Illinois describes their process in more detail: They start off by coating a surface with tiny spheres and then pack them tightly into a lattice structure. The space between and around the spheres is filled with metal. Melting the spheres results in a spongelike 3-D scaffolding. The next step is electropolishing, a process that etches away the scaffold's surface, to enlarge the pores and make an open framework. The frame is coated with a thin film of the active material.\n\n\"The result is a bicontinuous electrode structure with small interconnects, so the lithium ions can move rapidly; a thin film active material, so the diffusion kinetics are rapid; and a metal framework with good electrical conductivity.\"\n\nThe group demonstrated both NiMH and Li-ion batteries, but any battery material, Braun said, that can be deposited on the metal frame can be used.\n\nAs such, Braun's work is not focused on pushing any specific battery product forward. \"This is not linked to one very specific kind of battery, but rather it's a new paradigm in thinking about a battery in three dimensions for enhancing properties,\" he said. The work has been supported by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and Department of Energy.PhysOrg.com) -- Researchers at MIT have designed a new battery that can recharge devices about 100 times faster than conventional lithium ion batteries. The design could lead to electric car batteries thatI must not be following these things closely enough, I thought this type of construction was old hat. So there is a benefit to this over using metalic foams for scaffolding ? And why do they use spheres ? If surface area is the main concern ,why not something that allows closer packing like truncated octahedrons ?\n\nSo there is a benefit to this over using metalic foams for scaffolding ? And why do they use spheres ? If surface area is the main concern ,why not something that allows closer packing like truncated octahedrons ?\n\nResearch! These people are finding out what nature allows, not designing a finished product! They may well get around to octahedrons and other fun shapes, but spheres are easy to make, unlike foams they have a consistent size, and they stack naturally in a geometric lattice.\n\nWhat I like is they're using well known industrial processes. That means other teams can use this technique to test other materials. Good progress.\n\nI think the methods for creating the spheres would need to be vastly different. The melting charactaristics of the sulphur-infused nanotubes would be utterly different.\n\nWith that in mind, I wonder if the tubes could be immersed in sulphur non-reactive medium(bath) whereby fluid tensions could curl them up into spheres around the sulphur during preproduction. What kind of medium and coditions could we use to get the desired affect? Any ideas"

The research demonstrated a new type of atomic force microscopy that can 'see' down into a working organic photovoltaic cell and relate its three-dimensional nanoscale structure to its performance.\n\nPhotovoltaic solar cells have become a much more common sight over recent years, often installed on rooftops where they quietly convert sunlight into clean electricity for homes and businesses.\n\nAn organic photovoltaic cell is a type of solar cell that uses organic (carbon-based) electronics and could potentially be a cheaper, more efficient and flexible alternative to today's photovoltaic systems. The technology is on the verge of commercialisation but several obstacles remain, including a necessary increase in performance.\n\nMany recent advances have occurred due to recognition of the pivotal role that morphology plays in efficiency, but it was previously difficult to measure exactly how form and structure affect electrical characteristics and therefore performance.\n\nThis research demonstrated that it is possible to obtain structural and electrical information, both on the surface and below the surface to a depth of at least 20 nanometres in operating organic solar cells. The new measurement method is based on a technique called photoconducting atomic force microscopy (pc-AFM) that uses a nanoscale probe to measure topography and photocurrent generation at the same time.\n\nThis technique can provide direct correlation between the nanometre scale morphology of a working organic solar cell and its performance characteristics.\n\nThis breakthrough will improve understanding of the technology, allowing manufacturers to improve the efficiency of their products by optimising the nanometre scale structure of the organic photovoltaic material.\n\nThe work has benefited from strong links with Imperial College London, who contributed with their material and device fabrication expertise.(PhysOrg.com) -- Fabricating photovoltaic devices – those that convert sunlight into electricity – out of organic materials has several advantages over using non-organic materials, such as flexibilityIn the solar energy field researchers are using the latest developments in nanotechnology to work on very small solar cells.

Currently, on average, solar panels convert only about 15% of the sunlight hitting them into power.\n\nHowever, additional investments in research will quickly get us to where we have to be. We already have the inklings as to where that is. Read on:\n\n\"Quantum dots have the potential to change the world. They are a form of solar cell that is completely beyond anything you might imagine. Traditional solar cells produce electricity in a unique way. When the sunlight hits material in the cell, the material kicks off an electron and the charge is the electricity. Quantum dots work the same way, but they produce three electrons for every photon of sunlight that hits the dots. The dots also catch more spectrums of the sunlight waves, thus increasing conversion efficiency to as high as 65 percent, a stunning figure.\n\nThe really interesting thing about quantum dots is they do not require big, bulk solar panels to work. Researchers are combing the dots with liquid polymers. In practical terms, this means they can be sprayed onto any surface. This literally means that anything painted can act as a solar cell. Think about that. In the near future, you will be able to go solar by just repainting your house. Hybrid cars will be revolutionized, so will your mobile phone. On a cold day, you can put on a coat and gloves that are heated by the solar cells imbedded in their surfaces. The scope of this breakthrough is as breathless as it is unlimited.\"\n\nWhen my kids were very little, they used to walk to school. When it was very cold outside, I gave them a headstart in staying warm by putting their coats in the dryer for a few minutes so when they put them on, they were all toasty. But the heat soon ran out. Imagine putting your kid in a coat covered with quantum dots! They could play outside in the snow (assuming we ever get snow again in Baltimore, and assuming they dust the snow off every now and then so it is exposed to the light), and never get cold!\n\nFor more information about this and other inventive technologies that will save the world, check out their site:\n\nThursday, January 15, 2009\n\ngood energy from eilat\n\nFrom February 17-19, 2009, Israel will host an international conference (in Eilat) that is expected to attract 1000 people from around the world, all gathering to talk about, and advance, the latest renewable energy technologies, not least of which is solar energy.\n\nIn addition to bringing together inventors, venture capitalists, government officials, businessfolk and more, this conference will launch the US-Israeli Energy Cooperation Act, passed two years ago by the US Congress. This act promises $20 million to promote the R&D of renewal energy. This is a triple-winner: good for the environment, good for the economy, and good for US-Israel relations.\n\nSunday, January 4, 2009\n\nThe latest sunrise\n\nToday is the latest sunrise of the year. 7:27 am Baltimore time. Not nice. It feels pretty dismal when you wake up around 6:00 or 6:30 am all ready to embrace the day, and you can't even find your slippers. The night still hangs heavy on the air. Some schools are beginning their work days just as the sun peeks over the houses, trees and hills. Surely some folks would like to argue that they shouldn't have to bare their shiny bodies to the world before the sun bares hers.\n\nThe good news, though, is that today (in daylight hours) is 51 seconds longer than the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year. We will enjoy a whopping 9h 30m 21s of daylight today, to be precise.\n\nThe longest day of the year around here - may it come soon! - is a full five hours longer - running 14 hours and 56 minutes and 21 seconds. As if to reward us for drudging through the dreary darkness, this year at least we actually get TWO days of this length: June 20 and June 21.\n\nI am paying particular attention to the sun this year for two reasons: it seems that Seasonal Affect Disorder - or at least its younger cousin SLOTH (Seasonal Lethargy Or someTHing) has settled in for the duration of winter. So every additional second of sunlight is scooped up and cherished.\n\nAnd this year is, as I have said before and will no doubt say again, The Year of the Sun, the year in which we get to celebrate Birkat Hahammah, the once-in-28-years celebration of the sun.\n\nI am bound and determined to learn more about the sun, and do more to invigorate the world with the energy from the sun, than I have in the past.\n\nIf you too want to track the comings and goings of the miraculous gift of the sun, you can check it out at \n\nThis helpful website gives you the sunrise, sunset, noon time and things I cannot understand, like the azimuth, different twilights and more.\n\nAnd if you want to help the sun help heal the earth, plant a tree, visit  and get all your friends to do the same and adopt some of the projects you read about there.\n\nLearn about renewable energy and how we can move the world to embrace it (Israel is heavy into solar technology research. Japan and China are hopping on board - America cannot afford to be left behind). You can find lots of information by searching the web or coming back here for updates."

This is fantastic news for smart implants seeking to use the\nbody's own movements to power their connection to the nervous system. But, the\nnews is tempered with the possibility of serious health concerns.\n\nThe piezoelectric capabilities were discovered by researchers at Northwestern\nUniversity in the US, whilst searching specifically for potential power sources\nfor smart prosthetics and deep brain implants – devices which connect to\nthe electrical impulses of either the central nervous system (brain) or the\nperipheral nervous system (everything else).\n\nBecause these devices send and receive the body's electrical control data,\nthey need to have sufficient power to decrypt the signals and send the appropriate\nresponses back. If they can use the body they are attached to for their power,\nit avoids the messy problem of relying on batteries which have to be surgically\nreplaced every few years.\n\nThe polymers are essentially a mesh of chains that break down over time from\nstretching and squashing – the very same actions that produce electrical\nenergy. Every time the polymer is squeezed, the pressure has a chance of breaking\nchemical bonds inside the chain. When this occurs, free radicals – ions\nwith unpaired electrons – are released. Released deep inside the body,\nfree radicals are a nightmare They severely damage organic tissue, triggering\npremature ageing and many cancers.\n\nSo, they are not really suitable as an energy source for smart prosthetics.\nUnfortunately, this research comes too late in a way, as polymer chains are\nalready used in ordinary dumb prosthetics in several applications. Not suitable\nfor joints, silicon polymers are used in cosmetic surgery for things such as\nbreast implants and face lifts.\n\nThe researchers demonstrated that radicals from compressed polymers generate\nsignificant amounts of energy that can be used to power chemical reactions in\nwater. This energy has typically been unused but now can be harnessed when polymers\nare under stress in ordinary circumstances - as in shoe soles, car tires or\nwhen compacting plastic bags.\n\nHowever, at the same time, they discovered the silicone polymer releases a\nlarge quantity of harmful free radicals when the polymer is under only a moderate\namount of pressure. It doesn't necessarily mean that the polymer is unsuitable\nfor a power source, but it does mean a way of containing the free radicals emitted\nneeds to be found. Worse, it does mean that those already implanted – typically\nin the soft flesh of the body – are potentially a very real health risk to those\nwith them.\n\nA group of standard silicone implants for breast prosthetics. Regardless\nof what they are filled with, the outside of the forms are made of silicon\npolymer - which releases free radicals when it is deformed. Silicon polymer\nis also used in many other ares where the body will deform naturally.\n\n\"We have established that polymers under stress create free radicals with\noverall efficiencies of up to 30 percent and shoot the radicals out into the\nsurrounding medium where they can drive chemical reactions,\" said Bartosz\nA. Grzybowski, an author of the paper and the Kenneth Burgess Professor of Physical\nChemistry and Chemical Systems Engineering. \"These radicals can be useful\nor they can be harmful, depending on the situation.\"\n\nGrzybowski and his team are the first to use this energy to drive chemical\nreactions by simply surrounding the compressed polymer with water containing\ndesired reagents. The radicals created in the polymer migrate toward the polymer/water\ninterface where they produce hydrogen peroxide, which then can drive chemical\nprocesses.\n\n\"You can get a surprisingly large amount of chemical energy from a polymer\nunder compression,\" Grzybowski said. \"This energy is, in a sense,\nfree for the taking. Under normal circumstances, the energy is virtually never\nretrieved from deformed polymers, which then age unproductively. But you could\nrecharge a battery from the energy produced by walking or driving a car. \"\n\nHowever, the free radical problem in generatinbg this much energy is significant.\nThe researchers confirmed that mechanical deformation -- moderate squeezing\n-- created free radicals in the polymers. They also determined the number of\nradicals produced in a polymer under pressure is approximately 1016 (10 to the\n16th) radicals per cubic centimeter of polymer.\n\nThey next filled polymer tubes with water, squeezed the tubes and measured\nthe total number of radicals that migrated into the surrounding solution. They\nfound that nearly 80 percent of the radicals made the trip.\n\nTo illustrate the process, they converted a Nike Air LeBron shoe into a \"lightning\nshoe,\" where the air pockets in the polymeric sole are filled with a solution\nof a compound that lights up in the presence of radicals. After a person walked\nin the shoe for 30 minutes or more, enough radicals were created to generate\na blue glow visible to the naked eye.\n\nThe researchers studied seven different polymers, including a number of particular\npublic interest. Poly(dimethylsiloxane), a silicon-based material commonly used\nin medical implants, was but one of them. In the lab experiments, the medium\nsurrounding the polymer and the amount of pressure exerted on the material were\nsimilar to what would be found in the human body, Grzybowski pointed out.\n\n\"Our findings are somewhat worrisome since every polymeric implant in\nthe human body experiences mechanical stresses and, as we now know, can produce\nharmful free radicals and liberate them into surrounding tissues, which may\ncontribute to diseases such as cancer, stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes\nand other major disorders,\" Grzybowski said. \"With this knowledge,\nI am quite happy to have a metal implant in my knee, rather than a polymer implant."

These technologies present a distinct advantage over photovoltaic (PV) cells in their ability to store the sun's energy as thermal energy, experts say\n\nResearchers have developed a ground-breaking way to make new affordable and efficient catalysts for converting electricity into chemical energy.

Such energy is clean and renewable, but it's available only when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing.\n\nScientists have designed an entirely new form of cooling panel that works even when the sun is shining. Such a panel could vastly improve the daylight cooling of buildings, cars and other structures by radiating sunlight back into the chilly vacuum of space.\n\nUsing a highly sensitive method of measurement, physicists have managed to localize defects in amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cells.

Sony has just come up with a battery that does the same thing: feed it shredded paper or cardboard, and it produces enough electricity to run an MP3 player.\n\nWhat Sony has come up with (actually, they've been refining it for years now) is a thin sheet of material called a \"bio-battery.\" The basic design uses an enzyme to break down sugar and turn it into hydrogen ions and electrons, creating an electric current and water. Bio-batteries like these can run on all kinds of things, from soda to fruit juice, but the problem is that all of these sugary liquids are just so tasty, and given the choice, most people can't help just drinking their battery power and not powering their batteries with it.\n\nOkay, so yeah, that's not the problem at all.\n\nStill, it would be a lot more useful to power a battery with something that's not as tasty or useful as fruit juice, which is why Sony has added another enzyme into the mix that can break down cellulose into sugar. Cellulose is made of long chains of glucose (sugar), and it forms the cell walls of most green plants. Cardboard and paper are both made of cellulose, but breaking those glucose chains down into usable bits is tough to do. The human digestion can't do it, but termites can, and so can Sony's pet enzymes.\n\nAll it takes to power this bio-battery, then, is a bunch of chopped up cardboard immersed in a solution of water and different types of enzymes. The first enzyme breaks the cellulose in the cardboard into glucose, which the second enzyme then eats to produce electricity. It's basically a little digestive tract that eats used paper products and poops out electrons and water, without relying on any heavy metals or chemicals or anything. Sounds too good to be true, and it almost is: as a proof of concept this technology is undeniably impressive, but it's going to be a while before bio-batteries like these output enough power to be useful as much more than novelties."

Even more unknown is the fact that fuel cells were and continue to be a source of drinking water for astronauts in orbit, since they produce pure water as a by-product.\n\nNASA is recognized for providing fuel cell technology with the initial research and development it required for safe, efficient use within other applications. Fuel cells have garnered a great deal of attention as clean energy converters, free of harmful emissions, since being adopted by the Space Program. Along with automobile manufacturers, universities, national laboratories, and private companies of all sizes have tapped into this technology.\n\nWhile the primary fuel source for a fuel cell is hydrogen, there are several different types of fuel cells, each having different energy conversion efficiencies. Alkaline Fuel Cells (AFCs), which use a solution of potassium hydroxide in water as their electrolyte, were one of the first classes of fuel cells developed and are still depended upon during Space Shuttle missions. Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells (PAFCs), considered the most commercially developed fuel cells, are used in hospitals, hotels, and offices, and as the means of propulsion for large vehicles such as buses. Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) are similar to PAFCs in that they are acid-based (although the acid is in the form of a proton exchange membrane), but they operate at lower temperatures (about 170 ºF, compared to 370 ºF) and have a higher power density.\n\nMolten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFCs) operate at high temperatures (1,300 ºF) to achieve sufficient conductivity. Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs), like MCFCs, operate at high temperatures (2,000 ºF), but are more ideal for using waste heat to generate steam for space heating,\nindustrial processing, or in a steam turbine to create more electricity.\nLastly, Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs) use methanol directly as\na reducing agent to produce electrical energy, eliminating the need\nfor a fuel processor, thus increasing the possibilities for a lighter,\nless expensive fuel cell engine.\n\nDevelopers of the various fuel cell technologies require advanced, fully automated, computer-controlled test equipment to determine the performance of fuel cell components, such as electrocatalysts, proton exchange membranes, and bipolar plates, as well as fuel cell stacks and fuel cell power systems. Since 2001, Lynntech Industries, Ltd., an affiliate of College Station, Texas-based Lynntech, Inc., has been manufacturing and selling a complete range of fuel cell test systems worldwide to satisfy customers' demands in this rapidly growing market.\n\nThe fuel cell test equipment was invented by Lynntech, Inc., in the early-to-mid 1990s, with funding for design, fabrication, and testing stemming from a Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract with NASA's Glenn Research Center. Glenn awarded the company the SBIR with the intent of utilizing the resulting technology to strengthen NASA's Reusable Launch Vehicle and Space Power programs. First year commercial sales of the fuel cell test equipment were in excess of $750,000, verifying NASA's expense as a sound investment. The test system arising from the work with Glenn has been patented by Lynntech, Inc., and continues to be upgraded to meet current standards.\n\nLynntech Industries' testing system comes equipped with software called FCPower,™ declared by the\ncompany as the most powerful and flexible program for testing in the industry. FCPower enables plug-and-play recognition of hardware, multiple levels of user control, complete automation of configuration and testing, customizable display, and data acquisition and exporting. Even more, the software incorporates safety features that allow for combustible gas monitoring and automatic shutdown of instruments and fuel supply lines.\n\nIt remains uncertain when exactly the average consumer will be able to fully appreciate the impact that fuel cells are making to preserve the environment, but Lynntech, Inc., and Lynntech Industries are in position to bring this moment of realization one step closer to reality.\n\nFCPower™ is a trademark of Lynntech Industries, Ltd.\nFlightweight™ is a trademark of Lynntech, Inc."

But scientists might have finally managed to create a nanomaterial capable of breaking water down into hydrogen and oxygen using common, easily obtained metals.\n\nWater does not like to be broken apart. We can do it, but the two most common methods either release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere or requires platinum, a rare earth metal that there just isn't that much of on this planet.\n\nLiquid water and ice structures\n\nPlatinum acts as a catalyst for the water. When a current is run through it, hydrogen can be liberated from the atomic structure that holds it in place. It is also very rare. The new nanomaterial, meanwhile, can do it using only common metals. It uses nickel, using an arrangement that makes the nickel act similarly to how platinum does. That makes the entire process cheaper and less energy intensive.\n\nThe breakthrough is thanks to the US Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory. They developed a novel electrocatalyst that can break apart water with very little energy. Actually, the scientists who developed the material were surprised at just how efficient the entire process was. Said the scientist who originally conceived of the idea behind the material, Brookhaven Lab chemist Kotaro Sasaki:\n\n\"We wanted to design an optimal catalyst with high activity and low costs that could generate hydrogen as a high-density, clean energy source. We discovered this exciting compound that actually outperformed our expectations.\"\n\nHydrogen is an ideal energy source. It is readily available in water, one of the most plentiful compounds on our planet. But in order to make hydrogen fuel worthwhile, the energy that goes into liberating it from the water has to be as low as possible. Before this nanomaterial, the return on energy investment has been nearly 1 to 1. This material could change everything."

The new screening assessments, the latest in a series of initiatives by Prime Minister Stephen Harper's administration seen as weakening environmental regulation, give an increased role in environmental oversight and enforcement to provinces. Speaking to the Vancouver Sun, a spokesperson for the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency said that the \"numerous small, routine projects… posed little or no risk to the environment.\" But Canadian environmental advocates warn that a reduced federal role in monitoring these hundreds of projects will ultimately place the province's environment, particularly fish habitat, at increased risk. \"The cumulative impacts of all the projects that they will no longer review will be great and it will take a few years for Canadians to appreciate that,\" said Otto Langer, a former official with the federal fisheries department. PERMALINK\n\nenergy cheaper and more sustainable. Speaking at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society, a team of researchers described advances in solar cells made with abundant metals, such as copper and zinc. While the market already offers solar shingles that convert the sun's energy into electricity, producers typically must use elements that are scarce and expensive, such as indium and gallium. According to Harry A. Atwater, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology, recent tests suggest that materials like zinc phosphide and copper oxide could be capable of producing electricity at prices competitive with coal-fired power plants within two decades. With China accounting for more than 90 percent of the world's rare-earth supplies, companies and nations are racing to find new sources of rare earth minerals, which are used in everything from solar panels to smart phones. PERMALINK\n\nthere should at least be a scientific debate over the possibilities of so-called cloud brightening, a process that involves sending particles, in this case sea water, into the atmosphere to create clouds that would, theoretically, reflect a greater amount of sunlight back into space. While ethical and political questions remain about such geoengineering schemes, that is no reason to not test the technology, said Rob Wood, a University of Washington physicist and one of the paper's authors. In the paper, the scientists suggest a small-scale test in which salt water is sprayed from a ship or barge followed by airborne measurements of the physical and chemical characteristics of the resulting clouds. PERMALINK\n\nA team of scientists is working with the Starbucks coffee chain to develop a bio-refinery process that would convert the company's discarded coffee grounds and day-old bakery goods into a key ingredient for making plastics and other products. The process, which will be described at a meeting of the American Chemical Society, builds on existing technology that converts corn, sugar cane, and other plant-based products into the ingredients for biofuels and other consumer products. According to researchers, the process involves blending the bakery waste with a mixture of fungi that breaks down carbohydrates in the food into simple sugars. They are ultimately converted into succinic acid, a material that can be used to make a range of products, including plastics, detergents, and medicines. While most experts say using crops for such purposes would not be sustainable, targeting food waste is an attractive alternative, said Carol S. K.

Coal consumption in Germany has grown by 4.9 percent since Chancellor Angela Merkel announced plans to shift away from nuclear power over the next decade, according to a Bloomberg News report. While German leaders intended the new policy to strengthen the nation's reliance on renewable energy, Germany's largest utilities have built coal plants instead of cleaner-burning natural gas projects because coal plants are cheaper. The collapse of the European Union's carbon permit costs also means that there is little penalty for burning coal. \"Angela Merkel's policy has created an incentive structure which has the effect of partially replacing nuclear with coal, the dirtiest fuel that's responsible for much of the growth in the world's greenhouse-gas emissions since 1990,\" Dieter Helm, an energy policy professor at the University of Oxford told Bloomberg News. PERMALINK\n\nThe Canadian company, TransCanada, has begun construction on the U.S. leg of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, installing segments in east Texas even as the fate of the pipeline's northern leg remains in question. Company officials confirmed that work began Aug. 9 on the section of the pipeline that will run from Oklahoma to Texas, just weeks after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approved the final construction permit. TransCanada, which ultimately hopes to build a pipeline to carry tar sands oil from Alberta to refineries in Texas, has agreed to relocate the northern section of the pipeline after the Obama administration, citing possible threats to Nebraska's ecologically sensitive Sand Hills region, rejected a permit for the entire project. If U.S. officials approve the revised northern section of the pipeline, construction could begin in early 2013, a company spokesman said. Pipeline opponents have already launched protests at construction sites in Texas, and say they will stage future demonstrations in an effort to block the pipeline. PERMALINK\n\nTwo environmental organizations are fighting a Canadian company's plan to mine a massive reserve of oil sands in eastern Utah, saying the project would tax water supplies in what is already the U.S.'s second-driest state. In what would be the U.S.'s first large-scale oil sands mining operation, Calgary-based U.S. Oil Sands Inc. has already excavated a two-acre test mine at site called PR Spring and ultimately hopes to establish a sprawling, 6,000-acre mine as early as 2014. According to the Utah Geological Survey, about 25 billion barrels of bitumen are buried on state and federal land in this region — enough to meet the nation's oil needs for more than three years. But according to a report by Inside Climate News, it remains unclear whether there will be enough groundwater to support the industry long-term — not to mention the water needs of municipalities and private industries nearby. Two groups, Living Rivers and the Western Resource Advocates, are appealing U.S. Oil Sands' mining permit, arguing that the state of Utah ignored the threat to groundwater supplies. According to a letter from the Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining, the mine is expected to use \"116 gallons of water per minute on a 24-hour basis.\" PERMALINK\n\nA Brazilian judge has ordered a suspension of the controversial Belo Monte dam project, saying that local indigenous people who will be affected by the massive hydroelectric project were not sufficiently consulted\n\nDivulgação/Norte Energia\n\nIllustration of the Belo Monte proposal\n\nduring the environmental assessment process.

The plan, unveiled by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, also would not preclude construction of a pipeline on the reserve. Salazar said the plan, which was praised by environmental groups but criticized by oil industry officials, would strike a balance between the nation's energy needs and the protection of wildlife and native Alaskan subsistence culture. \"This will provide a road map to help facilitate the transition from leasing and cautious exploration to production and smart development,\" he told reporters in Anchorage, Alaska. The reserve, located west of oil fields on Alaska's North Slope, is the home to a some of the largest caribou populations on the planet and millions of migratory birds from around the world. The region is also estimated to contain 549 million barrels of recoverable oil and 8.7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and California air quality measurements, the scientists calculated that VOC levels declined by an average of 7.5 percent per year.

According to the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 23 of those quakes occurred within two miles of high-volume injection wells that pump wastewater from controversial hydrofracturing drilling technology deep underground. \"You can't prove that any one earthquake was caused by an injection well,\" Frolich said. \"But it's obvious that wells are enhancing the probability that earthquakes will occur.\" PERMALINK\n\nGetty Images\n\nelectricity demand with renewable sources — including wind, solar, and geothermal — during 2011, up from 17 percent in 2010.

While it's unclear what specifically triggered this week's massive grid failures, which knocked out power in 20 Indian states, government officials accused several northern states of drawing more power from the grid than their allocated amounts. Another factor may have been increased electricity usage caused by unusually high water pumping for irrigation as a result of weak monsoon rains. Experts say the blackouts reveal a fundamental gap between supply and demand in a nation that aspires to be a global economic leader. While India has increased its power capacity more than 35 percent in the last five years, a peak-hour electricity shortfall of about 10 percent exists and hundreds of millions of people in rural areas have no access to electricity.

Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers from the university's Earth Institute argue that the use of technologies to remove emissions at the source — such as at coal-powered plants — will not go far enough because they don't address the transportation sector, which accounts for up to half of global CO2 emissions. In addition, the scientists say that the shift to renewable energy sources will likely not occur fast enough. Technologies that remove CO2 from the atmosphere on a large scale — such as forests of artificial trees or the use of absorbent liquids that extract CO2 — could help avert potentially dangerous warming.

With searing heat and drought conditions only intensifying in July, corn and soybean crops in the U.S. Midwest are suffering badly, threatening to increase food and fuel prices and cut food aid and grain exports from the world's top producer of key crops. \"We're moving from a crisis to a horror story,\" said Purdue University agronomist Tony Vyn. \"I see an increasing number of fields that will produce zero grain.\" The current drought now covers a larger area than the famous 1936 drought, although other droughts in the Dust Bowl years — particularly the extreme drought of 1934 — still rank higher, the NCDC said in a report.

In addition, the EU predicts it would save about 160 million tons of imported oil.

By 2018, the amount of fish raised in aquaculture will exceed the amount caught in the wild for the first time and will account for 52 percent of the total by 2021, the report states.

The thin spherical structure improves light absorption by trapping the light inside the material, creating what are known as optical whispering galleries. Credit: Yan Yao\n\nVisitors to Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol Building may have experienced a curious acoustic feature that allows a person to whisper softly at one side of the cavernous, half-domed room and for another on the other side to hear every syllable. Sound is whisked around the semi-circular perimeter of the room almost without flaw. The phenomenon is known as a whispering gallery.\n\nIn a paper published in Nature Communications, a team of engineers at Stanford describes how it has created tiny hollow spheres of photovoltaic nanocrystalline-silicon and harnessed physics to do for light what circular rooms do for sound. The results, say the engineers, could dramatically reduce materials usage and processing cost.\n\n\"Nanocrystalline-silicon is a great photovoltaic material. It has a high electrical efficiency and is durable in the harsh sun,\" said Shanhui Fan, a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford and co-author of the paper. \"Both have been challenges for other types of thin solar films.\"\n\nThe downfall of nanocrystalline-silicon, however, has been its relative poor absorption of light, which requires thick layering that takes a long time to manufacture.\n\nWhispering galleries\n\nThe engineers call their spheres nanoshells. Producing the shells takes a bit of engineering magic. The researchers first create tiny balls of silica — the same stuff glass is made of — and coat them with a layer of silicon. They then etch away the glass center using hydrofluoric acid that does not affect the silicon, leaving behind the all-important light-sensitive shell. These shells form optical whispering galleries that capture and recirculate the light.\n\n\"The light gets trapped inside the nanoshells,\" said Yi Cui, associate professor of materials science engineering at Stanford and a senior author of the paper. \"It circulates round and round rather than passing through and this is very desirable for solar applications.\"\n\nThe researchers estimate that light circulates around the circumference of the shells a few times during which energy from the light gets absorbed gradually by the silicon. The longer they can keep the light in the material, the better the absorption will be.\n\n\"This is a new approach to broadband light absorption. The use of whispering-gallery resonant modes inside nanoshells is very exciting,\" said Yan Yao, a post-doctoral researcher in the Cui Lab and a co-lead author of the paper. \"It not only can lead to better solar cells, but it can be applied in other areas where efficient light absorption is important, such as solar fuels and photodetectors.\"\n\nThrough thick and thin\n\nIn measuring light absorption in a single layer of nanoshells, the team showed significantly more absorption over a broader spectrum of light than a flat layer of the silicon deposited side-by-side with the nanoshells.\n\n\"The nanometer spherical shells really hit a sweet spot and maximize the absorption efficiency of the film. The shells both allow light to enter the film easily and they trap it so as to enhance the absorption in a way larger-scale counterparts cannot. That is the power of nanotechnology,\" said Jie Yao, a post-doctoral researcher in Cui's lab and co-lead author of the paper.\n\nFurther, by depositing two or even three layers of nanoshells atop one another, the team teased the absorption higher still. With a three-layer structure, they were able to achieve total absorption of 75% of light in certain important ranges of the solar spectrum.\n\nClever structure\n\nHaving demonstrated improved absorption, the engineers went on to show how their clever structure will pay dividends beyond the mere trapping of light.\n\nFirst, nanoshells can be made quickly. \"A micron-thick flat film of solid nanocrystalline-silicon can take a few hours to deposit, while nanoshells achieving similar light absorption take just minutes,\" said Yan.\n\nThe nanoshell structure likewise uses substantially less material, one-twentieth that of solid nanocrystalline-silicon.\n\n\"A twentieth of the material, of course, costs one-twentieth and weighs one-twentieth what a solid layer does,\" said Jie. \"This might allow us to cost effectively produce better-performing solar cells of rare or expensive materials.\"\n\n\"The solar film in our paper is made of relatively abundant silicon, but down the road, the reduction in materials afforded by nanoshells could prove important to scaling up the manufacturing of many types of thin film cells, such as those which use rarer materials like tellurium and indium\" said Vijay Narasimhan, a doctoral candidate in the Cui Lab and co-author of the paper.\n\nFinally, the nanoshells are relatively indifferent to the angle of incoming light and the layers are thin enough that they can bend and twist without damage. These factors might open up an array of new applications in situations where achieving optimal incoming angle of the sun light is not always possible. Imagine solar sails on the high seas or photovoltaic clothing for mountain climbing.\n\n\"This new structure is just the beginning and demonstrates some of exciting potentials for using advanced nanophotonic structures to improve solar cell efficiency,\" said Shanhui Fan.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nSilicon is readily available, easy to process, highly stable and non-toxic. It is also one of the best materials for making solar cells. The high quality and purity of silicon needed for fabricating the most Ultra-thin solar cells can absorb sunlight more efficiently than the thicker, more expensive-to-make silicon cells used today, because light behaves differently at scales around a nanometer, ...\n\nSolar cells are a key technology in the drive toward cleaner energy production. Unfortunately, solar technology is not yet economically competitive and the cost of solar cells needs to be brought down. OneNow this is creative thinking that could show to be quite useful. While they don't share specific frequencies in the spectrum, I'm wondering if the diameter of the shells is pertinent to specific light frequencies. If so then layers of nanoshells of different diameters may be useful for capturing an even broader spectrum researchers"

      "text": "New materials for renewable energy\n\nThe power of being made very small\n\nNano-engineering can produce substances with unique properties that will give renewable energy a boost\n\nBIG improvements in the production of energy, especially from renewable sources, are expected over the coming years. Safer nuclear-power stations, highly efficient solar cells and the ability to extract more energy from the wind and the sea are among the things promised. But important breakthroughs will be needed for these advances to happen, mostly because they require extraordinary new materials.\n\nThe way researchers will construct these materials is now becoming clear. They will engineer them at the nanoscale, where things are measured in billionths of a metre. At such a small size materials can have unique properties. And sometimes these properties can be used to provide desirable features, especially when substances are formed into a composite structure that combines a number of abilities. A series of recent developments shows how great that potential might be.\n\nResearchers have already become much better at understanding how the structure of new nano-engineered materials will behave, although the process remains largely one of trial and error because different samples have to be repeatedly manufactured and tested. Michael Demkowicz of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is developing a model that he hopes will address the problem from a different direction: specifying a set of desired properties and then trying to predict the nanostructures needed to deliver them.\n\nDr Demkowicz is working with a team based at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, one of a number of groups being funded under a new $777m five-year programme by the American government to accelerate research into energy technologies. The material Dr Demkowicz is looking for will be good at resisting damage from radiation. It could be used instead of stainless steel to line a nuclear reactor, which would extend the reactor's working life and allow it to be operated more efficiently by burning a higher percentage of nuclear fuel. At present, says Dr Demkowicz, reactors burn only around 1% of their fuel, so even a modest increase in fuel burn would leave less radioactive waste.\n\nThe reason why the linings of nuclear reactors degrade is that metals can become brittle and weak when they are exposed to radiation. This weakness is caused by defects forming in their crystal-lattice structure, which in turn are caused by high-energy particles such as neutrons bumping into individual atoms and knocking them out of place. When these displaced atoms collide with other atoms, the damage spreads. The result is holes, or \"vacancies\", and \"interstitials\", where additional atoms have squeezed into the structure.\n\nDr Demkowicz says it is possible to design nanocomposites with a structure that resists radiation damage. This is because they can be made to exhibit a sort of healing effect in the areas between their different layers. The thinner these layers are, the more important these interfaces become because they make up more of the total volume of the material. Depending on how the nanocomposites are constructed, both the vacancies and the interstitials get trapped at the interfaces. This means there is a greater chance of their meeting one another, allowing an extra atom to fill a hole and restore the crystal structure. In some conditions the effect can appear to show no radiation damage at all, he adds.\n\nThe ideal nanocomposite would not only resist radiation damage. It would also not itself become radioactive by absorbing neutrons. Dr Demkowicz has used his modelling techniques to come up with some candidates; iron-based ones for fission reactors and tungsten-based ones for those that may one day use nuclear fusion. It could still take years before such materials are approved for use, but the modelling methods will greatly speed up the process.\n\nAcross the spectrum\n\nNano-engineered materials will also play an important role in a more efficient generation of solar cells, according to an exhibition by researchers at Imperial College, London, called \"A Quantum of Sol\", which opened this week at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition, also in London. Again, the desired effects are obtained by using combinations of material produced at extremely small sizes. In this case, they are used to make \"multi-junction\" solar cells, in which each layer captures energy from a particular colour in the spectrum of sunlight. Overall, this is more efficient than a conventional solar cell which converts energy from only part of the spectrum.\n\nWhereas conventional solar cells might turn 20% or so of the energy in sunlight into electricity, multi-junction solar cells already have an efficiency of just over 40% and within a decade that could reach 50%, predicts Ned Ekins-Daukes, a researcher at Imperial. Until nano-engineering costs come down with economies of scale, multi-junction solar cells will remain expensive. The researchers expect that electricity-generation costs can still be cut in the meantime by using mirrors to concentrate sunlight on the cells.\n\nThrough the glass\n\nSolar cells could also be incorporated into the structure of buildings, including windows. Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials are looking for suitable transparent materials to make them. They too are using computer models to explore atomic structures and then to simulate how electrons will behave in them. With the right combination of conductive and transparent material, says Wolfgang Körner, from the German institute, it should be possible to produce completely see-through electronics.\n\nThe nanostructure of composites can also provide great mechanical strength in relatively light materials. Composites such as fibreglass and carbon fibre bonded in a plastic resin are already widely used to replace metal in making, for instance, cars and aircraft. But by controlling the direction and the tension of the fibres during their construction it is possible to produce a morphing composite, which adjusts its shape under certain conditions. The change can be instigated by an external control or it can be automatic, for instance in response to variations in heat, pressure or velocity.\n\nThese morphing composites could be used to produce more efficient turbine blades in wind and tidal generators, a seminar at Bristol University's Advanced Composites Centre for Innovation and Science was told this week. A bistable composite capable of altering its aerodynamic profile rapidly when wind and current conditions changed would help to remove unwanted stresses in the blades. That would increase the efficiency of the blades and extend the working life of the generator systems they power, says Stephen Hallett, a member of the Bristol team. Morphing composites would mean, for instance, that tidal generators could be made smaller and would last longer, which would make them more viable commercially. In this way many tiny changes in the science of materials could generate a big future for renewable energy."

We're losing energy!'\" says Lusk, a Mines physics professor and solar energy researcher, who admits to checking out his panels and their energy output more than most. On a clear day, he explains, only a fraction of the photons hitting the photovoltaic cells on his roof are converted into electricity—the rest bounce off as light or are lost as heat. On a cloudy day, or as dusk approaches, the long-wavelength, low-energy particles of light are scarcely enough to produce any juice at all. On average, just 20 percent of the sun's rays actually get converted to energy in a contemporary solar cell.\n\n\"In terms of efficiency, there is a lot of room for improvement up there,\" he says.\n\nFueled by a six-year, $12 million grant from the National Science Foundation, Lusk and his colleagues at the Renewable Energy Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (REMRSEC) have spent the last four years working to improve that efficiency via a complex merging of nanotechnology, quantum physics and computational wizardry known as \"exciton engineering.\"\n\nThe nascent and controversial field hinges on the manipulation of \"excitons\"—the combination of an excited electron and the hole from which it is dislodged by an incoming photon. In conventional photovoltaic cells, the exchange is generally one-for-one; upon impact, a photon creates an exciton, which sends a highly energized electron racing into an electrical circuit.\n\nTags\n\nRelated News\n\nOne of the leaders of the largest professional society of scientists and engineers in China – who has an interesting historical connection to Colorado School of Mines -- paid a visit to the university Feb. 19.Dr. Cheng...\n\nAs it's often said, the real world can be the best classroom.

(AFPN) -- Air Force Office of Scientific Research officials here recently awarded the University of Washington and three partner universities a grant worth approximately $6 million over five years to study the design of air vehicles capable of collecting and storing solar and heat energies.\n\nThe Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative grant was presented in Seattle at the University of Washington, the lead university for this grant, and UW will collaborate with the University of Colorado, the University of California at Los Angeles and Virginia Polytechnic Institute on the initiative.\n\nOne of the goals of the research is to enhance Air Force air vehicle systems, but there are many potential applications in other areas such as space platforms.\n\n\"While running air vehicles or space platforms, there are presently three main sources for harvesting energy with non-fossil origins -- sunlight, heat and vibration,\" said Dr. B. L. Lee, program manager at AFOSR's Aerospace and Materials Sciences Directorate.\n\nThe source of the heat energy, he said, can be aerodynamic heating caused by high-flying speed or the recycling of waste heat around an aircraft cabin or engine. Each of the three sources, he said, is capable of generating electricity, but sunlight and heat energies show the greatest potential in terms of significant power output. As a result, the proposed research will focus primarily on these two energy sources.\n\nResearchers will explore a variety of topics concerning materials and micro devices associated with so-called photovoltaic energy, or electricity generated from light sources, and thermoelectric energy, or electricity generated from heat sources.\n\nOnce fully developed, these systems may one day enable air vehicles to fly solely on solar energy and aerodynamic heat. The systems may also find applications in cabin operations on commercial airplanes.\n\n\"For integration of energy harvesting and storage devices into air vehicles with minimal increase of weight, we hope to create a new generation of multifunctional materials that can, for example, maintain structural integrity in flight while at the same time serve as energy collectors and storage units,\" Dr. Lee said.\n\nThe goal is challenging because of the interaction of many different disciplines of sciences involved in this study. Another interesting aspect of the research is an enhanced approach to technology development and system integration.\n\n\"Electronics communities are always looking to improve energy-generating efficiencies of devices, while structural communities of mechanical and materials engineers are looking to improve aircraft design in terms of weight and mechanical performance,\" Dr. Lee said.\n\n\"Essentially, our research attempts to do both in a single step,\" he said. \"We consider this a futuristic way of doing business with higher efficiency.\""

In order to find the best alloy Gremaud developed a method which enabled simultaneous testing of thousands of samples of different metals for their capacity to absorb hydrogen. The British company Ilika in Southampton has shown considerable interest.\n\nHydrogen is considered to be a clean and therefore important fuel of the future. This gas can be used directly in cars in an internal combustion engine, like in BMW's hydrogen vehicle, or it can be converted into electrical energy in so-called fuel cells, like in the Citaro buses in service in Amsterdam.\n\nThe major problem of using hydrogen in transport is the secure storage of this highly explosive gas. This can be realised by using metals that absorb the gas. However, a drawback of this approach is that it makes the hydrogen 'tanks' somewhat cumbersome.\n\nThe battery, the competing form of storage for electrical energy, comes off even worse. Driving four hundred kilometres with an electric car, such as the Toyota Prius, would require the car to carry 317 kilos of modern lithium batteries for its journey. With Gremaud's light metal alloy this same distance would require a hydrogen tank of 'only' two hundred kilos. Although this new metal alloy is important for the development of hydrogen as a fuel, the discovery of the holy grail of hydrogen storage is still some way off.\n\nHydrogenography\n\nIn his research Gremaud made use of a technique for measuring the absorbance of hydrogen by metals, based on the phenomenon of 'switchable mirrors' discovered at the VU University Amsterdam. About ten years ago researchers at the VU discovered that certain materials lose their reflection by absorbing hydrogen. This technique became known as hydrogenography, or 'writing with hydrogen'. Using this technique, Gremaud was able to simultaneously analyse the efficacy of thousands of different combinations of the metals magnesium, titanium and nickel. Traditional methods require separate testing for each alloy.\n\nThe analysis requires each of the three metals to be eroded from an individual source and deposited onto a transparent film in a thin layer of 100 nanometres using so-called sputtering deposition. This ensures that the three metals are deposited onto the film in many different ratios. When the film is exposed to different amounts of hydrogen, it is clearly visible, even to the naked eye, which composition of metals is best at absorbing hydrogen.\n\nGremaud is the first to use this method for measuring hydrogen absorption. The British company Ilika in Southampton wants to build a hydrogen analyser using this technique.Given two catalysts for the job of turning intermittent wind or solar energy into chemical fuels, scientists chose the material that gets the job done quickly and uses the least energy.

      "text": "A Brief History of Battery Developments\n\nRelatively abundant and readily recyclable, both Nickel and Zinc offer appealing characteristics for a variety of industrial uses. Independently, both have been used in a number of battery technologies over the years. In fact, a century ago, Thomas Edison recognized the potential of nickel-zinc electrochemistry. He explored its development for use in high power, high energy demand applications such as powering miner's safety lamps. While the low cost, high energy density characteristics were promising, Edison's researchers ultimately settled on alternative electrochemistry that was easier to produce with the technological limitations of the time.\n\nIn more recent times, nickel-cadmium and nickel-metal-hydride chemistries (NiCd and NiMH) have been successfully commercialized and widely used for high demand applications. However, these technologies have reached technological limitations. While existing battery suppliers are taking advantage of their size and position, these technologies have matured and improvements in performance and capacity will be incremental. In addition, increased environmental restrictions are likely to impact their use.\n\nA New Era for Nickel-Zinc\n\nPast barriers to the successful development of a rechargeable NiZn battery have included problems with dendrite formation as well as passivation and shape change of the zinc electrode. PowerGenix has a patented electrolyte formulation that stabilizies the zinc electrode, enabling the cell to match NiCd levels of cycle life.\n\nPowerGenix has further enhanced the performance of the cell with an electrode composition that avoids cobalt contamination of the zinc electrode and a negative cap design which lowers impedance and promotes uniform current density. These improvements have produced a dramatically more powerful and longer lasting cell, ideal for high-rate applications."

      "text": "Energy storage and generation systems\n\nAbstract: ThisHERS) and hydrogen oxidation reactions (HORs) in the same system. This disclosure further relates to energy storage and generation systems having low cost, fast response time, and acceptable life and performance\n\n2. Discussion of the Background Art\n\nThere are several technologies for energy storage and generation. These technologies can be divided into three subgroups: mechanical including pumped hydro, compressed air, fly wheels, and the like; electrical including super capacitors, super conducting magnets, and the like; and electrochemical including batteries, flow batteries, hydrogen storage, and the like. The current technology of electrochemical storage and generation is either expensive or inefficient or both. Generally, batteries can store and supply power at high efficiency, but are limited in capacity (total energy). Also, flow batteries are limited in power density and response time.\n\nFuel cells are often described as continuously operating batteries or as electrochemical engines. A typical fuel cell consists of two electrodes, an anode and a cathode, and a membrane interposed between the anode and cathode. Fuel cells operate by converting fuel combustion energy, such as hydrogen, to electrical power through an electrochemical process. It does so by harnessing the electrons released from controlled oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions occurring at the surface of a catalyst dispersed on the electrodes.\n\nRegenerative fuel cells typically operate in harsh environments that can have an adverse effect on catalyst activity in the fuel cell. An important issue connected to catalyst activity in regenerative fuel cells that utilize, for example, a halogen acid electrolyte, is poisoning of the hydrogen catalyst by the halides. The membrane cannot completely prevent electrolyte crossover from one side of the cell to the other. For example, in a hydrogen tri-bromide fuel cell (HTBFC), bromides, e.g., tri-bromide, diffuse to the hydrogen electrode and poison the catalyst. Despite the fact that hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction is fast and its overpotential is rather low compared to other voltage losses in the regenerative cell, in halogen ion-containing solutions, the catalyst is severely poisoned, and this raises the overpotential of the hydrogen electrode in the regenerative fuel cell.\n\nAcceptance of energy storage and generation technologies depends on their cycle life and performance capability. In particular, with regard to regenerative fuel cells, they can be run, in addition to the direct mode, in the reversible mode, consuming electricity and the products of the direct reaction in order to produce the reactants of the direct reaction. For regenerative fuel cell such as hydrogen/bromine fuel cells, an important factor limiting its cycle life and efficiency is the degradation of the operating fuel cell materials. These materials are exposed to a highly corrosive bromine electrolyte for long periods of time at elevated temperature.\n\nEnergy storage and generation devices are needed for wide application with regenerative energy sources. Such storage and generation devices are useful in matching a varying energy supply to a varying energy demand.\n\nA need exists for energy storage and generation systems that exhibit operational stability in harsh environments, e.g., both charging and discharging reactions in a regenerative fuel cell in the presence of a halogen ion or a mixture of halogen ions. Also, a need exists for energy storage and generation systems that are capable of conducting both hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and hydrogen oxidation reactions (HORs) in the same system. It would be desirable in the art to provide energy storage and generation systems having low cost, e.g., low cost electrolytes, fast response time, and acceptable life and performance.\n\nThe present disclosure provides many advantages, which shall become apparent as described below.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThis disclosure generally in part to an energy storage and generation system comprising at least one vessel suitable for holding an electrolyte, at least one vessel suitable for holding a gas, also relates in part to a energy storage and generation system comprising at least one vessel suitable for holding an electrolyte, at least one vessel suitable for holding a gas, and one or more stacks of regenerative fuel cells comprising a solution or electrolyte compartment, a gas compartment and a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) disposed between the solution or electrolyte compartment and the gas compartment.

The energy storage and generation systems can achieve high power for fuel cell technology—up to 1.5 W/cm2 (at 80° C.), while achieving low cost storage price due to the implementation of low cost electrolytes. The energy storage and generation systems of this disclosure also exhibit fast response time.\n\nThe energy storage and generation systems of this disclosure include an electrolyte circulation loop which comprises one or more valves, one or more pumps, and optionally a pressure equalizing line. The energy storage and generation systems of this disclosure also include a gas circulation loop which comprises one or more valves, one or more pumps, a gas purifier, a liquid absorber, a gas circulation ejector, and optionally a gas compressor.\n\nThe energy storage and generation systems of this disclosure can include a management system. The management system may be any suitable controller device, such as a computer or microprocessor, and preferably contains logic circuitry which decides how to operate the various valves, pumps, circulation loops, and the like.\n\nFIG. 1 illustrates a process block diagram of the energy storage and generation system of this disclosure. The system is divided into two sides, i.e., an electrolyte side 10 and a gas, i.e., hydrogen, side 15. The fuel cell stacks 20 are located between the reactants. The electrolyte side 10 consists of electrolyte tank 25 and an electrolyte circulation pump 30. The pump 30 circulates the liquid electrolyte through the fuel cell stack 20 during energy storage stage and during energy generation stage. The hydrogen side 15 consists of a hydrogen tank 35, hydrogen circulation ejector 40, hydrogen purifier 45 for treatment of hydrogen exiting the fuel cell stack 20, liquid absorber 50 for separation of draft droplets from the hydrogen leaving the fuel cell stack 20, and an optional hydrogen compressor 55 for compressing hydrogen into the tank 35.\n\nThe general operation principle of the regenerative fuel cell system can be described with respect to the energy storage stage (both electrolyte line and hydrogen line) and energy generation stage (both electrolyte line and hydrogen line).\n\nWith regard to the electrolyte line of the energy storage stage, electrolyte flows from the electrolyte tank 25 into the fuel cell stacks 20 and is oxidized. Electrolyte from the fuel cell stacks 20 is taken up by the electrolyte pump 30 and pumped back into the electrolyte tank 25.\n\nWith regard to the hydrogen line of the energy storage stage, hydrogen is produced in the fuel cell stacks 20 and thereafter flows into the hydrogen purifier 45. Traces of liquid inside the hydrogen stream are absorbed in the liquid absorber 50. The hydrogen is then optionally compressed by a compressor 55 to facilitate compressing of hydrogen into tank 35.\n\nWith regard to the electrolyte line of the energy generation stage, electrolyte flows from the electrolyte tank 25 into the fuel cell stacks 20 and is reduced. Electrolyte from the fuel cell stacks 20 is taken up by the electrolyte pump 30 and pumped back into the electrolyte tank 25.\n\nWith regard to the hydrogen line of the energy generation stage, hydrogen from the tank 35 flows through the hydrogen circulation ejector 40 and then to the fuel cell stacks 20. Hydrogen is oxidized inside of the fuel cell stacks 20. Any excess hydrogen (not reacted) exits the fuel cell stacks 20 and flows to the hydrogen purifier 45. Traces of liquid inside the hydrogen stream are absorbed in the liquid absorber 50. The hydrogen is then optionally compressed by a compressor 55 to facilitate compressing of hydrogen into tank 35.\n\nThe electrolytes useful in the energy storage and generation systems of this disclosure comprise a halogen acid, a mixture of halogen acids, an iron salt and conjugated acid thereof, or a mixture of iron salts and conjugated acids thereof. The gas useful in the energy storage and generation systems of this disclosure comprises hydrogen.\n\nIn halogen—hydrogen regenerative fuel cells, the electrolyte consists of a halogen acid or a mixture of halogen acids. On charging (electrolysis mode) the halogen molecule, tri-atom and penta-atom complex ions form (depending on the type of the acid used and its concentration) at the halogen positive electrode.\n\nFor example, when a high concentration of HBr is used, the oxidation products are: Br− as the major product, a small concentration of Br5− ions, and a small concentration of dissolved bromine molecules. When using mixture of halogen acids, a mixture of complexes can be formed such as for example: ClBr2−, Br2I− and IBr2−.\n\nThese ions and the dissolved halogen molecule are the oxidation compounds that, on discharge accept electrons from the positive electrode and turn back into the halogen acid (HX). The particular halogen acid to be used in the energy storage and generation systems of this disclosure depends on the end-use application. For example, HCl has a high vapor pressure in comparison to HBr and HI, but the hydrogen chlorine cell has higher voltage. A passive acid (i.e., a acid that does not take part in the cell reactions) such as phosphoric acid can be added to increase electrolyte viscosity. This reduces halide complex ions crossing over to the hydrogen electrode with minor effect on proton conductivity. Other passive acids include sulfuric acid or trifluoromethanesulfuric acid that can be added to increase electrolyte conductivity.\n\nFor example, in a hydrogen—tribromide regenerative fuel cell, the hydrogen-tribromide fuel cells and electrolyzers consist of a bromine electrode and a hydrogen electrode with a proton-conducting membrane between them. All cell components, especially the electrodes, must be capable of resisting corrosion by bromine and hydrobromic acid.\n\nThe hydrogen—tribromide regenerative fuel cell reaction (discharge) is given by equation 1:\n\nH2+Br22HBr [1]\n\nFrom the reversible cell voltage given by the Nernst equation as shown in equation 2, it can be seen that the hydrogen-bromine cell voltage decreases with increasing HBr activity, and increases with H2 pressure and Br2 activity.\n\nThe formation of bromine complexes reduces Eo by less than 0.1 V. The experimental output circuit voltage (OCV) values at room temperature for a fully-charged regenerative hydrogen-bromine fuel cell based on nano-porous proton conducting membrane (NP-PCM) containing 3-7M HBr are about 1V.\n\nBromine is highly soluble in aqueous electrolytes. The solubility of bromine in water increases in the presence of bromides as a result of the formation of complex ions like Br3− and Br5−. For example, the solubility of bromine in 1M HBr at 25° C. is 1.495 mole/liter, while in 3.1M NaBr it is 6.83M (partly due to the formation of higher complexes like Br5−). The color of the solution is yellow at low bromine (or tribromide) concentration and deep red at high bromine (or tribromide) concentrations. The molar absorptivity of bromine gas at 405 nm is 162 and that for aqueous bromine solution at 393 nm is 164.\n\nThe formation of tribromide ion in the presence of bromine and bromide is a fast reaction given by equation 3:\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction at 25° C. is 17. As a result, in practical fuel cells and electrolyzers containing 3 to 7M HBr, most of the bromine is present as tribromide ions (and some as pentabromide ions) and the concentration of free bromine is low. For example, at 25° C. in a solution of 3M HBr and 1M Br2, the concentrations of Br3− and Br2 (ignoring the formation of pentabromide ions which further reduces the bromine concentration) are 0.97 M and 0.03 M respectively.\n\nIn the hydrogen-bromine fuel cell, there are two major parallel reactions at the bromine electrode (equations 4 and 5):\n\nSince, in practical fuel cells with high HBr concentration, the concentration of free bromine is much smaller than that of the tribromide ion, it is expected that the reaction in equation 4 prevails. In this (and similar) regenerative fuel cells, the oxidizing species such as Br3— and Br2 crossover to the hydrogen electrode and reduce regenerative fuel cell performance. This can be reduced by using a selective membrane such as nanoporous proton conducting membrane which reduces this crossover significantly. In order to reduce the bromine (Br2) concentration, or to increase its molecular size, organic compounds such as N-ethylpyrrolidinium bromide, N-methylpyrrolidinium bromide, N-chloroethylpyrrolidinium bromide, N-chloromethylpyrrolidinium bromide, and others can be used at low concentrations to complex. However, it is necessary to pick organic compounds that do not interfere with the hydrogen electrode. Also, the additives concentration should be low enough to avoid phase separation.\n\nIn iron—hydrogen regenerative fuel cells, the electrolyte consists of an iron salt and the conjugated acid or a mixture of different iron salts their conjugated acids to achieve multiple iron ligands. The charge transfer process in Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox couple is an inner sphere process, therefore the charge transfer kinetics is highly dependent on the nature of the iron complex and its electrochemical characteristics. In the presence of different ligands, Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions can take a form of free ions or complexes in the solution, hence presenting a challenge in choosing the optimal electrolyte composition and the optimal operation conditions for each composition. The cell reaction is given in equation 6a for a monoprotic acid and equation 6b for diprotic acid.\n\nH2+FeX3FeX2+HX [6a]\n\nH2+Fe2(X)3FeX+H2X [6b]\n\nIllustrative iron salts and conjugated acids useful in the energy storage and generation systems of this disclosure include:\n\nYou can also Monitor Keywords and Search for tracking patents relating to this Energy storage and generation storage and generation systems or other areas of interest. ###"
