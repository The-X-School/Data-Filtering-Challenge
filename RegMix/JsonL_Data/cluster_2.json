What does Elizabeth attribute his not telling to?\n\n-John hasn't told the court what he knows because there are no witnesses to justify him.

By saying \"It is winter in here yet\" John is implying that in the room with Elizabeth it is emotionally cold. This is because Elizabeth didn't know that John would be out so late planting and thought that he may have gone to Salem. Here we see that Elizabeth still may not trust John because of what happened in he past with Abigail. 2. Mary Warren has disobeyed her employers and gone to Salem because she is an official of the court. 3. Abigail Williams reveals to John Proctor that the dancing didn't have anything to do with witchcraft. 4. John hasn't told the court what he knows because he and Abigail were alone when she revealed it to him and he has no proof of it. Elizabeth attributes his not telling to his trying to save Abigail.\n\n5. Elizabeth became more suspicious of John Proctor because he lied to her telling her that it was in a room of people that Abigail talked to him not them being alone.\n\n6. The news about the trials that Mary Warre reveals to John Elizabeth is that thirty nine women have been arrested and that Goody Osburn will hang. 7. Mary Warren acts different ways toward her employers at the beginning she acts towards them in a way to where they will have pity on her for she says she is sick, then she tells them everything they want to know about the trials, and then she is defiant towards them saying that John Proctor will not whi her and that she will do what she wants to do. 8. By saying \"I saved her life today\" Mary means that she defended Elizabeth when she was accused in court. 9. When she finds out that she has been accused, Elizabeth realizes that Abigail is trying to get her dead. 10. Elizabeth asks John to go to Abigail and call her a whore, and to break off any sense of a promise that Abigail may think John has made to her. 11. Reverend Hale visits the Proctors because he has been going around to everyone who has had their name associated with witchcraft. 12. Proctor responds to the questions about why he has not been to church by saying that at one point his wife has been sick, but then he admits that her does not trust Parris and sees no light of God him. 13. Reverend Hale asks Proctor to recite the ten commandments. 14. When reciting the ten commandments John Proctor forgot the one about adultery. When Hale reveals that Proctor had repeated one twice, and had left one out, Elizabeth tells John that it was the one about adultery. This contributes to the fact that John committed adultery against Elizabeth with Abigail. 15. John Proctor reveals to Reverend Hale that the children's sickness didn't have anything to do with witchcraft, and that the reason they were sick was because Mr. Parris came upon them in the woods and they were startled and became sick. 16. Reverend Hale wants John to testify to the information in court. 17. Elizabeth says that she doesn't believe in witches at this point because she doesn't believe that the Devil would own a woman's soul when they have walked uprightly. 18. Giles Corey reveals to the Proctors and Reverend Hale that his wife and Rebecca Nurse have been taken away to jail. 19. Rebecca Nurse has been accused of murder of Goody Putnam's babies. 20. Martha Corey has been accused because she had sold a pig to Wallcott years ago and soon after he bought the pig it died. Wallcott accuses Martha of bewitching all of his pigs with the books because they never live. 21.Ezekial Cheever and Marshal Herrick arrive at the Proctor home to take Elizabeth away to jail. 22. Cheever is both astonished and and afraid when he find the poppet with the needle in it because Abigail got stabbed by a needle in the belly and she said that it was Elizabeth's spirit that pushed it in and now in Elizabeth's poppet there was a needle. 23. John asks Mary Warren to come to court with him and charge murder on Abigail by telling the court that Abigail was responsible for the needle in the poppet. 24. Mary Warren is afraid to do what he asks because Abigail will kill her if Mary tells on her. 25. Mary Warren warns John about testifying against Abigail in court by telling him that Abigail will charge lechery on him. 26. John decides to still go to the court and testify against Abigail.\n\nmelissadawn 20 posts\nSunday, 13.

      "text": "IRP Reading Response Prompts\n\nTerm 1-Making Inferences\n\n#29 Dialogue Detective\n\nRead aloud a section of dialogue that taught you a lot about the characters who are conversing. Explain how you interpreted their words, inner thoughts and author's comments to infer personality, feelings and motivation.\n\n#30 Be the Character!\n\nRead aloud a favorite scene or section of dialogue. Now imagine you are that character, and suddenly, a fairy godmother appears and kindly asks you to express everything you are thinking and feeling and why. Free-associate as though you are the character.\n\n#31 Action Speaks Louder\n\nIt is fair to say that what you do shows others what kind of person you are. From a book's character's actions, we decide if he or she is courageous, sneaky, hot headed, and so on. Choose a character, and pick three or four of his or her actions. Discuss what they may reveal about the character's personality.\n\n#32 Be an Actor\n\nReady to show what you know about characters' motivations? Select a section of your book that's rich in dialogue. Read it aloud, adjusting your voice for different character's personalities and emotions. Describe why you chose to read the parts the way you did.\n\nTerm Two-Setting\n\n#13 Past, Present, and Future\n\nIn this book, are the characters living in the past, the future, or do they remain in the present time? What did you learn about the time period? Do you think the world is better or worse off now?\n\n#14 Important Scenes\n\nPick your favorite character. Which setting deeply affects the character's decisions and feelings? Which create problems? Identify two or three settings and clearly explain how each impacts the character.\n\n#15 Clues about Time\n\nReflect on how much time passes in your book. Skimming the text, find and discuss how the author makes time move.\n\n#16 You are There!\n\nSometimes an author describes a place with so much detail that you can see, hear, smell, and feel what the place is like. Find a scene that involves several of your senses. What are the words and phrases that stir the senses?\n\nTerm Three-Character\n\n#1 Heart-to Heart\n\nThe main character wants to meet you at the local diner to talk about everything he or she has been going through. Think about conflicts this character faces. Then tell the main character what you think about how he or she handles it, and what you consider to be his or her greatest strength-and his or her greatest flaw.\n\n#2 Mood Clues\n\nMad? You slam a door. Hurt? You cry or run away. Sad? You slump your shoulders. What you say and do communicate your mood and even your personality. The same is true for book characters. Find and discuss two character-revealing passages, and explain what each taught you about that character's feelings, motivations and personality traits.\n\n#3 Choose a Character\n\nDiscuss this! If you had to be stranded on a desert island with any character in your book, who would it be? Why? Who would be your last pick? Why?\n\n#8 Favorite Things\n\nList things that you cherish in life, such as free time, in-line skating, a friendship, or a favorite sport. Now, list 5 or 6 things that the main character might value. Discuss how the plot helped you understand what the character values. Then compare your values to the characters.\n\nTerm Four-Theme\n\n#9 What's Up\n\nA news reporter is interviewing you about issues you've observed between friends and family at school an in your neighborhood. What are some problems you might discuss? Does your book address any of these? Explain the connections between your book and any problems you identify.\n\n# 10 Make It a Bestseller\n\nYou're an editor who has come up with a new title for your book. Think about the novel's characters, problems, settings, events, and themes. Create an effective new title that will entice people to read the book and explain why you think it reflects the book's main ideas so well.\n\n#11 Talk Show Question\n\nYou are the author. In front of millions of TV viewers, a famous talk show host asks you: \" So do you think people are basically good-hearted or basically selfish? Based on the characters in your novel, what would you answer and why?\n\n#12 Pick a Theme\n\nDiscuss what the author seems to be saying about one of these topics or themes:\nfriendship, family, poverty, prejudice, survival, hope, peer pressure, illness, handicaps, talent."

For Wednesday, come to class prepared to lead a discussion on the question you have chosen and also bring the beginning of a rough draft. The final essay will be on the order of two pages in length (1.5 spacing, 10 font.)\n\nThe British Hunter, Robert Wilson, respects neither one of the Macombers, whom he is guiding on safari. Summarize his attitude toward each of them. Does he have more contempt for one or the other? Do you agree with Wilson's assessment of them? If so, why? What, on the other hand, is your assessment of Wilson, both for the attitude he has toward them and the way he treats them?\n\nIn your reading of \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\", is Robert Wilson a teacher or tyrant, a hero or bully – or is he a bit of each? Does he take advantage of a weaker man? Or is his cruelty calculated to redeem Macomber' life in some way? We know how things end for Francis. How do they end for Margot?\n\nWe've noted the themes of manliness and nature in Hemingway's stories. The first theme involves a code of behavior emphasizing stoicism, courage and, in his famous phrase, \"grace under pressure.\" The second stresses the curative, purifying, redemptive powers of the natural world as opposed to the lack of honor, moral shallowness and corruption of so-called civilization. How do these themes play out in \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber?\n\nWhy is the life of the story's title character described both as \"short\" and \"happy?\" What is \"happy\" about the life that ends on the last page? What philosophy about the meaning of life does Hemingway mean to convey by the situation he describes in this story? Are the values he ascribes to Robert Wilson meant to be taken by the reader as admirable? What are the moral issues Hemingway raises in this story?\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Review the images of Gilded Age New York in the pages of Illustrated History of New York - and categorize them according whether they illustrate \"Sunshine\" or \"Shadow\" during the Gilded Age. If you're not sure what the image represents explain why.\n\n2. Choose one person, place, thing or event from the identifications below and do some preliminary research on the internet - site your source(s) – and write a brief analysis of the item's historic significance for understanding the history of New York City during the Gilded Age.\n\nWeek XI November 22-24, 2010\n\nSunshine and Shadow, New York – 1860 – 1898\n\nDiscussion: The end of the Civil War brought with it reunion between the North and South, and reunion brought with it new opportunities for New York to grow into the national metropolis - and one of world's largest and most powerful cities by the end of the nineteenth century. New York was the national metropolis by the end of the Civil War with a population of between 800,000 to one million people. This number would have been unimaginable just a couple of generations earlier. Imagine, then, that by the year 1900 the city would more than triple in size reaching a population of fully 3,000,000 people. By the end of World War I, just twenty years later, New York would become the world's largest city and truly the capital of the world. In this chapter we continue to observe this dizzying 19th ascent and the challenges brought about by ever bigger bigness. Commerce, immigration, population growth and geographical expansion, continue to be major themes of the story. But now the problems associated with rampant capitalism and poverty produced a wider and wider gap between the privileged and the poor. Add to this the massive \"new Immigration\" between the years 1886 and 1924 and one begins to understand the meaning of the metaphor that is the title of the chapter. New York was, indeed, two worlds, one \"Sunshine,\" the other \"Shadow,\" one a world of the rich and privileged, the other a world of unimaginable hardship, deprivation, horrible working and living conditions and despair. It was also a time of extraordinary achievement, aspiration, invention and productivity. This troubled, varied and often fabulous New York is our subject.\n\nMajor themes\n\nReunion and reconstruction: New York as the national metropolis\n\nThe Gilded Age: Boom and Bust, Bulls and Bears\n\nDemocratic aspirations: Central Park\n\nThe \"New Immigration\" – 1886 – 1924 (13.5 million people enter through New York)\n\nThe new urban political machine\"- the case of William M. \"Boss\" Tweed and Tammany Hall\n\n1. Give three examples of racism in New York City during the decades before the Civil War, taking into account the social, economic, and political conditions in which the African American population found itself.\n\n2. What is the issue that the author discusses in Chords of Caste?\n\nWeek VI – May 16-20\n\nOrder and Disorder – New York, 1825-60\n\nThis week we study of the transformative events of the period 1825-1860.\n\n1. Transportation has been a continuing factor in the evolution of New York since the Half Moon sailed up what would be named the Hudson River in 1609. Discuss five different episodes in the history of transportation that transformed the history of this city during the first half of the 19th century.\n\n2. New York City is, and has always been, a \"city of immigrants,\" starting with the diverse population that arrived during the Dutch period, right up until the present day, when almost 40% of the City's population is foreign born. Describe this pattern in the early 19th century. What immigrant groups arrived here? What was their impact? Were there tensions and conflicts between those who had called New York home for generations and those newly arrived? What were these tensions? How did they affect the politics and the culture of the City in the years prior to the Civil War? Have immigrant groups been welcomed with open arms to New York? Give examples. How have various groups struggled and risen through the \"social geography\" of the city?\n\n3. The period from 1825 to 1860 was a time of truly unprecedented growth, change and challenge to every New Yorker:\n\n1. The population grew from around 200,000 to nearly one million people.\n\n2. Increasing diversity made this growth even more disorienting.\n\n3. Economic and technological changes created upheavals in the social and cultural lives of every New Yorker, in the ways they lived and worked, in the way they communicated, and in the ways they related to each other. Crime, poverty, racial and ethnic conflict disease, mand much more plagued a city seemingly unequipped to handle its sudden transition into the modern world, a city\n\nYour author refers to the sum total and impact of these changes as producing a period of \"disorder\" – not a very optimistic assessment. Give examples of some of the economic, social and cultural challenges and problems that descended upon the little city that became a metropolis in just a few decades. If you lived in New York during this time, what do you think the impact of these dramatic change and growth would have been on your life?\n\n4. Along with the \"disorder\" created by the rapid changes in New York City during this period, as it developed into a new kind of city – a metropolis, which by the Civil War was already bursting with nearly one million people. Historians have also focused on the attempts at improving life, making it more modern and efficient, attempting to establish some kind of pattern for the future and stabilize daily life. Give examples of these efforts to impose \"order\" on the obvious disorder of the teaming city.\n\n\"Discussion of Major themes\n\nThe period 1825 to 1860 was a time of truly unprecedented growth, change and challenges to every New Yorker. Imagine that you maintain an organized bedroom, in an organized home, in an unchanging neighborhood. You rely on this organization and predictability in your life. Then, while you're overnight at a friend's, a windows are left open, there's a storm, and gusts of wind and rain damage and disorganize everything you rely on for normal life. When you return, nothing is the way you left it. You would be disoriented, to say the least. You would face disorder in every in every part of your life. You would begin, with the help of others, to try to restore some order in your life. Something like this is what happened to New York as it was transformed by the \"storm\" of history from a small, intimate town into a metropolis in a couple of generations. Not only did the population increase from 90,000 at the beginning of the century to 750,000 by the time the Civil war began. Different kinds of people from those who had settled and lived here for two hundred years. These \"Knickerbockers\" had dominated social, civic and economic life of the city. Now, as Germans and Irish immigrants poured into New York, their privileged position was threatened. We will observe the City's unprecedented growth (both in population and geographic expansion) and transformation (in terms of industrialzation, transportation, commerce, class and race, demography, media and communications, policing, public health, and much more. These developments ended the intimacy of the old \"walking city\" and ushered in new relationships characteristic of the modern metropolis? Would you have liked to live in \"gaslight New York\"?\n\nThemes of the period:\n\nI New York City expands more rapidly than any city in history. From the small town of a few thousand people in the 1780 it becomes to the metropolis of 1865, with a population of three quarters of a million.\n\nII The impact of the \"Transportation Revolution\" on New York City\n\n1. Robert Fulton's development of the steamboat, 1807\n\n2. The development in 1811 of New York City's grid plan, New York's familiar grid of streets and avenues, one of the most recognizable aspects.\n\n3. The Age of Sail reaches its peak even as new forms of transportation develop. Americans build the sleekest, fastest sailing vessels in the world that voyage to every continent and open up world trade centered on New York. The famed Yankee Clippers were the fastest ships on the world. In 1817 ,scheduled packet service – the first being The Black Ball Line in 1817, replaces individual contracting of merchants with ship captains, making the system of booking passage predictable and rational.\n\n4. The Erie Canal, completed in 1825, seals New York's position, predicted since Hudson's voyage in 1609, as the preeminent hub of Atlantic – and eventually, global – trade.\n\n5. The railroad era, beginning in the late 1820′s, put an end to the construction of canals. The career of Cornelius Vanderbilt, a pioneer of transportation on both water and by rail, is symbolic of the passing of an age and the beginning of a new one. Travel by sea was for thousands of years the only alternative to walking or being drawn by animals on land. Now the \"iron horse,\" powered by the steam locomotive ushered in a new technology that shrunk time and space. Vanderbilt became the nation's premier shipping magnate, and then in the 1840s, switched to rail, becoming the most powerful railroad owner in the world.\n\nII The first great wave of immigration into New York City during the 1840s, primarily German and Irish.\n\nIII A Sense of History: Reacting to rapid population growth and immigration of different ethnicities, a new sense of history develops in New York City during the period prior to the Civil War. The role of Washington Irving, who was New York's first internationally known author, is very important in this development. His book, The Knickerbockers History of New York gave rise to the term \"Knickerbockers\" referring to native born New Yorkers of Dutch or English descent during a period of increasing anxiety about the influx of foreigners into New York.\n\nIV Geographical expansion of New York. John Jacob Astor buys up real estate all over the City and sells it to contractors as New York expands northward. One such block was Charlton Street, and one such building was our new school building at 42 Charlton Street!!\n\nV The Industrial Revolution in New York City: the rise of the factory system and the decline of traditional economic and social relationships. By the 1840s New York is the nation's largest industrial center. The east river on both the Manhattan and Brooklyn sides was the industrial hub of the city, with smokestacks rising, hundreds of employees working in manufacturing, and as much as 15% of the nation's wealth centered in the area from Greenpoint to Brooklyn Heights and 23rd street to the Battery.\n\nVI The New Politics and the Rise of Tammany Hall\n\nVII Class and Race in antebellum New York\n\n1. \"Slavery by another name\" – the case of the St. Augustine's Church slave galleries.\n\n2. The rise of the workingman's movement in New York City\n\n3. Class markers in consumption and recreation: the case of Central Park\n\nWeek V – May 8-14\n\nThis week we will be reading about and discussing the emergence of New York City briefly as the nation's political capital, and then, permanently, as the nation's financial and commercial capital. Be prepared for each day's class having read the following pages and answered the accompanying questions.\n\nReading – Burns, pp. 21-27 Slavery and racism in colonial New York\n\n1. Describe the nature of slavery as it existed in New York City during the English colonial period. Describe the reactions of enslaved African Americans to their plight. How did the Revolutionary War affect the City's slave population?\n\nReading, Burns, pp. 28-37 The Capital of a New Nation;pp. 51-55 America's City\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. When the War for Independence began in 1776, why were New York City and the Hudson River Valley central to England's strategy for defeating the rebellion? Did the strategy work? What was the political result of the American victory at Saratoga? .\n\n2.. What was the magnitude of the force the British assembled in New York Harbor in the summer of 1776? Describe the strategy of the British as they moved to secure New York City in August of 1776.What were the major encounters during the Battle of Long Island – also known as the the Battle of Brooklyn?\n\n3. What was the condition of New York City in the years immediately following the conclusion of the American War for Independence?\n\n4. In the years following the victory over England, New York evolved from the political capital of the nation to its economic one. How would New York City history been different if it had remained the capital of the United States?\n\n5. Describe the development of New York City's economy during the years after the War for Independence concluded in 1783. How did advances in transportation propel New York City to the forefront of the nation during the first decades of the nation's existence.\n\nReading, Burns, pp. 56-67 America's City\n\nWhat was the significance and the impact of the construction of the grid system of streets and avenues in 1811?\n\nIs it fair to describe the construction of the Erie Canal as in some way the fulfillment of the dream of Henry Hudson?\n\nWeek IV – V April 25-29; May 2-5\n\nWe reach the end of the Adriaen Van der Donck saga. In doing so we understand the question we began with: Why did the Dutch colony fail; or as we often phrased it, Why don't we speak Dutch?\n\nReadings: In order to answer the following questions on Chapters 11-14, read my summaries and check the references to specific pages or passages in the book itself , cited in the summaries, for further clarification.Your answers are due Monday, May 8th.\n\nWritten Questions:\n\nChapter 11 – \"An American in Europe\" – When did Van der Donck return to the Netherlands? Why? What did he find there – in terms of the political atmosphere? What argument did he make to the States General? Who were his political enemies? What was the decision of the Dutch government with respect to the colony's government and management? What orders does it send to Director General Stuyvesant? What does Van der Donck accomplish with respect to the government of New Amsterdam. (P. 230)\n\nChapter 12 – \"A Dangerous Man\" – Van der Donck remains in the Netherlands, but then international events intervene and the government starts to back down from its support of Van der Donck's position. The summary states: Then the roof falls in. A drastic shift in the tides of international geo-politics intervenes and snatches AVD's victory from him.(pp. 245-46) Explain!\n\nChapter 13 – \"Booming\" – Although AVD has lost his battle against Stuyvesant and the Company, he nevertheless did win a huge victory. As a result of his boldness New Amsterdam was now an incorporated, self governing city – its residents now citizens. Explain. What was the Flushing Remonstrance, and why was it important in the history of religious liberty in this country?\n\nChapter 14 \"New York\" – Why don't we speak Dutch\" What happened to Adriaen Van Der Donck in 1655? What happened to New Netherland in 1664?\n\n\"The General and the Princess,\" Chapter 9, pp. 167-179 (To be discussed Thursday and Friday)\n\nQuestions:\n\nRead the following chapters in Russell Shorto, Island at the Center of the World and my summaries of the chapters found in the Pages Section of the Blog entitled Gotham Resources.

Describe the company's business.\n\nWhy is what we call New York Harbor and the Hudson River really an estuary\n\nWhy were 17th century explorers obsessed with the Northwest Passage?\n\nWhat are today's names for the Fresh, North and South Rivers, respectively?\n\nWho were the patroons?\n\nWhy was Rosh Hashanah in 1654 so important?\n\nWhen did the English capture New Netherland?\n\nIn what way was Municipal Charter of New Amsterdam granted by the States General in 1653 vindication for Adriaen Van der Donck?\n\nWeek I – II March 14 – 17; April 4-8\n\nIntroduction: Glacier, Natives and Dutchmen\n\nWe begin by considering the following topics: New York's natural history - terrain and its natural life; The native inhabitants of New York called the Lenape; The geopolitical situation in Europe at the end of the 16th and early 17th centuries, which led to the rise of The United Provinces of the Netherlands and the Age of Exploration in the New World; and the early settlement of the island of Manhattan.\n\nWe will start with the impact of the last Ice Age. The glacier began to recede some 15,000 years ago leaving behind an \"archipelago\" of island – of today's five boroughs only the Bronx is part of the mainland United States – some 70 miles of shoreline and hundred of islands.\n\nTo understand the force and impact of the glacier – called the Wisconsin Glacier - imagine a huge steam shovel, digging huge trenches or troughs as the land froze and the ice sheet advanced down from the arctic circle. Except the steam shovel is actually the southern-most edge of the ice, and as it proceeds, it mixes everything in its path in with the ice.It dug huge troughs like the Hudson Valley and shallower flatlands all over what is now New York City. There was so much sea water frozen into he glacier, by the way, that the actual shoreline of the Atlantic Ocean off New York, New England and much of New Jersey was up to 150 miles east of where it is now.\n\nThis all started 75,000 years ago. Then about 15,000 years ago, the glacier started to melt. It receded northat different speeds, depending on how cold it was for a given stretch of hundreds of years. And as it melted over a particular spot in the geography, it deposited the mud and rock it had dug and mixed with ice on the way down . So if the glacier took a long time to melt over a particular spot, it deposited more mud – eventually dry land – over that spot. Today those locations form higher points in the terrain of the City. Often their names remind of of this fact, for example Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, or Murray Hill Manhattan. Other spots indicate the glacier was melting fast when it receded over that spot. Hence, Flatbush, Brooklyn, or the Harlem Valley in Manhattan at around 100-110 streets on the west side. At first, with all this water being deposited, most of Manhattan was flooded, leaving the island, especially the lower half, a perpetual swamp or actually underwater. (This is what could happen with increased global warming today.) Another reason is that the melted ice water had nowhere to drain in to ocean. Why? Because the channel now spanned by the Verazzano Bridge was a barrier reef, like a cork in the bottle of water formed by New York Bay. Eventually that cork popped, and the result about 10,000 years ago was the geography we recognize today.\n\nAt this point about 8,000 years ago, the native inhabitants that Henry Hudson would later encounter, entered the scene. These natives were the Lenape Indians, part of the great Algonquian peoples that stretched across the northeast and even north-central United States. Another name for them is The Delaware Indians. Europeans first made contact in the early 17thcentury with the arrival of Henry Hudson, an English navigator sailing for the Dutch West India Company. Hudson's voyage was part of a \"Great Age of Exploration\" that included all the great European powers facing the Atlantic Ocean. (Classical Civilization - Greek and Roman civilization – was basically a Mediterranean culture.) Other transformative forces providing the context of the Dutch exploration and settlement of North America included the Protestant Reformation, the Commercial Revolution, the Scientific Revolution, and the first stirrings of the rise of democratic thought and values, one important manifestation of which was the establishment of a republican form of government in The Netherlands, which for all intents and purposes gained it's independence in 1579, although the formal recognition of the fact of it's independence didn't come until 1648. A formal truce between the years 1609 and 1620 gave the now powerful rebellious province of Spain to enter the race for colonies in North America. This, of course, was the year Henry Hudson sailed the Half Moon under the Dutch Flag and joined the race to find the fabled \"northwest passage.\"\n\nPowerful Atlantic powers were scrambling to find the northwest passage because it was supposedly a water route through the North American continent to the Pacific Ocean, thus providing renewed access to the Orient. The search was made necessary by grand historical developments that began almost a thousand years earlier – the great battle between Christianity and Islam, which culminated in 1554 in the capture of Constantinople , thus interrupting the overland trading route to the Orient which had been traveled by Europeans since at least the time of Marco Polo (13th century) and spurred the search for new routes by sea.\n\nThe first Atlantic nation to do so was Portugal, which first circumnavigated Africa, sailed the Indian Ocean, colonized to the subcontinent (India) and continued on to Cathay (China) and the South Asia Sea. This led to the voyages of Columbus, the first to dare the uncharted waters of the Atlantic itself, sailing west to find the east, and famously succeeding in 1492. Soon, all the major western and northern European nation states participated: Spain, England, Scotland Portugal, France, Sweden and others. A cold – and often hot – war ensued: a great centuries-long rivalry involving colonization across the globe, submission of native groups who objected, organized privateering (piracy) and often outright armed conflict. These ambitious and powerful states motivated by rivalries for colonies and resources spawned a new financial and commercial class (the bourgeoisie) and then tapped their wealth by chartering joint stock trading companies and establishing colonies. The English dominated the east coast of North America – Jamestown Virginia, 1607, and New England – Plymouth 1620, and Massachusetts Bay, 1629. The Spanish dominated South America, the French, Canada and the interior of North America, and all of them took a part of the Caribbean Sea. Even Sweden established a colony in North America, on the Delaware River, which the Dutch squashed in 1655.\n\nBut it was the upstart United Provinces of the Netherlands that with Hudson's voyage grabbed, perhaps the most valuable piece of the international colonial puzzle: the section of the eastern coast of what is now the United States of America. It included what is now New York, New Jersey and part of Connecticut. This colony would be named New Netherland by the Dutch West India Company, the trading Company the Dutch established in 1621 to run things. In 1609, it signed up an English navigator named Henry Hudson to search for the Northwest Passage. After two failed attempts, he tried a third route, and on September 12, 1609, sailed through the Verrazano Narrows and entered the Upper Bay of New York harbor, inaugurating the Dutch colony in the New World. It would last until 1664 when the British captured it.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nHow was the geography of New York City formed by the Wisconsin glacier? How long did this process take?\n\nWho were the native inhabitants of the area when Europeans made contact during the early 16th century?\n\nDescribe the rise of the Dutch nation – The United Provinces of the Netherlands – during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In what areas did this new nation become one of the leaders of Europe? What accounts for this so-called \"Golden Age of the Dutch?\" Name some of the individuals who we associate with this period.\n\nWhen did the Dutch rule New Netherland?\n\nWas the colony simply a trading post, a purely business proposition? Or was it a colony, with a government, laws and settlers? Why is this question important?\n\nName the company chartered by the Dutch government in 1621 to manager the colony. What was the title given to the executive director of the company in North America? Who would you say were the most important men to fill this position during the Dutch period?\n\nWho was Adriaen Van der Donck? What was his relationship with three older men who were prominent in the history of New Netherland: Killiaen Van Renssalaer, Willem Kieft and Peter Stuyvesant?\n\nWhat were Van der Donck's goals for the colony? Why did this put him in direct conflict with Peter Stuyvesant. Where did Van der Donck make his case during the period 1650-1653? What happened in the States General – the government of the United Provinces of the Netherlands\n\n1. If geography is destiny, explain why New York City was destined to become one of the most economically powerful cities on earth. How did the Wisconsin Glacier create the geography and topography of New York City and its environs beginning 15,000 years ago?\n\n2. Who was Henry Hudson? Why did he sail for the Dutch? What kind of man was he? What happened to him? What was the name of his ship? Describe the adventures he had on his voyages to what became New York?\n\n3. The Dutch were the most powerful nation in 17th century Europe. What was the source of their economic power? What advantage s did they bring to the \"cold war\" (and often hot wars) of the 16th and 17th centuries? Why did they seek a colony on the Atlantic coast of North America?What made the late 16th and 17th centuries the Dutch Golden Age? pp. 16-17; search for the Northwest Passage\n\n4. Who were the native inhabitants of New Netherland? How did their culture compare to that of the Europeans who arrived in the early 17th century? What was the impact of globalization on the native peoples they encountered?What were core characteristics of the culture and society of the Lenape? How did this culture adapt to the introduction of European culture during the Contact Period? \"The Dutch Buy Manhattan,\" pp. 48-49\n\n5. What was the main economic activity of the Dutch settlers? What was the relationship of settlers to the company? Ultimately, was New Amsterdam in particular, and New Netherland in general, a colony or a company, a civil community or a trading post? Why is this important?\n\n6. How did the Dutch settlers and the natives get along? Who was Willem Kieft and what fierce conflict broke out during the 1840′s?\n\nOn the basis of the reading be able to define and discuss the following Key Terms. Have this sheet available at all times during class discussions, when we will amplify these terms' meaning and relevance for the history of the Dutch period – 1609-1624."

      "text": "In a suburban Atlanta neighborhood where divorce is as rampant as kudzu, Mary Bliss McGowan doesn't notice that her own marriage is in trouble until the summer night she finds a note from her husband, telling her he's gone -- and taken the family fortune with him.\n\nStunned and humiliated, a desperate Mary Bliss, left behind with her seventeen-year-old daughter, Erin, and a mountain of debt, decides to salvage what's left of her life by telling one little bitty lie.\n\nAt first, Mary Bliss simply tells friends and family that Parker is out of town on a consulting job. Then the lies start to snowball, until Parker turns up dead. Or does he?\n\nMary Bliss's formerly staid existence careens into overdrive as she copes with an oversexed teenager, a mother-in-law with Ethel Merman delusions, and the sudden but delicious shock of finding herself pursued by two men: -- and the perfect recipe for chicken salad.\n\n1. Mary Bliss and Katherine have been friends for more than a decade, and the saying \"opposites attract\" seems to describe their friendship. Are Katharine and Mary Bliss really as different as they seem? What makes their friendship so strong? What do they have in common?\n\n2. Mary Bliss encourages Katherine to reconcile with Charlie, who cheated on Katharine and was living with another woman. In one instance Mary Bliss says to her, \"Honestly, sweetie, he's too good a man to just throw away like this.\" Why does she think Katharine should take Charlie back when she makes it very clear that she will not give Parker a second chance?\n\n3. Mary Bliss thinks her life is perfect, or at least perfectly well ordered, until Parker leaves. Do you think she was happy in her marriage? Did she miss any signs that her marriage was not as perfect as she thought? When Mary Bliss finally has the chance to confront Parker, he puts the blame on her for his leaving. What do you think about this?\n\n4. Parker's leaving is the catalyst Mary Bliss needs to make changes in her life -- and to change herself. \"Maybe there was a smidgen of rebel beaten down inside her. Maybe Parker's leaving had unlocked this side of her.\" Describe Mary Bliss as she appears at the beginning of the novel. How has she changed by the end of the story?\n\n5. Mary Bliss visits Eula regularly at the nursing home, cooks her favorite foods, and brings her flowers. Even after Parker leaves, Mary Bliss continues to visit Eula. Why is Eula so hostile to Mary Bliss? Why does Mary Bliss feel such a sense of responsibility for Eula? Did Eula's decision about her estate surprise you?\n\n6. There are references throughout the story to Mary Bliss's childhood. \"Her own daddy, James Clewitt, had abandoned his family. Had told her mama he was going to Florida to look for work.. Drove away in a 1968 green Ford Falcon. And that was that. Never to return.\" How have the circumstances of Mary Bliss's childhood affected her as an adult? She sees Parker's behavior as worse than her father's because \"Parker had not only abandoned them, he'd stolen their future.\" Do you agree with Mary Bliss on this?\n\n7. Discuss the relationships Mary Bliss has with the women in her life -- Katharine, Erin, Eula -- and how each one is important to her.\n\n8. Katharine plays an integral role in the plan to fake Parker's death. Why does she do this? Is it merely because she's Mary Bliss's best friend, or are there other reasons?\n\n9. Mary Bliss and Matt Hayslip meet under unusual circumstances, and she does not particularly like him at their first meeting. What changes her mind about him? Mary Bliss and Matt's relationship is clouded by lies and deception. In one instance he says to her, \"What about you? Are you capable of telling the truth?.\" As she says about their relationship, \"they had done everything backward.\" Why, ultimately, does their relationship work?\n\n10. The title of the book, Little Bitty Lies, is an understatement. What do you think of the lies that abound in the book? Is there any character who does not resort to lies and deception? During a conversation with Charlie, Mary Bliss feels bad for deceiving him but has \"already made an uneasy peace with her conscience, telling herself the ends justified the means.\" In Mary Bliss's case, do you think the ends justified the means?"

Questions and shifting should be somewhat rapid.\nYou might try to ask some general questions first to get students started.\n\nHere are some question possibilities:\nEnrique's Journey\nWho do you most admire?\nWhat's your favorite book?\nHow much of Enrique's Journey did you read?\nWhat do you think about immigration?\nDid Enrique's Journey influence how you feel about immigration?\nWhich character in the book did you most identify with?\nWhat was your favorite part of the book?\nWhat was your least favorite part of the book?\nWhat would you do differently than Enrique?\nTalk about a time when someone really supported you.\n\nThe Social Barometer Exercise\n\nThere are two ways to set up the exercise:\nExplain to students that you will make a statement, and that based on their agreement OR disagreement with the statement, they should place themselves along a continuum/spectrum. Emphasize that there are no right or wrong answers. Designate one side of the room as \"Strongly Agree\" and the other side as \"Strongly Disagree\". Students can place themselves anywhere along the continuum. Randomly call on students along the continuum to explain why their views and placement.\nSimilarly, explain that you will make a statement and that based on their position, they will group themselves under one of the four signs you've posted around the room. Emphasize that there are no right or wrong answers. Post on each of the four classroom walls, \"Strongly Agree,\" \"Agree,\" \"Disagree\" and \"Strongly Disagree.\" Once grouped under their position, students should talk amongst themselves to discuss why they chose this position. Call on a spokesperson from each of the four groups to explain their views to the rest of the class.\nOther things to consider:\nThe key question for the facilitator is \"Why do you strongly agree or strongly disagree with this statement?\"\nYou can allow students to change positions/locations if someone says something that persuades them to modify their original viewpoints\nDiscussion shouldn't get too personal or chaotic\nTry to call on many different students to keep everyone involved.\nYou might start with a more innocuous topic first to get the feel for the exercise. \"My parents really miss me,\" \"The Lumberjacks will win the homecoming game this year.\"\n\nHere are some statements you could use for the book, Enrique's Journey:\nIt is important for the US to allow Latin Americans into the country.\nI admire Enrique for the journey he made.\nI think that Enrique's mother made a good choice to leave her family and go to the United States to make money.\nIf I lived in Veracruz and was really poor, I would share food and clothes with the people riding on the train.\nI learned a lot from reading this book.\nMexican and Latin American immigrants should be treated better by the border patrol.\nI believe that immigrants should not be allowed to stay in the US.\nI think that it's right for Mexico to deport Latin American immigrants who are riding the train.\nI think it's important that people know about the issues discussed in this book.\nThink of your own statements that will get students to take a position.\n\nFor more information:\n\n inst_resources/social_barometer.pdf\n\nAgree\n\nDisagree\n\nStrongly Agree\n\nStrongly Disagree\n\nEnrique's Journey Debate\n\nFacilitator Guidelines:\nSet up a debate by dividing the class into two sides. You can either allow them to group themselves by position or randomly number them into two groups.\nExplain that each side will have a few minutes to prepare a list of reasons why their position will be supported and formulate a position statement.\nAllow each side to present their statement and then facilitate a back and forth discussion between the two sides.\n\nPossible debate ideas:\nShould the US allow more Latin Americans to immigrate?\nIs it right for Latin American parents to leave their children behind when they go to the US to try to make money? Should parents come to the US to try to make money?\nShould Mexican and Latin American immigrants try to \"fit in\" in the US?\n\nQuotable Quotes\n\nFacilitator Guidelines:\n\nDistribute a quote from the book to each student in the room. (There are some on the following pages you might consider.)\nHave them read the quote and think about what it means to them.\nStudents should get up, introduce themselves to another student, read their quote and give a brief explanation of what it means, whether or not they agree, etc.\nSince different students might react differently to the quotes, it would be okay to have duplicate quotes.\nQuotes\n(there are 20 provided here)\n\nPg. 27 \"In one neighborhood near where Enrique's mother grew up, fifty-two children arrive at kindergarten each morning. Forty-four arrive barefoot. An aide reaches into a basket and places a pair of shoes into each one's hands. At 4 P.M., before they leave, the children must return the shoes to the basket. If they take the shoes home, their mothers will sell them for food.\"\n\nPg. 44 \"On March 2, 2000, he goes to his grandmother Agueda's house. He stands on the same porch that his mother disappeared from eleven years before. He hugs Maria Isabel and Aunt Rosa Amalia. Then he steps off.\"\n\nPg. 47 \"Looking at the small, soft-spoken boy lying on the bench, he reminds himself that a live migrant is better than a dead one. In eighteen months, Diaz has had to bury eight of them, nearly all mutilated by the trains. Already today, he has been told to expect the body of yet another, in his late thirties.\"\n\nPg. 50 \"Their prize possessions are scraps of paper, wrapped in plastic, often tucked into a shoe. On the scraps are telephone numbers: their only way to contact their mothers. Some do not have even that.\"\n\nPg. 67 \"He is among the 20 to 30 percent of those boarding the trains in Tapachula who are fifteen or under, by estimate of Grupo Beta, a government migrant rights group in Chiapas.\"\n\nPg. 71 \"Enrique's train runs only a few times a week, but it averages three derailments a month-seventeen accidents in a particularly bad month…\"\n\nPg. 78 \"Nearly one in six migrant girls detained by authorities in Texas says she has been sexually assaulted during her journey, according to a 1997 University of Houston study. Some girls journeying north cut off their hair, strap their breasts, and try to pass for boys. Others scrawl on their chests, TENGO SIDA. \"I have AIDS.\"\"\n\nPg. 103 \"Riding trains through the state of Chiapas has taught him that any upraised hand might hurl a stone. But here in the states of Oaxaca and Veracruz, he discovers that people are friendly. They wave hello and shout to signal if hostile police are lying wait for them in an upcoming town.\"\n\nPg. 194 \"Over time, though, they realize they are strangers. Neither knows the other's likes or dislikes.\"\n\nPg. 244 \"For most immigrants who come to the United States, the biggest downside is the toll parent-child separations exact on families.\"\n\nPg 111: \"The priest Salamón Lemus Lemus chuckles as he looks out on the grounds of the María Auxiliadora church. \"They have taken over my church,\" he says smiling. Hundreds of migrants mill around in the courtyard. They sleep in every nook and cranny of the church…\"\n\nPg 119: \"Reyes, who had walked two and a half hours to Nogales says she shouted at the mayor, \"We are human. We should treat people in a humane way. It's okay to send people back. But they shouldn't shoot them, beat them this way.\"\n\nPg 120: \"The cargo is beginning to change. It is valuable and more easily damaged—Volkswagons, Fords, and Chryslers. Security guards check the freight cars, catch every rider they can, and hand them over to the authorities. More important, says Cuacuhtemoc González Flores, an official of the Transportatión Ferroviaria Mexicana railroad, is the fact that if a migrant falls and is injured or killed, it costs $8 a minute to stop the train, often for hours until investigators arrive.\"\n\nPg 121: \"Only a bribe, Enrique knows, will keep him from being deported back to Central America…Some officers will let you go for 20 pesos. Others demand 50—or more—and then turn you over to la migra to be deported anyway. Now he prays the coins he has will be enough.\n\nPg 123: \"He relishes the camaraderie: how riders take care of one another, pass along what they know, divide what they have. Migrants will often designate one person to look out for trouble while the others rest. They give one another advice. In spots along the route where the train slows and migrants sprint from the shadows to board, reaching for the ladders, migrants riding atop the cars should out if the train is going too fast.\n\nPg 124: \"El Mexicano is the longest tunnel. For eight minutes, the train vanishes inside. Black diesel smoke rises, hugging the tops of the cars. It burns the lungs and stings the eyes.\"\n\nPg 129: \"Live wires carry electricity above the trains for 143 miles north…the wires still carry 25,000 volts to prevent vandalism. Signs warn: DANGER—HIGH VOLTAGE. But many of the migrants cannot read. They do not even need to touch the lines to be killed.\n\nPg 150: \"Sometimes Enrique does not eat at all. He feels weak. Occasionally local fishermen give him a fish they have caught. Friends at the camp share their meals…One teaches him how to fish with a line coiled on a shampoo bottle…\"\n\nPg 151: \"Enrique learns that El Tiríndaro is part of a smuggling network. He has partners in three safe houses on the U.S. side of the river, people who will hide migrants if Border Patrol agents are in pursuit…The price is $1,200.\"\n\nPg 156: \"Though many mothers expect the separation to be short, typically they last six to eight years, says Analuisa Espinoza, a Los Angeles Unified School District social worker who specializes in immigrants. By then, they are strangers. Some mothers, picking up children from smugglers, hug the wrong ones. Enrique wonders: What does his mother look like now?\"\n\nFrierian Fish Bowl\n\nFacilitator Guidelines:\nYou will need slips of paper, pencils and a bowl or hat for this activity.\nHave each student react to the question you pose on a slip of paper and place it in the bowl.\nPass around the bowl and have students draw out a response. They should present the written response to the group as well as their personal reaction.\n\nThis technique insures that everyone will participate and allows for everyone to provide their personal thoughts more discretely. When students are asked to speak to the group, they are reading and reaction to someone else's position.\n\nSample Reaction Statements:\nBeing separated from your family is difficult.\nThe US should allow more Mexicans and Latin Americans to immigrate to the US legally.\nEnrique was brave. If I was in his situation, I would have tried to come to the US also.\n\nForce Field Analysis\n\n\"In every organization, work environment, family, or community, there exists a natural tendency (a force field) which acts to keep the situation from changing. A force field represent posers that are proposing change and those that are working towards change. In essence, those forces want to keep the issue at an equilibrium.\"(\n\nFacilitator Guidelines:\n\nUsing a white board, flip chart, etc, ask students to submit the forces which support the issue you pose. On another area, record forces which work against the issue.\nFacilitate a discussion of which forces can be changed, how those changes might occur, what things that we personally do to change the forces?\nPossible force field issues:\nThere are forces which cause Mexicans and Latin Americans to immigrate to the US\nThere are forces which cause Latin American parents to leave their children behind when they go to the US to try to make money.\nThere are forces which make it difficult for Mexican and Latin American immigrants to \"fit in\" to the US."

      "text": "The Seamstress\n\nA Novel\n\nAs seamstresses, the orphaned sisters Emília and Luzia dos Santos know how to cut, how to mend, and how to conceal. These are useful skills in the backcountry of Brazil, where vigilantes called cangaceiros make the rules. Emília dreams of falling in love and escaping to the city. Luzia also longs to escape their little town, where residents view her with suspicion because of her deformed arm and her quick temper.\n\nBut when Luzia is abducted by a group of cangaceiros led by the infamous Hawk, the sisters' quiet lives diverge in ways they never imagined. Emília stumbles into a marriage where her glamorous life is soon overshadowed by heartache and loneliness. Luzia, forced to trek through scrubland and endure a nomadic existence, begins to see the cangaceiros as comrades, not criminals.\n\nLuzia will overcome time and distance to entrust her sister with a great secret—one Emília vows to keep. And when Luzia's life is threatened, Emília will risk everything to save her.\n\nQuestions for Discussion\n\n1. How does their shared childhood as poor, religious, orphaned seamstresses shape Emília and Luzia's unique perspectives on life?\n\n2. How does access to water define political power in a country like Brazil in the 1920s and 1930s? How did the author's descriptions of extreme drought affect your appreciation of modern conveniences?\n\n3. How does the Hawk's treatment of Luzia in the caatinga, or scrub, reveal Antônio's true nature?\n\n4. What does Emília's reception into Recife society indicate about the esteem in which the Coelho family is held? To what extent is her mother-in-law, Dona Dulce Coelho, overly concerned about others' perceptions of Emília?\n\n5. To what extent are secrets responsible for the marriage between Degas and Emília and, much later, for its disintegration?\n\n6. How does Luzia's behavior in the initial aftermath of Antônio's death explain her success in becoming the new captain of the cangaceiros? In what other ways does her behavior change once the Hawk is dead?\n\n7. How do Dr. Duarte's interests in phrenology and politics and his import-export business connect him to the government's search for The Seamstress and the Hawk?\n\n8. At various points in the novel, how does Dr. Eronildes Epifano represent both salvation and damnation to the cangaceiros? What role does Degas play in alerting Emília to Dr. Eronildes's duplicity?\n\n9. Given The Seamstress's attacks on innocent people, to what extent are Emília's efforts to communicate information to Luzia through newspaper articles and photographs ethically defensible?\n\n10. How does the book's final image connect with earlier images of bones in The Seamstress? Why do you think the author chose to close her book with this image?\n\nAbout the Author\n\nFrances de Pontes Peebles was born in Pernambuco, Brazil and raised in Miami, Florida. A graduate of the University of Texas at Austin and the Iowa Writers' Workshop, she has received several awards, including Brazil's Sacatar Artist's Fellowship and the Michener-Copernicus Society of America Award.

Or, how do they embrace them?\n\n\"Today you pay me ... but tomorrow I will pay you. Both of you!,\" says bossboy Joshua. How does he make good on his threats against Tembi and MÄrit? Do you feel that his frustration and anger were justified in any way? How did you feel when his behavior was avenged by Tembi?\n\nHow does Khoza's arrival on the farm change the dynamic between Tembi and MÄrit? What aspects of Khoza's personality make MÄrit distrust him? Were you surprised when she allowed him to take her rifle? How would you characterize Khoza's loyalties to MÄrit and Tembi? Does his behavior toward the black soldiers complicate your understanding of his loyalty?\n\n\"I wouldn't lower myself to his level,\" says MÄrit. Why does she lie to Tembi about what happens between her and Khoza? How does this lie affect their friendship? Does this remark reflect a change or prejudice in MÄrit's attitudes?\n\nWhy do Khoza and Tembi force MÄrit out of her home? Why does she choose not to fight them, or punish them even when she has a clear opportunity to do so? Were you surprised that Tembi would betray MÄrit like this? Do you believe that Khoza and Tembi were justified in their actions? Why or why not?\n\nA Blade of Grass opens and closes with the image of seeds that Tembi intends to plant. How does this image undergo a transformation over the course of the novel? How do the original seeds nourish Tembi and MÄrit at various points in the book? What do the seeds at the end of the book represent?"

In \"Code Breaking\" Melinda discusses her English class where the students are reading \"The Scarlett Letter\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne. In \"The Scarlett Letter\" there is a great deal of symbolism. The book, which is set in colonial New England, takes place in a conservative, religious, Puritan community. The main character, Hester, becomes pregnant in the absence of her husband. This is a mortal sin in this community. Hester is arrested and punished by the town. During this era punishment for adultery was extreme. Hester is shunned by the community (no one will speak to her, associate with her, or be friends with her) and she is forced to wear a scarlet letter \"A\" on the exterior of all her clothing. The \"A\" stands for adultery and is meant to mark her as a sinful, shamed woman.\n\nMelinda identifies with Hester. She, too, feels shunned by her community.

      "text": "Reader's Den\n\nShare the shapes of the city's skyline begin to emerge from the fog, Mrs. Lidcote is full of worry and unable to stop mulling over her past, which she fears will become her daughter Leila's future. When she shares these fears with an old friend, Franklin, whom she meets on the boat, he tells her that times have changed, that Leila won't face the same stigma, and what's more, he proposes to Mrs. Lidcote! She has a lot to think over, and she begins to really wonder if she does have a chance of being accepted again by those who cut her out years ago.\n\nWhy does Franklin try so hard to convince Mrs. Lidcote that she is just being paranoid, and is not a social outcast? Does he really believe times have changed so much, or is he just working towards his own goal of marrying her? Maybe he is trying to convince himself?\n\nFranklin, Leila, and the relative sent to collect her, Susy, all have in common an attitude of gaiety when it comes to Leila's new marriage. They all try to convince Mrs. Lidcote that she is hopelessly old-fashioned and out of touch with the new way of doing things. Mrs. Lidcote starts to second guess herself, until it becomes clear that she is being excluded from Leila's dinner party. Why is everyone working so hard to convince her of something that doesn't seem to be true?\n\nInstead of telling her mother directly that she should not attend her dinner party, Leila insists that she must be too exhausted after her journey to come. Does it seem that everyone is treating Mrs. Lidcote like a child? Why does Leila not think her mother will be able to see that she is being excluded?\n\nBefore she returns to Europe, Franklin comes to Mrs. Lidcote's hotel room to try once more to convince her that she will be accepted in society. Despite what had happened at Leila's home, Mrs. Lidcote suddenly agrees and tells Franklin she wants to go downstairs right then and there to see some old acquaintances. It is only then that Franklin balks, and the truth is made clear: he knows that she is still an outcast. Was Mrs. Lidcote really convinced, or was she trying to test Franklin?\n\nThis story was published in 1911. Does the social world of old New York hold any relevance when you read it today? Is it enjoyable as a look at a bygone era, or do you find parallels with today's society that you relate to?\n\nPlease leave any comments and questions below, and thank you for participating in the Reader's Den! Join us next week when we will discuss Wharton's 1934 story, Roman Fever.\n\nOn one hand, this story has a specific time stamp. It's hard to imagine someone being shunned over any marital transgression that didn't involve a crime, much less being socially ostracized years after the fact for something no longer considered a big deal.\n\nAn aspect that I find more enduring: if you live long enough to have grown children, you have lived through some major changes and plenty of pendulum swings in attitudes about marriage, dating, and family matters in general. Figuring out whether and how the changes apply at every stage of life is an ongoing or recurring job for many.\n\nThanks for commenting, Anne! I think you make a good point; divorce may carry the stigma it once did, but people will always face adjustments and changes in social standards during their lifetimes.\n\nOne thing that I think remains true today is that once a person has judged another person in a certain way, it is difficult to overcome the perception of that person, whether it be positive or negative. Mrs. Lidcote's actions may not have shocked people so much were she her daughter's contemporary, but at this point people have made up their mind about her."

      "text": "Her Daughter's Dream\n\nHer Daughter's Dream - Discussion Guide\n\nDiscussion Guide\n\n1. Both Hildie and Trip miss some obvious signs that something traumatic has happened to Carolyn. What are they? Later, in chapter 4, when Hildie and Trip argue about Hildie's going back to work, Trip says, \"A little girl shouldn't be alone so much. Things could happen.\" Discuss the irony in that statement. What is it about their family dynamics that makes Carolyn vulnerable to a predator like Dock?\n\n2. Do you think Hildie's character changes from book 1 to 2? If so, how does she change and why? Did you like her more or less in this book?\n\n3. Carolyn runs away—literally and figuratively—after getting the news of her brother's tragic death. Is that a realistic response? Why or why not? Have you ever wished you could run away from a painful reality? How did you deal with it? Have you ever been in the place of Carolyn's parents and grandmother—not knowing the whereabouts of someone you love? What was that like? What advice would you give someone who is facing such a situation?\n\n4. When Carolyn meets Mary in Golden Gate Park, Mary says she felt an impulse to make extra sandwiches that morning, even though she had no idea why. Have you ever felt God nudging you to do something you didn't understand? Did you follow through on that impulse? Why or why not?\n\n5. After Carolyn comes home following her two-year disappearance, neither Hildie nor Trip presses her for details about what happened. Do you think that is wise? How does this both help and hurt Carolyn? In your own life, how can you balance being nosy with being concerned for those you love?\n\n6. When Carolyn graduates from college and pays off her debt to her parents, Trip and Hildie give the money back to her. Were you surprised by Trip and Hildie's action? Why or why not? Why is it hard for Carolyn to accept their gift? Have you ever given or received an unexpected, extravagant gift? What was the motivation behind it? What was the response?\n\n7. For many years, Carolyn finds more appealing fellowship and support in AA than she does in the church. Why is that? What does that say about AA? about the church? What finally changes Carolyn's view of Christians? Do you know anyone who has a negative view of the church? What could you say or do to encourage them to give the church another chance? What other influences does God bring into Carolyn's life to show her the truth of His love for her?\n\n8. Near the end of the story, Hildie reflects that God sent Mitch to rescue her, just as he had rescued Carolyn years earlier. In what ways does Mitch \"rescue\" Carolyn? How might her life have been different if she had never married? if she had married someone less understanding and supportive?\n\n9. Marta's choice not to move to Jenner by the Sea with Hildie and Trip seems to finally make the gap between mother and daughter so wide it can't be crossed. Why does Hildie think Marta doesn't want to move in with them? What does Marta really want? Why are they unable to discuss it rationally?\n\n10. In chapter 30, when Dawn and Carolyn go to visit Marta for a week, Marta says that \"making things easier on your children is sometimes the worst thing you can do.\" Do you agree or disagree? How do you see this illustrated in the story? in your own life?\n\n11. How does Marta change over the course of the two books? What changes her the most? In what ways is she still the same?\n\n12. When Dawn confesses to her mother that she slept with Jason, Carolyn's response is gracious and nonjudgmental. How do Carolyn's own experiences play into her response to Dawn? How would you respond to such a confession from your son or daughter? How would you like to respond?\n\n13. How does Dawn's experience of the church after she sleeps with Jason differ from Carolyn's experience after returning from Haight-Ashbury? Why is it different? How does Paster Daniel's gracious response affect Dawn's future and her walk with Christ? Have you ever been in a position to counsel someone who has made a mistake they think cannot be forgiven? What did (or would) you say?\n\n14. Near the end of the story, Dawn makes an important decision that affects the life of her unborn child. How might her struggle with miscarriage and infertility have affected her decision? What would you have done in Dawn's place? Discuss her choice not to talk about it with either her husband or her family. Was that the right way to handle it? Why or why not? How do you think Jason felt when he learned what had happened?\n\n15. In chapter 55, Dawn reads this excerpt from Marta's journal: \"We try to do a little better than the previous generation and find out in the end we've made the same mistakes without intending.\" How do you see this illustrated in the story? How have you seen negative behaviors easily turn into a habit in your own life, as Hildie mentions in chapter 56?\n\n16. When the three generations (Hildemara, Carolyn, and May Flower Dawn) finally sit down to talk, they discuss many of their \"family secrets.\" Discuss the revelations and the effect of finally getting them out into the open. Are you satisfied with what they talk about and how it goes? In what way do you wish it had been handled differently? Are the responses realistic and/or what you expected?\n\n17. At one point, Marta tells Dawn that people either weigh you down or give you wings. How do some of the characters in this saga give people wings? What can you do in your own relationships to give those you love wings instead of weighing them down?\n\n18. While Scripture makes it clear that children are not held responsible for their parents' sins (see Ezekiel 18:20), it's also true that destructive patterns tend to continue in families and have a negative impact on successive generations (see Exodus 20:5). Over the span of these two novels, what relationship patterns are repeated between mothers and daughters? between grandmothers and granddaughters? In what ways are the patterns finally broken? Is the resolution realistic? What relationship patterns—either negative or positive—have occurred in your family? If the patterns are negative, what have you done or what could you do to break them?\n\n19. Are there secrets in your family—either from generations past or from the present? To whom would you like to talk about these secrets? What kind of response do you think you would get? What response would you hope for?\n\n20. This novel contains many relationships, conversations, rifts, and moments of reconciliation. Take a few minutes to list some of your favorite scenes and tell why you were especially touched or challenged by them."

Living with them is Catherine, their niece, who falls head over heels in love with Rodolfo. Eddie is not happy, as he is incredibly overprotective of Catherine. This overprotectiveness turns to jealousy, which turns into an obsession. At the end of Act One all five characters are in the living room, sharing a cosy after dinner chat.\n\nAt this point of \"A View From The Bridge\" Eddie is feeling intensely jealous of Rodolfo and he doesn't really understand why. He talks to Alfieri about it, yet Alfieri seems to immediately understand what is going on and just before this scene hints at the bloody outcome of this tale. Marco, too, recognizes Eddie's feelings for Catherine, though he appears to be the only one in the family who sees it.\n\nThe premonition in Alfieri's soliloquy make the audience think.

How did Debra's mother, and even grandmothers, help and hurt Debra's chances for a successful life? In what ways is Debra like and unlike them? What learned or inherited mothering skills—good and bad—helped make Debra into the mother she became?\n\n3. How did Debra's father influence her choices in male partners? She says, with regard to self-esteem: \"just because you know you don't have enough doesn't mean you get some.\" It seems clear that she knows all along that she should avoid unstable men but doesn't. Why? In the end, when she makes a better choice for a life partner, why has her judgment improved?\n\n4. How did Debra come to terms with the \"race\" issue she and Marie constantly faced in small town Texas? She says she never saw her motherhood as political, \"but it has its political moments, and I can't back down.\" Should she have been more activist? Why or why not?\n\n5. Strangers comment on the fact that Debra has no extended family. Who plays the role of extended family for Debra? Also, Debra regrets chances not taken to mend her relationship with her own mother and, at the end, worries if she's repeating this mistake with her father. What determines how much contact we have with our family of origin?\n\n6. Debra seems to see this adoption as her last great chance to enter the ranks of the \"normal.\" Is she naïve about this? Does she ignore the possibility that the way she sets out to make a home and family, and where, will increase her isolation? How does the ending speak to her sense of identity? Has she made peace with this longing for normalcy?\n\n7. How do Debra's travails with Marie's hair teach her about an unfamiliar culture and, consequently, about herself? Why does Marie's hair care seem so symbolic to Debra?\n\n8. Debra continually finds herself as the solo female in groups of men: the workers on her house, the workers on her yard and fence, and her graduate school friends. How did her interactions with each group help or hinder her growth toward greater strength and stability?\n\n9. Debra is both a single mother and a mother in an interracial family. Which circumstance seems most challenging?\n\n10. How much does the sense of place inform this book? If she'd bought a house in the college town where she teaches, or one of the neighboring cities, in what ways would the story change?\n\n11. The book uses a quote from Iris Murdoch as an epigraph: \"Emotions really exist at the bottom of the personality or at the top. In the middle they are acted.\" This quote suggests that we make compromises as we try to be true to ourselves and yet also belong to a community. To be true to ourselves can feel right but isolating. Living in communities can feel cozy, but it requires white lies and self-effacement, too. What does the book say about finding the balance between living alone and living with others? How do we find this balance?\n\n12. Debra's aunt says at the end of the first chapter, \"The meaning of life is children and old people. And death.\" Has Debra discovered this meaning for herself by the end of the book? Do you agree with the aunt's statement?\n\n13. Debra writes: \"The sprawling mess of life is why we need stories, a fleeting sense of order so we return to life with the unproven but irresistible conviction our mistakes and emergencies matter, so life might make sense too.\" Do you see your own life as a story that makes sense? How do specific emergencies in the book create a greater meaning and in the end seem to impart a message? What message"

You are going to write an extended essay on one of these questions. By the end of class, please be prepared to email me which question you have chosen to write about. For Wednesday, come to class prepared to lead a discussion on the question you have chosen and also bring the beginning of a rough draft. The final essay will be on the order of two pages in length (1.5 spacing, 10 font.)\n\nThe British Hunter, Robert Wilson, respects neither one of the Macombers, whom he is guiding on safari. Summarize his attitude toward each of them. Does he have more contempt for one or the other? Do you agree with Wilson's assessment of them? If so, why? What, on the other hand, is your assessment of Wilson, both for the attitude he has toward them and the way he treats them?\n\nIn your reading of \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\", is Robert Wilson a teacher or tyrant, a hero or bully – or is he a bit of each? Does he take advantage of a weaker man? Or is his cruelty calculated to redeem Macomber' life in some way? We know how things end for Francis. How do they end for Margot?\n\nWe've noted the themes of manliness and nature in Hemingway's stories. The first theme involves a code of behavior emphasizing stoicism, courage and, in his famous phrase, \"grace under pressure.\" The second stresses the curative, purifying, redemptive powers of the natural world as opposed to the lack of honor, moral shallowness and corruption of so-called civilization. How do these themes play out in \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber?\n\nWhy is the life of the story's title character described both as \"short\" and \"happy?\" What is \"happy\" about the life that ends on the last page? What philosophy about the meaning of life does Hemingway mean to convey by the situation he describes in this story? Are the values he ascribes to Robert Wilson meant to be taken by the reader as admirable? What are the moral issues Hemingway raises in this story?"

Do not feel as though you need to respond to every question, but do not focus all your responses on just a few questions; spread them out. Also, feel free to respond more than ten times.\n\n**Make sure you read all student responses to the question you are responding to. You can respond to the question or to a student in particular--maybe you would like to address a point he or she has made. Use the \"Reply to This\" tag found at the bottom of each question and student response, and make sure you click on the right one for the particular question or student response you would like to reply to.\n\nMake sure each posting is a suitable length, not too long and not too short. Each of your responses should be approximately five sentences long.\n\nReplies to This Discussion\n\nThis statement affected my reading on how literal I took it. In my mind I was reading the book for some reason with the thought that some of it was real. He wrote it so well that I almost mistook it for being real. I mean the Vietnam war was real so maybe thats why I thought so. But either way it didn't necessarily change my view. After figuring that out I realized, isn't that what O'Brien's interpretation of a true war story is? So I read on like I would read any other book. As I read the book I looked instead for the deeper meaning of the story. And it made me wonder, which parts of the story were true? Now im curious to know which parts of the story are from his own life.\n\nAfter reading this novel, I have been surprised by the amount that I was able to connect with it, despite knowing that much of it was fictional during my reading. Therefore, when I read this final caption, I was not overly surprised. In the end, I feel that whether the story was true to actual events or not, it expressed a very meaningful theme that has seemed to really stick to me. In an earlier entry, I commented that the small \"happening truths\" made the story even more real to me. Now, I realize that these small truths still exist, but in the form of morals and lessons that I can choose to carry on with in my life. For this, I can do nothing more but appreciate O'Brien's storytelling ability that much more."

      "text": "The Color of Water: Summary of Chapter 2-5\n\nSummary of Chapter 2: The Bicycle\n\nThe memoir switches to James's point of view. When he was fourteen, and his stepfather Hunter Jordan died, the only father he had known, his mother mourned in a strange way. She took up the piano and began riding a bicycle all over the black neighborhood since she couldn't drive. They lived in St. Albans in Queens, New York, and the half-black young James is embarrassed by having a white mother who rides the bike in a conspicuous way against traffic. His stepfather had married his mother when she was a widow with eight black children. Hunter had mixed Indian and black blood and gave his mother four more children. He was the only \"Daddy\" James had known, since his own father died when his mother was pregnant with him. At fourteen, James drops out of school, takes drugs, and begins to live a street life, snatching purses. The older children are all in college or graduate school, which his mother had forced \"through sheer will power,\" (p. 7) since there was no money.\n\nJames recalls he always thought his mother strange. She did not look like her children, she did not socialize, and she could speak Yiddish. She ruled her twelve children with an iron fist and would never discuss issues of race. As a younger kid, James was at the mercy of the older siblings. There was never enough of food, clothes, musical instruments, or books to go around, so they shared everything. When James asks his mother questions about race or her background, she would avoid the topic and say, \"Educate your mind . . . Forget everything else\" (p. 13). James describes his siblings as \"ragged with wild hairdos\" (p. 14).\n\nCommentary on Chapter 2: The Bicycle\n\nThe memoir skillfully switches voices between Ruth and James throughout the book, establishing a rhythm of unfolding a fuller picture of the family and their challenges. The narrative is largely chronological but focuses on highlights or moments, such as this one when Hunter Jordan dies. Both Ruth and her son James fall apart when Hunter is gone. James takes to the street without a father figure to help him, and Ruth is lost, with a second husband gone and still five children at home to raise by herself. James begins to give us flashes of how it was to grow up in such a large and poor family that rarely had an adult around to monitor it. His mother had to work nights, and his stepfather only came home on weekends.\n\nBesides the poverty, James always had a difficult time with the question of race, who his mother was, and who he was. His part of the narrative shows the puzzling questions of a mixed race child. The mother's narrative sheds light on his questions, but was only shared much later with him when he became an adult journalist investigating his family's past. James's chapters establish his need to understand his mother's side of the family, and Ruth's narrative brings out why she was reluctant to share this information. Her memoir is honest, direct, and demonstrates her great intelligence, courage, and independence in daring to enter a mixed marriage in the 1940s.\n\nSummary of Chapter 3: Kosher\n\nRuth recounts that her mother's family had the class and money in Poland. Her father was cruder and had lower class manners, though he was respected as a rabbi. He married his mother as a ticket into America. Her mother's eldest sister and husband sponsored them to come to New York. She was two and her brother, Sam, was four when they arrived in America. Their father threatened to send them all back to Europe whenever he was mad. Her mother was terrified of the Tsar and the Kaiser and told about the cold-blooded mass killings in Polish villages.\n\nThey lived with her grandparents in Manhattan when they first arrived. Her grandparents were warm and loving, the only family members who were. They were Orthodox Jews and ate kosher, which were strict rules for eating certain foods on separate sets of dishes. There were many rules for Sabbath. Ruth could never bear sitting still. She liked to run and move. A child was not allowed to ask questions. When her grandfather died, she felt great claustrophobia about the burial rites but was not allowed to say the word, \"death,\" and she never understood it.\n\nCommentary on Chapter 3: Kosher\n\nRuth gives a strong feeling for the claustrophobic life in her family, though her grandparents were warm and loving. She remembers only arbitrary rules and not being able to ask questions. Death is frightening to her because of the rituals and finality of burial. Her grandfather looks asleep, not dead, and she feels they are burying him too soon. She never gets over the shock of death, having major breakdowns with her mother's death, and the death of her two husbands. James describes her teetering on the edge of sanity when someone close to her dies, but she just manages to bring herself back.\n\nRuth has a surprisingly detailed memory of Jewish customs, even though it happened to her fifty years ago by the time she recalls it for her son. This gives an understanding of the power of her heritage and the power it still has over her, despite her suppression of her Jewish memories. With her family performing a kaddish or ceremony for the dead for her while she was still alive, she feels the fear of premature burial, as she did with her grandfather. The desire for life explains her drive to escape a restrictive background at the young age of eighteen.\n\nSummary of Chapter 4: Black Power\n\nJames tells how his mother avoided explaining who she was as they were growing up. When he asked where she was from, she would say, \"God made me . . . I'm light-skinned\" (p. 21). He only got a few tidbits from older siblings. The children teased each other about their background. A brother told James he was adopted, and he went into a panic. His mother did not look like the children with their brown skin. His mother would comfort him that she was truly his mother, but he retains \"an ache\" (p. 23) inside him about his mixed race, and he does not know what it is.\n\nIn 1966, when he was nine, the subject of Black Power was a hot topic. Malcolm X, the militant black leader, had just been killed, and James's siblings could discuss nothing else. James is confused, because Black Power seems threatening to his white mother. His mother will not discuss politics. She has created her own world with her children: \"She insisted on absolute privacy, excellent school grades, and trusted no outsiders of either race\" (p. 27). She works the swing shift as a typist at Chase Manhattan Bank, and her only goal is to get her children educated and to church. James's parents believed that education was the way out of poverty. While Ruth trusts blacks more than whites, she tries to save her children from conflict. She sets the example by ignoring insults when she appears with her black children in public. While James worries for his white mother's safety, she herself is fearless and determined, even after getting mugged. James once hits another black kid who brags that his father is a Black Panther, thinking he is defending Mommy.\n\nCommentary on Chapter 4: Black Power\n\nJames presents a graphic picture of how confusing it was to be of mixed blood during the civil rights movement. While some of his older brothers and sisters take part in the demonstrations, he only thinks of protecting his white Mommy. He cannot understand why she is white, and she will not explain it to him, so he is always left with an ache that he cannot fix. His mother defends Malcolm X and civil rights, but she does not want her children to focus on race. She wants them to educate their minds as a way of knowing who they are.\n\nSummary of Chapter 5: The Old Testament\n\nRuth explains in her voice her father's role as a traveling rabbi in America. He would get contracts from synagogues, but since he was paid little, the family depended on charity and handouts to get by. They moved a lot. His father was not a good rabbi. She was ashamed of her mother being crippled by polio, but she explains that love was not natural to her until she became a Christian.\n\nEventually, the family ended up in Suffolk, Virginia in 1929. They were not accepted there, because they were Jews. The children called her names. When her father could make no money as a rabbi, he opened a store that sold mostly to black people, which increased the town's prejudice against them. Ruth's \"Mameh\" was a good wife and kept the religious tradition, but her family in New York ignored her, and so did her husband. The father makes everyone work hard in the store, and there was no family love. She describes her terror of her father, who sexually abused her.\n\nShe defends her choice of a black husband, saying that James's father, Dennis, \"taught me about a God who lifted me up and forgave me and made me new. I was lucky to meet him or I would've been a prostitute or dead\" (p. 43). She says the Jews were still waiting for the Messiah. She describes Passover customs.\n\nCommentary on Chapter 5: The Old Testament\n\nRuth tries to explain how she could forsake her own religious tradition for Christianity. The chapter title contrasts with the next chapter title, suggesting the harshness of Old Testament law and the New Testament law of forgiveness. Ruth's family thinks she has made a choice to lower herself and the family by marrying a black man, but what she tells us of Dennis shows his great kindness and humanity in contrast to her own family's cruelty. In her family, only her mother and grandparents show Ruth any love or understanding. Her father does everything to squash the life out of his family, using them for his own purposes. All the children run off as soon as they can, and the poor mother dies an early and sad death. The harshness and strict rules of her Jewish life are constantly seen in light of the liberation she feels in finding a loving and forgiving God. Dennis exemplifies Christianity to Ruth, for his kindness to everyone. Love is more important to her than skin color or customs"

Wouldn't the words, \"dying rich uncle who wishes to make you his heir\" mean anything to her?\n\n] I must have a different edition, couldnt find those, but I have other issues...which complicate this scene\n\n] ] My only guess is she was in such shock, she couldn't think straight.\n\n]\n\n] This is a puzzlement for me, but for many reasons... ] Jane herself started this whole pickle by writing to the uncle in the first place. Remember, Jane had this info from just before Aunt Reed died. Why did she not write from Gatehead, she was there three weeks after the funeral! It was then she learned about the money! Why did she wait until she got back to Thornfield? Or why she didn't renew the correspondence at Moor House. Or how Jane's letter got to the islands and Mr Mason got back to England in one month. Or why the heck didn't Mr Briggs have further details of the \"competency\" mentioned in Uncle's letter from three years ago.\n\n] Poor little Jane was in such a shock, she could not think straight. Yes, yet throughout the book she is such a strong character, and has such a clear head. Why did she not go find Messrs Briggs and Mason until this was all straigntened out? These guys just left her, in Thornfield, alone in a swoon? They couldn't wait to leave. Would not gentlemanlike behavior had dictated at least an offer of assistance from one of them? errr!! Why did they just leave her like that? ] :-)\n\n] ]\n\nThose exact words all together are not in the book. But the letter she got from Aunt Reed lets her know he was rich and wanted to make her his heir. A lawyer showing up at the wedding implies that her uncle hadn't made it to the poor house yet. And Mr. Briggs and Mr. Mason conveyed the dying part. Jane, who is one smart cookie, should have put two and two together.\n\nAnd you are so right about them not doing anything. Talk about letting the ball drop! It's inexcusable. Jane could have the guy's license!!\n\nI am afraid that the only answer to all this is that the author is Charlotte Bronte, not Jane Austen. The protaganists in a romance novel must SUFFER before they can be happy. Little details like what we have been discussing just get in the way of their ennobling ordeal. Therefore they are unimportant and can safely be ignored."

Is Derry necessary to the plot—or does it drag down the novel's pace?\n\n3. Describe the kind of world that Jake of 2011 finds himself in when he arrives in 1958? What changes have 50 years made in our culture? What has not changed? Do you...would you...prefer to live in one era over the other? If you were alive during the 50s and 60s, what do you recall of your life and world events? Are you ever nostalgic?\n\n4. Once in Texas, what does Jake, now George Amberson, come to learn about Lee Harvey Oswald as a human being? What kind of character is Oswald? How would you describe him?\n\n5. When Oswald arrives on the scene, why doesn't Amberson just take him out? Why does he delay?\n\n6. Follow-up to Question 5: Who is de Mohrenschildt and what is his connection to Oswald?\n\n7. Follow-up to Questions 5 & 6: What makes George (and the author) conclude that Oswald acted alone? What do you think? Have you done any prior reading that would make you agree or disagree that Oswald as the lone gunman?\n\n8. Amberson has come to believe that life is not random:\n\nCoincidences happen, but I've come to believe they are actually quite rare. Something is at work, O.K.? Somewhere in the universe (or behind it), a great machine is ticking and turning its fabulous gears.\n\nWhat does Amberson mean and what makes him believe this? Many believe in an over-arching fate or in God who oversees—and intervenes in—our lives. People often say, \"things happen for a reason.\" Do they? Are coincidences truly rare—is chance a major force in the universe? Or is there a something greater at work? What do you think?\n\n9. Follow-up to Question 8: Discuss this passage from the novel below. What does it mean? Do you agree with the vision of the world it presents, particularly the last sentence?\n\n.... A universe of horror and loss surrounding a single lighted stage where mortals dance in defiance of the dark.\n\n10. Follow-up to Questions 8, 9 & even 2: Talk about harmonics, echoes, and the butterfly effect. What are they? How do they play out in this book? What do they suggest about the danger of tampering with the past?\n\n11. Do the events in the novel—transporting Jake from 2011 to 1958, moving him from Maine to Texas, and putting him near the Oswalds—seem at all plausible? Is King able to construct his plot in such a way that it makes sense? Or is the entire construct too preposterous to be enjoyable or taken seriously as literature?\n\n12. How does King handle the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis? Do you find his treatment of it suspenseful? Or because you know the outcome, is recapping the event dull and uneventful?\n\n13. King paints a dire portrait of the world at large in the 50s and 60s—the geopolitics and existential dread of nuclear war. He's a horror writer, after all. Yet in many ways, the centerpiece of the novel is George's relationship with Sadie—the detail of their small, beautiful romance. Why would King choose to juxtapose the grand scale with the quotidian of everyday life—and an intimate love story at that?\n\n14. Why does Sadie sense that there's something odd about George? What are some of the ways that George's knowledge of the future betray him?\n\n15. Follow-up to Question 14: Why doesn't George tell Sadie who he is? How would you handle such information if you were told that the person you loved came from the future?\n\n16. What about George's sports betting? Is it a fair way to make a living? It's certainly not honest, but then again...why not? Has Jake's moral compass shifted somehow, now that he's George Amberson?\n\n17. Discuss the Yellow Card Man. What is the symbolic significance?\n\n18. How would you classify this book—Historical fiction? Science fiction? Alternate history? Romance? Thriller? Is it a suspenseful read—did you find yourself rushing to turn the page? Were you expecting George to succeed—or fail—in his mission?\n\n19. Talk about George's decision to return to 2011. Do you wish he had made a different choice? What about Sadie?\n\n20. When Jake returns to the present, in what way are things different? Is the world a better place? What does the novel suggest about the ability to change events...and thus change the course of history—a good thing or dangerous thing?\n\n21. If you've read other Stephen King books, or seen the movies, how does this book compare with his others? Has he jumped his usual genre...or expanded it? Does that fact that King's normal genre is fantasy-horror make him especially equipped as an author to write a book like 11/22/63?\n\n(Questions issued by LitLovers.

      "text": "Harry & Tonto: DISCUSSION QUESTIONS\n\nWhat is the function of the first sequence of the film? (scenes 1-5). In other words, how do those scenes provide a context for what follows in the film?\n\nThroughout the film there are numerous allusions to Shakespeare's King Lear. In that play the king steps down from his throne and resolves to divide his kingdom into three parts—one for each of his daughters. Two of the daughters declare (falsely) their love and respect of the old man. But the third refuses to make a grand expression of her love for him—and he angrily banishes her. He suffers through time spent with each of the first two daughters. Lear, forlorn and hopeless, wanders the heath and rages against the storm. His third daughter, Cordelia, raises an army and invades England—is briefly reunited with her father (and is reconciled to him), and then Cordelia is hanged in prison and Lear, broken-hearted, dies soon afterward. What resonance to the story of King Lear do you see in the story of Harry Coombs?\n\nOne critic referred to Harry Coombs as a \"connoisseur of the human condition.\" What evidence of that characterization do you see in the film?\n\nCan you remember times when Harry lost his temper in the film? What did these scenes reveal about his character?\n\nWhy was Harry's having a cat for a pet, instead of a dog for a pet, a perfect complement to his character?\n\nIn scene 27 Harry is reunited with an old flame, Jesse Stone. What did Harry gain from this interaction? In what way did it close a circle in his life? What did the hitchhiker Ginger gain from watching their interaction?\n\nSeveral times in the film Harry reminisces about his late wife, Annie. How do these scenes provide insight into his character and values? Why don't we see him talking about his late wife with the people he encounters?\n\nThere are really two basic scenes in the film beginning with sequence two: scenes where Harry is visiting with his three children and scenes of Harry on the road (to Chicago, and later, to Los Angeles). How do these scenes play off one against the other? What is being resolved in each set of scenes?\n\nThere are two prominent deaths portrayed in the film. What is their function in the film?\n\nDid you detect any pattern in Harry's interactions with authority figures in the film? For example: the police trying to evict him, the woman at the morgue (scene 14), the airport security folks (scene 16), and the greyhound bus driver (scene 19).\n\nHere are the main players in Harry's life in the film. In each case, analyze the basis of Harry's relationship to these individuals (or types).\n\nOld friends: Analyze the role of these old friends in Harry's life.\n\nPolice trying to evict him\n\nJacob Rivetowski\n\nLeroy\n\nNew friends: Analyze Harry's secret for making new friends.\n\nNorman (his grandson)\n\nGinger (hitchhiker)\n\nFamily. Analyze the dynamics of Harry's relationship with each of his three\nchildren. Why can't Harry live with any of his children? I know the\nthought has occurred to you: if Harry is such a special and magical character,\nthen why have his children turned out the way they turned out\n\nBurt\n\nShirley\n\nEddie\n\nHere is a list of the people Harry Coombs interacts with (other than friends and family members). Most of the people below are strangers—a few have become acquaintances. Do you discern any patterns to his interactions with other people? What does Harry bring to each interaction? What attracts people to Harry Coombs—and vice-versa?\n\nJesus, the grocer (scene 2)\n\nAn old woman he meets when we see him enter the building (scene 4)\n\nThe landlady in the apartment building—when Harry is looking for a new place (scene 12)\n\nThe old man who waves Burt and Harry down and asks for a handout (scene 13)\n\nThe taxi driver at the airport (scene 17)\n\nThe old guy on the bus (scene 18)\n\nTrader Nick (scene 20)\n\nThe African American family in Fort Wayne (scene 26)\n\nThe old traveling salesman (scene 32)\n\nThe sultry hooker (scene 35)\n\nThe middle-aged compulsive gambler (scene 37)\n\nThe American Indian, Sam Two Feathers (scene 39)\n\nAnatol, the old guy with the beret in Santa Monica (scene 43)\n\nThe chess player, a middle-aged guy, who talks philosophy with Harry (scene 43)\n\nThe cat woman (scene 44)\n\nThe little girl on the beach (scene 45)\n\nHere are some quotes—the wisdom of Harry Coombs—as they appear in the film. Which of these quotes means the most to you? Why?\n\nIt's all run down. It all runs down sooner or later\" (scene 5)\n\n\"You know people—that's home\" (scene 5)\n\n\"That's life. An old man loses his home, and he's just a wanderer\" (scene 7)\n\n\"Doesn't matter how old a man is. He needs his privacy.\" (scene 11a)\n\n\"Oh, we had good times.

      "text": "--a traveling funeral--and she wants the most important women in her life as \"pallbearers.\"\n\nFrom Sonoma to Manhattan, Katherine, Laura, Rebecca, Jill, and Marie will carry Annie's ashes to the special places in her life. At every stop there's a surprise encounter and a small miracle waiting, and as they whoop it up across the country, attracting interest wherever they go, they share their deepest secrets--tales of broken hearts and second chances, missed opportunities and new beginnings. And as they grieve over what they've lost, they discover how much is still possible if only they can unravel the secret Annie left them....\n\n1.Annie Freeman's Fabulous Traveling Funeral opens with the dilemma of Katherine's disintegrating Bali bra. What does this situation tell us about her personality? In what way does it set the perfect tone? What enables the UPS driver to be so empathetic?\n\n2. What were your first impressions of Annie G. Freeman after reading her obituary? How did you envision her by the end of the novel? What made her such a tireless champion for so many overlooked realms of humanity?\n\n3. What did Annie mean in her instructions when she wrote, \"Honor me now and you will honor yourselves\"?\n\n4. Did Annie's friendship with Katherine change very much from the time they were teenagers? How did \"Katie\" respond to Annie's suicide attempt? What were the greatest comforts they gave to each other over the years?\n\n5. When Annie becomes Jill's protégé in Chapter Five, she says that she does not want to be challenged irresponsibly or tricked, and \"I don't want to have to stand on my head to get a promotion.\" She also asks to be mentored and trained. What would it take to make such on-the-job negotiations the norm, full of candor and benevolence?\n\n6. What transformations does Laura make during the traveling funeral? What is the significance of her prophetic feelings? Why was she the ideal lifeline for Annie on the night she was attacked?\n\n7. What do Annie and Rebecca teach each other about control? What was at the heart of their initial struggle to get along as neighbors?\n\n8. In what way is Marie distinct from the other women? What is the source of the special traits that make her a gifted hospice worker? What was the effect of her intangible presence on the trip, by cell phone and memory?\n\n9. What do all of Annie's friends have in common? How does the theme of rescue and healing play out in their traveling funeral? What variations did you notice in the thoughts and responses recorded in the journal?\n\n10. Discuss the men in Annie's life, ranging from John and their sons to the mysterious ex-husband who observes them in Manhattan. How was she able to balance love and independence? How would you characterize her life: bittersweet? Exhilarating?\n\n11. Compare each of the destinations on Annie's itinerary. How do the landscapes form a complete portrait of her? What aspects of her life are captured by the various \"guides\" encountered on the trip?\n\n12. Do you agree with the airport anthropologist's theory that the death of a loved one can restore other relationships in our lives? How have your friends, family, and community traditionally responded to grief? Why does the traveling funeral resonate with so many strangers near the end of their journey?\n\n13. Discuss Balinda's presence. What is the role of spontaneity and improvisation in the traveling funeral? How do Balinda's plans for her mother convey the new perspective rippling throughout the travelers?\n\n14. In Chapter Twenty-eight, Annie's friends express their anger--toward her, toward her death, and over the end of their beautiful time together. What healing comes from this anger?\n\n15. If you were to plan your own traveling funeral, who would your \"pallbearers\" be? What places would you want them to visit together? What untold chapters of your life would you like them to discover along the way?"

Joe then tries to remember \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" by Tennyson and \"When the Frost is on the Pumpkin\" by Riley. Joe runs through the planets, the Ten Commandments, and assorted psalms. Joe regrets how little he memorized of all of these things because now he cannot use them to entertain himself for long stretches of time.\n\nJoe decides to start at the beginning with an idea and somehow teach himself something new. He decides to start with an idea that relates to telling time. He realizes he cannot calculate the time between the day in September 1918 when he was hit with a shell and the day he awoke and discovered he was deaf. But the idea of counting time has been in his head for a while. Joe's first thought is to track the seconds, minutes, and hours between each nurse's visit until he gets to twenty-four hours, so he would know what schedule the nurses kept. But Joe cannot concentrate long enough to count the seconds correctly. He realizes that this method is too complicated, so he decides to focus on simpler schedules like how often his bowel movements and bed changes occur in nurse's visits.\n\nEventually, Joe realizes that he can sense the outside world with his skin and decides that he should attempt to feel the sunrise. He reasons that the nurse probably bathes him in the mornings, as nurses do their heavy work in the morning. He calculates that the nurse probably visits him roughly every two hours, so he decides to count up to her last visit before dawn and then prepare himself to feel the change in temperature that accompanies sunrise. Joe executes his plan and triumphantly feels the warmth on his neck. Joe feels a part of the world, as dawn is happening to many others at the same time. Joe imagines himself watching dawn move over his old town and the mountains of Colorado. He feels grateful for the gift of time.\n\nChapter xii\n\nJoe celebrates his New Year's Eve exactly one year after he manages to keep time. He remembers various New Year's images from his life in Colorado and Los Angeles. Keeping time has become easier for Joe as he has became accustomed to the nurses' schedules and has learned to tell the nurses apart from the diffrent vibrations they make. Joe likes his regular nurse—the day nurse—and guesses that she is middle-aged, heavier, and used to her work, as she does it briskly. Joe can tell when a new nurse comes on duty because he can feel her take off his sheet, look at him for the first time, and then cry or even leave the room to be sick. All these observations help Joe organize his new universe. Now that he can keep time, he makes sure to imagine himself taking a walk in the woods outside Paris on every Sunday afternoon.\n\nJoe thinks of Kareen, as he left her when she was nineteen. Thinking of her is the only time he becomes homesick and wishes he were in an American hospital. Joe knows that he cannot even be identified as an American. Joe decides that he is probably among Englishmen, as he was stationed next to a regiment of \"Limeys\" when he was hit.\n\nJoe remembers the strangeness of the Englishmen, especially one Scottish man who refused to fight the Germans once he learned that there were Bavarians fighting with them (Scotland had a connection to Bavaria through Crown Prince Rupert of the Stuart line). To Joe's surprise, the Englishmen did not shoot the Scotchman; instead, they merely transferred him to another location where there were no Bavarians fighting.\n\nJoe remembers a day when the Englishmen glimpsed a German soldier stumbling blindly out in the open and decided to shoot at him. The soldier was killed, but he remained hanging on the barbed wire not far from the English regiment's trenches. The dead German began to smell, so an English corporal passing through the area ordered the regiment's leader, Corporal Timlon, to bury the German. Timlon did bury the German, but then the area was shelled and the buried German resurfaced, hanging on the barbed wire again.\n\nAt this point, the Englishmen named the German man \"Lazarus.\" The colonel came back through and ordered Lazarus buried again, this time with a full Church of England funeral service said over the body. Corporal Timlon obeyed and was shot in the rear end while reading the service. Several days later, however, the German body resurfaced again after shelling, and the Englishmen opened fire on the body. Shortly afterward, a young subaltern assigned to the English regiment snuck out on his first night patrol and stumbled into the body of Lazarus. The young Englishman went permanently mad and was sent to a mental hospital. Joe imagines swapping minds with the young Englishman, who is probably no longer using his healthy body.\n\nAnalysis\n\nJohnny Got His Gun continues to be paced peculiarly. An undefined amount of time passes between Chapter x and Chapter xi, while one year passes between Chapter xi and Chapter xii; the chapters themselves proceed at pace. In Book I, we see Joe struggle to keep his sanity and to assert his consciousness against the onslaught of memories. Joe learns to recognize that he is remembering memories, not reliving them, and he learns to recognize the difference between sleeping and waking hours. The establishment of these mental boundaries allows Joe to feel like a conscious, thinking being again. Book II charts Joe's progress as a conscious, thinking being as he tries to organize his mental world.\n\nThe shift from a preoccupation the past to a focus on the future that happens between Book I and Book II also happens on a smaller scale within Chapter xi. Joe begins the chapter attempting to fill up his mental life with lessons remembered from his youth—mathematics, grammar, literature, religion. But Joe ultimately realizes that he never learned enough to make this mode of preoccupation worthwhile. Instead, he looks forward, deciding to try to teach himself new things. He works first on the project of telling time. Instead of trying to fill up the empty space of his time, he works to divide that time up into measurable segments.\n\nIn Chapter xii, Joe's internal world begins to come alive with details from the external world. He has also gained greater control over his memories. Instead of letting them wash over him while he is in a semiconscious state, Joe measures them out, using them to fill time, as with his repeated Sunday afternoon walks in the woods outside of Paris. Sometimes, he uses his memories to rehearse a story line, as with the memory of Lazarus.\n\nThe story about Lazarus begins as a tale of how different Joe considers the English to be, but it ends with Joe declaring solidarity with the young English subaltern: \"wherever you are we have lots in common we are brothers.\" The Lazarus story again raises the idea of the decay and disgustingness encountered during war—a theme also touched on by Joe's rat story and dream in Chapter vii. The subaltern and Joe are not \"brothers\" because they were fighting together against the Germans, rather because they are both victims of the overwhelming bodily horrors of war. In fact, the Lazarus story emphasizes the fact that solidarity does not necessarily fall along battle lines: the Scotsman feels more solidarity with the Bavarians against whom he is fighting than with the English with whom he was fighting. Joe's story stresses the foreignness of the English regiment while creating sympathy for the wandering German, who is arbitrarily shot down and becomes \"Lazarus.\" Solidarity in battle is not created by recognition of allies and enemies, but instead by mutual experience and recognition of the bodily horrors of war."

      "text": "4. Synopsis and Activities: Act Two\n\nThe scene opens in the studio and dominating the space is a large image of both Australian and British women bowing to the Japanese. This huge image remains throughout most of the scene and the audience cannot escape its meaning. Both Bridie and Sheila are present and Bridie is off to one side singing the Captive's 'Hymn' (with the women's choir). Sheila is speaking to the camera and her answers to the questions are juxtaposed with Bridie's singing. In this interview we learn about the situation in Belalau and the Japanese order that had been issued to kill every prisoner of war.\n\nBridie's illness and the way in which Sheila looked after her is made public—but Sheila baulks at telling the whole truth about how she acquired the drugs to save her, making up the story of the shoe-horn saving her. This information is picked up by the interviewer as if it is highly significant. The scene ends with the story of Curtin's message: 'Keep smiling, girls'. The horror of this command is emphasised by the image of Curtin and the prisoners and the Judy Garland song.\n\nStudent activities\n\n27. Make notes on the factual information that is revealed about the war.\n\n28. Make notes on the way that Sheila has responded to the events of the war. Examine the ways in which she uses language in this scene to both reveal and hide her feelings.\n\n29. Make notes on the ideas or issues that are highlighted by the dramatic form of this scene.\n\nScene Ten\n\nThe transition to this scene holds the image of emaciated male prisoners in view as we move into a space that is neither hotel room nor studio although both characters are still wearing body microphones. Sheila has not gone to lunch and is sitting doing some kind of tapestry—an image of stitching things together. Bridie comments on the photograph of the soldiers—a comment that stimulates a riposte from Sheila about the role of the government in suppressing information about the women's role in the war. This interaction between the on-stage action and the projected visual images connects past and present.\n\nTheir conversation reveals the tension that is now out in the open. Recriminations flow as Bridie tries to make sense of what she has learned and Sheila tries to defend her actions, not only with the Japanese but also in leaving Bridie after the war. The intercutting of Rick's voice into their altercation leaves them not knowing how much he has heard. The juxtaposition of the song 'I'll Walk Alone' suggests the isolation of each of these victims of this dreadful situation.\n\nStudent activities\n\n30. Make notes on the factual information that is revealed about the war.\n\n31. Make notes on their view of the relationship between the women in this scene. Consider what might be causing the tensions that are evident in the scene.\n\n32. Make notes on the ideas or issues that are highlighted by the dramatic form of this scene.\n\nScene Eleven\n\nThis scene is back in the studio and the visual image of the postcards seems dwarfed beside the projected images that we have previously seen. The recitation of the words of each of the postcards leads the women back into their memories. The moments of darkness highlight the pain of these experiences.\n\nIn this scene the image of the sonata becomes significant as the women trawl back through their memories together. In this scene, one of the most important issues of the play is highlighted—the complete lack of acknowledgement by the Australian government juxtaposed with the pitifully small amount of compensation paid by the Japanese government to these victims of the power play of these sovereign states.\n\nStudent activities\n\n33. Make notes on the factual information that is revealed about the war.\n\n34. Discuss the feelings that the women reveal about their memories in this scene.\n\n35. Make notes on the ideas or issues that are highlighted by the dramatic form of this scene.\n\nScene Twelve\n\nThis scene takes place in the motel room. Bridie is attempting to re-establish their relationship despite the obvious tensions between them. It is in this scene that we learn of Bridie's 'crime' in the David Jones' food hall. We now understand how she feels and why she reacted in this way. Sheila's reaction to this confession allows us to see how deeply scarred these women have been by their experiences—not only by the Japanese, but also by the responses and inaction of their own countries. Sheila's realisation is that it is important not only for themselves but for the thousands of others similarly afflicted to tell these stories in public. Bridie is not yet convinced and the tension between them arises again. We are now aware that this tension is about the present, the past, memories, recollections, reconstructions, truth, shame and guilt. The moment of darkness returns, followed by images of 'great men' of history and the song, 'Whispering Grass'.\n\nStudent activities\n\n36. Make notes on the factual information that is revealed about the war.\n\n37. Make notes on the ideas about truth and lies that are revealed in this scene.\n\n38. Make notes on the ideas or issues that are highlighted by the dramatic form of this scene.\n\nScene Thirteen\n\nThis scene cuts straight into the interview as both Bridie and Sheila recount their experiences as the war draws to an end. We hear about the diaries and the burning of these by the British. This is overlaid with images ofHiroshimaand the news of the death ofPearlafter the war had officially ended. There is a sense of calm as both women recount these events, although at one significant moment Sheila's composure cracks. It is at this point that we see the symbiotic relationship that the women had previously enjoyed. As Bridie finishes recounting the anecdote that Sheila had begun they join hands and relive, together, that moment of memory and reconciliation. The playing of the 'Blue Danube Waltz' is a counterpoint to their memories. Dancing becomes associated with life and joy and hope and survival, and this is juxtaposed with the Japanese atrocities in Belalau and the visual images of the celebrations of the end of the war.\n\nThe scene reaches a climax as the confessions of the two women are made public. This is the moment of truth as Bridie tells about Sheila's personal sacrifice and Sheila tells of Bridie's theft from David Jones. The simplicity of these truths juxtaposed with the official 'lies' of the government ring out with a clarity and candour that is underlined by the gradual darkness that follows the revelation. This scene ends with the sounds of the hymn 'An Epitaph to War', images of the women recuperating and the huge projected image of the army nurses arriving in\nSingapore.\n\nStudent Activities\n\n39. Make notes on the factual information that is revealed about the war.\n\n40. Examine the relationship between the characters that is revealed in this scene.\n\n41. Make notes on the ideas or issues that are highlighted by the dramatic form of this scene.\n\nScene Fourteen\n\nThe filming has finished, and Bridie is reading a newspaper—a poignant symbol of the official version of news. The two colleagues and friends are now reunited and this is contained in the image of the lifting of the suitcase. While most of the tension has been released there is still some unresolved business to be dealt with. Sheila holds out the shoe-horn, now the symbol not only of their reunion, but also of their reconciliation. The two women embrace. The play ends with them women dancing to the 'Blue Danube' and in the slowly darkening space the final spotlight falls on the shoe-horn.\n\nStudent activities\n\n42. Make notes on the factual information that is revealed about the war.\n\n43. Discuss the reconciliation that has taken place between the characters.\n\n44.

It is a part of the Hindu philosophy instead. This is an example of Murs open mind and how he is willing to try out anything and will believe in what he wants to believe in. He won't be told by somebody else what his beliefs should be.\n\nPreacher and the leader of the choirs are the most highly looked upon in the Church since they are placed in very important positions.

Murs is also concerned over that the leader of the choir doesn't have a wife yet despite his supposed devout faith. So many things in his religion didn't go together. That the people in the highest placed position were going against there religion and doing wrongs. This made Murs start to question his faith.\n\nMurs went his own way when it came to religion and decided for himself what he wanted to believe in, instead of just being told to believe in something. Murs got into following the Nation Of Islam beliefs from The Final Call newspaper.\n\nThe Final Call was a the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam. It was founded by Minister Louis Farrakhan. It reports national and international news. It is also used as a way of communication with the Nation of Islam.\n\nMurs began to question his faith and belief in God. If God was supposed to help him, how come when Murs' life got harder, Murs felt like God wasn't there to help him.

      "text": "Up Coming Books\n\n1. The story line in this book has an ever-present theme of the relationships between parents and children, especially between a mother and her child. What kind of relationship did you have with your parents as a child? As an adult? Are there any parallels between your own parental relationships and those of the characters?\n\n2. Will is described as having \"strangely dysfunctional relationships with all of the women in his life\" (120). Do you agree with this assessment? By the end of the book, does it seem as if he is improving his relationships with women? How so?\n\n3. There are many different women in this book with different roles in law enforcement. How are their positions similar? How are they different? Do you think it was easier for the younger women to establish their careers in what is still a male dominated line of work?\n\n4. Do you think Will's assumption of Evelyn's involvement in her team's corruption affected the way he pursued her kidnapping? Did Amanda's withholding of information from Will affect the progression of the case?\n\n5. When speaking on the subject of women and minorities trying to make careers in the police force in the 1960's and 1970's, Amanda says, \"Every single day was a struggle to do right when everything around you was wrong\" (119). What do you think she means by this? Do you think her perception of the situation was accurate?\n\n6. When visiting Boyd Spivey in prison, Will reflects on the living situations of the prisoners and how they are de-humanized. He thinks of their living conditions as \"heartbreaking\". When he considers the crimes that landed them in prison, however, he seems to change his mind. Do you agree with Will's sentiments? Should you feel sympathy for the prisoners at all? Or do they deserve the treatment they receive?\n\n7. Before Faith goes off to be questioned by the Atlanta police, Amanda hugs her and says, \"You've got two minutes to pull yourself together. If these men see you cry, all you will be to them for the rest of your career is a useless woman\" (139). Is this judgment accurate in your mind? If Faith were a man in the same situation, would crying elicit the same negative connotation?\n\n8. \"Mystery is good for a relationship,\" Will says to Sara, in a joking manner (186). Do you think there is some truth to that statement? How could this \"mystery\" in both familial and romantic relationships be seen as a theme in the book?\n\n9. A pregnant fourteen year-old is not common these days, though it's not an usual occurrence, either. Back in the early 90s, when Jeremy was born, Faith and her family endured ostracization and alienation. In most areas of the United States today, that would not be the case. Have things changed for the better, or are they worse?\n\n10. When reflecting on the secret that led to her kidnapping and torture, Evelyn thinks the kidnappers would not believe her because, \"The truth was too disappointing. Too common\" (205). What is your opinion of the true motivation behind the crime revealed at the end of the book? Do you think Evelyn is correct in thinking it disappointing and common?\n\n11. The prisoners in the book have remarkable means of communicating both within the prison and with the outside world. Even prisoners like Boyd Spivey and Roger Ling, who should technically have no access to any information outside of their cells, are usually better informed than the GBI investigators visiting them. What, if anything, can and should be done to inhibit outside communication?\n\n12. This novel is told through the viewpoints of several different characters. How does this technique aid the narrative? How does each point of view give the reader insight into the case?\n\nThe Shoemaker's Wife by Adriana Trigiani\nTuesday July 9th, 12:00 p.m.\nBring your lunch. Dessert and lemonade will be provided.\n\n1. The novel is split into three parts: Italian Alps, Manhattan and Minnesota. How would you characterize Ciro and Enza in each of these sections? How do they adapt to their new homes? In what ways did they change over the course of the novel? In what ways did they remain the same?\n\n2. How would the course of both Ciro's and Enza's lives have been different if they hadn't gone to America? Do you think they would have ended up together if they had stayed on the mountain?\n\n3. Enza and Ciro shared their first kiss beside Stella's grave. In what ways did digging the grave open up Ciro's heart?\n\n4. When Ciro opened up his duffle bag on the ship to America, \"the fragrance of the convent laundry—lavender and starch—enveloped him, fresh as the mountain air of Vilminore\" (p. 120). What other aspects of convent life stayed with Ciro and Eduardo after they left? What did they learn from the sisters?\n\n5. Enza \"found a best friend in Laura, but so much more\" (p. 195). What do you think made Laura and Enza's bond so deep from the beginning? In what ways did they support one another?\n\n6. Did anything surprise you about the characterization of Enrico Caruso? How would you describe his relationship with those around him? How did the time he spent with Enza and Laura affect them, even decades later?\n\n7. How does The Shoemaker's Wife portray the immigrant experience? Do any of your own families have a similar immigrant history? Did they have a different experience?\n\n8. Enza and Ciro have different views of religion. In what ways do their beliefs shape their actions and relationship?\n\n9. How do you think Enza's life would have turned out if she had married Vito? If Ciro had married Felicitá? What did Vito and Felicitá offer them and what did they lack?\n\n10. Carlo Lazzari warned Eduardo to \"beware the things of this world that can mean everything or nothing\". In what ways did this advice ring true throughout the novel?\n\n11. What effect did fighting in the Great War have on Ciro? Do you believe he returned to Manhattan a changed man, or did the war just force him to acknowledge what he had known all along?\n\n12. When Ciro saw Enza on the steps of Our Lady of Pompeii church, moments away from marrying Vito, \"it seemed like fate was on his side.\" Do you believe that fate brought Ciro and Enza together on that day? Overall, do you believe that Ciro and Enza were destined to be together?\n\n13. Enza once said to Ciro: \"I remind you, I imagine, of things you'd rather not think about.\" What do you believe Enza meant by this? What challenges did Ciro and Enza face in their relationship? How did they differ in their ways of communicating?\n\n14. How did Ciro, Enza and Antonio each react to Ciro's diagnosis? What were Ciro's fears and hopes for his family? In what ways will Enza and Antonio fulfill his dreams?\n\n15. At the end of the novel, Enza agrees to return to Italy with Antonio and Angela. How do you imagine the reunion between Enza and her family? How will Schilpario be different for Enza when seen through Angela and Antonio's eyes?\n\n1. Did you like Libby as a character? Do you think the author intended for her to be likeable?\n\n2. As the book shifted between points of view, did you find one most appealing, most enlightening, or most reliable?\n\n3. Why has Libby ignored Jim Jeffreys's advice to earn an income for so many years? Do you believe she feels she's earned the money she's been gifted by strangers? What is her attitude toward money?\n\n4. Throughout the book, many characters seem to feel as though life is something that happens to them; others take a more proactive role in steering its course, often with disastrous consequences. Discuss the book's theme of action versus reaction, investigation versus acceptance. Where does Libby's behavior fit in this contrast?\n\n5. Like others Libby meets during her investigation, Barb Eichel seems pleased to have been contacted, having \"wondered if you'd ever get in touch.\" Why did Barb wait for Libby to come to her? Did Barb do enough to remedy the harm she thinks her book has done?\n\n6. As Lyle first brings Libby through the Kill Club gathering, he distinguishes between different types of members—role players and solvers, for instance. Do you consider these to be meaningful differences? How do the various groups make use of the club?\n\n7. In considering the case of the missing girl Lisette Stephens, Libby thinks to herself, \"There was nothing to solve.... She just vanished for no reason anyone could think of, except she was pretty.\" Do you think it's strange that Libby considers this an uninteresting case? What does her attitude toward Lisette say about her view of her own family's murder? Was there something to \"solve\" in the Days' murder?\n\n8. What do you make of Magda, the middle-class Kill Club member so fond of Ben, and so callous to her own son? What does her character tell us, if anything, about the Kill Club and its members?\n\n9. One of the appealing aspects of the Day case (according to Lyle) is the role of children as instigators, victims, and unreliable witnesses. Do you see any similarities among Krissi's accusation, Libby's false eyewitness account, and Lyle's role in the California fires? Were these children to blame for their mistakes? In what ways did they attempt to right the wrongs they caused?\n\n10. \"No one ever forgives me for anything,\" one character says. What role does forgiveness play in Dark Places? Which characters should be more forgiving? Less?\n\n11. What do you think of Diondra's relationships? Why is she attracted to Ben? Why is Trey such a constant companion? Do you think she was romantically involved with Trey?\n\n12. Patty Day frequently worries whether she is a good mother. What do you think? How does the book depict parents in general? Who do you consider the \"good\" and \"bad\" parents in the book?\n\n13. Did you think Ben was guilty? Does the author intend for us to doubt him?\n\n14. Why doesn't Diane return Libby's phone calls? What does she mean at the end of the book when she says, \"I knew you could do it.... I knew you could...try just a little harder\"? Do you like Diane?\n\n15. Why do you think Libby, at the end of the book, thinks twice before shoplifting? Is this reflective of a new attitude toward the world? How?\n\n16. Do you think Ben will find Crystal? What do you imagine their reunion would be like? 17. Why do you think the author chose to set the murders on a farm? What images and themes does the heartland and farming evoke?\n\n18. Libby is a liar, a manipulator, a kleptomaniac, and an opportunist. Does she have any redeeming qualities? Are you able to empathize with her? If so, why?"

He swears he's turned over a new leaf but his ever-suspicious wife, Charlotte, can't be sure. After all, Curtis is on the road a lot. Charlotte herself is no angel and she's keeping plenty of secrets from Curtis. One is the strange behavior of their daughter Marissa—who actually may not be Curtis's child at all. Another is a disturbing visit from Curtis's so-called brother, a man Curtis has asked Charlotte not to see. When Curtis discovers what's going on, Charlotte finds herself between the proverbial rock and a hard place, and she has some tough decisions to make if she wants to salvage her marriage.\n\nQuestions for Discussion\n\n1.

      "text": "The correct answer is D. Because the husband is speaking, and the wife has refused his request to turn around, we can assume that he believes she's deliberately provoking him or infuriating him enough to cause action. Choice E, threaten is obviously too harsh. More than likely, she wouldn't threaten anyone. Choices A and C are not close to the meaning; to coerce means to force someone to do something, and to intimidate means to get someone to do something by fear. He intimidates and coerces her, not vice versa. The only choice that's close is Choice B, hassle. However, because the word tends to have a more light-hearted connotation, Choice D is the better answer.\n\n2. Which of the following is NOT a likely inference based on the information in the passage?\n\nA. Patty from down the road is the wife's best friend.\nB. The husband seems to be truly sorry for what he's done at the end.\nC. The wife sees no way out of the relationship but suicide.\nD. The husband values his job more than his wife.\nE. The housekeeper found the wife in the bathtub.\n\nThe correct answer is A. Here, we're looking for the one phrase that we could NOT infer from the passage. Choice B IS a likely inference; he cries at the end. Choice C IS a likely inference since the wife commits suicide in the story (or the evidence points to that). Choice D IS a likely inference, since the husband ignores the wife's obvious turmoil and goes to his meeting in Chicago instead of staying with her. Plus he assaults her regularly. Choice E IS a likely inference, because the housekeeper reported that the wife had an empty Valium bottle in her hand. Choice A IS NOT a likely inference because a best friend wouldn't be referred to as \"Patty from down the road\". Plus, it seems likely that the wife probably didn't have a best friend at all if suicide seems like the only way out for her.\n\n3. The author most likely includes the information in lines 10 – 14 in order to:\n\nA. compare what happened to the wife recently to the abuse that happened in her childhood.\nB. explain that the husband had a pattern of abuse and probably wouldn't stop any time soon.\nC. demonstrate the wife's weakness.\nD. intensify the scene by describing the wife's injuries in full detail.\nE. critique the wife's willingness to let her husband get away with physical abuse.\n\nThe correct answer is B. Here, we need to look closely at the lines indicated by the question and ask, \"Why did the author write these lines specifically?\" Choice B is the best answer because the lines show how his open hand, his fist and a belt have all administered abuse. If it happened in the past, it will probably continue to happen. Choice A is not correct because although a comparison is made (at least it's not with the belt), it's not comparing any kind of abuse other than domestic violence. Choice C is incorrect because although the wife does appear weak throughout the story, during those lines, she's ironic, offering an almost positive outlook on her abuse. Choices D and E are inaccurate because the wife's injuries aren't described in much detail and no critique of her behavior is made.\n\nA. Her husband takes a flight to Chicago.\nB. Her husband walks into the house.\nC. Her husband runs through the rain.\nD. Her husband slams his fist into the wall.\nE. Her husband purchases roses.\n\nThe correct answer is E. This is simply a matter of remembering the chronology of the story and reading accurately. Which events come after the beginning of the story when the wife is looking out the window? Well, the only thing that could have happened before the wife looks out the window, which is an easier way to tackle the question, is the husband purchasing roses because he walks in with them while she's standing at the window. Hence, everything else must come after.\n\n5. The passage provides information that answers which of the following questions?\n\nI. Does the husband hold a powerful position at work?\nII. What kind of personality traits does the wife display?\nIII. Does the wife's relationships with others in the neighborhood affect her married life?\n\nA. I only\nB. I and II only\nC. I and III only\nD. II and III only\nE. I, II, and III\n\nThe correct answer is B. This is a funny question in that you don't have to actually answer the questions behind the Roman Numerals. Your only goal is to determine whether or not you could answer the questions based on the information given in the text if you needed to. Question I is answerable (he has to fly to Chicago; he has purchased a Mercedes; they employ a housekeeper, etc.). We can reasonably assume that he has a powerful position, so we can answer that question. Question II is answerable (she is meek, forgiving, weak, a sucker for punishment, etc.) We could name a bunch of different personality traits of the wife. Question III, however, is unanswerable because we don't know about any relationships she has with anyone in the neighborhood besides Patty. And that one seems very cursory at best. Therefore, the correct answer is Choice B. The passage provides info to answer questions I and II only."

So, it wouldn't really matter *how* fat or skinny the senior Musgroves were - if there were 5 people in the carriage, Mary's chances of being squashed would still have depended on whether she was sitting next to one other person or two other people (unless there was little leg room as well)!"

Are there any circumstances where it might be acceptable to go back on one's word? Give an example.\n\n8. Matthew objected to the play Macbeth because of an old prejudice. Was he justified in his stand? Where do you see similar reactions in today's world? Do you have any old prejudices that might need to be reviewed in this light?\n\n9. Ellie enjoyed Marcus Beldon's attention because she saw him as educated and influential. Are we ever swayed when someone we see as more attractive than our spouse seeks us out? Is there such a thing as a \"harmless\" flirtation?\n\n10. In managing the farm after Matthew left, Ellie discovered strengths she didn't realize she possessed. This happens today when loved ones are in the military, or taken seriously ill. How do you visualize her readjustment to her former role after Matthew returned?\n\n11. Traveling the southern Illinois circuit served as an object lesson for Matthew. Would he have learned the importance of remaining faithful to his church otherwise? Think of some occasions where you received your most important lessons—were they preached to you or did you learn the hard way?"

      "text": "–in–\nBut Sigrid is not the only one with secrets.\nA high ranking SS officer and his family move down the hall and Sigrid finds herself pulled into their orbit. A young woman doing her duty–year is out of excuses before Sigrid can even ask her any questions. And then there's the blind man selling pencils on the corner, whose eyes Sigrid can feel following her from behind the darkness of his goggles.\nSoon\nIn this page–turning novel, David Gillham explores what happens to ordinary people thrust into extraordinary times, and how the choices they make can be the difference between life and death.\n\nDISCUSSION QUESTIONS\n\nWhy do you think Sigrid helps Ericha at the cinema in the opening of the book? If you had been in Sigrid's situation, would you have helped Ericha? Would you have become as involved as Sigrid does? With the advantage of hindsight, our perspective is no doubt skewed; since we know the truth behind what was happening in Nazi Germany, how do our answers compare with Sigrid's bold decisions?\n\nAs the story progresses, Sigrid grows more and more involved and takes more and more risks. How does her reasoning for doing so later differ from the reasoning behind her first risky decision in the cinema? What is her motivation for making these increasingly dangerous choices? Desire? Excitement? Conscience?\n\nDiscuss the theme of betrayal in City of Women. Many of the characters are guilty of double–crossing and treachery. In what ways do they deceive one another? What about Egon? Is his betrayal portrayed differently from that of others, such as Renate or Ericha?\n\nSigrid's relationships are numerous and varied—with her mother–in–law, her neighbors, her coworkers, her husband, her lovers, the so–called U–boats. How does each of them define who Sigrid is? How is she reflected in the various relationships? How have these bonds been altered by the extraordinary circumstances of war?\n\nWere you surprised by the depiction of Berlin during World War II? Before reading the novel, had you thought about what life was like on the German home front as the tide turned and defeat loomed on the horizon?\n\nCountless times throughout the novel, characters risk their lives to help others—to protect the value of human life, spurred on by their own integrity. Conversely, there is the scene on the bus where no one does anything as a Jewish woman is arrested and brutalized. Which do you think is typical of human behavior? Are people more inclined to avert their eyes and try to stay out of trouble, or risk their own safety and get involved? Why?\n\nIf one simply observes the facts at surface value, Sigrid would probably not be considered a righteously moral individual. Nonetheless, she manages to be a very sympathetic character. How does the author accomplish this?\n\nSigrid's coworker Renate seems to have a sensibility similar to hers. Yet when Renate discovers that Sigrid's lover may be Jewish, her response shocks Sigrid. Was it naive of Sigrid to expect anything different? Were you surprised by how deep–seated Renate's anti–Semitism was?\n\nOften in the novel, people are not actually who they appear to be. Consider Frau Obersturmführer Junger, the SS officer's pregnant wife who moves in down the hall: were you shocked to find out her secret? Do you feel that everyone in the book is hiding something?\n\nHow would you characterize Sigrid's relationship with Ericha Kohl? Antagonistic? Trusting? Maternal? What do you think Sigrid gets from her relationship with Ericha? What does Ericha get from Sigrid?\n\nWhat did you think about Kaspar? Egon? Wolfram? All are on the wrong side of history. Did you find any of them appealing? Are they very different from one another?\n\nAt one point Sigrid flirts with the idea of turning in Anna Weiss and her two daughters so that she can have Egon to herself. Do you feel she seriously considers this?\n\nHow important is amorous passion in the novel? Is that the driving force that motivates Sigrid? Is it emblematic of something else?"

In what ways does she indulge\nthat impulse, and in what ways does she deny it?\n\nRead the Judges' Citation for the National Book Award, above. Why do you\nsuppose they deemed the book a masterpiece of investigative journalism?\n\nDiscuss the notion of \"magical thinking.\" Have you ever experienced\nanything like this, after a loss or some other life-changing occurrence? How did\nit help, or hinder, your healing?\n\nDo you think Didion's \"year of magical thinking\" ended after one year, or\ndid it likely continue?\n\nConsider the tone Didion uses throughout the book, one of relatively cool\ndetachment. Clearly she is in mourning, and yet her anguish is quite muted. How\ndid this detached tone affect your reading experience?\n\nHow does Didion use humor? To express her grief, to deflect it, or for\nanother purpose entirely?\n\nOver the course of the book, Didion excerpts a variety of poems. Which\nresonated for you most deeply, and why?\n\nTo Didion, there is a clear distinction between grief and mourning. What\ndifferences do you see between the two?\n\nOne word critics have used again and again in describing this book is\n\"exhilarating.\" Did you find it to be so? Why, or why not?\n\nDiscuss Didion's repetition of sentences like \"For once in your life just\nlet it go\"; \"We call it the widowmaker\"; \"I tell you that I shall not live two\ndays\"; and \"Life changes in the instant.\" What purpose does the repetition\nserve? How did your understanding of her grief change each time you reread one\nof these sentences?\n\nThe lifestyle described in this book is quite different from the way most\npeople live, with glamorous friends, expensive homes, and trips to Hawaii,\nParis, South America, etc., and yet none of that spared Didion from experiencing\nprofound grief. Did her seemingly privileged life color your feelings about the\nbook at all? Did that change after reading it?\n\nAt several points in the book Didion describes her need for knowledge,\nwhether it's from reading medical journals or grilling the doctors at her\ndaughter's bedside. How do you think this helped her to cope?\n\nReread the \"gilded-boy story\" on pages 105–6. How would you answer the\nquestions it raised for Didion?\n\nIs there a turning point in this book? If so, where would you place it\nand why?\n\nThe last sentence of the book is \"No eye is on the sparrow but he did\ntell me that.\" What does this mean?\n\nDidion is adapting The Year of Magical Thinking into a play bound\nfor Broadway. How do you imagine its transition from page to stage? Would you\nwant to see the play?\n\nBefore The Year of Magical Thinking, had you ever read any of Joan\nDidion's work?

      "text": "Sunday, December 2, 2007\n\nForster, A Passage to India\n\nWhile reading the section on the \"Caves\" we came up with some interesting ideas and questions for you to think about:\n\nFriendship:\n\nAziz does love Mrs. Moore but not so much Adela \"He had never liked Miss Quested as much as Mrs. Moore, and had little to say to her, less that ever now that she would marry a British official.\"(167)\n\nThis sets a mood of conflict between them and shows Aziz' feelings of restraint due to the her engagement-uncomfortable with the British official that has power over him\n\n\"She was perfect, as always, his dear Mrs. Moore . . . There was nothing he would not do for her. He would die to make her happy.\" (145)\n\n\"Yes, I am your friend\" Mrs. Moore to Aziz (164)\n\nAlthough he does not like Adela as much as Mrs. Moore, Aziz still says:\n\n\"These two had strange effects on him- they were his friend, his for ever, and he theirs forever…\" (157)\n\nEvidence of innocence?\n\nEcho:\n\n\"Life went on as usual, but had no consequences, that is to say, sounds did not echo or thoughts develop.\" (155)\n\nI think this is a really important quote that describes the echo. It's almost as if the echo represents trouble and the future arrest of Aziz. Maybe that's why the echo made Mrs. Moore uncomfortable? That's a bit of a stretch but still can show the impending trouble- \"echoes generate echoes\" (163)\n\nMrs. Moore \"didn't know who touched her, couldn't breathe, and some vile naked thing struck her face and settled on her mouth like a pad . . . For an instant she went mad, hitting and gasping like a fanatic. For not only did the crush and stench alarm her; there was a also a terrifying echo\" (162)\n\n\"There are some exquisite echoes in India . . . The echo in a Marabar cave is not like these, it is entirely devoid of distinction. Whatever is said, the same monotonous noise replies . . .\" (163)\n\n\"The crush and the smells she could forget, but the echo began in some indescribable way to undermine her hold on life\" (165)\n\nAfter Mrs. Moore leaves the cave she is looking for a villain. Foreshadowing of the incident with Adela?\n\nThe Moguls:\n\nAziz admires Babur but thinks Akbar is foolish because... \"You keep your religion, I mine. That is the best. Nothing embraces the whole of India, nothing, nothing...\"(160) Not even British culture?\n\nAdela counters with \"...I hope you're not right. There will have to be something universal in this country- I don't say religion, for I am not religious, but something, or how else are barriers to be broken down?\"(160) This question seems to show how E.M. Forster is wondering how any humans can connect. Especially in India where there are so many barriers. They then go into a conversation about Adela's impending Anglo-Indian point of view which will further separate her from any sort of universal brotherhood\n\nAziz says he feels like the Emperor Babur, and later says \"But Babur- never in his whole life did he betray a friend\" (159) Foreshadowing his innocence?\n\nAnd then in regards to the problem with Aziz:\n\n\"He was inaccurate because he desired to honor her and- facts being entangled- he had to arrange them in her vicinity, as one tidies the ground after extracting a weed. Before breakfast was over, he had told a good many lies\" (175) Aziz\n\nAziz is digging himself into a hole\n\n\"When an Indian goes bad he goes not only bad, but very queer.\" They keep referring to Aziz in generic terms making them seem to represent the larger conflict between the British and English. Fielding plays an important mediator role between the two races, often siding with Aziz. Interesting? Why is this significant?\n\n\"When evil occurs, it expresses the whole of the universe. Similarly when good occurs\" (197)\n\nWhat did you think of this passage? I thought it was very interesting- saying they were all responsible- he did it, and so did everyone else.\n\n15 comments:\n\nKristina\nsaid...\n\nI don't really think that British culture really embraces the whole of India. I think that it tries to take over the country and it is successful in doing so, but saying that it embraces it is not really true. The natives still have their own religion and ways of doing things and they are often relatively unaffected by the British people in terms of this. They are not treated fairly, however, and the government is controlled by Britain but the Indian culture hasn't been completely taken over. Furthermore, India does eventually get freedom from British control, so England couldn't have overtaken the country so much that it embraced the whole of it.\n\n\"...I hope you're not right. There will have to be something universal in this country- I don't say religion, for I am not religious, but something, or how else are barriers to be broken down?\"(160) I also think that this question is interesting. It does show E.M. Forster's questioning of how humans can connect. I thought that the quote even seemed to foreshadow India's eventual freedom from British rule because she talks about barriers being broken. It seems as though she is suggesting that the people of India should come together on some common ground in order to overthrow the British rule. The quote makes me like Adela a little more than before just because she seems to be standing up for the Indians more than the British by saying it.\n\nI think that the root of the problems that surround the echo in the caves lies in the difference between the echoes that are found in India which are described as \"exquisite\" and the echoes in the cave which are \"entirely devoid of distinction\" (163) and monotonous. Why are the echoes in India not characterized by this deep fear while those in the Marabar caves are? My idea is that the echoes in the caves are so feared because they reduce everything to having the same meaning. It is interesting to note when you look at it this way that only the English people are described as fearing the echoes. As Mrs. Moore says, \"Pathos, piety, courage-they exist, but are identical, and so is filth. Everything exists, nothing has value\" (165). The echoes outside of the caves are exquisite rather than feared because in that realm of India the English are able to apply their hierarchies and social structures in order to develop an India that has meaning for themselves and thus is not feared. Mrs. Moore's anxiety in the caves first develops when she is plunged into darkness and is unable to determine the identities of the people who are touching and crowding her. Her fear arises in this situation because her place in the hierarchy has become unstable- no one can tell that she is English in the dark and she cannot tell who anyone is either. This makes sense to me in my head but I'm not sure I described it well, sorry if it's confusing!\n\nI was thinking pretty much the exact same thing as Megan concerning the echoes of the caves. It reminds me of the deeper unity that is said to underlie the outwardly disparate culture of India (and presumably the world) as evoked in the moment of poetry we looked at toward the beginning of the novel. Looking at it in this sense, it screams 'descending into the unconscious' to me that is somehow like a collective of life and existence or a primordial source. Deep beneath the surface (into the caves) of life, everyone and everything is connected without these social constructions imposed by people. I agree that the novel portrays the English as the only visitors to be startled in the caves, and it seems to portray the Indians in a very 'mystic native' stereotype kind of light, as if there are essential characteristics or connections to the world in \"Orientals.\" On the one hand, Forster is presenting a decently rounded portrait of both English and Indians positive, negative, and neutral characters; yet on the other hand, this particular treatment of the Indians seems a little racist in a way, however well-intentioned it may be.\n\nAnd who would be more likely to read this novel? The audience is almost certain to be English, not Indian, and this is a book that is dealing quite directly with larger social themes as opposed to subtly exploring them. To me it comes off as quite literally the reader's \"passage to India.\" I can imagine English readers picking up the book to get at the \"real India\" that Adela is also looking for. In this sense, maybe Forster is getting carried away with his attribution to the \"Orientals\" of a greater/easier ability to connect with the world.\n\nThe relationships between Aziz, Mrs. Moore, and Adela are more complex than simply eternal friends. The fact that Aziz befriends the British women in no way proves his innocence or guilt in the accusations against him and his interactions with Adela.\n\nThere is no way that British culture embraces India in any way. The interactions between British settlers and Indian natives at the town party display the incompatability between the cultures. As long as the British remain outsiders and demand control of the natives, the master/slave complex keeps the cultures from embracing each other as a unified India. Since the cultures are so completely different in practices and values, they can nerver fully assimilate each other. This is not bad, though, as if they were to assimilate, the spiritually rich Indian culture would be lost to a foreign influence.\n\nWhen Forster uses Aziz in conflicts with British authority, it represents the larger Indian population resisting the British occupation of India. The fact that Fielding sides with Aziz shows that, on at least some level, that British authority realizes its presence effecting Indian culture in a negative way and acknoledges that the natives deserve better treatment.\n\nI think the difference between Aziz's feelings towards Mrs. Moore and Adela are purely in Aziz's head. He clearly loves Mrs. Moore more than Adela, but I think these feelings stem from Aziz's initial encounters with the women. He first meets Mrs. Moore in the mosque where she has respectfully followed protocol. I think Aziz is immediately drawn to Mrs. Moore and hopes she will provide the \"oriental\" English figure he's been looking for. In a way, Aziz sees Mrs. Moore in the manner in which he wishes to perceive her. Conversely, he meets Adela in somewhat different circumstances. Adela first appears to Aziz in the whites-club watching an English performance. It is no surprise that Aziz would become more hesitant with Adela after associating her with the white counterparts he finds her with. The fact that Mrs. Moore is found in a mosque and Adela found in a whites-club initially begins the separation that Aziz feels between the two women. Although Aziz eventually cares for both women, I think his first-impressions created the foundation of his relationships.\n\nI think Forster is drawing up a very broad and elaborate extended metaphor with his description of the caves and the \"echo\". I haven't quite wrapped my brain around it yet, but what it seems to me is that Forster is describing varying culutral spheres, \"pockets,\" realms-- what have you.\n\nConsider the following quote: \"Behind it [Kawa Dol (the overarching summit/rock)], recumbent, were the hills that contained the other caves, isolated each from his neighbour by broad channels of the plain.\"\n\nThese caves are representational of the cultural realms, the Muslim Indian culture, the Anglo-English culture, the Hindu-Indian culture, the infinitesimal sub-divisions of culture that can be divided in a multitude of ways. There are many caves, all similar in shape, indistinguishable from one another. Yet they are not interconnected-they are isolated, some not even penetrated yet, perfect chambers of darkness at the depth of each cave. this is a reference to the small kernel of culture that is appealing and attractive. It is also interesting how the caves are described as being simultaneously magnificent as well as dull.\n\n...\n\n\"Having seen one such cave, having seen two, having seen three, four, fourteen, twenty-four, the visitor returns to Chandrapore uncertain whethre he has had an interesting experience or a dull one or any experience at all.\"\n\nThe caves, representing structures, being penetrated by men with rough tunnels that \"impinge....upon the internal perfection\" are this cultural spheres. Entering these caves is essentially cultural consumption, trying to derive experience/meaning through exposure to these cultures. However, the process is rough, tainted somewhat, and often bewildering, as it leaves Mrs. Moore and Adela disoriented and disturbed (some kind of culture shock). If left undisturbed, they are perfect dark chambers of perfection, but as soon as the outside world is let in to encounter the depth of the cave things become problematic. Consider the caves that are described as being unfound, no tunnel enters them, they hide within the hills, they are cultures existing in vacuum, cultures not yet subjected to universality to which they will inevitably be bound too.\n\nThe echo comes in here as it is representational of the pursuit of culture, which is the essentially the same endeavour, seeking universal truths through religion, relationship, ritual, etc. All cultures are pursuing the same abstractions, whether they exist or not is unknown. The \"boum\" is both representational of the sameness of these cultural endeavours as it breaks down everything into the same sound, the same reverberation, the same echoing sound. It unites everything in a way but is also unnevering as it undermines certain cultural structures, such as Mrs. Moore's christian identity, and thus becomes very unnerving. It reduces everything to sameness and nothingness (but abscence implying presence, as Godbole would argue).\n\nIts a complicated interpretation but I know Forster is getting at SOMETHING here. I want to talk tomorrow about what he might be trying to draw up with the echo and the caves as two additives to a compounded metaphor.\n\nThere's a lot of great stuff being said about the echoes. I especially like Megan's observation that only the English seem to be affected. England at that time and during the preceding centuries was not a place accustomed to difference. They largely considered France to be their opposite, but on the grand scale, those two countries are more like feuding twins. India, on the other hand, has had a more diverse history, particularly as regards religious life. With the Church of England clearly dominant, the nation was largely preserved from the tumultuous variety of sects in Europe. India not only has many sects, but they teem within two separate religions, Hindu and Islam, which each have very different worldviews. India is a vast mixed plain; England, a sealed-off island. The caves represent a liminal space where religions, cultures, nations, and bodies mix and are so compacted as to almost become one. This is an allegory of imperialism. The Indians are used to a heterogenous culture and are not as unsettled. As for the English, even relatively open-minded individuals like Moore and Quested are used to a more uniform and stable world.\n\n This way of eating is low-fat and high in fiber, thereby reducing high cholesterol, preventing heart disease, reducing cancer risks, assisting with weight management and strengthening the immune system.

      "text": "I Am the Cheese\n\nTAPE OZK012\n\nSummary\n\nAdam tells Brint that he went down to the cellar and waited for his father, even ignoring the phone call from Amy.\n\nA third-person narrator describes how Adam remembers sitting in darkness until his father finds him in the cellar. His father asks him several times if he is all right. Finally, Adam asks him about Grey and Martha. His father sighs with sadness and asks how much he knows. Adam's father has dreaded the day when Adam asked questions about the family's past.\n\nIn a dialogue with Brint, Adam says that his father told him that his real name was Paul Delmonte, and that there was no Adam Farmer. He says his father told him almost everything about their history. They were, indeed, running away that night on the bus. The Delmonte/Farmer family fled that day in the woods, as well, because his father thought he had seen one of \"them.\" Adam is unsure who \"they\" are now.\n\nIn a third person narrative, Adam remembers back to his conversation in the cellar. His father revealed that his own real name was Anthony Delmonte, and he had been a reporter in the small town of Blount, New York, for the Blount Telegrapher. He was quickly promoted to political reporter, even covering the state capital in Albany. He won a prestigious national award for a series of articles detailing small government corruption in Blount. Anthony Delmonte then married Louise Nolan and they had a son, Paul.\n\nBack in a dialogue with Brint, Adam questions Brint's motives. Brint tells Adam that his motives do not matter and he presses him about the bus ride.\n\nAdam remembers his father telling him he had uncovered important documents at the State House in Albany. Adam tells Brint that the documents linked the corrupt state and federal government to organized crime. His father testified in Washington, D.C. before a closed Senate committee. In return for giving evidence to the investigators, he would be protected and his identity kept secret. For a year, he hid in hotel rooms and visited his guarded house only occasionally while Louise took care of the infant Adam.\n\nAdam says his father did not reveal everything so that Adam would be \"protected against betrayal\" if he were questioned. Brint asks him what he means by betrayal, but Adam is again unsure. Brint believes Adam is withholding knowledge. Adam tells him that his father finally returned to his job in Blount—his editor had given him a leave of absence, thinking he was researching a book. Based on his father's testimony, there were hushed arrests and resignations in Washington. Adam's father was just happy to be back with his family.\n\nA narrator describes how Adam remembers when there was a bomb planted in his father's car. A local policeman had seen two strangers lurking near the Delmonte house, and a phone call warned Adam's father to stay in the house. The police discovered the bomb and a bomb squad defused it. A few days later, Anthony was working late at the newspaper. As he left, the police officer assigned to guard the building pulled a gun on Anthony. Mr. Grey shot the phony guard before the guard shot Anthony. That was the night Mr. Grey became a fixture in the Delmonte's lives.\n\nAdam tells Brint that Grey was one of the first men behind a new government program, the U.S. Department of Re-Identification, and had been attached to Anthony's case from the start.\n\nA third-person narrator describes how Adam remembers talking to his father incessantly once he learned about the Farmer's situation. Adam and his father spoke in a variety of locations—his father explained that the cellar room was cleared for hidden bugs, and that otherwise they should talk in public places or while they are on the move. Adam explains that Grey's department was developed to protect witnesses who testified against powerful organizations, such as the Mafia. Many of these witnesses lived new lives under assumed names. Grey had told his father that his men had foiled the two murder attempts, but that eventually they would get him if he did not join the department. When Louise received a threatening phone call one night, Adam explains that Anthony reluctantly agreed to join.\n\nAdam tells Brint that, because this was in the early days of the protection program, it was not a completely efficient process. The second birth certificate was a mistake, for instance, but Anthony kept it in case they needed it. They were given the name Farmer—which Anthony hated, since it changed their background to Protestant—and the family relocated to Monument. Grey kept them in the Northeast so that they would not stand out, but there was little chance of anyone's tracing them back to Blount.\n\nA third-person narrator describes why there was little chance of the criminal organization tracing the Delmontes. Adam's father showed him a newspaper clipping in the cellar one night. The headline reported that the family had been killed in a car crash.\n\nAdam and Brint end the session.\n\nAnalysis\n\nMany of the previous plot mysteries are explained here, such as why the Rawlings editor did not know the Farmers. Adam's discussions with his father also explain why the emotional world of the Farmers, especially for Adam's mother, has been so dark. Adam's real name, \"Paul,\" could be a reference to \"pall,\" a covering for a coffin. Adam's family has covered the coffins of their former lives, as has Adam in his memory. In the beginning of the novel, Adam also talks about his fear of being confined in small places, like an \"upright coffin.\" Cormier skillfully deploys this information through Adam's direct conversation with Brint and through his memories, so that the reader understands Adam's horrified reaction to first learning about his past, and his fear of re-remembering what he had learned.\n\nJust as Anthony opposed an organization that had more power than he did, so does Adam, it seems, with Brint. Brint manipulates Adam like a puppet with medication and commands him to remember certain pieces of information. Adam begins to suspect openly for the first time that Brint, a somewhat cold figure all along, is trying to squeeze Adam for information that should be irrelevant, an accusation that Brint denies.\n\nInterestingly, the major revelations do not come at end of the book, as in a typical mystery novel, but only two-thirds of the way through the story. Cormier withholds other plot mysteries, such as whom the Delmontes ran away from and how Adam ended up in the institution. More important, Cormier holds back the emotional mystery, such as what will happen on Adam's journey to his father and through his conversations with Brint, and whether he will be able to handle the newfound information about his identity. The main purpose of this mystery, then, is not detective-story conventions about a criminal's identity, but Adam's emotional struggle with his own identity and his discovery of who he really is. The identity realization does not unfold as a typical coming-of-age story, in which the protagonist discovers who he is through experiences of maturation. Instead, Adam learns about his identity in systematic fragments, where the discovery of his identity is not necessarily a good thing."

      "text": "Underground to Canada: Activity 1\n\nIf you have seen my page Underground to Canada you would know that my class has started inquiry circles, where we\n\nI am loving this book!\n\ngo in groups and read a novel together and have to write notes about the book. My group (Olivia, Alexandra, Jared, Simone and I) is reading the book Underground to Canada by Barbara Smucker with drawings by Imre Holfbauer. My teacher, Mr. Pepper has given us an assignment about what we are reading and disscusing in these groups. The numbered questions below is what we have to write about. Hope you like it!\n\n1. Summarize the main events in your group's novel after 3 days of Inquiry Circles.\n\nJulilly is a 12 or 13 year old slave who has grown up in a fairly mellow Virginia plantation. She has never been whipped or treated badly, until a slave trader from Mississippi came to buy slaves and bring them back to a \"deep south\" plantation. The trader took Julilly away from her family along with many other children and three full grown men. She has to endure starvation, thirst and the blistering heat on the long trip to Misissippi. The \"deep south\" plantation is very different than the one that she grew up in. The slaves were treated like pigs with very little to eat, and if the masters thought that they were not doing their share of work the punishment was being whipped. None of the hundreds of slaves at this plantation were happy with the slave quarters falling apart at the seams, The exhausting heat without shade, everyone is hungry and thirsty twenty-four seven, mean while everyone even the elderly and \"cripples\" have to pick cotton all day long. No one talks at this new place, and the only person who talks to Julilly is her new friend Liza who has suffered too many whippings from Ol' Man Sims.\n\nEverything changes yet again when a large Canadian man named Alexander Ross comes to the Riley plantation to study birds. There is much talk in Julilly and Liza's hut about this mysterious land called Canada, under the north star where once you cross the boundaries you are free from being a slave! Ross then asks Ol' Man Sims for two slaves to guide him. Could Julilly and Liza be the two slaves he chooses? Will Julilly and Liza's dreams of escaping come true?\n\n2. Who are the round and flat characters in your novel? How has the author introduced you to the important characters in your novel? Provide an example of how the author used one (or more) of the above ways to introduce one of the main characters in your novel.\n\nRound Characters: Characters we get to know well. Round characters have a variety of traits that make them believable.\n\nJulilly: A 12 or 13 year old slave, who was taken away from her Mammy (Mother) and sold to a brutal plantation in the \"deep south\". She longs to go back to her Mammy and escape slavery by fleeing to Canada. The only things she can think about are not being whipped, this Alexander Ross fellow and escaping with Liza!\n\nLiza: A \"crippled\" slave that has been slashed with Sims whip a few too many times. She also dreams of escaping but knows first hand the consequences of getting caught. She can't help but think that Ross holds answers for her.\n\nLester: An adult male slave sold at the same time as Julilly. He always has piercing angry eyes, and is proud of Julilly for being so strong. He is also thankful that Julilly helped him during his time of need while they traveled to the Riley plantation. Lester like Julilly was taken away from his family.\n\nFlat Characters: ImportantMammy Sally: Julilly mother who fist told her about Canada before she was sold. A strong, loving and tough woman. She lost her husband the day her only daughter was born.\n\nAdam: An adult male slave sold at the same time as Julilly and was also taken away from his family. His is also set on escaping.\n\nBen: An adult male slave sold at the same time as Julilly and was also taken away from his family. Ben is not sure if he is going to escape or not.\n\nOl' Man Sims: The fat overseer of the slaves, who likes to use his whip very often especially on the elderly and \"crippled\" He reports to Massa (Master) Riley.\n\nMassa Riley: The owner of the plantation, he doesn't keep the slave quarters up to date and doesn't feed his slaves enough.\n\nMassa Henson: The owner of the plantation Julilly grew up on and wasn't very mean to his slaves like Massa Riley is.\n\nAlexander Ross: The new man in the story from the great, cold land called Canada. Ross is an ornithologist at the plantation \"to study birds.\" A few of the slaves hope that he can lead them to Canada.\n\nBarbara Smucker is a great author, she describes her characters by using that characters actions, speech and thoughts, and other characters comments. An example of this is how she described and introduced Liza: \"…sullen, hunchbacked girl\" This immediately makes you think that she has been injured in some. Barbara also has another slave say \"Too many whippin's\" This comment about Liza makes readers think that she has done something to make Sims very angry and whip her quite a lot. A little later in the novel Liza says \"My back is givin me misery\" This now makes me think that the whipping were very very painful especially when the pain has stayed with her for so long. Barbara is great at describing settings, characters, etc. I really like how she writes.\n\n3. Choose an event in the story that you feel is important. Describe what happened. Why do you think the author had this happen at this point in the story? Don't forget to include the characters introduced so far, the setting and any other important information that will allow your blog readers to gain a deeper understanding of the story. If you had been the character involved in this event, how would you have reacted to the event?\n\nThe event that I choose was when Alexander Ross first came to the plantation. This was of course after Julilly was sold and had befriended Liza. Ross came one afternoon while the slaves were picking cotton in the field. When he showed up there was a hush in the field as the work slowed so the slaves could hear what the white folks were saying. Massa Riley was explaining to Sims who and why Alexander Ross was there. Julilly was picking just a few feet away and she could hear every word. When Massa Riley said that Ross was from Canada, Julilly had hope because her Mammy had told her about the foreign place. When they were finished talking Ross went to pick which slaves would help him in his search for birds. Then Sims yelled at the slaves to get back to work and whipped Julilly once, he was about slash at her again but Ross stopped him. I think that Julilly felt grateful, surprised and found herself kind of starting to trust the Canadian. I think that if I were Julilly I would have felt the same way because I would have expected to be whipped more than once by what I had seen earlier. I would also be shocked that a white man had saved me! Especially if the man was from Canada, the place where slaves were free!\n\nI think that Barbara Smucker made this event happen at this point in the book because Julilly and Liza had been talking about Canada the scene before, so it made sense for a Canadian man to come into the story. That would make readers think that he will be the one to help Julilly and Liza get to freedom!\n\n4. Predict what you think is going to happen next in your novel.\n\nI predict that Alexander Ross will pick either one of the girls or both to guide him. I also think that Ross isn't really at the plantation to watch birds because he is so nice to the slaves, I think he will help at least a few slaves be free. I'm not sure if Liza will be able to travel that far because her back but I hope that she can! I also think that Julilly will meet up with her mammy at some point!\n\nThis entry was posted\non Thursday, May 19th, 2011 at 7:25 am and is filed under School.\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site."

      "text": "Reading Group Guide\n\nThis reading group guide forThe Bird House includes an introduction, discussion questions, ideas for enhancing your book club, and a Q&A with author Kelly Simmons. The suggested questions are intended to help your reading group find new and interesting angles and topics for your discussion. We hope that these ideas will enrich your conversation and increase your enjoyment of the book.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nEvery family has its secrets. But when you are the last survivor tending to the dark fires of memory, and your own mind is fading, who do you share them with? Your diary or your eight-year-old granddaughter? Or do you simply let them fade away, along with your memory?\n\nThe Bird House is a moving story of secrets, lies, and relationships. It is a close look at the hardship and heartbreak that one woman can withstand during a lifetime. As an elderly woman, Ann Biddle is struggling to both remember and come to terms with the life she has led. It is through her young, but wise granddaughter, Ellie, that Ann finds a way to deal with her past and finally reveal the secrets that have come to taint the present.\n\nTOPICS AND QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\n\n1. Ann reveals within the first chapter that her memory is failing. How did this confession affect your reading? Was Ann an unreliable narrator? Explain your answer.\n\n2. Bird houses are a recurring theme throughout the novel—besides the title itself, Ellie chooses bird houses for her \"Aspect\" school project. Do you think the bird houses hold some sort of symbolism? Why or why not?\n\n3. Throughout the novel, we get bits and pieces of what Ann's husband, Theo, was like. Do you think Ann is fair with his depiction? If the novel had been narrated by Theo, how do you think he would have described himself? How would his perspective differ from Ann's?\n\n4. In the beginning, Ann describes her daughter-in-law, Tinsley, as almost perfect. She even attributes her granddaughter's wonderful demeanor to Tinsley. When do you see Ann's opinion begin to change? Why do you think it changes so drastically? Do you think they will ever completely resolve their differences?\n\n5. Ann thinks the world of Tom and Ellie. In her mind, they can do no wrong. Do you feel the same? Or do you think she is fiercely loyal to them because they are her flesh and blood?\n\n6. Adultery recurs throughout the novel and is also a shared commonality between Ann, her mother, and Tinsley. How do you think this bonds the women together? Does this shared connection help them relate to one another? Or could it also have an opposite effect on their relationships?\n\n7. Ann, her mother, and Tinsley all have completely different personalities and lead completely different lives. What do you think lead each woman to cheat on her partner?\n\n8. There were multiple instances throughout the novel where Ann's daughter, Emma, acts in an odd, and even malicious, manner. Do you think this is a result or an effect of the anger and resentment she feels for losing her daughter at such a young age?\n\n9. Do you blame Ann for her daughter's death? Do you think Ann blames herself? Why do you think she kept this a secret for such a long time?\n\n10. When Ann confronts Tinsley about her affair, she claims to have the best intentions. Do you agree with how Ann handled this discussion? If you were in Ann's position, what would you have done?\n\n11. Ann never gave her father the chance to give his side of the story, and after his death she discovers he was not her biological father. Do you think she should have given him the chance to explain himself? And do you think this was what he was trying to tell her?\n\n12. Ann reveals a great deal about her past, and even present, to Ellie. Do you think this relationship was inappropriate? Why or why not?\n\n13. On page 272, Ann says to Ellie: \"'If you ever have to choose between a man who's serious and a man who's fun, choose the fun one. Promise me.'\" Do you agree with Ann? Who do you think was the \"fun one\" and who was the serious one? Theo or Peter?\n\n14. Did you like that the novel was told from only Ann's perspective? Or would you have a more objective, third person narrator?'\n\nENHANCE YOUR BOOK CLUB\n\n1. Ellie decides to do her school project with the \"Aspect\" of bird houses. Make your own bird house and share it with the group.\n\n2. Ann and Ellie work very hard to create their family tree for Ellie's school project. Visit  or pick up a copy of Shaking the Family Tree: Blue Bloods, Black Sheep, and Other Obsessions of an Accidental Genealogist by Buzzy Jackson, to learn more about how to make a family tree of your own.\n\n3. Not all elderly people have the family and friends that Ann has. Volunteer at a nursing or retirement home with members from your book club. Sit down with someone and ask her to tell you stories of her past.\n\n4. Learn more about Kelly Simmons on her website at  and her blog at \n\nA CONVERSATION WITH KELLY SIMMONS\n\nWhat was your inspiration for The Bird House?\n\nMy daughter brought home an assignment from school that asked her to do a series of projects based on the family history that required interviewing a grandparent. I thought to myself, hmmmm, this assignment could really backfire, couldn't it? With a troubled grandparent, an innocent little girl, and a few family secrets, all hell could break loose! The idea rattled around in the back of my mind for a year or so while I started two other novels. Then I decided it was too powerful a story to ignore and focused my attention on it.\n\nAs your second novel, was the writing process easier or more difficult? What were the differences and similarities in writing The Bird House compared to Standing Still?\n\nIt was a bit easier in the editorial stages because I'd been through the process already. And as with Standing Still, I found the voice of the main character quickly. However, the actual writing was more difficult. The structure of The Bird House, with its twin diaries forty years apart, entwining and untangling, proved challenging. That being said, the most difficult part for me is always choosing material. I guess because of my advertising background, I'm a brainstormer—I generate lots of ideas for novels.\n\nThe main character, Ann, is suffering from early onset of Alzheimer's. Do you personally know anyone suffering from the disease?\n\nYes, our family has struggled with having a loved one diagnosed, as have several of my friends' families. It's a reality for many people, and in the beginning stages, it's so hard to pinpoint and accept.\n\nHow did you research Alzheimer's to make sure Ann's symptoms were realistic?\n\nI interviewed siblings, spouses, and children of Alzheimer's patients, rather than doctors, to hear their stories and to try to get the details right. I wanted the family's perceptions of the symptoms, not the textbook symptoms, if that makes sense.\n\nWhy did you decide to write the novel in the first person? Why did you want readers to get only Ann's perspective?\n\nAnn's perspective works best because her faulty memory makes her an unreliable narrator. I wanted readers to feel the tension and the worry of not knowing what she was going to do or say, or if they could trust her version of events. I love ambiguity and subtlety in a story, and so many novels with multiple narrators or an omniscient narrator go overboard and reveal more than is necessary. It's kind of a TMI situation for me. And I guess I am somewhat obsessed with first-person unreliable narrators, as Standing Still had one too!\n\nYou are a former creative director with a specialization in marketing to women. The Bird House is primarily about women, told from a woman's perspective. Do you think you will ever write a novel from a man's perspective? Or would you rather stick to what you know best?\n\nWell, I admit I have a righteous feminist streak, almost as if I was born in another era. I just really feel the indignation and the struggle deeply. Writing male characters can be a joy, but overall, there are so many more women's stories I want to explore.\n\nYour first novel, Standing Still, deals with anxiety disorders and abduction, while characters in The Bird House cope with Alzheimer's and the death of a child. Why did you choose to pair these dark subject matters in both your novels?\n\nMy agent once told me that I was \"obsessed with what's hidden.\" I'm also obsessed with the things I'm afraid of—which are fairly numerous! If you combed through the magazine articles and newspapers I read, the movies I see, the TV I watch—you'd see immediately I have a fascination with gritty stuff—crime and police, mysteries. By melding them into my work, I'm shedding some feminine, suburban, maternal light on them.\n\nAnn and Ellie are very close throughout the novel. Were you close to either of your grandmothers?\n\nI was close to both of them—the book is dedicated to them—and have amazing, warm, hilarious memories of them both. Because my mother was ill when I was young, these relationships were especially important to me.\n\nWhat are you currently reading? Who are your favorite authors?\n\nI just finished Little Bee, which was my choice for my mother-and-daughter book group. A few of my favorite authors are Ann Beattie, John Irving, and Lionel Shriver. But I love so many!\n\nAre you working on a third novel? What is next for Kelly Simmons?\n\nYes, I'm polishing up a new novel called The Book Addict. Words to live by!"

      "text": "The Unfinished Gift Discussion Questions: Dan Walsh\n\n1. Christmas is traditionally a holiday where families celebrate and create fond memories. But for many people like Patrick, it merely highlights the emptiness and brokenness that's existed for years. What has your experience been like? If you can't personally relate to Patrick's story, what do you believe has made a positive difference in your family life?\n\n2. Patrick's father and grandfather haven't spoken to each other since before he was born. Do you have any relatives who haven't spoken to each other for years? What consequences has this rift caused for them or your family? What are the main issues? Do you think they justify the separation? If yes, why; if not, why not?\n\n3. With the introduction of Father O'Malley and Ian Collins' recollection of his last conversation with his son, we become aware that Collins is Catholic and the rift has something to do with his son \"pulling away from the faith.\" Does this seem as serious a thing now as it was in the 1940s? Has anyone in your family changed churches? How has this affected relationships in the family? Has it created any conflicts that have proved difficult to forgive?\n\n4. Why do you think Mrs. Fortini was not intimidated by Ian Collins? Do you know anyone like her?\n\n5. After Ian received the MIA telegram about Shawn, he quickly became convinced that Shawn was actually dead. Have you ever jumped to a conclusion about a big event in your life or believed the worst before you had all the facts, and then it was nowhere near as bad as you'd imagined? What lesson can we learn from times like these?\n\n6. At the end of the section where Ian is reading the letters, he reads one he's never seen from his deceased wife, Ida. She is thanking Patrick's mom for helping her to understand the gospel more clearly. Has this book helped you to understand the gospel more clearly? If so, how?\n\n7. The social worker, Katherine Townsend, came to love Patrick almost like her own child. She was rebuked for getting too emotionally involved. After getting so close, how do you think she'll handle letting go? How do you think you would have handled this situation? In the end, do you think she made the right call?\n\n8. How were you affected by the role Ezra Jeffries played toward the end of the story? Have you witnessed anyone treated in a similar way because of their race or ethnic background? Would you have had the courage to step in like Katherine did? 9. What parts of the book impacted you on an emotional level? If there were more than one, which one affected you the most?\n\n10. This book wasn't a mystery novel, but did anything happen that surprised you?\n\n11. The author has said that he intended the unfinished wooden soldier to be more than just a toy Patrick craved, but to serve as a metaphor that weaves the whole story together from beginning to end. Did you catch this? What do you think he means?"

Since her and her father used to play the piano together, she refuses to play it. Now she has to spend an entire summer with him, away from her friends and her New York. It also doesn't help that she has gotten caught shoplifting twice.\n\nWhat causes the conflict to occur? What are some of the obstacles that lead to the conflict? Ronnie's dad gets put in the hospital, and she finds out he has cancer and didn't have much time left.\n\nWhat is the most exciting part of the plot? Is this when the conflict is resolved? As the summer progresses, Ronnie meets Will, a volleyball player who happens to be very rich and falls in love with him. She also becomes closer with her father, telling him things she would never think of telling her mom.\n\nHow is the conflict resolved? Is this what you expected? Explain. Ronnie's dad has been trying to write a song but just couldn't seem to get it right. When he gets out of the hospital, he isn't strong enough to work on it, so Ronnie starts to work on it. When she finishes it she plays it for him. By the end of the book, Ronnie matured so much. Instead of thinking that her father constantly played the piano so that she would play again, she realized that her father always played because that was what he loved to do.\n\nDescribe the setting in the book. What visual images do you see in your head? Give examples in the book that lead you to these images.\n\nUse the sensory images: visual, taste, smell, movement, etc. As I read the book, I could visualize the ocean's waves crashing into the tide, the smell of the salt water, and the cool summer breeze. The setting reminded me of the lazy, laid back feeling of summer.\n\nDescribe an important symbol in the book. What is the symbol? Ronnie finds a turtle nest on her 3rd night at her dad's house, and sleeps out by them when a raccoon almost destroyed it. The turtles are an important symbol in the book because it shows that Ronnie isn't as bad as she looks. Also as the turtles get closer and closer to hatching, Ronnie gets more and more mature.\n\nWhat effect do the events in plot have on the characters?\n\nHow do the characters change throughout the book? Ronnie went from being rebellious and hating her dad to getting along with him.\n\nDescribe a questionable action by one of the characters. Do you think they were right or wrong? Why? When her dad hides the piano because Ronnie doesn't want to see it. I think he shouldn't have done that and should have explained why he likes to play the piano, but that wouldn't have made a good book.\n\nCompare and contrast two characters in your book. Blaze and Ronnie's parents are both divorced and they're rebellious. Blaze is more of a push over and does whatever Marcus tells her to, but Ronnie sees right through him.\n\nDescribe an important passage in the book. Why is it important? \"Her mind flashed on a dozen different images: Suddenly she knew why her dad wanted her and Jonah to come to North Carolina. And she understood that her mom had known the truth all along. With so little time left together, he had no desire to argue with her. And his ceaseless work on the window now made perfect sense. She recalled his coughing fit in the church and the times he'd winced in pain. In hindsight, the pieces all fit together. Yet everything was falling apart.\" (321) this is important because it was a big turning point in the book and she finally realized that it really wasn't all about her.\n\nWhat other books or stories could you compare this book to? How are they similar? How are they different? The Last Song is like Dear John and all the other Nickolas Sparks books. They pretty much all have to do with love and loss. The only thing that's different is the characters and the problems they face.\n\nWhere there any words that you did not know the definition? Did you look the word up in the dictionary? If you didn't, how did you determine what the word meant? I don't really remember struggling on any words, but when I do come across a word I don't know, I usually read on to see if I can just figure out the meaning.\n\nWas there a moment in the book when you were surprised, angered, upset, excited or happy? Describe the scene and what evoked this emotion. I was sad when Ronnie and Will found Jonah in the shed trying to finish the stained glass window because he believed that if he finished it his dad would get better.\n\nAre there any parts of the story that are confusing? Why? There really wasn't any part of the story that was confusing to me.\n\nIf you could ask the author one question, what would it be and why?\n\nWould you recommend this book to someone else? Why or why not? Use specific examples from the book to answer this question. Yes because it's a typical coming of age and it's a good to read if you are just in the crying mood. It shows how death makes people grow up faster than they usually would."

      "text": "The Secret Garden\n\nChapter I\n\nSummary\n\nThe omniscient narrator of The Secret Garden begins by enumerating the many defects of Mary Lennox, the ten-year-old girl who is the novel's protagonist. Mary is ugly, with skin made yellow by constant illness. At the outset of the novel, she is living in India with her parents, who have neither time nor affection for her. Her mother, who had never wanted a child at all, has entrusted Mary to the care of a number of Indian servants, whose only instructions are to keep the unloved child out of her mother's sight. Mrs. Lennox is described as a famously beautiful, elegant woman, who does nothing but attend fashionable parties. Though everyone is acquainted with and admires Mrs. Lennox, nearly no one knows that she has a little girl, so totally is the embarrassingly ugly child kept from public view. As the servants are obliged to give Mary whatever she wants (lest her parents be disturbed by her crying), Mary becomes terribly spoiled, selfish, and dictatorial. She loves no one, and no one cares at all for her.\n\nThis already unhappy state of affairs is made worse when a cholera epidemic breaks out in the Indian village where the Lennoxes are living. The family does not manage to flee in time to escape the epidemic because Mary's mother, in the spirit of thoughtless egotism that is typical of her, has insisted upon staying to attend a dinner party. On the morning that the cholera finally strikes the Lennox bungalow, Mary's Ayah (the Indian woman who serves as her nanny) does not come to tend to her. Left utterly unsupervised, Mary wanders into the garden and begins to play by herself beneath a tree. There, she overhears a conversation between her mother and a British officer, after which the events of the morning are explained to her. The fact that her Ayah has died of the cholera does not bother Mary at all, as she did not love her nanny or anyone else.\n\nThe household is seized by terror and confusion, and in the ensuing chaos Mary is completely forgotten. She shuts herself in her room, and does nothing but cry and sleep for more than a day. When she finally ventures out, the house seems eerily deserted, as though it has been abandoned. Mary drinks a glass of wine left standing on the dining-room table. The wine causes her to fall into a deep sleep that lasts many hours. When she awakes, a small green snake with glittering eyes is the only living creature besides Mary herself left in the bungalow—everyone else, including her parents, has died or fled. A party of British soldiers finds her there and takes the newly-orphaned child away with them.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe first chapter of The Secret Garden goes to great lengths to establish Mary Lennox as a \"tyrannical and selfish little pig,\" who is as ugly as she is hateful: she beats her servants, calls them appalling names, and does not mourn her nanny's death. However, the chapter also lays the blame for Mary's flaws at the feet of her parents, particularly her mother. It thereby introduces one of the novel's central themes: the notion that children must be loved if they are to be capable of loving, and given examples of virtue if they are to be virtuous.\n\nThe first chapter also presents Mary as a sickly child. Though the source of her sickness is not entirely clear, the novel subtly attributes it to her childhood in India: \"Her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another.\" India, clearly, is no place for an English child, though the novel suggests that India is at fault, rather than the British invasion of the country.\n\nThe relation between health and location and the relation between well-being and beauty are important motifs throughout The Secret Garden. India is presented as a place which breeds illness and ugliness, as both Mary and her father take ill during their time there; though her mother is beautiful, her beauty conceals a moral illness, or an illness of the soul. Illness and its ostensible causes are pivotal to the novel as a whole.\n\nMary is not loved, for she is an unwanted child whose ugliness is a source of great embarrassment to her mother. Mary is thus positioned as the first of the many secrets which animate the novel: she is herself secreted away from view, and her parents' friends have no idea that they have a child at all. The soldiers who discover her at chapter's end are shocked to find her, and refer to her as \"the child no one ever saw.\" Furthermore, no one takes care of her except the native servants, who do so only because they are commanded to, not because they have affection for her: they forget her entirely when they flee the bungalow.\n\nThe relationship between the servants and the Lennox family is left largely unexplored by the novel, but implies a great deal about British colonialism in India. The servants must obey Mary's every wish, and even must withstand her beatings, because they depend upon her parents for their survival - their disobedience may carry with it the threat of death. This is made painfully clear by the fact that the servants remain with the family, even though they recognize the threat the cholera presents; many of them die because they did not flee earlier.\n\nWhat befalls Mary after the onset of the epidemic has a certain fairy-tale character. The empty dining room with its abandoned meal conjures the tale of \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\"; Mary's drinking of the glass of sweet wine recalls Alice in Wonderland, while the oblivious sleep it causes is reminiscent of \"Sleeping Beauty.\" As in a fairy story, Mary awakens from her sleep to find that her world has entirely changed. The motif of sleep recurs as a state in which one \"knows nothing more for a long time\"—that is, as a state of oblivion to be contrasted with the desirable state of wakefulness, which is associated with liveliness and curiosity. The empty house, the tiny snake \"with eyes like jewels\" who serves as her only companion, and Mary's orphaned state itself also seem borrowed from fairy-tales. Fairy-tales and their promises will also recur later in the novel, though they are left implicit here."

      "text": "Beaufort Book Club\n\nTuesday, May 14, 2013\n\nDiscussion Questions\n1. Does this book have\na central theme? What is it?\n\n2. Why does Mary Anne always read a book's\nending first? How does this reflect her character?\n\n3. Early in the book,\nWill writes, \"I wanted to learn more about my mother's life and the choices\nshe'd made, so I often steered the conversation there. She had an agenda of her\nown, as she almost always did. It took me some time, and some help, to figure it\nout.\" (page 6) What was Mary Anne's agenda?\n\n4. Mary Anne underlined a\npassage in Seventy Verses on Emptiness, which resonated with Will:\n\"Permanent is not; impermanent is not; a self is not; not a self [is not]; clean\nis not; not clean is not; happy is not; suffering is not.\" Why did this strike\nboth of them as significant? What do you think it means?\n\n5. Throughout\nthe book, Will talks about books as symbols and sources of hope. How has reading\nbooks served a similar function for you?\n\n6. While reading A Thousand\nSplendid Suns, Will and Mary Anne discuss three kinds of fateful choices:\n\"the ones characters make knowing that they can never be undone; the ones they\nmake thinking they can but learn they can't; and the ones they make thinking\nthey can't and only later come to understand, when it's too late, when 'nothing\ncan be undone,' that they could have.\" (page 41) What kind of choices did Mary\nAnne make during her cancer treatment? Did she or Will make any of the third\ntype?\n\n7. Mary Anne especially liked a passage from Gilead by\nMarilynne Robinson: \"When you encounter another person, when you have dealings\nwith anyone at all, it is as if a question is being put to you. So you must\nthink, What is the Lord asking of me in this moment, in this situation?\" (page\n96) Why do you think this moved her so much? What did it mean to Will?\n\n8.\nHow does religious belief help Mary Anne? How do you think it might have helped\nWill?\n\n9. Mary Anne doesn't believe her travels to war-torn countries were\nbrave: \"I wanted to go to all those places, so how could that be brave? The\npeople I'm talking about, they did things they didn't want to do because they\nfelt they had to, or because they thought it was the right thing to do.\" (page\n167) In what ways is Mary Anne brave during her cancer treatments? Does she ever\ncome to think of herself as brave?\n\n10. Will is amazed by his mother's\nability to continue her efforts to fund the library in Afghanistan even while\nfacing a death sentence, until he realizes that \"she used her emotions to\nmotivate her and help her concentrate. The emphasis for her was always on doing\nwhat needed to be done. I had to learn this lesson while she was still there to\nteach me.\" (page 194) Did Will learn? What makes you think so?\n\n11. Why\ndid Mary Anne become so intent on certain things happening: Obama's election,\nDavid Rohde's safe return? Will talks about his own \"magical thinking\" several\ntimes in the book—what form do you think Mary Anne's took?\n\n12. \"We're all\nin the end-of-our-life book club, whether we acknowledge it or not; each book we\nread may well be the last, each conversation the final one.\" (page 281) How did\nthis realization affect Will's final days with his mom?\n\n13. After she\ndies, Will looks at Mary Anne's copy of Daily Strength for Daily Needs,\nnext to the bed. He believes this quote from John Ruskin was the last thing his\nmother ever read: \"If you do not wish for His kingdom, don't pray for it. But if\nyou do, you must do more than pray for it; you must work for it.\" (page 321) How\ndid Mary Anne work for it throughout her life? Do you think Will found solace in\nthis passage?\n\n14. Several times in the book, Will talks about eBooks\nversus their physical counterparts. Why does he prefer one to the other? Does\nMary Anne agree? If you read this book on an eReader, how do you think it\naffected your experience?\n\n15. Which of the books discussed by Will and\nMary Anne have you read? Which do you most want to read?\n(Questions issued by publisher.)\n\nMonday, February 18, 2013\n\n1.

One of the opening scenes in A Grown-Up Kind of Pretty depicts Tyler Baines chopping down the Slocumb willow tree. What does this tree symbolize for Big? For Liza? For Mosey?\n2. On page 70, Mosey realizes she isn't who she thought she was. At first, she feels liberated. Then she feels confused and lost. How is she like Liza and Big? What makes her different? Do you think a child takes on traits like compassion, humor, and good sense from her biological parents, or do you think that she learns these from the people who raise her?\n3. Several men in this novel cheat on their spouses (Coach, Lawrence), but the women cheat on one another in a different way. What kind of emotional betrayals show up in their friendships, and in their families? Who do you think is the most loyal person in this story?\n4. Though Liza and Melissa were inseparable when they were young, Big believes that Noveen was a better friend to Liza than Melissa ever was. Patti turns out to be a wonderful friend to Mosey. What have the Duckins women given to Liza and Mosey? How was Melissa different?\n5. One theme in A Grown-Up Kind of Pretty is belonging. On page 224, Big says, \"Bogo wasn't the only stray that Mosey had adopted for us all recently.\" Who do you think are the \"strays\" in this story? When do they find a home?\n6. When Mosey enters Liza's tree house and sees her old Moomin books covered in Magic Marker, she says, \"If I had doubted for a second this place was Liza's, I didn't doubt it now\" (p. 245). Have you ever found a secret place or a secret box that belonged to someone you love? What part of this person did you find there?\n7. Was Big smart to keep the details of her family crisis from Lawrence? If she had shared more with him, do you think he could have helped her, or protected Mosey?\n8. Did Liza do the right thing by taking Mosey from her mother when she was small? Would you still feel that way if Mosey had been a Duckins or a Richardson instead? Why?\n9. Big and Liza are determined to keep Mosey from getting too close to boys. Do you think they're overreacting? What would you do to keep your daughter from making the same mistakes you made?\n10. When something bad happens, Big, Liza, and Mosey often respond with action—though sometimes their approaches aren't quite ethical. Does Liza break Lawrence's ex-wife's plates on purpose, or was it an accident? Did you enjoy it a little, since Sandy cheated on Lawrence and lashed out at Big? Do you think Claire Richardson was at all justified in her attacks on Liza? On Big? Do you blame her less because she lost both her daughters? Though it was wrong of Big to throw bricks at the church's windows, do you think it was justified, given how she was treated by the church community? How does knowing the pain each character has been through change the way you respond to her actions?\nQuestions from litlovers.com\n\nWednesday, August 15, 2012\n\n1. Kamila studied to become a teacher and even earned a prestigious teaching certificate. Before she could complete her training, the Taliban took over Kabul and banned women from nearly all public places, including schools. How did Kamila adapt the skills she learned as a teacher and put them to use starting her dressmaking business, and later in her U.N. work?\n\n2. At many crucial junctures, Kamila turns to her faith for guidance. What role does faith play in her personal journey?\n\n3. Under the Taliban, Afghan women were confined to their homes and saw their lives transformed virtually overnight. Many women like Kamila still needed to support their families, though, and so found creative ways to work within and around these new restrictions. What would you have done under similar circumstances? Would you have dared to go against the Taliban's rules at the risk of your own safety?\n\n4. Malekheh plays an instrumental role in teaching Kamila how to sew and in get ting her dressmaking business off the ground. Kamila often seeks out the advice of her eldest sister, even though she doesn't always take it. How would you characterize the relationship between these two sisters? What role do you think this relationship played in Kamila's business success?\n\n5. Lemmon paints a colorful, yet nuanced portrait of modern day Afghanistan. The story of Kamila and her family presents an alternative to the conventional image of women as victims of war. Did Lemmon's portrayal change the way you think about Afghanistan? Or about women and war?\n\n6. Within a year, Kamila was able to transform a living room operation into a thriving dressmaking business --- selling finely embroidered dresses to tailors throughout Kabul and providing meaningful work for an entire community of women. What do you think about Kamila's business practices? Why do you think she and her sisters were so successful? What lessons about entrepreneurship can be taken from their story?\n\n7. In chapter 7, Kamila and her sisters work around the clock to make 6 dresses for a wedding party, only to discover that the bride is marrying a Talib. How does this episode impact or cause you to revisit your view of the Taliban? If Taliban soldiers knew about the Sidiqi sisters' tailoring business, why didn't they shut it down? What did you think when you saw that there were Taliban who sent their daughters to work with Kamila?\n\n8. How does Lemmon portray men throughout the book? Think of Rahim, Mr. Sidiqi, Ali and his brothers, and the Talibs Kamila encounters. Do these characters reshape or reinforce your impressions of men in Afghanistan?\n\n9. Despite being faced with the daily perils of war and economic hardships, the Sidiqi family never completely abandoned their home in Khair Khana. What does that say about their commitment to their community? To their country?\n\n10. How does Kamila's story affect the way you see the future of Afghanistan and America's presence in this war-scarred country?\n\nMonday, June 04, 2012\n\nDiscussion Questions for Still Alice by Lisa Genova\n1. When Alice becomes disoriented in Harvard Square, a place she's visited daily for twenty-five years, why doesn't she tell John? Is she too afraid to face a possible illness, worried about his possible reaction, or some other reason?\n2. After first learning she has Alzheimer's disease, \"the sound of her name penetrated her every cell and seemed to scatter her molecules beyond the boundaries of her own skin. She watched herself from the far corner of the room\" (pg. 70). What do you think of Alice's reaction to the diagnosis? Why does she disassociate herself to the extent that she feels she's having an out-of-body experience?\n3. Do you find irony in the fact that Alice, a Harvard professor and researcher, suffers from a disease that causes her brain to atrophy? Why do you think the author, Lisa Genova, chose this profession? How does her past academic success affect Alice's ability, and her family's, to cope with Alzheimer's?\n4. \"He refused to watch her take her medication. He could be mid-sentence, mid-conversation, but if she got out her plastic, days-of-the-week pill container, he left the room\" (pg. 89). Is John's reaction understandable? What might be the significance of him frequently fiddling with his wedding ring when Alice's health is discussed?\n5. When Alice's three children, Anna, Tom and Lydia, find out they can be tested for the genetic mutation that causes Alzheimer's, only Lydia decides she doesn't want to know. Why does she decline? Would you want to know if you had the gene?\n6. Why is her mother's butterfly necklace so important to Alice? Is it only because she misses her mother? Does Alice feel a connection to butterflies beyond the necklace?\n7. Alice decides she wants to spend her remaining time with her family and her books. Considering her devotion and passion for her work, why doesn't her research make the list of priorities? Does Alice most identify herself as a mother, wife, or scholar?\n8. Were you surprised at Alice's plan to overdose on sleeping pills once her disease progressed to an advanced stage? Is this decision in character? Why does she make this difficult choice? If they found out, would her family approve?\n9. As the symptoms worsen, Alice begins to feel like she's living in one of Lydia's plays: \"(Interior of Doctor's Office. The neurologist left the room. The husband spun his ring. The woman hoped for a cure.)\" (pg. 141). Is this thought process a sign of the disease, or does pretending it's not happening to her make it easier for Alice to deal with reality?\n10. Do Alice's relationships with her children differ? Why does she read Lydia's diary? And does Lydia decide to attend college only to honor her mother?\n11. Alice's mother and sister died when she was only a freshman in college, and yet Alice has to keep reminding herself they're not about to walk through the door. As the symptoms worsen, why does Alice think more about her mother and sister? Is it because her older memories are more accessible, is she thinking of happier times, or is she worried about her own mortality?\n12. Alice and the members of her support group, Mary, Cathy, and Dan, all discuss how their reputations suffered prior to their diagnoses because people thought they were being difficult or possibly had substance abuse problems. Is preserving their legacies one of the biggest obstacles to people suffering from Alzheimer's disease? What examples are there of people still respecting Alice's wishes, and at what times is she ignored?\n13. \"One last sabbatical year together. She wouldn't trade that in for anything. Apparently, he would\" (pg. 223). Why does John decide to keep working? Is it fair for him to seek the job in New York considering Alice probably won't know her whereabouts by the time they move? Is he correct when he tells the children she would not want him to sacrifice his work?\n14. Why does Lisa Genova choose to end the novel with John reading that Amylix, the medicine that Alice was taking, failed to stabilize Alzheimer's patients? Why does this news cause John to cry?\n15. Alice's doctor tells her, \"You may not be the most reliable source of what's been going on\" (pg. 54). Yet, Lisa Genova chose to tell the story from Alice's point of view. As Alice's disease worsens, her perceptions indeed get less reliable. Why would the author choose to stay in Alice's perspective? What do we gain, and what do we lose?\n\nWednesday, May 09, 20122. How do Nicky Eck's crimes against Molly affect the rest of her life?4. Why does Mariah Snow take an immediate dislike to Molly? Is this a clue to what happened in Mariah's past? Do you believe people like or dislike other people because they possess similar qualities (either positive or negative)?6. What do you make of the author's choice to write a majority of the novel in journal entries and letters? How would the novel be different if she had chosen to tell the story using straight prose?9. What do you think happened to Mary White?11. When Simon Black visits Molly in the mountains in February (page 241), Molly doesn't discuss with Agnes what transpired between them. What do you suppose was said?13. Who do you believe killed Jacky (with the first shot in the stomach, not the second shot in his neck)? Why do you suppose BJ helped Molly cover up what really happened to Jacky?15. What are the reasons behind Molly's decision to go back to Agate Hill in the end? How does this illustrate the change in Molly from the beginning of her life to the end of it?\n16. Which character do you relate to the most in the book, and why?\nQuestions from Readinggroupguides.com\n\nTuesday, April 17, 2012\n\n1.

Discuss what Ted Kills Many means when he says, \"Apples don't roll straight, but they roll. Right off the rez.\"\n\n3. What are some of the names that Earl uses to refer to himself in his imaginary documentary? Which of the names do you feel best fit Earl and why?\n\n4. How do you feel about the way Carson deals with his grandfather's death? What insight does this give into how Carson thinks and acts?\n\n5. Willie's father tells him before he leaves for his year in America, \"You may find, though, that people are the same everywhere. That there is not the difference you think between us and them.\" If, when he returned to Germany, Willie were to reflect on these words of his father, what would he conclude?\n\n6. Who (or what) is Goat Man? Is Goat Man a real or imaginary creature? Defend your point of view from the story. What does Greggy Longwell think about Goat Man when he first hears about him? How does his thinking about Goat Man change?\n\n7. What are Carson's reasons for not wanting to train Magnus Yarborough's horses? Why does he finally agree to train them? How does his decision to go against his basic rules for training horses turn out?\n\n8. How do you feel about the development of the relationship between Carson Fielding and Rebecca Yarborough? Does it cross any boundaries into becoming an improper relationship? Would you say that their relationship justified Magnus' behavior toward his cattle and Carson?\n\n9. Relationships with fathers are a key element to the story. Discuss the relationship between Carson and his father, Charles; between Charles and his father Ves; between Willie and his father.\n\n10. What about the relationship between Earl Walks Alone and his father Cyrus? Has his father impacted Earl's life even though he is no longer alive? Give some examples.\n\n11. Another father-son relationship that the book touches on is the one between the biblical characters of Abraham and Isaac. (p. 344 f.) How does this connect with the rest of the story?\n\n12. What is Lebensborn? What role does it play in forming who Willie is? How does it affect who his father is?\n\n13. Why does Carson object to selling the ranch? Why does his father Charles want to sell it? What position does Carson's mother Marie take about selling the ranch? Why? Which character do you side with and why?\n\n14. The Work of Wolves explores the role of silence in personal relationships and communities. It also looks at how silence is understood in a community. Find some examples from the story that illustrate these two points. What does Greggy Longwell mean when he says on p. 384, \"This much silence, it ain't as hard to read things, in some ways\"?\n\n15. The first mention of wolves in this book occurs on page 288. The chapter that shares the same name with the title of the book is only one sentence long. Why is the novel called The Work of Wolves?\n\nThursday, March 08, 2012\n\n1.In many ways, Hadley's girlhood in St. Louis was a difficult and repressive experience. How do her early years prepare her to meet and fall in love with Ernest? What does life with Ernest offer her that she hasn't encountered before? What are the risks?\n2.Hadley and Ernest don't get a lot of encouragement from their friends and family when they decided to marry. What seems to draw the two together? What are some of the strengths of their initial attraction and partnership? The challenges?\n3.The Ernest Hemingway we meet in THE PARIS WIFE—through Hadley's eyes—is in many ways different from the ways we imagine him when faced with the largeness of his later persona. What do you see as his character strengths? Can you see what Hadley saw in him?\n4.The Hemingways spontaneously opt for Paris over Rome when the get key advice from Sherwood Anderson. What was life like for them when they first arrived? How did Hadley's initial feelings about Paris differ from Ernest's and why?\n5.Throughout THE PARIS WIFE, Hadley refers to herself as \"Victorian\" as opposed to \"modern.\" What are some of the ways she doesn't feel like she fits into life in bohemian Paris? How does this impact her relationship with Ernest? Her self-esteem? What are some of the ways Hadley's \"old-fashioned\" quality can be seen as a strength and not a weakness?\n6.Hadley and Ernest's marriage survived for many years in Jazz-Age Paris, an environment that had very little patience for monogamy and other traditional values. What in their relationship seems to sustain them? How does their marriage differ from those around them? Pound's and Shakespeare's? Scott and Zelda's?\n7.Most of THE PARIS WIFE is written in Hadley's voice, but a few select passages come to us from Ernest's point of view. What impact does getting Ernest's perspective have on our understanding of their marriage? How does it affect your ability to understand him and his motivations in general?\n8.What was the role of literary spouses in 1920's Paris? How is Hadley challenged and restricted by her gender? Would those restrictions have changed if she had been an artist and not merely a \"wife\"?\n9.At one point, Ezra Pound warns Hadley that it would be a dire mistake to let parenthood change Ernest. Is there a nugget of truth behind his concern? What are some of the ways Ernest is changed by Bumby's birth? What about Hadley? What does motherhood bring to her life, for better or worse?\n10.One of the most wrenching scenes in the book is when Hadley loses a valise containing all of Ernest's work to date. What kind of turning point does this mark for the Hemingway's marriage? Do you think Ernest ever forgives her?\n11.When the couple moves to Toronto to have Bumby, Ernest tries his best to stick it out with a regular \"nine-to-five\" reporter's job, and yet he ultimately finds this impossible. Why is life in Toronto so difficult for Ernest? Why does Hadley agree to go back to Paris earlier than they planned, even though she doesn't know how they'll make it financially? How does she benefit from supporting his decision to make a go at writing only fiction?\n12.Hadley and Ernest had similar upbringings in many ways. What are the parallels, and how do these affect the choices Hadley makes as a wife and mother?\n13.In THE PARIS WIFE, when Ernest receives his contract for In Our Time, Hadley says, \"He would never again be unknown. We would never again be this happy.\" How did fame affect Ernest and his relationship with Hadley?\n14.The Sun Also Rises is drawn from the Hemingways' real-life experiences with bullfighting in Spain. Ernest and his friends are clearly present in the book, but Hadley is not. Why? In what ways do you think Hadley is instrumental to the book regardless, and to Ernest's career in general?\n15.How does the time and place—Paris in the 20's—affect Ernest and Hadley's marriage?

How, and how does Hadley feel about those changes?\n16.What was the nature of the relationship between Hadley and Pauline Pfeiffer? Were they legitimately friends? How do you see Pauline taking advantage of her intimate position in the Hemingway's life? Do you think Hadley is naïve for not suspecting Pauline of having designs on Ernest earlier?

Is there a way she could have fought harder for her marriage?\n18.In many ways, Hadley is a very different person at the end of the novel than the girl who encounters Ernest by chance at a party. How do you understand her trajectory and transformation? Are there any ways she essentially doesn't change?\n19.When Hemingway's biographer Carlos Baker interviewed Hadley Richardson near the end of her life, he expected her to be bitter, and yet she persisted in describing Ernest as a \"prince.\" How can she have continued to love and admire him after the way he hurt her?\n20.Ernest Hemingway spent the last months of his life tenderly reliving his first marriage in the pages his memoir, A Moveable Feast.

His first name is Philip, and his last name is Pirrip. Philip Pirrip. When we try to say that name ten times fast, we end up saying \"filapeera.\" Because it is such a challenging name to enunciate, our narrator decided at a young age to call himself, \"Pip\" for short, and we are much obliged to him. This is a 500-page novel, so the shorter the better.\n\nPip is an orphan who lives in the marsh country along the river Thames, twenty miles from the sea to be exact. He lives with his mean sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, and with her blacksmith husband, Joe Gargery.\n\nPip's parents died before he was old enough to have memories. So he likes to chill in the cemetery with their gravestones. He thinks each grave marker is indicative of their personalities, and, thus, gets to know more about them.\n\nDum dee dum. We continue to hang out with Pip in the cemetery in the late afternoon, chilling with the family graves when, suddenly, someone jumps out of a hiding place and grabs Pip by the throat. This someone looks like Mr. Clean, but a dirty and beat up Mr. Clean.\n\nThe scary Mr. Clean look-a-like tells Pip to be quiet or else. Then he demands that Pip bring him some wittles (a.k.a. vittles; a.k.a. food) and a file (a sharp metal instrument, not something you save on your computer). Then he shakes Pip a little, turns him upside down, tells him he'll cut out his heart and liver if he doesn't obey, and disappears into the marshes."

If so, how?\n\nThe Sentry By Wilfred Owen\n\nWe'd found an old Boche dug-out, and he knew, and gave us hell, for shell on frantic shell hammered on top, but never quite burst through. Rain, guttering down in waterfalls of slime kept slush waist-high and rising hour by hour, and choked the steps too thick with clay to climb. What murk of air remained stank old, and sour with fumes of whiz-bangs, and the smell of men who'd lived there years, and left their curse in the den, if not their corpses …\n\nThere we herded from the blast of whiz-bangs, but one found our door at last, – buffeting eyes and breath, snuffing the candles. And thud! flump! thud! down the steep steps came thumping and sploshing in the flood, deluging muck – the sentry's body; then his rifle, handles of old Boche bombs, and mud in ruck on ruck. We dredged him up, for killed, until he whined 'O sir, my eyes – I'm blind – I'm blind, I'm blind! Coaxing, I held a flame against his lids and said if he could see the least blurred light he was not blind; in time he'd get all right. 'I can't,' he sobbed. Eyeballs, huge-bulged like squids'. Watch my dreams still; but I forgot him there in posting Next for duty, and sending a scout to beg a stretcher somewhere, and flound'ring about to other posts under the shrieking air.\n\nThose other wretches, how they bled and spewed, and one who would have drowned himself for good, – I try not to remember these things now. Let dread hark back for one word only: how half listening to that sentry's moans and jumps, and the wild chattering of his broken teeth, renewed most horribly whenever crumps pummelled the roof and slogged the air beneath – through the dense din, I say, we heard him shout 'I see your lights!' But ours had long died out.\n\nSuicide in the Trenches By Siegfried Sassoon\n\nI knew a simple soldier boy Who grinned at life in empty joy, Slept soundly through the lonesome dark, And whistled early with the lark.\n\nInYour Response to this Theme:\n\nImagine you lived in London during the bombings of World War II.

I had a nice life there; I had my own shop where I used to make fur coats.\n\nOut of the 78 people in my family, I am the only one to survive. My parents had 3 boys and 3 girls: My parents were Jacob and Toby; my brothers were Moishe and Baruch, and my sisters were Sarah, Rivka and Leah. They were all killed.\n\nThe deportations started on July 22, 1942. My other 2 sisters and 2 brothers went to Treblinka. After that I never saw anybody from my family again.\n\nAt Majdanek they took our clothes and gave us striped shirts, pants and wooden shoes.\n\nWe had to walk to work barefoot. After a few days some people could not take it anymore, and they fell down in the road. If they could not get up, they were shot where they lay. After work we had to carry the bodies back. If 1,000 went out to work, a 1,000 had to come back.\n\nThe soldier took us to the railroad tracks, he put us on a train and the next morning we left Majdanek. I had been there 9 weeks. We were on this train for two nights and a day with no food or water. In my 9 weeks at Majdanek I had not changed my shirt or washed myself. We were eaten up with lice, and many of us were swollen from hunger.\n\nWhen we got off the train, we saw that we had arrived at Auschwitz. There was a selection and some of us were machine gunned in a field there. They did not take them to the gas chambers.\n\nI was taken to get a number tattooed on my arm. I got Number 128232. The separate numbers add up to 18. In the Hebrew language the letters of the alphabet stand for numbers. The letters which stand for the number eighteen spell out the Hebrew word \"Chai,\" which means life. After I was tattooed, I was given a potato.\n\nAfter I got out of quarantine, I was put to work building railroad tracks. A young guy came up to me and said, \"I know you.\" I asked him, \"Who are you?\" He said his name was Erlich and that he knew me from Majdanek. I asked him what this place was. He said it was the hospital barracks, Block 20. He told me, \"It is very bad here. Dr Mengele comes two times a week to make selections. But this is Tuesday and he will not come again this week. I will let you know what is going to happen.\" I had not eaten since Monday. He gave me bread.\n\nI was working for over a year with the boys at the same job, digging sand. Every day we loaded up a wagon with the sand and pushed it 16 kilometres. Twice a day we carried sand to Birkenau to cover the ashes of the dead from the crematoria.\n\nI saw when the transports came. I saw the people who were going in, who to the right and who to the left. I saw who was going to the gas chambers. I saw the people going to the real showers, and I saw the people going to the gas. In August and September of 1944 I saw them throw living children into the crematorium. They would grab them by an arm and a leg and throw them in.\n\nI left Auschwitz for Gross-Rosen and 9 days later the Russians liberated it. That cost me 5 months!\n\nGross-Rosen was murder. The guards walked around with iron pipes in their hands. We were put in a shed with two thousand men. In the daytime we had to stand up, and at night we slept head to foot. The only food we got was a slice of bread and a cup of coffee at night. I thought I was going to die there.\n\nEarly at 4 a.m. on 1 May, 1945, near Tutzing, we heard heavy traffic on the highway. We pushed to look out of the two little windows of the train. A jeep drove up with two soldiers. One was a short man, an MP. He spoke good German. He asked who we were. We said we were from the concentration camps. Everybody started hollering and crying."

      "text": "Oliver Twist-Chapter 38-41\n\nThe title of Oliver Twist is deceptively simple. Although it does nothing more than state the protagonist's name, the central mystery of the novel is, in fact, the protagonist's true identity. Oliver's misfortunes have had much to do with the false or mistaken identities others have thrust upon him. Dickens conceals the solution to the mystery of his true identity, leaving just a clue here and there in order to move the plot forward. Various people seek to conceal Oliver's identity for their own personal gain. Oliver's identity is intertwined with Monks's identity, and the connection between the two of them has shrouded both their identities in mystery. Once it becomes clear that Oliver and Monks are brothers, the novel enters its final stage. We begin to have some idea of who Oliver might be, but the story continues since Oliver himself has yet to find out.\n\nThe meeting of Nancy and Rose represents the clash of two very different worlds. Rose has been raised amid love and plenty, and, as a result, her virtue and kindness are almost unreal. On the other hand, Nancy has struggled for survival in the streets, and instead of conventional virtue, her life is full of crime and violence. Yet both were once penniless, nameless orphans. Rose simply had the good luck to be taken in by Mrs. Maylie, who offered her a road of escape from her unfortunate position. Now, Rose offers Nancy a similar road of escape, but it is already too late for Nancy. Their characters can be seen as part of Dickens's argument that the environment in which people are raised and the company that they keep have a greater influence on their quality of character than any inborn traits. Rose and Nancy were born in similar circumstances: only the environment in which each was raised has made them so different.\nNancy's decision to confront Rose with information about Oliver stands in opposition to her earlier decision to drag Oliver back to Fagin. Just as Nancy causes Oliver to become a thief earlier...\n[continues]"

What's your favorite thing about her?\n\nIf you read the first novel, how have lost loves, family dramas, and professional opportunities impacted Valentine? How do they affect her over the course of this chapter in her life?\n\nDo you think Valentine is like most contemporary American women?\n\nWhat role does Valentine play in the Roncalli family? How do the Roncallis define family? How is their notion of family challenged when they learn about their relatives in Argentina?\n\nWhat does Valentine think about Gianluca, and how does she feel about him? How does she react when she receives his handwritten letters? Over the course of the story, do her feelings for him change—or her understanding of those feelings? What does Valentine want from love?\n\nSpeaking of love, June tells Valentine, \"The only urgent thing in life is the pursuit of love. You get that one right, and you've solved the mystery.\" Do you agree with this? Is love the most important thing in life?\n\nCompare and contrast the men in Valentine's life, including her father, her brother Alfred, Brett, Gabriel, and Gianluca.

What is your opinion of June?\n\nWhat is the importance of scent in the book? What are Valentine's favorite smells and the associations she has with them? Do you have a favorite smell?\n\nOne of the novel's themes is trust. Why is trust difficult for Valentine? How do we learn to trust someone? What happens when that trust is shaken? Can it be rebuilt? How are these lessons demonstrated in the various marriages and relationships, from Valentine's parents to Brett's marriage to Mackenzie, Alfred and Pam to Valentine and Gianluca, and even Gram and Dominic?\n\nBret tells Valentine that marriage is a lot of work, but she thinks it should be the easy part. Can it be both? What is your view of marriage? Would you recommend it?\n\nValentine's mother, Mike, built her life upon the philosophy, \"One god, one man, one life.\" What would Valentine's philosophy be? Do you have a personal philosophy?\n\nWhat happens when Val goes to Buenos Aires? How does that trip affect her professionally and personally?\n\nValentine is the \"sole custodian of our family history, and not because anyone asked me to be. The truth is, no one else is interested in the contents of these dusty old boxes, nor do they want to store them. I'm the only Angelini who treasures these old documents and is inspired by them.\" Why is the past important to her? Do you have a family custodian? Why don't Americans seem to care about the past?\n\nGram's move to Italy means Valentine must sort through the furniture, boxes, and documents she left behind. \"Our history can only be told through the things she saved, and now that Gram is gone, it's left to me to decide worth saving.\" How does she learn to decide what's worth saving? What would your things say about your life story? Do you have any special objects you want your children to have and pass down to their children?\n\nForgiveness is a central theme of Brava, Valentine. What does forgiveness mean to the person receiving it—and to the person offering it? Why do some people struggle with forgiveness? Is there any transgression too big to be forgiven?\n\nWhat are Valentina's inspirations for her work? How does she keep her creativity fresh?\n\nGram advises her that the key to creativity is for an artist to leave her comfort zone. How can trying something new be stimulating?\n\nTradition is also very important to Valentine. \"Gianluca taught me that tradition isn't something we do, it's the way we are.\" Explain.\n\n\"Trigiani's endearing heroine, Valentine, struggles to balance her life as a shoe designer with her love life.

      "text": "The Scarlet Letter\n\nChapters 3–4\n\nSummary—Chapter 3: The Recognition\n\nIn the crowd that surrounds the scaffold, Hester suddenly\nspots her husband, who sent her to America but never fulfilled his\npromise to follow her. Though he is dressed in a strange combination\nof traditional European clothing and Native American dress, she\nis struck by his wise countenance and recognizes his slightly deformed\nshoulders. Hester's husband (whom we will learn, in the next chapters,\nis now calling himself Roger Chillingworth) gestures to Hester that she\nshould not reveal his identity. He then turns to a stranger in the crowd\nand asks about Hester's crime and punishment, explaining that he\nhas been held captive by Native Americans and has just arrived in\nBoston. The stranger tells him that Hester is the wife of a learned\nEnglishman and had been living with him in Amsterdam when\nhe decided to emigrate to America. The learned man sent Hester to\nAmerica first and remained behind to settle his affairs, but he\nnever joined Hester in Boston. Chillingworth remarks that Hester's\nhusband must have been foolish to think he could keep a young wife\nhappy, and he asks the stranger about the identity of the baby's\nfather.\n\nThe stranger tells him that Hester refuses to reveal her\nfellow sinner. As punishment, she has been sentenced to three hours\non the scaffold and a lifetime of wearing the scarlet letter on\nher chest. The narrator then introduces us to the town fathers who\nsit in judgment of Hester: Governor Bellingham, Reverend Wilson,\nand Reverend Dimmesdale. Dimmesdale, a young minister who is renowned\nfor his eloquence, religious fervor, and theological expertise,\nis delegated to demand that Hester reveal the name of her child's\nfather. He tells her that she should not protect the man's identity\nout of pity or tenderness, but when she staunchly refuses he does\nnot press her further. Hester says that her child will seek a heavenly\nfather and will never know an earthly one. Reverend Wilson\nthen steps in and delivers a condemnatory sermon on sin, frequently\nreferring to Hester's scarlet letter, which seems to the crowd to\nglow and burn. Hester bears the sermon patiently, hushing Pearl\nwhen she begins to scream. At the conclusion of the sermon, Hester\nis led back into the prison.\n\nSummary—Chapter 4: The Interview\n\nHester and her husband come face to face for the first\ntime when he is called to her prison cell to provide medical assistance.\nChillingworth has promised the jailer that he can make Hester more\n\"amenable to just authority,\" and he now offers her a cup of medicine. Hester\nknows his true identity—his gaze makes her shudder—and she initially\nrefuses to drink his potion. She thinks that Chillingworth might\nbe poisoning her, but he assures her that he wants her to live so\nthat he can have his revenge. In the candid conversation that follows,\nhe chastises himself for thinking that he, a misshapen bookworm,\ncould keep a beautiful wife like Hester happy. He urges her to reveal\nthe identity of her lover, telling her that he will surely detect\nsigns of sympathy that will lead him to the guilty party. When she\nrefuses to tell her secret, he makes her promise that she will not reveal\nto anyone his own identity either. His demoniacal grin and obvious\ndelight at her current tribulations lead Hester to burst out the\nspeculation that he may be the \"Black Man\"—the Devil in disguise—come\nto lure her into a pact and damn her soul. Chillingworth replies\nthat it is not the well-being of her soul that his presence jeopardizes,\nimplying that he plans to seek out her unknown lover. He clearly\nhas revenge on his mind.\n\nAnalysis—Chapters 3–4\n\nThe town has made Hester into a \"living sermon,\" as Chillingworth puts\nit, because she is stripped of her humanity and made to serve the\nneeds of the community. Her punishment is expressed in violent terms.\nReverend Wilson relates an argument he had with Dimmesdale about\nwhether to force Hester to confess in public. Dimmesdale spoke\nof such an action in terms of a rape, arguing that \"it were wronging\nthe very nature of woman to force her to lay open her heart's secrets in\nsuch broad daylight, and in presence of so great a multitude.\"\n\nThe men who sit in judgment of Hester are not only hypocritical but\nalso ignorant. Bellingham, surrounded by the trappings of his office,\nand Wilson, who looks like \"the darkly engraved portraits which\nwe see prefixed to old volumes of sermons,\" both occupy positions\nwhere power is dependent upon self-portrayal and symbols. They know\nlittle of human nature and judge using overarching precepts rather\nthan the specifics of an individual situation as their guides. The\nnarrator tells us that these ignorant men \"had no right\" to \"meddle\nwith a question of human guilt, passion and anguish.\" Dimmesdale,\non the other hand, seems to know something of the human heart. He\nis compassionate toward Hester and is able to convince Bellingham\nand Wilson to spare her any harsher punishment.\n\nAs part of its meditation on the concept of evil, the\ntext begins to elucidate Dimmesdale's character for the reader.\nThe emerging portrait is not altogether positive. Although Dimmesdale\ndisplays compassion and a sense of justice, he also seems spineless\nand somewhat sinister. His efforts to get Hester to reveal her lover's\nidentity involve a set of confusing instructions about following\nher conscience and exposing her lover in order to save his soul.\nThe reader does not know why Dimmesdale declines to speak straightforwardly,\nbut Hester does. When it is later revealed that Dimmesdale is the\nlover she seeks to protect, his speech becomes retrospectively ironic\nand terribly cruel. In this way, The Scarlet Letter comes\nto resemble a detective story: things have meaning only in the context\nof later information. The larger implication of such a structure\nis that lives have meaning only as a whole, and that an individual\nevent (Hester's adultery, for example) must be examined in a framework\nlarger than that allowed by the categorical rules of religion. This\nnotion returns the reader to the book's general theme of whether\nit is ethically right to judge others.\n\nChillingworth, too, begins to come into focus in these\npages. The novel sets up a formal parallel between Dimmesdale and\nChillingworth before the story makes clear the logical connection\nbetween the two characters. In contrast to Wilson's dehumanizing\ncondemnations and to Dimmesdale's mysterious circuitousness, Chillingworth's\nwillingness to take some of the blame for Hester's \"fall\" seems\nalmost noble. He admits that he was not the right husband for Hester\nand that he was remiss in not joining up with her sooner (even though\nhe seems to have been held captive). Yet, he ultimately chooses\nto use his knowledge for vengeance. While he is less hypocritical\nthan the Puritan fathers, who claim to want only the salvation of\ntheir followers, Chillingworth, as the name he takes suggests, is\ndevoid of human warmth. His marriage to Hester—his one attempt at\nhuman contact—has led to disaster, and any compassion he may once\nhave felt has now faded. Bellingham, Wilson, and the rest of the\nPuritan leadership come across as bumbling, ignorant, and silly\nin their pageantry and ritual when compared with the intentionally\nmalevolent Chillingworth, who seeks revenge, destruction, and sin.\nPerhaps most cunningly, he forces Hester to become the\nkeeper of everyone's secrets, thus stripping her of any chance she\nmay have had at redemption or a happy life. Chillingworth's physical\ndeformity mirrors his spiritual deformity. As Hester suggests, he\nis like the \"Black Man,\" because he lures others into sin. By emphasizing\nChillingworth's scholarly training, the text puts a spin on the\nbiblical equation of knowledge with evil: here it is knowledge without compassion\nor human experience that is the greatest evil.\n\nSparkNotes is the best! \"The Scarlet Letter\" has the most confusing Olde English I think I've ever had to muddle through. Thankfully, SparkNotes broke it down for me and explained what's going on when, 'cause you just can't understand with all the beating around the bush!\n\nThis SparkNote was amazingly easy to understand, I just wish that someone would rewrite the book with modern English.

      "text": "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\n\nChapters 11–13\n\nSummary—Chapter 11: Conscience Racks Tom\n\nThe day after Tom and Huck witness Dr. Robinson's murder,\nsome townspeople discover the doctor's corpse in the graveyard,\nalong with Potter's knife. A crowd gathers in the cemetery, and\nthen Potter himself appears. To Tom, Huck, and especially Potter's\nshock, Injun Joe describes how Potter committed the crime. Consequently,\nthe sheriff arrests Potter for murder.\n\nTom's pangs of conscience over not telling the truth\nabout the murder keep him up at night, but Aunt Polly assumes that just\nhearing about the horrid crime has upset him. Tom begins sneaking\nto the window of Potter's jail cell every few days to bring him\nsmall gifts.\n\nSummary—Chapter 12: The Cat and the Pain-Killer\n\nBecky Thatcher falls ill and stops coming to school. Tom's\ndepression worsens, so much so that Aunt Polly begins to worry about\nhis health. She gives him various ineffective \"treatments,\" which\nculminate in an awful-tasting serum called \"Pain-killer.\" Tom finds\nthis last treatment so intolerable that he feeds it to the cat,\nwhich reacts with extreme hyperactivity. Aunt Polly discovers what\nTom has done, but she begins to realize that \"what was cruelty to\na cat might be cruelty to a boy, too,\" and sends\nhim off to school without punishment. Becky finally returns to school\nthat morning, but she spurns Tom completely.\n\nSummary—Chapter 13: The Pirate Crew Set Sail\n\nFeeling mistreated, Tom resolves to act on his earlier\nimpulse to become a pirate. He meets Joe Harper, who is likewise\ndisaffected because his mother has wrongly accused and punished\nhim for stealing cream. They find Huck Finn, always up for a new\nadventure, and the three agree to slip away to Jackson's Island,\nan uninhabited, forested isle three miles downriver from St. Petersburg.\n\nThat night, the three boys take a raft and pole their\nway to the island, calling out meaningless nautical commands to\none another as they go. At about two in the morning they arrive\non the island, build a fire, and eat some bacon that Joe has stolen\nfor them. For the rest of the night they sit around and discuss\npirate conduct. Eventually, however, they think about the meat they\nstole and reflect on the shamefulness of their petty crime—after\nall, the Bible explicitly forbids stealing. They decide that \"their\npiracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing\"\nand fall asleep.\n\nAnalysis—Chapters 11–13\n\nTwain discourages us from feeling sympathy for Injun Joe,\nthe novel's most pronounced villain. We learn that Dr. Robinson\nonce mistreated Injun Joe by chasing him off when he came begging\none night, but Injun Joe's willingness to murder a man as retribution\nfor this relatively minor offense and his decision to pin the crime\non a pathetic drunk who instinctively trusts him confound our ability\nto feel sorry for him.\n\nJoe's status as a \"half-breed\" (he is half \"Injun,\" or\nNative American, and half white) makes him an outsider in the St.\nPetersburg community. The novel contains racist suggestions linking\nInjun Joe's villainy to the presumed contamination of his white\nblood. Joe tells Dr. Robinson, \"The Injun blood ain't in me for\nnothing,\" suggesting that the alien, \"Injun\" part of Joe is what\ninspires his evil. When Injun Joe reappears in disguise later in\nthe novel, he comes dressed as a deaf and mute Spaniard. In a way,\nJoe's choice of disguise is logical, given his dark features, but\nthe outfit also reinforces Injun Joe's foreignness.\n\nAs in Chapter 8, Becky's rejection\nturns Tom to thoughts of piracy. Twain mocks the convention in adult\nromances that unrequited love drives men to desperate acts. Only\nHuck, who joins Joe Harper and Tom as they act on Tom's pirate fantasy,\nadds an authentic outlaw element to the adventure. Huck smokes and\nis something of an outsider in St. Petersburg society. However, whereas\nInjun Joe is completely ostracized by the St. Petersburg community,\nHuck Finn is allowed some mobility within it, as Huck's roles—as\nTom's companion and, later, as the Widow Douglas's adoptee—show.\n\nThe boys' trip to the island and their plans for a pirate\ncareer demonstrate their imaginative energy and their innocence.\nThrough several exchanges, the three reveal that they know very\nlittle about what being a pirate actually entails. The children's\nbooks they have read furnish their entire conception of an outlaw's\nlife. Tom's remarks about pirates that \"they have just a bully time\n… [they] take ships, and burn them, and get the money and bury it\nin awful places [but] they don't kill the women—they're too noble\"\ndemonstrate the degree to which Tom idealizes these figures. Furthermore,\nthe boys' remorse over the stolen bacon—an actual, and comparatively small,\noffense—shows that they don't see the storybook misdeeds they venerate\nas actual sins or punishable offenses. In their shame at having\nstolen the bacon, they defer to the Ten Commandments and to their\nown consciences, irrationally deciding that such mean behavior is\nunworthy of their idealized image of a pirate. Up to this moment,\nwe have seen Tom maturing mentally, as he dreams up scheme after\nscheme. He has matured through his eye-opening experiences, such\nas his witness of Dr. Robinson's murder, and he has matured emotionally,\nas he falls for and is rejected by Becky Thatcher. Tom's rejection\nof sinful behavior, however, marks the first instance of his moral\nmaturation. We know he has the capacity to memorize and imagine\na whole new world of pirates on the high seas, but now we see that\nhe understands right versus wrong as well.\n\nIf u have a big exam on this novel coming up.......instead of reading all the chapter analysis's,read the overall anylsis, quotes and come up with the most important charcters and write out WHO they really are. Just a helpful idea.......!\n\nAfter chapter 17, all the chapters are one chapter behind. So chapter 19 is under chapter 18 and so on. I am not positive if this goes on through the rest of the chapters but I know that after chapter 17, this does happen. Hope this helps!"

Is it because Marianne has not been introduced to Mrs. Smith, or because Willoughby is visiting?\n\n] I must have missed something here because this entire incident has escaped me. Would someone please help to enlighten me?\n\nThe first time I read this it seemed to me that Elinor was questioning Marianne's visit while Mrs. Smith was there. But on closer reading I think she is saying that she couldn't believe (on hearing about the visit from Mrs. Jennings) that neither Willoughby would have asked her to go nor would Marianne have agreed to go to Allenham with Mrs. Smith there since Marianne was not acquainted with her. Apparently, at the very least, Mrs. Smith would need to have met her first. When Elinor says she would not have gone there while Mrs. Smith was there (since they had never had an introduction) nor with Willoughby alone with no other person in attendance leads me to believe there were two options: Through an acquaintance with Mrs. Smith, she could go alone with Willoughby or without an acquaintance she could go when Mrs. Smith was out if there was a chaperone. When Marianne says they went in the carriage and there wasn't room for another person to go as chaperone, it seems to me she just did it anyway even though Mrs. Smith wasn't there. This is just my opinion so if I am incorrect, I hope someone will let us know. Hope this helps.\n:-)"

      "text": "The Chocolate War\n\nChapters 29–32\n\nSummary\n\nChapter 29\n\nWhen Brian Cochran adds up the totals, he is astounded and cannot wait to tell Brother Leon. For the past few days the chocolates have been selling like hot cakes, and although he does not understand why, he is relieved that he has good news to report. He has heard rumors that The Vigils were behind the sale, and he has noticed The Vigils whispering to people in the hallways, making threats, and taking off after school with boxes of chocolates in their cars. He thinks it eerie that everyone is being credited with the sales, and that the numbers for each person's individual sale tally is climbing whether that person has sold any chocolates or not. Carter approaches Brian with money from the sale. He tells Brian whom to attribute the boxes—he looks at the roster and attributes some of the sales to boys who have not sold many boxes. When Brian posts the tally at the assembly meeting, he receives a round of cheers from his fellow students.\n\nChapter 30\n\nBrother Leon insists on conducting the chocolate roll call, even though most people bring their money and report directly to Brian. Leon congratulates boys for selling their chocolates even though everyone knows they were not responsible for the sales at all. Leon calls on Jerry, and as always, Jerry says no. Then, a student named Harold Darcy raises his hand and asks Brother Leon why it is that Jerry is not selling the chocolates. Harold says that he and everyone else have the right to know, since they have all been selling chocolates since day one. Brother Leon asks Jerry to answer the question. Jerry replies: \"It's a free country,\" but Brother Leon says that answer is not good enough. Jerry then confirms that the sale is indeed voluntary, and that he does not have to sell the chocolates. Harold asks Jerry if he thinks he is better than everyone else, and Jerry says no, but that he still refuses to sell the chocolates. The tension in the room mounts and is finally broken by the bell. When The Goober goes into the assembly hall that afternoon, he is met with applause. Someone announces that he has sold his fifty boxes, and Goober is shocked since really he has sold only twenty-seven boxes. His feeling that something is rotten at the school is confirmed, and he tries not to think about what it means.\n\nChapter 31\n\nAs Jerry leaves school, someone stops him, asking in a menacing voice: \"What's your hurry, kid?\" It is Emile Janza, who banters with Jerry for a few minutes, trying to intimidate him. Jerry looks around, hoping that someone is in view, but no one is. He was dismissed early from football practice because he had not completed a single pass. As he left the field, he noticed the other players looking at each other, laughing and smirking, and he realized that they had purposely missed his passes. Instead of practicing, Janza had been waiting for Jerry.\n\nEventually, Janza says that Jerry \"lives in the closet.\" When Jerry asks what Janza means, Janza says that Jerry \"is a fairy. A queer. Living in the closet, hiding away.\" Jerry gets extremely upset, and Janza goes on a rant about how Jerry is poisoning the school. While they argue, Jerry notices a group of boys coming out from behind bushes and corners, and they descend on him simultaneously. Jerry curls in a ball and takes the beating, eventually throwing up and driving the boys away.\n\nChapter 32\n\nJerry makes it home, painfully and quietly, not wanting anyone to see him. He washes himself, and lays in the dark, wishing his mother were there. His father is at work on the night shift. As Jerry lies in bed, the phone rings. He answers, but again, hears only cackling. Soon, the phone calls change and instead of laughing, the voice on the other end says things like \"come out and play, Jerry.\" Jerry looks out the window and sees figures in the darkness and threatens to call the police. The phone rings through the night, and eventually Jerry's dad takes it off the hook. Jerry decides not to tell his father what is going on as he does not want his dad involved at all.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBrian is slow to realize that the rejuvenation of the sale in Chapter 29 is due to The Vigils. Perhaps he does not want to believe it, and would rather believe that everyone suddenly is more invested in the sale. He finally acknowledges it, however, but is strangely unconcerned. Brian concentrates on the bottom line, perhaps a quality he picked up from Brother Leon. So long as he can report good news, and so long as Brother Leon is happy with the totals, Brian is happy. He plays dumb when Carter approaches him, and attributes boxes of chocolates to boys he knows did not sell them. In a way, Brian is an accomplice in the rottenness of the sale, silently acquiescing to both The Vigils and Brother Leon. He demonstrates the ways in which the path of least resistance is the easiest and safest route, and despite having some moral objection to both Brother Leon and The Vigils' manipulation of the sale, he goes along with it because in so doing, he eliminates any personal risk. Brian is a foil for Jerry, who constantly fights the path of least resistance, and does that which causes serious risk to himself both emotionally and physically.\n\nOnce again, The Vigils' plan is working perfectly. The general student support for Jerry had been picking up and some kids also considered refusing to sell the chocolates. In spite of The Vigils, for a few days, Jerry had become a kind of revolutionary hero. The Vigils had to do something not only to sell the chocolates, but also to turn the popular sentiment against Jerry. Cormier does not describe exactly how The Vigils enacted their plan, and how they sold all the chocolates and made the sale popular, but by this chapter it is clear that whatever they have done is working. Perhaps Cormier is vague about the details because, like the mafia, The Vigils work quietly and do not give away their secrets.\n\nHarold Darcy, an average, fairly anonymous student at the school publicly questions Jerry, demonstrating that popular feeling has swung from support to resentment of Jerry. Jerry's response in class is inadequate, as Brother Leon explicitly tells him, and the dissatisfaction of the other students implicitly tells him. Jerry is even more on his own now, as the other students feel that Jerry's refusal to sell the chocolates is indicative of his belief that he is better than the rest of them.\n\nThe Vigils attack on a physical level as well in Chapter 31. Emile Janza is their front man in the assault against Jerry, probably because Archie has used the picture to make sure Janza is involved. Janza first makes Jerry vulnerable emotionally by calling him a queer. Cormier clues into the fact that as a high school boy, being called a queer can be worse than being called anything else, and that it can strip a boy's confidence. Janza taunts Jerry with this idea, and Jerry responds exactly how Janza wants. Then, when Jerry is emotionally vulnerable a group of boys descend on him, making him physically vulnerable as well. The Vigils attack from all sides and angles, making nearly every aspect of Jerry's life hellish. Physically, Jerry cannot fight back. Despite having been attacked on multiple fronts, Jerry does not appear to be weakening. He also makes the conscious decision to fight alone, and does not tell his father what is going on."

These reading comprehension worksheet answers are affiliated with the article, so they won't really make much sense by themselves!\n\nReading Comprehension Worksheet 2 Answers\n\n1. Sainte- Pélagie, Jean Francois' place of imprisonment, used to be a\n\n(C) fencing school\n\nWhy? In line 32, at the end of paragraph five, the reader learns that Jean Francois is imprisoned at Sainte-Pélagie. Paragraph six begins to describe the living conditions there and in line 40, a room is described, which is filled with all the \"all the old apparatus of a fencing school,—broken masks, rusty foils, leather jackets and gloves with the stuffing half out. It was there that the political prisoners had dinner together…\" So we see that the room, and hence, most likely, the prison, had once been a fencing school.\n\nWhy? The answer lies in paragraph two, when Jean Francois describes where the police found him - in \"ruined houses\" after his mother dies (lines 6 – 7). We can infer that he was living in those ruined houses, working with the brush seller and catgut scraper, and that when the police found him, he was arrested for being homeless, a crime at the time.\n\n3. The sentence on line 20: \"He talked this way openly, cynically, like a man.\" primarily serves to\n\n(D) demonstrate the effect the protagonist's misfortune has had on his young life.\n\nWhy? Here, with a question that may seem to have a few correct answers, it may be useful to get rid of obviously wrong answers, first. Choice A, \"present new information about the protagonist so his actions are better understood,\" is incorrect because there is no new information about him presented – just previous info expounded upon. Choice B is incorrect because he never argued against reform school. Choice C is wrong because at that point, he didn't show any signs of cunning, and Choice E is incorrect because although there was definite back-story in paragraph two, there is no back-story presented in the sentence itself, and the question relates only to this one line. Hence, choice D must be correct.\n\n4. You could infer that the group Jean Francois joins after his second arrest would most desire to\n\n(E) overthrow the government\n\nWhy? The key to this answer lies in the words \"most desire to.\" What would \"political prisoners\" (line 41) who meet in the leader's room, have violent disputes, welcome a newcomer with the name \"citizen\" and plot governmental offices (as the hunchback does in the last two lines) most want to achieve? Political stature, which can only happen by an overthrow. Choice E.\n\n5. The following are all incidents prior to Jean Francois' initial arrest EXCEPT\n\n(B) Jean Francois commits petty theft\n\nWhy? Jean Francois commits petty theft in line 31, which is his second arrest. Paragraph two contains all of the other choices, which happens before he's arrested for vagabondage, his first run-in with the law."

I would think Georgianna is too old for a governess. What sort of authority, if any, did she hold over Georgianna? What would be her duties? We know that Mr. Darcy and Col. Fritzwilliam were her guardians. Would this be part of an \"establishment\" such as the ill-fated one they set-up with Mrs. Young at Ramsgate?"

I'm not sure if it's because of reading it in little chunks or because the feeling in this part was different. There was decidedly less romance in these chapters - Max came across as precoccupied in a moody kind of way compared to mysterious and suave. In the first three chapters the future looked bleak compared to an idyllic past, but that past is looking less happy now after the less than romantic proposal and the persistent sick feeling in the narrator's stomache.\n\nHow old is she anyway? I had 19 in my head and she acts very young all the time, such as when she's picturing her happy life in her postcard house, doesn't understand Mrs Van Hopper's insinuations she's been sleeping with Max and goes running to Max to make it all better.\n\nStrange that someone who so admired her parent's loving relationship would settle for a cold proposal and recognise there was no mention of love. Does the dream of the house squish her knowledge this is a bad move?"

His parents are well-off people, since they have a flat with many domestics.\n\n5) Because of his job as an ophthalmologist, Amit's father was invited throughout the world so as to teach in hospitals. That caused the family to move a lot and settle in various places in the whole world.\n\n6) Firstly, he was the only student of Indian origins: l. 22 : \"Amit was the only Indian student\", and that was apparently the first time it happened to him. Moreover, he had arrived there for the fourth year, and his classmates already knew one another, so it was not easy for Amit to become integrated: l.25- 26 \"by that time, friendships (…) in place. Amit also had to go to church on week ends: l l.28-29: \"attend chapel on Sundays.\". In addition, even though he was a brilliant student before, he had to work very hard to have good results in Langford: l.27: \"he'd had to work doggedly to maintain his grades\". Lastly, Amit realised that his classmates were far richer than him and his family: l.29 : \" his parents' wealth was laughable compared to the majority of Langford boys.\n\n7) This sentence shows that, despite the difficulties Amit had to face and the fact that he missed his family very much, as far as his integration is concerned, he tried to do his best to adapt to his new life in Langford.\n\n8) His parents had chosen Amit to study in Langford because it is a good school, with very good results. Indeed, Amit's father tells him about the number of student from Langford who go to the most famous American Universities. Moreover, even if his parents were moving to Dehli, they don't want their son to study in India, and want him to attend a good school.\n\n9) Amit is angry at his parents who sent him to study far away from them. Moreover, he has to make many efforts to get used to his new way of life, and he reproaches them the decision they made to leave him, to some extent we can say that he may feel abandoned."

It remains common, for example, to\nspeak of someone \"turning green with envy\" or \"black with\nrage.\" Yellow was associated with jealousy. Jealousy is frequently\nused as a synonym for envy, but envy is rarely used as a synomyn for jealousy.\nThis is because the first meaning of jealousy involves suspiciousness about\nthe feelings or fidelity of another. Minny is not jealous in this primary\nsense. Instead she is covetous; she envies the possessions of others. So\nthe author had a choice. Minny did not have to turn yellow. She could have\nturned green. Why might the author have chosen yellow as Minny's punishment?\nWho else in the United States in the late 1870s was considered \"yellow\"?\n\n2. It is the parrot who gets to pronounce Minny's fate. Why not her wronged\nsister? or her mother who had warned her this could happen?"

      "text": "Special Sub-Topic: The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\n\nThe story begins with an unnamed narrator requesting information from an old man about someone named Leonidas W. Smiley. What is the name of this old man with a proclivity for storytelling?\n\nSimon Wheeler. The narrator describes how a friend of the old man (Simon Wheeler) told him to inquire about Leonidas W. Smiley because his friend knew that the old man would talk about Jim Smiley.\n\nInstead of telling the narrator about Leonidas W. Smiley, the old man tells stories about a man named Jim Smiley. What addiction or bad habit do we learn that Jim Smiley has?\n\nBetting. Jim Smiley would bet on everything from a horse race to which bird on a fence would fly away first.\n\nJim Smiley had a \"small bull-pup\" dog that had a very intimidating name. What was this battle-ready dog's name?\n\nAndrew Jackson. The name seems like a great fit for a fighting dog. I'm glad that there are many laws now-a-days preventing betting on animal fighting.\n\nJim Smiley's prized possession was obviously his \"jumping frog\". What famous political name did Smiley bestow on the frog?\n\nDaniel Webster. According to the old man, Dan'l Webster was the best leaping, most modest, and gifted frog in all of Calaveras County.\n\nHow long did Jim Smiley \"educate\" his frog in order to make him a championship jumper?\n\n3 Months. Jim Smiley trained (educated in Twainspeak) his frog for three straight months in his backyard. According to Smiley, \"all a frog wanted was education, and he could do 'most anything\".\n\nA stranger tells Jim Smiley that he'd challenge Smiley's celebrated frog in a jumping contest, but he can not at the moment because he doesn't have a frog. What wager did Smiley make for this proposed contest?\n\n$40. Forty dollars in 1865 is probably equivalent to over $1,000 today. With all that money at stake, Jim Smiley should've either taken Dan'l Webster or the stranger with him while looking for another frog.\n\nAs Jim Smiley is searching for a frog to give to the stranger for the competition, the stranger engages in some foul business. What cheating act does the stranger do before the competition?\n\nHe pours quail-shot into Smiley's frog.. How dishonorable! The stranger is probably the type of character that goes town-to-town scamming people.\n\nThe stranger ends up winning the competition because Jim Smiley's frog is unable able to jump. What does the stranger say as he leaves the competition?\n\nI don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog.. The stranger first said this line about Dan'l Webster after Jim Smiley stated that his frog \"can outjump any frog in Calaveras County\". To make the comment again after winning an unfair competition is adding much undue insult.\n\nAfter the stranger is gone, Jim Smiley tries to discern why his talented frog wouldn't jump. How does he discover that his frog has been tampered with?\n\nHe picks the frog up and realizes that he weighs about five pounds.. I suppose that a five pound frog is rather hefty. Smiley's suspicions were confirmed when Dan'l Webster vomited quail-shot several moments later.\n\nAs the old man is about to finish the story of Jim Smiley's jumping frog, he is interrupted by another individual. The narrator attempts to leave the locale, but the old man catches up with him. The story ends with the old man beginning to tell the narrator about what?\n\nA one-eyed cow.. The cow \"didn't have no tail, only a short stump like a bannanner\". Luckily for the narrator, he was able to escape the old man before he could tell a story about the bovine cyclops.\n\nDid you find these entries particularly interesting, or do you have comments / corrections to make?

Why?\n\nWhat does Mrs. Marković mean when she says, \"There are two chambers in every heart, one for Judas and one for John\"?

Or would you describe that moment of decision in other terms? Explain.\n\nHow is Robert's years-long pursuit of Sanso like Janeal's attraction to Sanso? How is it different? Does his commitment to bringing Sanso to justice bring out the best in Robert or the worst?\n\nThe Katie who lived represents the best of both women, Janeal and the Katie who died.

      "text": "CBSE class X English Delhi set 1 2007\n\nJoin Us\n\nQ. 1. Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow : (12 marks)\n\nLast June, my elder daughter Sylvie, finished kindergarten at the school near our home in Bethlehem, USA. If my wife, Theresa, and I have our way, Sylvie will graduate from the same school. I am eyeing Sylvie's graduation because I want this to be her only school and Bethlehem to be her hometown. Both goalsfirst one a school, the second a hometown - eluded me. My father was in the army, and I attended numerous schools. Our transient lifestyle offered a grand upbringing, but it came at a cost. Of all those people I befriended on the run, for instance, I've maintained contact with exactly one. I'm generally from everywhere and exactly from nowhere.\n\nI want Sylvie and her two year old sister Linnea, to have that hometown that I missed. It would be a place they know intimately, care about, return to with a thrill. So when Theresa took a teaching post in Bethlehem, we moved from Chicago and decided to settle down here. That was almost six years ago, and the transition was rough. We did not like the paucity of movie houses, usedbook stores and great restaurants. We found instead, cheap shopping malls and cornfields being transformed into faceless suburbs. It was hard to imagine blossoming in such a place. We began to seek out the good things in Bethlehem, of which, we discovered, there are many. In short order we turned up the children's corner of the public library, a number of parks and the folkmusic club that draws top performers to a venue no bigger than our living room.\n\nWhere we found good places, we found good people. Slowly their numbers increased. Soon we discovered we had knit together a circle of dear friends. As our friendship strengthened, so, too did an unspoken belief that we would be here for each other over the long haul. We'd watch each other's children grow up; offer them a hand where we could, support each other through the joys and travails of parenthood.\n\nThere's a yearly party, a joint sale and more potluck dinners than I can count. We've celebrated both of Linnea's birthdays with a bash on our front lawn. On Saturday mornings when many of us converge downtown, the shopkeepers greet me and my children by name, and hand out goodies. To the old-timers here, all this might be unremarkable. But to the vagabond like me, this acceptance is heart-warming, nourishing and ultimately sustaining. So why resist its pull ? Because it's a mistake to take for granted a good community, or to assume we'd be lucky enough to find one somewhere else. In the end, good and lasting community arises from a commitment to it. And there's no more basic commitment than staying put.\n\n1.1 Complete the summary given below. Use only a word to fill in the blanks. (1×5=5)\n\nThe author decided to stay put at Bethlehem as he wanted it to be his (a) _____________________ hometown. Though upset about the lack of (b) ___________________, he and his wife started to seek out the good things there. Soon a strong bond developed between them and their (c)___________________.

Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow : (8 marks)\n\nSet in the declining but still green Western Ghats in the South-West of Karnataka, Coorg is the heart of India's coffee country. Coffee is the world's most heavily traded commodity after crude oil. Coorg boasts a land area four times larger than Hong Kong and seven times the area of Singapore. Most of it is under tree cover because unlike tea plants, the coffee bush requires shade.\n\nIndia is acknowledged as the producer of the finest mild coffees. With their tropical climate, high altitude, abundant rainfall and fertile soil, Coorg and the neighbouring Chickmangalur districts in Karnataka have consistently produced and exported high quality coffee for over 150 years. The coffee output of these two districts accounts for 70 percent of the total coffee produced in the country. Coorg coffee is valued for its blue colour, clean beans and fine liquoring qualities and hence is in demand in the international markets.\n\nIn March and April, the coffee blossom time in Coorg, when blossoms transform into berries, the bushes are cropped. The cherry-red fruit is then pulped; the seeds separated, dried and sent for curing. Coorg or Kodagu is the district which is one of the largest producers of pepper, cardamom and honey in the world.\n\nNot much is known about the early history of Coorg. Recorded history is available only from 1600 A.D. onwards when Kodava Rajas ruled over the region and established their capital at Mercara by constructing a mud-walled fort. The martial Kodavas troubled Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan, who ruled the Mysore region in the 18th century, by way of sporadic rebellions. But in 1785, Tipu's large army marched into Kodagu and devastated the kingdom. Fourteen years later, with the help of the British, who defeated Tipu Sultan following the historic siege of Srirangapatana in 1799, Coorg regained independence and under the leadership of Raja Veerarajendra rebuilt the capital. Later in 1834, the British exiled its ruler Chikkaveera Rajendra and assumed administrative charge of the district. The British left India in 1947, leaving behind a legacy of coffee plantations, colonial buildings and well-planned road networks.\n\n2.1 Complete the following : (1×4=4 marks)\n\nThe tea plants are unlike coffee plants as the latter _____________ .\n\nCoorg coffee is internationally acclaimed for its _____________ .\n\nCoorg is famous not only for coffee but also for _____________ .\n\nAfter crude oil, coffee is the _____________ .\n\n2.2 Complete the table given below : (1×4=4 marks)\n\nYear\n\nEvents\n\n(a) _________\n\nRecorded history of Coorg available from\n\n1785 AD\n\n(b) ____________________\n\n(c) ________\n\nCoorg regained independence\n\n1834 AD\n\n(d) ____________________\n\nSECTION - B\n\nWriting (30 marks)\n\nQ. 3.

His sister, Sue, joins him at the site for a kind of impromptu commemoration. At the end of the section, David says, \"I sit back, close my eyes, and remember.\" Though we never return to this present-tense present, how does the retrospective frame enrich the novel?\n\nIn Sook to Noona to Susan to Sue. Across the book, each member of the Kim family changes. How does the new culture they have to navigate accelerate their transformations? Who changes the most? The Kims take on American attributes, but don't leave their Korean culture behind entirely. Which changes does the author portray as losses, and which as gains?\n\nAll comedy is observational. Part of the fun of Everything Asian is how bizarre the Kims find their new world, New Jersey, and how they attempt to make sense of it. Where and how does the author take advantage of these opportunities for satire?\n\nThe structure of Everything Asian is unusual. David is our narrator, yet in between his first-person chapters we get third-person tales of not just his family members but also their fellow merchants at Peddlers Town. Who narrates these stories and why?\n\nOften the younger Kims seem to operate in a completely different world than their parents. How does the author use David's first-person narrative to play up the way the two generations approach America?\n\nEarly on, David sees his father as a loser. Could the same tag apply to the other merchants of Peddlers Town? To all the people in the novel? In a land that reveres success, what are the personal consequences of failure?\n\n\"Girls have to be bold,\" In Sook/Noona/Sue says. How does she seize the role of American woman, as opposed to her mother? How does her mother break from the traditional Korean roles of wife and mother?\n\nSo often the individual relationships within the Kim family seem irrevocably broken, yet the family perseveres, mysteriously reconstituting its bonds. This may be the greatest accomplishment of the novel. How does the author show the various family members moving from bitterness and anger back to acceptance and love?\n\nGenerally epigraphs come at the beginnings of books. How would Sherwood Anderson's famous line from Winesburg, Ohio function differently if it preceded the novel? How does it apply to the Kims? To the residents of Peddlers Town?\n\nUnless otherwise stated, this discussion guide is reprinted with the permission of St. Martin's Griffin"

They bowed and curtsied to one another; shaking hands was still quite \"modern\". Although clothes had loosened up a bit in the previous decade or so, women did wear corsets, and the sort of \"stocks\" and collars men wore under theri chins did the same thing: people kept their backs straight, their heads up, didn't lean against the backs of their chairs, etc.\n\nSo for W. to just settle back against the mantlepiece as if for a longer chat is a sign of being extremely relaxed, as if, in our day, someone sat down on the sofa and put their feet up, as it were. That's why the gesture strikes me as so extraordinary; and remember, he does it _as soon as_ he got what he came for, what his vanity demands: Elinor's \"forgiveness\"."

      "text": "Reading Guide Questions\n\nThese discussion questions are designed to enhance your group's conversation about Wrecker, a heartfelt novel about a group of misfits who form an unusual family amid the trees and valleys of California's Lost Coast.\n\nAbout this book Wrecker is three years old and alone in the world. His mother, Lisa Fay, has high hopes for her son, but the temptations of San Francisco in the 1960s land her in prison. Lisa Fay's sister, Meg, gets custody of Wrecker, but a botched root canal has left Meg brain damaged and fully dependent on her devoted husband, Len. It falls to Len to adopt Wrecker, a skittish but fearless child, but Len quickly realizes that he can't manage both Meg and Wrecker at the same time.\n\nLen's neighbors, the tiny commune at Bow Farm, agree to take Wrecker in. Melody, the youngest, bonds with Wrecker instantly and dreads the day she might lose him to his birth mother. Ruth, the eldest, shares an impish sense of humor with the unruly boy. Johnny Appleseed teaches Wrecker respect for nature and suspicion of the law. And Willow, who walked away from her own family, finds herself fighting two overwhelming urges: her maternal feelings for Wrecker and her growing attraction to Len. As two milestones approach - Wrecker's eighteenth birthday and the end of Lisa Fay's prison sentence - this slapdash family quickly bonds around Wrecker's mysterious history, and the hopeful possibilities of his future.\n\nFor discussion\n\nCompare the three settings of Wrecker: hippie San Francisco, the women's prison at Chino, and the secluded Mattole Valley. How does each of these settings look and feel in the novel? What does Lisa Fay miss most about San Francisco? Why does the Mattole Valley feel like home to Melody?\n\nDiscuss the circumstances of Meg's illness. What was Meg like before she got sick? What toll does Meg's condition take upon her marriage, and how does Len express his devotion and his doubts?\n\nWhat are Len's first impressions of three-year-old Wrecker? What reservations does Len have about taking Wrecker in? Are his worst fears justified? Why or why not?\n\nEach resident of Bow Farm—Melody, Willow, Ruth, Johnny Appleseed, and Wrecker—has survived a difficult past. How do we learn about their histories? What are they running away from, and how do they reconcile a painful past with a hopeful present?\n\nYoung Wrecker's early days at Bow Farm are full of \"love in overalls, love with a spade in its hand.\" (28) Why is taking care of Wrecker such hard work? What does each of his caretakers contribute, and how do they make this unusual family work?\n\nCompare Melody and Willow, the two founders of Bow Farm. How do their personalities, homes, and parenting styles differ? What are the sources of tension between these two friends, and how do they eventually resolve their differences?\n\nLisa Fay puts off naming her son until he says to her, \"I a wrecker.\" (63) What is the meaning of this unusual name? What are some of Wrecker's destructive tendencies, and how does he fight the urge to \"wreck\" the things and people around him?\n\nLove doesn't come easily in this novel: Arlyn leaves Lisa Fay, Melody and DF Al don't stay together, Len misses the old Meg, and Ruth mourns the death of Elizabeth. What does this theme of difficult romance add to the novel? How do these stories of lost love compare to Len and Willow's romance?\n\nTrace the journey of the photo that Belle snapped on Wrecker's third birthday. How does the photo get passed along, and what does it mean to each person who has it? How does it eventually land in Wrecker's hands?\n\nConsider Lisa Fay's fifteen years in prison. How does she cope with her circumstances, and what memories and emotions threaten her sanity during these long years?\n\nWhen Melody tells Wrecker about his mother, she finally understands that \"her omission could be as gravely harmful as an outright lie.\" (239) Why does Melody keep Wrecker's history from him for so long? What are the consequences of her silence? Was her \"omission\" a mistake? Why or why not?\n\nWhile Wrecker is at his first school dance, Len and Willow finally admit their feelings for each other. Discuss how these two scenes fit together: Wrecker meeting girls and Len and Willow getting closer in a bar. What discoveries do these characters make during this trip to town?\n\nWhy does Willow share her own story as a mother in her good-bye letter to Wrecker? Discuss how Willow's family history leads her to give Wrecker the following advice: \"Listen to me. Don't choose. Melody is your mother. Lisa Fay is your mother, too.\" (259). How does Wrecker respond to Willow's advice?\n\nWrecker spans twenty years, from the boy's birth to his young adulthood. When does time seem to pass slowly in the novel? When does it pass quickly? Which important events mark these years of Wrecker's life? How does Bow Farm and the Mattole Valley change over these two decades?\n\nDiscuss the last scene of the novel, when Wrecker, Ruth, Len, Willow, Melody, and Lisa Fay sit down to dinner together at Bow Farm. How does this dinner make them into a family? Why do you think it is told from Ruth's perspective? How would this scene be different from the point of view of another character?\n\nUnless otherwise stated, this discussion guide is reprinted with the permission of Bloomsbury"

How do you think this event changes the course of Hattie's life/the course of the novel?\n\nHattie thinks her mother would have thought the names she chose for her twins—Philadelphia and Jubilee—were \"vulgar,\" \"low and showy.\" But Hattie chose them to \"give her babies names that weren't already chiseled on a headstone in the family plots in Georgia.\" Instead, she wanted to give them names \"of promise and hope, reaching forward names.\" What do you think the author means to convey here?\n\nIn the second chapter (\"Floyd\"), the narrative moves up twenty-three years, to 1948, and focus shifts to Hattie's oldest surviving son.

Does he have feelings for her similar to Pip's feelings for Estella? Or perhaps she is an exhibit, a trophy from his first big case win?\n\nThen there is an odd exchange between Wemmick and the turnkey at Newgate Prison referring to Pip:\n\nTurnkey: 'Is this young gentleman one of the 'prentices or articled ones of your office?'\n\nWemmick: '...Well, supposing Mr Pip is one of them?'\n\nTurnkey: 'Why then, he knows what Mr Jaggers is.'\n\nI wondered whether he was hinting Jaggers was gay; however I did not think homosexuality was acknowledged in nineteenth century British fiction. However, when Mr Jaggers invites Pip and his three associates to dinner, he takes a shine to Bentley Drummle. That made me wonder whether Bentley Drummle was an attractive man, something that Pip could not see. However, at a later meeting after the marriage Jaggers says,\n\n\"So, Pip! Our friend the Spider has played his cards. He has won the pool.'\nIt was as much as I could do to assent.\n\"Hah! He is a promising fellow - in his way - but he may not have it all his own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to be found out first. If he should turn to, and beat her --'\n\nAfter that I wondered whether Jaggers had seen from the first that Estella would marry Drummle. When I discovered on the internet that Drummle had died by the end of the book, I wondered whether there was a second phase to the revenge mission against men and that Jaggers was aware of it. The first phase would be the breaking of hearts that we all knew about. The second phase would be to destroy a man. I wondered how she would do it. Maybe she would drive him to suicide. I found that very depressing because that would mean Estella was a psychopath. However, it did not turn out that way, so maybe Jaggers just approved of the marriage because he did not want Estella to continue her cruelty on any man who was not as unpleasant as Bentley Drummle.\n\nLastly, what type of lawyer is Mr Jaggers? Is he a solicitor or a barrister? It seems like he argues in court, so that would suggest a barrister, but in his other tasks he seems more like a solicitor."

How do the jokes and stories help him and Tree-ear face the hard realities of their lives?\n\n2.\n\nIn some ways life in Tree-ear's world is very different from ours in the here and now. What are some of these differences? What are some similarities? Can you imagine Tree-ear or Crane-man or the potter Min living in your neighborhood as modern Americans? What would they be like? What about Kang the potter who invents a new way of decorating pottery?\n\n3.\n\nCrane-man says that seeing the fox actually changed his life, causing him to stay under the bridge instead of going on to the temple. \"Between the fox and you,\" Crane-man tells Tree-ear, \"I was destined never to become a monk!\" What does Crane-man mean by \"destined\"? Is destiny mostly a matter of luck or does it come from qualities in the characters themselves?\n\n4.\n\nWere you surprised when Tree-ear, too, had an encounter with a fox? How does the fox affect Tree-ear's \"destiny\"?\n\n5.\n\nWhere does Tree-ear get the courage for his dangerous mission? Is he already brave before the trip or does his courage grow as he goes along?\n\n6.\n\nDo you think the potter Min is an admirable person? Why or why not? Why does he change in his attitude towards Tree-ear?\n\n7.\n\nBecause of his pride as an artist, Min nearly misses his chance to get the royal commission (pp. 87-89). Crane-man's pride makes it hard for him to take meals in trade for work while Tree-ear will be away (101-102). Yet it's partly pride that makes Min a great artist and that makes the lame Crane-man such a strong person. Then there's Tree-ear, a despised orphan who dares to talk to the royal emissary. How does pride work in our lives, according to the author?\n\n8.\n\nAt the beginning of the story Tree-ear tells how he managed to get some rice from a traveling farmer. How does this brief episode prepare us for the rest of the book? What do you get out of Crane-man's idea that \"Scholars read the great words of the world. But you and I must learn to read the world itself\"?"

Anyway, on a foreboding night, Victor brings the stitched up corpse pieces to life.\n\nVictor is on the brink of the achievement of a lifetime. He has visions of a Nobel Prize in Potentially Evil and Highly Suspect Late-Night Doings. He has created a superior race of people. He is going to win fame and adoration and, oh wait. No! The monster is huge and not exactly aesthetically pleasing.\n\nVictor is roughly thinking, \"uh-oh.\"\n\nBut wait, you say. What's so bad about this monster? Does he club baby seals or throw soda cans in the trash instead of recycling them? Did he hit someone's mother? Nope. Nope. Nope. He's just ugly. That's it.\n\nAnd frankly, who did Victor expect from a pile of corpse parts, Brad Pitt? And isn't beauty supposed to be on the inside? But in this story, beautiful = good, ugly = evil. Got it? Take it up with Shelley. Or societal ideals of the 1800s.\n\nThe monster leans over Victor and smiles at him. Oh, the horror.\n\nBut Victor has just had a nightmare about Elizabeth and his mother's corpses (think foreshadowing), so when he sees the ugly smile, he runs out of his house and spends the night in his courtyard.\n\nThe next morning, Victor goes for a walk. He can't seem to be able to stand being in the same room as someone who is ugly.\n\nIn town, in one of many remarkably convenient coincidences in this book, Victor runs into his dear old buddy Henry near the town inn. Henry has come to study at Ingolstadt. It's the thing to do.\n\nDon't worry – Henry is attractive. So it's okay for Victor to be friends with him.\n\nVictor immediately falls ill with a fever, and Henry nurses him back to health over a number of months. Illnesses lasted a long time back then because they didn't have things like penicillin or hygiene."

      "text": "Reading Guide Questions\n\nWhen you first meet Iris, Wendell, and Ambrose in chapter 1, do they seem mad to you? How do they see one another, and how true do you think their first impressions turn out to be? Use examples from the novel to support your opinion.\n\nThroughout Blue Asylum, attempted rescue is a recurring theme: Wendell and the lamb, Iris and the baby, Iris and Ambrose, Dr. Cowell and Iris. Do you think Iris had any influence over whether Ambrose lived or died? What lessons do you think she learned by the end of the story?\n\nDescribe Dr. Cowell's criteria for a \"sane\" wife. Then, compare Dr. Cowell's relationship with his wife, Mary, to what the doctor tells his women patients they should be to their husbands. How well does his own marriage hold up to his proposed ideal? How do these expectations, fairly representative of Americans in the late nineteenth century, influence the behavior of the women in this novel? How did it make you feel to learn some of the circumstances under which women were committed to asylums during this time period?\n\nThe United States found itself grappling with major shifts in the way people were measured toward the end of the nineteenth century: the abolition movement considered whether African slaves were as equally human as their white masters and what role they should play in society; the women's suffrage movement challenged men to see their wives, sisters, and daughters as intellectual equals who deserved a voice in government; the Civil War raised questions of states' rights versus the need for national identity via federal oversight, and pit American against fellow American based on little more than geography. In what ways does Blue Asylum address these issues? Identify the opinions expressed by various characters throughout, and imagine yourself in their shoes. Do you sympathize more strongly with one \"side\" than another? Why or why not?\n\nWhen Iris undergoes the water treatment, she tells Dr. Cowell, \"This is not treatment. This is torture\" (p. 83). He believes she is insane, and yet he can't let go of her accusations. He tells his wife, \"She called it torture! As though I were some kind of monster!\" Why do you think he is so disturbed by Iris's words, even as his wife reminds him that his patients have taken leave of their senses (and by extension, their opinions of his treatment aren't worth his regard)?\n\nOn page 115, Dr. Cowell finds himself feeling that he \"somehow returned to his youth, as though if he had turned to a mirror in mid-rant he'd see a man with a smooth, young face and a black beard with no hint of grey.\" Contrast this moment with his feeling expressed on page 47 that the island was taking his youth: \"Were he not trapped here, with the lunatics and his moody, attention-demanding wife and son, he'd have been able to remain a younger man.\" Do you feel any sympathy for Dr. Cowell? Why or why not?\n\nWendell is obsessed with the memory of his first childhood love, Penelope, a teenage inmate of the island who commits suicide before the opening of Blue Asylum. How does his unrequited love of Penelope affect Wendell's feelings for Iris? What first draws him to her? If his parents had been more involved in his life, do you think Wendell would have felt the same about the two women? Why or why not?\n\nIn what ways does Wendell identify with the inmates at Sanibel? How does he set himself apart from them?\n\nThe relationships in this novel are beautifully and authentically rendered - they are complicated and complex and rarely what they first appear to be. Discuss Dr. Cowell's relationship with his wife and child, and also with the inmates collectively. Do you think the Cowells love each other? Do you think Dr. Cowell loves his work more or less than his family, and why? Use examples from the novel to justify your opinion.\n\nLydia tells Iris that the latter's love for Ambrose means \"God still sees you not as a lunatic but as His child\" (p. 123). Identify the role that religion plays in the novel, including the characters' expressions of faith and religious feeling.\n\nWhen Iris first asks Wendell to help her escape from the island, he hesitates. With what is he struggling? Why does he first refuse to help Iris and Ambrose? Do you think he's right, or is it like Iris says, that he's just like his father? What ultimately changes his mind?\n\nIt's fairly clear early in the novel that Iris was unfairly committed to the asylum, and the social issue of people (women in particular) being sent off to asylums for simply being \"different\" shines through the narrative. But what about other inmates, like the man whose feet are too heavy, or the woman who intensely feels for every living creature? Who does and doesn't belong in the asylum? Where do you think one properly draws the line of madness?\n\nDr. Cowell changes his mind about Iris several times throughout the novel. What prompts him to consider for the first time that Iris might be telling the truth - that she is the victim of her husband's lies and base character? What changes his mind again?\n\nWhen he finally catches up with her, Dr. Cowell kindly tells Iris that she has made Ambrose \"as happy as he could have been\" (p.262). Do you agree or disagree? Was Iris wrong to take Ambrose with her? What elements factored into Ambrose's eventual breakdown during the war? Why do you think his discovery of Seth's true identity sent him over the edge? Do you think he ever could have recovered from his trauma?\n\nThe color blue plays a significant role in the novel. Identify the ways in which the author uses the color to evoke certain moods or meanings. What various meanings does the color have for each character?\n\nThis novel takes a look at the effects of betrayal on multiple levels. Iris and Lydia betray their husbands' and society's expectations of proper, married women. Dr. Cowell betrays his sacred oath to heal and never harm his patients. Wendell betrays his father's trust. And all of these are set against the backdrop of perhaps America's first and worst betrayal - the war in which she turned on herself, where brother fought against brother. Identify each instance of betrayal in the novel and discuss each character's motivations. Do you feel anyone is 100% justified in their actions? Why or why not?\n\nThough the main action of the story takes place in a setting so far removed it may as well be another country, the effects of the Civil War still cast a shadow on almost every aspect of the novel. From the restriction of goods to the posttraumatic stress haunting Ambrose, identify and discuss how the war influences the characters and events of Blue Asylum. Consider how this influence differs or is similar to the effects of war on Americans today.\n\nDiscuss the ending of the novel. Why do you think the author chose to end with Dr. Cowell back at the asylum, waiting for the mad old woman to come in for her appointment, and with the image of the woman dancing on the beach with her imagined husband? What is the significance of the birds' perspective of the scene?\n\nDiscussion questions written by Ally Peltier.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, this discussion guide is reprinted with the permission of Mariner"

Marks : 20\nRead the passage given below and then answer the questions which follow:\n12 marks\n1. In spite of all the honours that we heaped upon him, Pasteur, as has been said, remained simple of heart. Perhaps the imagery of his boyhood's days, when he limned the familiar scenes of his birthplace, and the longing to be a great artist, never wholly left him. In truth he did become a great artist , though after his sixteenth year he abandoned the brush for ever. Like every artist of worth, he put his whole soul and energy into his work, and it was this very energy that in the end wore him out. For to him, each sufferer was something more than just a case that was to be cured. He looked upon the fight against hydrophobia as a battle, and he was absorbed in his determination to win. The sight of injured children, particularly, moved him to an indescribable extent. He suffered with his patients, and yet he would not deny himself a share in that suffering. His greatest grief was when sheer physical exhaustion made him give up his active work. He retired to the estate at Villeneuve 'Estang, where he and his kennels for the study of rabies, and there he passed his last summer, as his great biographer, Vallery Radot, has said, \"practicing the Gospel virtues.\"\n2. \"He reverenced the faith of his fathers, \"says the same writer, \"and wished without ostentation or mystery to receive its aid during his last period.\"\n3. The attitude of this man to the science he had done so much to perfect can be best summed up in a sentence that he is reputed once to have uttered, concerning the materialism of many of his contemporaries in similar branches of learning to his own: \"The more I contemplate the mysteries of Nature, the more my faith becomes like that of a Breton peasant's wife.\"\n4. But even then in retirement he loved to see his former pupils, and it was then he would reiterate his life principles: \"Work, \" he would ay, \"never cease to work.\" So well had he kept this precept that he began rapidly to sink from exhaustion.\n5. Finally on September 27, 1895, when someone leant over his bed to offer him a cup of milk, he said sadly: \"I cannot, \" and with a look of perfect resignation and peace, seemed to fall asleep. He never again opened his eyes to the cares and sufferings of a world, which he had done so much to relieve and to conquer. He was within three months of his seventy-third birthday.\n6. Thus passed, as simply as a child, the man whom the French people were to vote at a plebiscite as the greatest man that France had ever produced. Napoleon, who has always been considered the idol of France, was placed fifth.\n7. No greater tribute could have been paid to Louis Pasteur, the tanner's son, the scientist, the man of peace, the patient worker for humanity.\n487 words\n\n1.1 Answer the following question:\n\na.Even accolades and honours did not change the simple man that Pasteur was.

Balram variously describes himself as \"a man of action and change,\" \"a thinking man,\" \"an entrepreneur,\" \"a man who sees tomorrow,\" and a \"murderer.\" Is any one of these labels the most fitting, or is he too complex for only one?

      "text": "Reading Group Guide\n\n1. For readers who come to Motherless Brooklyn with little knowledge of Brooklyn, what devices, beyond straightforward descriptions, does Lethem use to capture its distinctive atmosphere?\n\n2. Lionel's wordplay includes variations on his own name?Liable Guesscog, Final Escrow, Ironic Pissclaim, for example. How does this particular quirk serve to establish Lionel's sense of himself and his place in the world? Is there an internal logic about the variations or are they simply haphazard?\n\n3. The Minna Men are all orphans, first introduced as teenagers. Discuss how each of them carves out an identity for himself and why this is important to them. How do the initial descriptions Lionel provides of Tony [p. 39], Gil [p. 40], and Danny [p. 42-43] foreshadow the relationships among the four as adults? Do their characters change in the course of the novel?\n\n4. Does Minna see himself as more than a boss to the young men? Does he make a conscious effort to turn the group into a family or does the family feeling develop from the needs of the young men themselves? What evidence, if any, is there that Minna's interest in them is emotional as well as practical? In what ways does Minna's relationship with his own mother and older brother influence the way he treats the Minna Men?\n\n5. Why does Lionel say \"it was Minna who brought me the language, Minna and Court Street that let me speak\" [p.37]? What parts do Tony, Gil, and Danny play in helping Lionel accept his Tourette's Syndrome? How do their individual ways of dealing with Lionel differ? Which man's support is the most significant to Lionel both as a teenager and as an adult?\n\n6. In describing Gil's explanation of Minna's kidnapping and murder, Lionel says \"English might have been his fourth or fifth language from the sound of it\" [p. 94]. Why does Lethem include this observation and other examples of mangled language throughout the book? How do they put Lionel's own \"language difficulties\" in perspective?\n\n7. In addition to Lionel's wonderful, often poetic riffs, what other specific language patterns does Lethem employ to bring the various characters to life? For example, how do Lionel's conversation with the homicide detective [pp. 109-111], his initial encounter with Kimmery [p. 135] and his interview with Matricardi and Rockaforte [pp. 176-177] create impressions of these particular people that are independent of Lionel's own perceptions?\n\n8. What role does Julia play in the novel? In what ways is she the stereotypical \"dame\" of other hard-boiled detective novels and films and how is she different? Do you think Julia is right when she says \"No woman would ever want you, Lionel....That's not really true. They might want you....But they'll never be fair to you\" [p. 297]?\n\n9. Is Kimmery also a stock figure in this tradition? How does Kimmery's reaction to Lionel's Tourettic behavior differ from the reactions of the other characters? Does the brief, romantic interlude between Lionel and Kimmery advance the plot and if so, in what ways? How does it affect your understanding of Lionel? Is Kimmery \"fair\" to Lionel?\n\n10. The Zen Buddhist communities in New York and Maine are not at all what they seem. Are the characters who participate in the Buddhist Zendo?Lionel's brother, Gerald, Julia, and Kimmery?influenced by Buddhist teachings? Do the principles of Zen Buddhism (either as expressed in the book by Kimmery or from your knowledge) illuminate some of the themes Lethem explores?\n\n11. Does Lionel in fact become a \"real detective\"? Do his techniques fit your definition of detective work? Kimmery, for example, is skeptical about both his intentions and his working style [p. 255]. Do you think her evaluation is accurate? In other detective books you may have read, are the heroes completely removed from the personal aspects of the cases they investigate? Is the solution to Minna's murder fully satisfying in light of the evidence presented in the rest of the book?\n\n12. At several points in the book, Lethem makes direct reference to the genres that inform Motherless Brooklyn — both the classic detective novel and \"wiseguy\" novels and movies. For example, Minna teases Gil for saying \"piece,\" rather than \"gun\" [p. 8]; and Lionel asks \"Have you ever felt, in the course of reading a detective novel, a guilty thrill of relief at having a character murdered before he can step on to the page and burden you with his actual existence?\" [p. 119]. In another passage, Lionel compares himself to the standard set in detective literature: \"So many detectives have been knocked out and fallen into such strange, swirling darknesses...and yet I have nothing to contribute to this painful tradition\" [p. 205]. Why does Lethem include these references? Are they simply there for \"comic relief\" or do they serve another purpose?\n\n13. By using Lionel as narrator, Lethem is following a long tradition in detective fiction. In what ways would the impact on the reader be different if a third-person voice told the story? Why do you think he chose to use a narrator with Tourette's Syndrome? Is this purely a literary device, giving him the opportunity to play with language as an author? Do the classic detective heroes — for example, Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade and Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe — have quirks comparable to Lionel's?\n\n14. Does the title of the book refer only to the four orphans who make up the Minna Men? In what ways is Brooklyn itself \"motherless\"?\n\n15. The Voice Literary Supplement wrote \"Lethem loves to cross-wire popular genres and watch the sparks fly.\" In addition to the conventions of the hard-boiled detective novel, what other genre does Lethem draw on in Motherless Brooklyn?\n\nManek, November 27, 2010 (view all comments by Manek)\nHoly living f*ck this is a great book! (Can I use the F word, Powell's, if I don't spell it out? A fleeting expletive is not legally obscene-- can't be, b/c of the First Amendment. Of course, you, Powell's, are entitled to your own policies. In this case, though, consider an exception. B/c- once again- F*CK!). Finished it around 4 am last night. Jonathan L. is a genius. Which makes the MacArthur grant make sense. It's top notch literary noir with Tourrette's Syndrome. Eat Me! While I'm at it, let me also recommend the audioversion of Lethem's Chronic City. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of his work. (Have to say, though, I didn't love Gun, With Occasional Music, which might be a kind of precursor to Motherless Brooklyn). Plot and characters are both fully developed and satisfying. Go buy it, now! Maybe get it for your friend who likes trashy crime fiction-- the one you wish would read something a little more literary. Telling you- this might be the book. Seriously. Your lowbrow friend will thank you.\n\nWas this comment helpful? | Yes | No (1 of 3 readers found this comment helpful)\n\nThe narrator, Lionel Essrog, known as The Human Freakshow, suffers with Tourette's syndrome and though you might not want to know him in real life, he's got to be one of the most brilliant characters ever created. His quirky rants put me off at first, but I found myself being drawn closer to him with each page, and by the end of the book, I had gained a whole new appreciation for Lionel Essrog. He's trying to find the murderer of the only man who gave him anything resembling fatherly care. Lionel's search takes on rather desperate proportions, but therein lies much of this book's beauty. There's nothing to compare it to a true original.\n\nby Fidel\n\n\"Review\"\nby Time,\n\"Finding out whodunit is interesting enough, but it's more fun watching Lethem unravel the mysteries of his Tourettic creation. In this case, it takes one trenchant wordsmith to know another.\"\n\n\"Review\"\nby The Denver Post,\n\"With one unique and well-imagined character, Jonathan Lethem has turned a genre on its ear. He doesn't just push the envelope, he gives it a swift kick....A tour de force.\"\n\n\"Review\"\nby Nicholas Kulish, Wall Street Journal,\n\"Jonathan Lethem's sixth book, Motherless Brooklyn, superbly balances beautiful writing and an engrossing plot....Motherless Brooklyn succeeds in the end because the author cares about his creations, especially his protagonist, in whom he instills real humanity.\"\n\n\"Review\"\nby The Boston Globe,\n\"Who but Jonathan Lethem would attempt a half-satirical cross between a literary novel and a hard-boiled crime story narrated by an amateur detective with Tourette's syndrome?...The dialogue crackles with caustic hilarity....Jonathan Lethem is a verbal performance artisit....Unexpectedly moving.\"\n\n\"Review\"\nby Washington Post,\n\"One of the greatest feats of first-person narration in recent Americn fiction.\"\n\n\"Review\"\nby Newsweek,\n\"Philip Marlowe would blush. And tip his fedora.\"\n\n\"Review\"\nby Esquire,\n\"The best novel of the year....Utterly original and deeply moving.\"\n\n\"Synopsis\"\nby Ingram,\nFrom America's most inventive novelist comes this virtuoso riff on the classic detective novel. Lionel Essrog, who has Tourette's Syndrome, and three other veterans from St. Vincent's Home for Boys work for a small-time mobster. When the mobster is fatally stabbed, Lionel's world is turned topsy-turvy. A National Book Critics Circle Award Winner.\n\n\"Synopsis\"\nby Random,\nFrom America's most inventive novelist, Jonathan Lethem, comes this compelling and compulsive riff on the classic detective novel."

HE FEELS UNAPPRECIATED AND AS THOUGH HE WORKS HARD FOR NOTHING. HE FEELS LIKE IT IS UNPRINCIPLED TO RECYCLE THE WOOD.\n\n4.

How did the Rachael lose her boat?\n\nIT WAS ATTACKED BY MOBY DICK AND THE BOAT WAS LOST AT SEA. THE SHIP HAD HARPOONED MOBY DICK, AND HE WENT SWIMMING SO FAST AWAY THAT NO ONE EVER SAW THE SHIP AGAIN.\n\n2. Why does Ahab ask whether Moby-Dick has been killed?\n\nHE STARTED TO BECOME UNSURE OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL FIND HIM IN THESE WATERS. HE IS WORRIED SOMEONE MIGHT KILL MOBY DICK BEFORE HE GETS TO.\n\n3. Why is the Rachael's captain investing an uncommon amount of time in his search for the lost boat?\n\nTHE CAPTAIN'S SON WAS ON THAT BOAT.\n\n4. How does Pip make Ahab doubt himself and his mission?\n\nAHAB LOVES PIP; HE IS WORRIED PIP MIGHT GET HURT. SEEING PIP'S MADNESS REMINDS HIM THAT HE IS MAD, AND THAT (FOR THE FIRST TIME) MAKES HIM QUESTION WHAT HE IS DOING.\n\n5. What does Ahab's final comment in chapter 129 mean?\n\nAHAB IS WILLING TO DIE FOR HIS MISSION. HE WILL NOT MOVE, EVEN IF THE BOAT SINKS, UNTIL \"THE OYSTERS COME TO JOIN [HIM]\"\n\nChapters 130 and 131\n\n1. Why does the mood onboard the Pequod shift (the crew is now decidedly gloomy and without humor) in chapter 130?\n\nAhab takes control and is clearly losing his mind (he also loses his hat, which is a scary omen). They are getting closer to Moby Dick – they are nearing the equator (where Moby Dick likes to hang out – this is also where Ahab had his leg bitten off); they are encountering many ships who have met Moby Dick (and those people have died/had other bad things happen because of Moby Dick).\n\n2. What makes Ahab decide to begin standing his own shift at the mast head?\n\nHe wants to see Moby Dick (truth) first – it's HIS quest (and he believes it is his fate). He also doesn't trust the men to actually see the whale or even tell him if they do see the whale.\n\n3. What happens to Ahab's hat and how is this interpreted?\n\nA bird takes the hat (black hawk). They view this as a bad omen.\n\n4. What happened to the Delight when it met with Moby-Dick?\n\nThey were throwing the dead from their boat into the water when the Pequod pulls up next to them. The ship lost one of its boats and five sailors.\n\n5. What is the other captain's opinion of Moby-Dick?\n\nHe says, \"the harpoon is not yet forged\" that can kill him.\n\nChapters 132 and 133\n\n1. In what ways are the things Ahab is saying to Starbuck in their conversation in chapter 132 very different from what we've come to expect from Ahab?\n\nAhab seems to be more kind-hearted than one might think. He seems to regret having left his wife behind for all those years, and he tells Starbuck not to lower a boat to hunt Moby Dick – he wants Starbuck to live and get to go home to his family.\n\n2. Who is the first to spot Moby-Dick, earning the doubloon? Why is this important?\n\nAhab (even though Tashtego yells out only a moment later); thus, Ahab got what he wanted (to be the first to sight the whale – he thought that was fated), and he also got to keep the doubloon.\n\n3. Why are Ahab and his crew unable to attack Moby-Dick as he chews on their boat?\n\nHe is very smart, and he gets his body perpendicular to the boat's keel as he bites the boat; this means that his body is protected by the boat.\n\n4. Why do the other boats not attack the whale after Ahab's boat is destroyed?\n\nThe men from Ahab's boat are in the water near Moby Dick and would be in grave danger if the other men were to attack Moby Dick now.\n\n5. How do Ahab and his crew end up escaping being killed by the thrashing whale?\n\nThe Pequod sails up and right into the battle; this makes Moby Dick turn and leave.\n\nChapters 134, 135, and Epilogue\n\n1. How are the whale and its actions described when he is spotted on the second day? Try to contrast his appearance to Ahab's appearance.\n\nThe whale is seen breaching out of the water \"toward heaven;\" he spouts, and it is glittering, sparkling, and glaring \"like a glacier.\" He seems good and pure, while Ahab seems dark and evil. Notice the darkness of Ahab's skin and face and the blackness of his clothing.\n\n2. On the second day, three harpoons are successfully attached to the whale. Why do the crews have to cut the lines?\n\nMoby Dick swims around in a crazy zig-zag until all the lines are so tangled that the men can do nothing but cut them.\n\n3. What does Ahab say is the reason for continuing the pursuit of Moby-Dick?\n\nHe believes it is his fate.\n\n4. How are Fedallah's four prophecies fulfilled?\n\nFedallah dies before Ahab; then, the first hearse is the whale himself dragging Fedallah down, and the second hearse is the American-wood of the Pequod; next, Ahab is killed by the hemp rope around his neck; finally, Ahab is given neither hearse nor coffin – he died at sea and was drowned.\n\n5. How is Ishmael able to survive the wreck of the Pequod?\n\nHe was thrown far from the fight when Moby Dick rammed into the boat he was in. Then, when it was all over, Ishmael saw Queequeg's coffin and went to float on it.

You'd better\npick out a red one. And say, this hospital of\nours is the real thing. It's the only one\nbetween Dodge and Ogalalla. This strange foreman\nwants to take stock in it. I wonder if that was\nwhat he meant by sawing off a little passel of cattle\non Mr. Quince. Now, don't argue or ask\nfoolish questions, but keep your eyes and ears open.\"\n\nFortified anew in courage, Dell accompanied the trail\nboss to meet his herd. It was a short hour's\nride, and on sighting the cattle, then nearing the\ncrossing, they gave rein to their horses and rode for\nthe rear of the long column, where, in the rear-guard\nof the trailing cattle, naturally the sore and tender-footed\nanimals were to be found. The drag men knew them\nto a hoof, were delighted to hear that all cripples\nwere to be dropped, and half a dozen were cut off and\nstarted up the Beaver. \"Nurse them to the\nnearest water,\" said Straw to the drag men,\n\"and then push them up the creek until I overtake\nyou. Here's where we drop our strays and\ncripples. What? No, I'm only endowing\na trail hospital.\"\n\nThe herd numbered thirty-one hundred two-year-old\nsteers. They filled the channel of the Beaver\nfor a mile around the crossing, crowding into the\ndeeper pools, and thrashing up and down the creek in\nslaking their thirst. Dell had never seen so\nmany cattle, almost as uniform in size as that many\nmarbles, and the ease with which a few men handled\nthe herd became a nine-day wonder to the astonished\nboy. And when the word passed around to cut all\nstrays up the creek, the facility with which the men\nculled out the alien down to one class and road brand,\nproved them masters in the craft. It seemed as\neasily done as selecting a knife from among the other\ntrinkets in a boy's pocket.\n\nAfter a change of mounts for the foreman, Dell and\nthe trail boss drifted the strays up the creek.\nThe latter had counted and classed them as cut out\nof the herd, and when thrown together with the cripples,\nthe promised little passel numbered thirty-five cattle,\nnot counting three calves. Straw excused his\nmen, promising to overtake them the next morning,\nand man and boy drifted the nucleus of a future ranch\ntoward the homestead.\n\n\"Barring that white cow and the red one with\nthe speckled calf,\" said Straw to Dell, pointing\nout each, \"you're entitled to pick one\nfor yourself. Now, I'm not going to hurry\nyou in making your choice. Any time before we\nsight the tent and shack, you are to pick one for your\nown dear cow, and stand by your choice, good or bad.\nRemember, it carries my compliments to you, as one\nof the founders of the first hospital on the Texas\nand Montana cattle trail.\""

Why do you think Oliver Pötzsch chose the title The Hangman's Daughter?\n\n8. Jakob Kuisl's \"holy of holies\" is a \"small study filled to the ceiling with dusty files and old books about what an executioner is and does\" (p. 433). What would your holy of holies contain?\n\n9. At twelve Jakob Kuisl vows: \"Never would he follow in his father's footsteps; never in his life would he become a hangman\" (p. 12). Discuss what you think happens later in life to change his mind.\n\n10. Jakob Kuisl is described as \"An angel with a huge sword. An avenging angel\" (p. 163). Discuss why the hangman is both respected and feared? Do you think that regardless of his profession, he is an honorable man?\n\n11. How do you think the Schongau witch trials differ from the more familiar Salem witch trials?\n\n12. \"Jakob Kuisl, too, knew all about potions and was suspected of sorcery. But he was a man. And he was the executioner\" (p. 48). Why are these important distinctions? Both Jakob and Martha are viewed as outsiders in their community, but discuss some of the differences between the executioner and the midwife.\n\n13. \"If you want to know who is responsible for anything, ask who benefits from it\" (p. 127). Did Johann Lechner's handling of events hinder or help the investigation? Why does he think the Landgrave should be convinced the witch controversy has been contained? Do you think his actions are based solely on greed or for the welfare of Schongau?\n\n14. Is holding one person responsible, whether guilty or not, justified if it saves a community? Where else have you seen a situation like this?"

      "text": "At First Sight\n\nBuy the Book\n\nThis novel picks up a few weeks after True Believer left off, where we learn that Jeremy and Lexie are engaged. By this point, Jeremy and Lexie have known each other less than a month. How did Lexie and Jeremy know so quickly? What role, if any, did her pregnancy play into the decision? Do you know any couples personally who got engaged so quickly? How long did it take you to realize that you wanted to marry your spouse? In his biography, Nicholas says that he told Cathy that they would get married one day, within 24 hours of meeting her. She laughed, but they've been married since 1989.\nDid this factor into the author's decision to open the novel in this manner?\n\nAlvin thinks Jeremy is making a mistake and feels free to tell him so. If you were Jeremy's friend, what would you have said? Lexie is nervous about meeting Jeremy's family, and though they were referenced quite a bit in both True Believer and At First Sight, they are minor characters, in that the reader never even learns the names of Jeremy's parents. Why did the author do this? Should the characters have been developed further? Why or why not?\n\nThe story largely takes place during the forty week period while Lexie is pregnant, which always changes a relationship. Yet, during this time, Jeremy and Lexie are still getting to know each other. How does the pregnancy affect the development of the relationship? Are the developments more positive or negative? At the same time, Jeremy and Lexie are remodeling a house, and Jeremy struggles with writer's block. It seems, to Jeremy anyway, that when it rains it pours. Describe how these challenges affect Jeremy? How do they affect Lexie?\n\nMayor Gherkin plays a lesser role in this novel than in True Believer. The town, too, plays a lesser role. Doris, Jed, Rachel and Alvin, on the other hand, play more prominent roles in At First Sight. Who was the most important of the minor characters? Who was the least important? Why did the author choose to \"switch\" the prominence of the characters in the sequel?\n\nDescribe the symbolism of the mysterious lights in the cemetery. In what ways does this symbolism portrayed in the relationship between Lexie and Jeremy?\n\nWorking late one night, Jeremy receives an e-mail that calls into question whether the child is actually his. At first he dismisses it; later, however, he begins to wonder how well he really knows Lexie. Should Jeremy have told Lexie about the e-mail right away? Would he have believed her? How might the relationship have played out differently had Jeremy been less secretive? In what ways was Lexie secretive? Who was more at fault when the problems in their relationship began to arise?\n\nAfter Jeremy and Lexie are married, Jeremy takes a walk on the beach, where he spies some wild horses grazing on the dunes. This paragraph is one of the author's favorite passages in the novel. Were there any passages that you found particularly insightful, well-written or interesting?\n\nDoris tells Lexie that a happy marriage means meeting your spouse's needs, while they do the same for you. If your spouse could meet only one of your needs, what would it be? What would your spouse's be? (The Ten Needs, from the book, His Needs, Her Needs, are: Communication, Affection, Honesty, Family commitment, Financial Support, Sex, Recreational companionship, domestic support, physical attractiveness, and admiration)\n\nToward the end of the novel, just as Lexie and Jeremy are settling into life as a married couple, new tension is suddenly added to the relationship. How would you react had this happened in your marriage?\n\nThis is the first of Nicholas's novels in which life after the characters fell in love is described in detail. It's also the first novel in which the characters were in love when the book began. In what other ways was this novel different than the author's previous work? Can this novel still be described as a love story? Why or why not?"

      "text": "Study Questions & Essay Topics\n\nStudy Questions\n\nAn answer to this question should point out\nthat money is the be-all, end-all symbol to most of the novel's\ncharacters except perhaps Selden. The upper-class society depicted\nin the novel is built on money. Admission to society is based on\nmoney. Social acceptance and, more importantly, power are products\nof money. To Lily, money means the ability to gain a permanent footing\nin society; that is why she always wants more of it. To Selden,\nmoney is the means by which people are destroyed and false, meaningless\nsocietal relationships are formed. To Bertha, money is the means\nby which she can maintain her power and influence over other people\nin society, getting them to believe whatever she wants them to believe.\n\nA good answer would involve a discussion\nof Lily's continual motivation by money. Her basic motivation, the\navoidance of \"dinginess,\" never changes. Her goal is always to marry\na wealthy man and live in the upper ranks of society. Her social\nstature is what really changes in the novel. As she falls lower\ninto the \"chasm\" Wharton describes, her desire to get out becomes\ngreater. Interestingly, this question could also be answered with\na discussion of how Lily will never change her mind on some things,\nincluding her decision to repay Gus Trenor all his money even though\nshe does not have to, and even though it spells her financial ruin.\n\nTo answer this question, look at Lily's indecision.\nShe holds firm to a constant belief that when it comes to marrying,\nshe can always do better than the current situation offers her.\nThis is why she delays in marring Gryce, Rosedale and Selden. Ironically,\nher standards never go up; they only go down as she becomes more\ndesperate. Nevertheless, if Lily were not plagued by her wishy-washy\nnature, she would have gotten married earlier and most likely lived\nhappily ever after. Her desire for more wealth and more fame (as\nalso seen in her perpetual gambling) is what brings her down.\n\nSuggested Essay Topics\n\n1. Is Lily's death inevitable\nand necessary, or could she have recovered and found a way to get\nback into society? In other words, is Lily fated to die?\n\n2. Describe the differences between\nLily's outlook on society and Selden's. What views do they hold\nin common? On what viewpoints do they differ?\n\n3. Many of the married men in\nthis novel lead boring and sad lives. Compare the attitudes and\ncharacterizations of Gus Trenor and George Dorset to those of Lawrence\nSelden and Simon Rosedale. What do they have in common with one another?\nWhat are their differences?\n\n4. How does the novel work with\nbehavioral details? Pick three tiny details that Wharton uses to\ngive the reader a clue as to what a character is thinking. You may\nwant to consider Lily's blushes and smiles in the novel, as well\nas the role of lighting cigarettes in the novel. Or you can look\nat the opening scene, in which Selden plays a mind game with Lily\nto determine by her actions what she is doing.\n\n5. How does this novel compare\nwith another novel of manners you have read (see \"The Novel of Manners\"\nsection)? You may wish to consider the novels of Jane Austen, Henry\nJames of George Eliot.\n\n6. Lily goes through some sweeping\nmood swings in the novel, fluctuating rapidly between happiness\nand despair. Pick two or three scenes in which Lily goes from happy\nto distressed, and analyze how this happens.\n\n7. How does Selden change over\nthe course of the novel? Explore his struggle between his desire\nto stay detached from society and his love for Lily."

This unlikely team discovers a vein of nearly unfathomable iniquity running through the Vanger family, astonishing corruption in the highest echelons of Swedish industrialism - and an unexpected connection between themselves.\n\nReader's Guide\n\nWho do you consider the novel's protagonist, Lisbeth or Mikael? Why?\n\nWhat point was Larsson trying to make with the themes running through this novel? How do issues such as man's brutality to women, journalistic integrity, and more general notions of trust tie in with each other throughout the book?\n\nWhat function do the sex-crime statistics on each section's title page serve?\n\n4. Re-read the passage from Mikael's book on page 84. What is its significance, in terms of the plot?\n\nOn page 126, Henrik tells Mikael, \"If there's one thing I've learned, it's never engage in a fight you're sure to lose. On the other hand, never let anyone who has insulted you get away with it. Bide your time and strike back when you're in a position of strength - even if you no longer need to strike back.\" Over the course of the novel, who puts this advice to the best use? How, and why?\n\nHow does the involvement of several Vanger brothers with Swedish fascist groups cloud Mikael's investigation into Harriet's disappearance? What role does Harald play?\n\nWhy does Henrik become an investor in Millennium? Does his plan succeed?\n\nDiscuss the character of Lisbeth. Some think she is a \"perfect victim\" (page 324), others find her intimidating, and Mikael wonders if she has Asperger's, but the reader is allowed to see exactly how her mind works. How do you see her? How do you think she sees herself?\n\nWhat do you think about the way Lisbeth turns the tables on Bjurman? Is it admirable, or a sign that she's unstable?\n\nOn page 202, Lisbeth says her new tattoo is \"a reminder.\" Of what?\n\nSeveral times in the novel, Mikae''s journalistic ethics are challenged. Do you consider him to be ethical? In your opinion, is anyone in the novel truly honorable? Who, and why?\n\nAfter reserving judgment for most of his investigation, on page 238 Mikael determines that Harriet was, in fact, murdered and that he's hunting for a killer. What prompts this decision? How does this affect the rest of his investigation?\n\nDiscuss the role of parents in the novel. Who is a good parent, and why? How might Harriet's story have changed if her mother had behaved differently? What about Lisbeth's? Is Mikael a good father?\n\nBlackmail is used several times in the novel, for different ends. Who uses it most effectively, and why?\n\nOn page 400, Mikael tells Lisbeth that to him, friendship requires mutual respect and trust. By those standards, who in this novel is a good friend? Is Mikael? What about Anita?\n\nDiscuss Henrik's request that Mikael never publish the Vanger story. Is it a reasonable request? Does Mikael's acquiescence change your opinion of him? Do Lisbeth's demands mitigate his ethical breach?\n\nWhat ultimately drives Lisbeth to take action against Wennerström on her own? Does she go too far?\n\nRe-read Mikael's statement about the media's responsibility at the top of page 454. Can you think of a situation in the American media that is analogous to the Wennerström affair?\n\nDiscuss the ending. Was it satisfying to you? Why or why not?\n\nSUGGESTED READING Gorky Park by Martin Cruz Smith; Smilla's Sense of Snow by Peter Høeg; The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism by Naomi Klein; The Elements of Journalism: What Newspeople Should Know and the Public Should Expect, by Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel"

In Daughter, Aya Rivers, a vibrant but mischievous teenager, tries to be obedient but has a hard time, particularly \"when she [comes] across a rule that [doesn't] fit into her life\" (page 4). Discuss the notion of rules as a theme that resonates throughout the novel. How do rules factor into the lives of Miriam and Aya? In what ways does following the rules backfire?\n\n2. As a child, Miriam \"was loved, yes, but hers was a childhood defined by the church, and by her mother's restrictions and protection\" (page 62). Examine the parallels between Miriam's and Aya's childhoods and upbringings.\n\n3. How is Miriam, as a parent, the product of her mother and father's attempts to do things \"just so?\" Were Maud and Fred successful as Miriam's parents? Was Miriam successful as a parent to Aya?\n\n4. Up until Miriam meets Bird, she is a silent and respectful girl who never really asserts herself or her point of view. She tells Bird that \"if you say how you feel it's either considered complaining, not being grateful for your blessings, or else not being in control of your emotions\" (page 101). Discuss the themes of silence and voice. How does Miriam eventually use the voice that has been locked within her for so long?\n\n5. Aya, seeking to define her identity, is naturally curious about her absent father. Miriam, attempting to shield her daughter from the bitter truth, tells Aya that her father died in Vietnam. Do you think Miriam should have told Aya the truth about Bird? How might have Aya's understanding of past events potentially affected her future?\n\n6. Devastated by the loss of her first and only love, Bird, and her only child, Aya, Miriam seeks to avenge her daughter's death by opening fire in a police precinct. Are you surprised by this sudden turn of events? Is Miriam justified?\n\n7. Growing up a lonely child, Miriam forges a strong and binding relationship with God. How does prayer and faith factor into Miriam's life? Ultimately, does she break her pact with God?\n\n8. An underlying theme of the novel is the impact of police brutality on families and the community at large. How do you reconcile the fact that both father and daughter are victims of haphazard policing? Considering the high levels of police antagonism, is it a startling coincidence or a probable occurrence?\n\n9. The novel Daughter sharply focuses on familial relationships, in particular, the raising of daughters. The narrator states: \"Aya would be raised a righteous woman, a clean and pure and proper woman. Miriam would not allow her girl to follow the example of her life\" (page 218). Do you think Miriam and her parents would have been as strict and restricting if they were raising boys instead of girls?\n\n10. By the end of the novel, Miriam encourages the women at the Waterkill facility to \"say their stories, the things they knew, the puzzles they'd fit together despite the missing pieces\" (page 259). Discuss the importance of passing on stories and sharing histories. How does Miriam eventually fit her puzzle together in spite of the missing pieces?"

What do you think about his \"sacrifice\" of the barn to help her out? Is it entirely altruistic? What are the unintended consequences to their love for each other? Why does Clover resent her father and betray both him and her nephew, Robert, at the end of the novel?\n\n12. Why does Robert, the good student and good son, allow himself to become involved in Arturo's \"missions\"? Discuss Robert's friendship with Arturo and why Arturo is so appealing to Robert. What do you think of the observation that Turo is \"of everywhere and nowhere?\"\n\n13. What do you think about Turo's activist group, the DOGS, and their acts of eco-vandalism? Do you agree with Turo that conservation efforts like recycling and organic lawn care aren't \"dramatic enough to make a dent\" (p. 172) in society's lazy, consumerist ways -- that true change will come about only through extremism?\n\n14. Discuss the importance of the tree house in the novel. What does it represent, if anything, to each of the four main characters?\n\n15. What do you think of Ira and his relationship with Anthony? How have Ira's fears influenced his relationships in general? How do you imagine the crisis at the end of the book has changed him, if at all?\n\n16. Homes often seem like characters in Julia Glass novels; compare Percy's house with key houses in her other novels, if you've read them (e.g., Tealing, Fenno McLeod's childhood house in Three Junes; Uncle Marsden's run-down seaside mansion in The Whole World Over). Describe Percy's house and its significance to various members of the Darling family. Discuss its tie to the neighboring house and the revelation at the end about the two brothers who built the houses. Why is this important?\n\n17. How have libraries changed over the course of Percy's working life, through his youth, his daughters' youth, and now Robert's youth? Percy doesn't seem to approve of the direction libraries are going and the way in which society regards books. Do you?\n\n19. Why is Sarah so evasive and even hostile when Percy confronts her about the lump in her breast -- and even after she starts cancer treatment with Trudy? What do you think about her decision to marry her ex-boyfriend when he offers her the lifeline of his health insurance -- and to keep this a secret from Percy? What does it say about Sarah and her feelings for Percy? Do you think the relationship, at the end of the book, is salvageable in any form?\n\n20. While visiting a museum, Percy's friend Norval asks, \"So what sort of landscape are you?\" Percy replies, \"A field. Overgrown and weedy.\" Norval then suggests, \"Or a very large, gnarled tree\" (p. 322). How would you describe Percy? How about yourself; what sort of landscape are you?\n\n21. How is The Widower's Tale both a tale of our time and a story specific to its place, to New England"

Find at least 3 examples in the text.\n2) What are the important points of chapter VIII about the reasons for slavery, and what are her objections?\n3) Why does Harriet Jacobs want to flee, and what finally makes the flight possible?\n\n1. Dr. Flint is her master, and she is inferior to him. He can do whatever he wants with her and Linda cannot protest against it; he can have her killed, or send to jail if she disobeys.\nHe has a sexual relationship with Linda. It does not say exactly that he has, but you can read it between the lines.\n3 examples from the text:\n1. But I now entered on my fifteenth year--a sad epoch in the life of a slave girl. My master began to whisper foul words in my ear.\n2. But he was my master. I was compelled to live under the same roof with him--where I saw a man forty years my senior daily violating the most sacred commandments of nature. He told me I was his property; that I must be subject to his will in all things.\n3. If God has bestowed beauty upon her, it will prove her greatest curse. That which commands admiration in the white woman only hastens the degradation of the female slave.\n\n2. One of the reasons for slavery is that slaves usually do not get any kind of teaching from their masters. The slaves believes many of the lies their masters tell them, and they do not think that slavery is worth while exchanging for freedom, if it is so hard to be free. Harriet Jacobs was lucky in that way, because she knew how to write and read.\nHarriet Jacobs admits that the black man is inferior. But, as she tells, it is the white man that has made him so, by torturing and repressing him.\nAnother reason for slavery is The Fugitive slave Law; it forces fugitive slaves back into slavery.\n\n3. Harriet Jacobs wants to flee, because she wants her children to be free. She knows that Mr. and Miss Flint wanted...\n[continues]"

While the real-life author Susanna Moodie suggested that Grace Marks was haunted by the image of Nancy Montgomery's eyes, the fictionalized Grace asserts that the so-called eyes are actually flowers.\n\nWhat alias does Grace use when she flees from the scene of the murder?\n\nMary Whitney. Grace recounts that she chose the name in the belief that the real Mary Whitney, a deceased friend, would have wanted her to use it. Jordan, Parkinson, and Kinnear are the surnames of other characters in the book.\n\nWhere does Grace's mother die?\n\nAt sea. Mrs. Marks dies while en route from Ireland to Canada. Grace is forever disturbed by her parent's maritime burial.\n\nAt Mrs. Alderman Parkinson's, Grace and Mary Whitney throw apple peels over their shoulders to find the initials of the men that they'll marry. Grace's apple peel forms a \"J.\" What shape does Mary Whitney's apple peel take?\n\nNone. It breaks.. The broken apple peel foreshadows Mary Whitney's death, as her early demise means that she'll never marry. Grace meets at least four men who could help her fulfill the fruit's remaining prediction: Simon Jordan, Jeremiah the Peddler, James McDermott, and Jamie Walsh.\n\nMary Whitney dies after a botched procedure. What type of procedure is it?\n\nAn abortion. Her friend's tragic death, coupled with her own eventual institutionalization, causes Grace to develop a fear of doctors.\n\nWhat does Dr. Jordan's mother urge him to do?\n\nMarry. Throughout the novel, Dr. Jordan muses on the prospect of fulfilling his mother's domestic aspirations for him. Still, learning Grace's story remains one of his top priorities.\n\nWhat psychological problem does Grace most obviously display?\n\nAmnesia. Grace has no recollection of the actual murder of Nancy Montgomery. Dr. Jordan, Dr. DuPont and Reverend Verringer eventually speculate that her memory loss is the consequence of a recurring dissociative state.\n\nWho hypnotizes Grace?\n\nDr. DuPont. He allegedly hopes to recover Grace's lost memories, but a possible ulterior motive for his actions surfaces late in the book.\n\nWhat secret behavior does Grace see in the dark while under hypnosis?\n\nDr. Jordan and Lydia holding hands. Grace's comparative coarseness while in her trance disconcerts those around her, especially Dr. Jordan.\n\nWhat pattern does Grace use on the quilt that she makes for herself at the end of the book?\n\nTree of Paradise. The novel is divided into sections named after quilt patterns. Grace notes that, in a symbolic gesture, the tree on her \"Tree of Paradise\" quilt will contain patches of fabric from Nancy Montgomery's dress, Mary Whitney's petticoat, and her own prison nightdress.\n\nDid you find these entries particularly interesting, or do you have comments / corrections to make?

These are rules that everyone seems to operate under although they are never explicity taught. What are some hidden rules in our society? You can think of the microcosm of MRMS or the wider world at large.\n\nIn To Kill a Mockingbird, Scout's early experiences with school are disappointing. What do YOU think school should be about? Use at least three of your List Two vocabulary words in your description. Please remember blogs must use correct punctuation and capitalization and be at least five sentences long.\n\nWhat would you \"title\" the table where you sit for lunch? Why did you choose it? What might other people \"title\" your table? Why might they say that? What table can you not picture yourself at? Why? How might titles and labels lead to prejudice? Are any prejudices okay?\n\nBoth in the dramatization of The Diary of Anne Frank and in the novel we will be reading next, To Kill a Mockingbird, characters are faced with moral dilemmas regarding how they choose to treat other people. About the Holocaust, Marion Pritchard said \"We are our brother's keeper. When you truly believe that, you have to behave that way in order to be able to live with yourself.\" Who in the Anne Frank situation would agree? Who would disagree? What actions or attitudes from those characters lead you to your conclusion?\n\nNow that you have read the short story and watched a film version of \"The Monkey's Paw,\" please compare and contrast these two genres. How did the writer convey mood? How did the director? What elements of the story line did the director find crucial? Which did he leave out or change? Is the theme the same in both? Which do you think is more effective in communicating the theme?\n\nGood readers find ways to connect what they read to their own experiences. Think of a situtation that relates in some way to Laurence Yep taking on the rat with his dad to feel a sense of accomplishment; a Pandora's Box situation with great potential for good or bad that made you very curious; or a culture shock similar to Naomi Shihab Nye's experience moving from the United States to Jerusalem.\n\nWhat was your situation? What did you learn from it?\n\n(Only complete, well-written, grammatically correct responses will be published and recorded.)\n\nFairy Tales often center on the perspective of the \"hero\" or \"heroine\" exclusively. However, other characters have motivations, too, that could be considered. For example, the novel and stage play Wicked tell the Wizard of Oz tale from the perspective of the Wicked Witch of the West.\n\nFor your blog entry, choose a well-known story and write an editorial to the local paper from a different character's point of view. Be sure to use proper punctuation, spelling, etc. as you try to \"set the record straight.\"\n\nIn the story \"Who are you today, Maria?\" the main character has to decide if she considers her cultural heritage a joke or a poem. How would you respond to that question? What do you value about your heritage? What do you not know about or understand well? Please write a grammatically accurate, complete paragraph about what you think of your heritage and how it relates to your identity.\n\nThis quarter our unit question is \"How will you play your hand?\" After playing a round of cards and hearing some of Randy Pausch's \"Last Lecture,\" I want you to think about what the strongest cards in your \"hand\" might be. What are the greatest assets you possess that you really didn't have much to do with? Do you have great family support? Are you naturally very focused and determined? Do you have musical or athletical ability that you were just born with? Have you always made friends easily? Describe one to three \"cards\" that you think are the strongest in your hand right now."

One of the author's descriptions 'feet flying beneath their chairs', made me smile. I cannot just move my feet, my whole body is jumping..even while sitting.

      "text": "1. Porch Lights opens with an epigraph, a poem written by Edgar Allan Poe, and each chapter begins with a snippet from Poe's short story, \"The Gold-Bug.\" How does the poem set the tone for the story that follows? What is the significance of the excerpts from the short story? How do these excerpts tie into the novel?\n\n2. Porch Lights is a story of family—of mothers and children. Compare and contrast Jackie and Annie. What is the source of friction between them—their differences, or their similarities? What are they like as mothers? How do mother and daughter change as the summer progresses?\n\n3. Dorothea Benton Frank beautifully captures the simple and enduring pleasures of family life. In our stressed out, too busy, overextended culture, do you think we've lost sight of these joyous moments? What are some of your favorite moments from the novel?\n\n4. Porch Lights is also a story of friendship. Talk about the bond between Annie and Deb. What draws these women together? How do their different personalities complement each other?\n\n5. Would you call Annie a romantic? Early on in the novel she admits, \"Maybe I was too old for romance or a new love. But I refused to completely believe such a depressing thought because of Deb. She says that on the day you stop believing in love you may as well lie down and die. I think she may be right.\" Is love—or the hope of it—essential to living?\n\n6. Annie and her estranged husband, Buster were separated for eleven years. Why didn't they divorce? Was it jealousy over the handsome neighbor, Dr. Steve Profker, that brought Buster back to Sullivans Island, or do you think he was looking for a way to reunite with Annie? What does Jackie learn about her mother, her father, and their relationship?\n\n7. How have Jackie's experiences as an army nurse shape how she views the world around her—the people and the events that unfold? Is it unfair of her to compare America with Afghanistan, or do her comparisons help keep her grounded? How does Annie's understanding of her daughter's experiences influence her viewpoint?\n\n8. As the summer winds down, Jackie is determined to go back to Brooklyn. Why? What makes her change her mind? What role does Steve play in her decision? What is it about Steve that earns Jackie's trust?\n\n9. Food is also central to the story. Annie loves to cook and entertain. For Jackie, \"it seemed like people who cooked like mad just made work for themselves.\" Do you agree with her? How does the act of making a meal reinforce bonds of family and friendship? Is it work—or a labor of love? By the end of the novel, do you think Jackie still thinks this way?\n\n10. Sullivans Island is both the novel's setting and a character in its own right. What does the island mean to Annie, Deb, and Buster? What about Jackie and Charlie? Describe the island you discovered in the pages of Porch Lights. How does this special place help heal the characters' emotional wounds? Does a cottage on the beach like the Salty Dog sound like an inviting place to visit or live?\n\n11. When Jackie arrives she wonders, \"What is it about this crazy little island? What did it always feel so far away from the rest of the world?\" Based on your impressions while reading Porch Lights, how would you answer her? What does Sullivans Island offer her and Charlie that Brooklyn does not?\n\n12. Annie is proud of Sullivans Island's rich history and lore. What about the place you call home? Do you know any historical facts about the town in which you live?"

Atticus is in Jem's room when Scout gets home and she falls asleep on Atticus' lap as he reads to her.\n\nChapter 31 Analysis\n\nAtticus' example shows Scout that racial prejudice can be overcome with hard work and patience. It must be done one step at a time. Scout shows a definite amount of maturity in the final chapters, but the novel ends with her falling asleep on Atticus' lap which serves to remind us that she is only eight years old."

      "text": "Sandra Kaye Darden never expects to find hope in the little pink house left by her Uncle Poppy. With her adopted son, Jake, missing thousands of miles way, and her family life disintegrating, Sandra feels as if her world is falling apart. But what begins as a simple painting project to help sell the house becomes a secret venture that starts to change everything.\n\nCass and her brother have trouble keeping a roof over their heads and food on the table since they ditched foster care. When a stranger shows up with free sandwiches, Cass has no way of knowing that one lunch will lead to an unexpected partnership, and the creation of a place of refuge that could reunite a divided community. In this moving story of second chances, an unlikely pair of friends will realize the ability of one person to make a difference and the power of what becomes known as the summer kitchen to nourish the soul.\n\nThe Summer Kitchen Discussion Questions: Lisa Wingate\n\n1. In The Summer Kitchen, Sandra seems to regret having given up some of the dreams she held as a young woman. At forty-nine, she feels that she hasn't achieved all she wanted to. Do you think we all feel this, in some sense? What is your greatest achievement? Your greatest regret?\n\n2. Even though, at first, Cass resents Kiki and Opal being in the apartment, she takes Opal under her wing and becomes a parental figure, to the best of her ability. Why do you think she does this?\n\n3. When Sandra sees the children in the Dumpster, she initially fails to recognize their needs, and when she does recognize them she tries to convince herself to leave them to social agencies. Why does she react this way? What barriers prevent us from recognizing the needs of the people around us, or from doing something bold to address them? Do you think one person can make a difference?\n\n4. In a family riddled with substance abuse, Poppy and Aunt Ruth provided an island of safety and security for Sandra. If not for them, what sort of life might Sandra have led? Do you think people are shaped more by inborn personality or by environment? How has your history shaped you as a person?\n\n5. As the relationship between Cass and Sandra develops, Cass recognizes that she was fortunate to have had a mother who \"loved her more than anything.\" Even though her upbringing lacked the financial comforts of Sandra's, what gifts has Cass been given that Sandra lacks? How do these gifts help Cass survive in a difficult situation?\n\n6. Cass repeatedly struggles with whether to share the sandwiches and other food with Angel, Ronnie, and Boo. Why does she hesitate? Why does she eventually decide to hand over the food?\n\n7. Sandra recognizes some of her own insecurities in Christopher. Do you think we inadvertently pass our own insecurities and hang-ups down to our children? In what ways? Have you experienced that in your own life?\n\n8. After only a week of working in the café, Holly is ready to take on the project, yet Sandra is still hesitant. Why do you think it's so much harder for her to make the commitment than it is for Holly?\n\n9. In thinking about the family she has created with Rob, Sandra eventually wonders if she might have \"fixed the moon\" too many times. Do you think it's possible to cripple the ones we love by making life too perfect, too easy? What benefits do we derive from struggle and hardship as we're growing up?\n\n10. In some ways, Poppy's unexpected death serves as a catalyst for change in Sandra's family and in the neighborhood around Poppy's house. If not for Poppy's death, do you think Jake would have ever been honest with his parents about his desire to teach? Would Sandra have branched out in life to do something totally unexpected? Would Christopher have admitted his true feelings about their perfection-centered household?\n\n11. Sandra and Rob's household is in many ways typical of modern households in which families deal with busy schedules, high expectations, and performance pressure. Does a drive to succeed in life and to raise successful children always lead to undue pressure, resentment, or disconnection between reality and expectation? Is it possible to balance \"keeping up with the Jonses\" with being real with each other? If so, how can we go about doing this?\n\n12. Rusty and Cass are in some ways heroic and in some ways tragic characters. What do you think Rusty's future should hold? What should Cass's future hold? In a perfect world, where would the two of them end up?\n\n13. Cass wishes she were older and Sandra wishes she were younger. Why do we often have such a hard time living in the moment and being happy where we are? Was there ever a time in your life when you felt you were in just the right place?"

Discuss the agelessness of love, and how it can transform us at any point in our lives.\n\nA crucial theme of Major Pettigrew's Last Stand is that of obligation. What are the differences between the Pettigrews' familial expectations and those of the Alis'? What do different characters in the novel have to sacrifice in order to stay true to these obligations? What do they give up in diverging from them?\n\nMajor Pettigrew clings to the civility of a bygone era, and his discussions with Mrs. Ali over tea are a narrative engine of the book and play a central role in their burgeoning romance. In our digital world, how have interpersonal relationships changed? Do you think instant communication makes us more or less in touch with the people around us?\n\nMuch of the novel focuses on the notion of \"otherness.\" Who is considered an outsider in Edgecombe St. Mary? How are the various village outsiders treated differently?\n\nFirst impressions in Major Pettigrew's Last Stand can be deceiving. Discuss the progressions of the characters you feel changed the most from the beginning of the book to the end.\n\nThe Major struggles to find footing in his relationship with his adult son, Roger. Discuss the trickiness of being a parent to an adult child, and alternatively, an adult child to an aging parent. How does the generation gap come to impact the relationship?\n\nMajor Pettigrew and Mrs. Ali connect emotionally in part because they share the experience of having lost a spouse, and in part because they delight in love having come around a second time. How do you think relationships formed in grief are different from those that are not?\n\nFor Major Pettigrew, the Churchills represent societal standing and achievement, as well as an important part of his family's history. However, as events unfold, the Major begins to question whether loyalty and honor are more important than material objects and social status. Discuss the evolving importance of the guns to the Major, as well as the challenge of passing down important objects, and values, to younger generations.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, this discussion guide is reprinted with the permission of Random House"

Or at least you get to determine it if you are as rich as the Woodhouses are. If Mr Woodhouse doesn't like late hours, or large groups of people, then that's his preference. We probably all dislike some sort of social occasions.\n\nI generally don't get a sense that Mr Woodhouse is controlling. In chapter 1 JA says that Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by her own. If Emma's doing just what she likes, then where is her father managing to control her? Also, it's clear from chapter 1 that Mr Woodhouse has failed to prevent his older daughter Isabella from marrying, and has failed to prevent Miss Taylor from marrying. Whatever Mr Woodhouse's desire to control those around him, he doesn't seem to be that effective a controller."

[It has the] power to beguile and enthrall.\" —The New York Times Book Review\n\nThe\nintroduction, discussion questions, suggested reading list, and author\nbiography that follow are designed to enhance your group's reading of\nJane Smiley's Good Faith. In this new novel she brings her\nextraordinary gifts to the seductive, wishful, wistful world of real\nestate, in which the sport of choice is a mind game.\n\nReader's Guide\n\nHaving given Joe Stratford the role of narrator, Smiley gives her\nreaders a great deal of access to Joe's thoughts. What difference does\nit make that the novel is narrated in first person rather than third?\nWhy does Smiley give us the story from Joe's perspective?\n\nWhat\nkind of a person is Joe? What does he think about himself, his marriage\nto Sherry [pp. 15–16], and his life? How accurate are his judgments\nabout himself and other people?\n\nLook closely at a couple of\nscenes in which Felicity and Joe are alone together. What specific\ndetails of Smiley's writing style affect the reader's experience of\ntheir love affair? Does Felicity love Joe? Does he love her? If he\ndoes, why does he not pursue her more actively?\n\nDiscuss the\nmain elements of Felicity's character. What is admirable about her? To\nwhat degree is she a typical dissatisfied homemaker motivated by\nboredom and restlessness? Is she playing a game with Joe for her own\namusement? How important is the conversation between Felicity and Joe\nin which she tells him, \"You do tempt me to find the limits of your\nkindness\" [see pp. 141– 43]?\n\nWhat do secondary yet vibrant\ncharacters like the Davids, Gottfried Nuelle, and George Sloan\ncontribute to the novel's world? Do they create a sense of realism? Are\nthey there for comic relief? How important is humor in Smiley's writing?\n\nIn what sense is Jane Smiley interested in exposing certain truths about small-town, middle-class America? What points does\nGood Faith\nraise about how ordinary people respond when they seem to see a chance\nto increase their wealth and raise their social status? What social\nconcerns might have motivated Smiley to take on a novel about the\n1980s? How is the present social climate different, and how is it\nsimilar, to those greedy years?\n\nIs Joe a man who is looking\nfor others to tell him what to do? Consider the descriptions of his\nrelationship with Sally Baldwin and with his ex-wife Sherry. Consider\nhis relationship with Marcus, and with Felicity. Is passivity a major\nflaw in Joe? Might it be considered a part of his charm?\n\nWhat\neffect has Joe's upbringing had on his character? Discuss his\nrelationship with his parents and his rejection of their religious\nlife. How strong a sense of ethics does Joe have? At what point, if\nany, does he begin to act and think more like Marcus?\n\nHow does\nSmiley present Marcus Burns, and how does she develop his character?\nWhat are his attractive qualities? Does Smiley imply that Marcus had\ntalents that were somehow misdirected? What propels him into\ncriminality?\n\nWhat is Marcus's appeal to Joe? On what is their\nfriendship based? On page 413 Joe describes the after-effects of\nMarcus's betrayal and wonders why, since Marcus had already received\nthe money from the loan, he also took Joe's savings. What might have\nbeen Marcus's reason for delivering this deeply personal blow to Joe's\nself-esteem?\n\nIs this novel concerned more with character or\nwith plot? To what degree is the element of surprise important to the\nstory? Is there a sense of inevitability about what is going to happen\nto Joe, and to Joe's money? If so, how does this affect the reading\nexperience? What, if anything, is surprising about the final chapters?\n\nThe novel raises interesting questions about real estate development,\nthe value of the countryside, and one's sense of place. Can you infer\nSmiley's feelings about the widespread transformation of the American\nlandscape during such periods as the 80s? What human emotions drive the\nforces of change?\n\nIs it surprising that central characters\nlike Joe, Gordon, and Felicity escape prosecution? What conclusions can\nthe reader draw from Felicity's involvement with Marcus and Jane?\n\nIs it surprising that central characters like Joe, Gordon, and Felicity\nescape prosecution?

Biddy is willing to do it.\n\nAfter his lesson, he goes to The Three Jolly Bargemen to collect Joe. Joe is with Mr. Wopsle and a stranger. The stranger offers to buy Joe and Mr. Wopsle a drink. Joe generally doesn't like people buying him drinks, but he accepts as not to be bad company.\n\nThe stranger keeps eyeing Pip. Joe gives details about Mr. Wopsle's vocation. The stranger ascertains that he is the clerk at the church that is out in the marshes, attached to the cemetery.\n\nThe stranger asks if there are many gypsies in this area, but Joe says they only get the occasional escaped convict. He tells the stranger about the arrest that they had witnessed. The stranger then asks Joe's relationship to Pip. Mr. Wopsle takes over the explanation when Joe's proves to be unsatisfactory.\n\nPip notices that the stranger is stirring his rum with a file. Pip realizes that the file belongs to Joe, the very one he gave to the convict. He deduces that the stranger knows the convict.\n\nWhen Joe prepares to leave, the stranger gives Pip a shilling. When they get home, Pip's sister unwraps the package the shilling is in, expecting it to be counterfeit. Not only is it genuine, it is wrapped in two one pound notes. Joe takes them back to the Jolly Bargemen to return them to the owner. He returns some time later, saying the stranger had left. He left a message for him at the pub.\n\nPip worries about the money and the stranger, fearing the convict will come after him with the file"

Kantner learns about caribou and the land from Bob and wishes he had Bob's patience to deal with the rapid deterioration of their lifestyle.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nWhat does Kantner mean when he says \"time has come out different than expected\" like the rice? (p. 127)\n\nPoints to consider:\n\nPerhaps he is talking about how life has changed and the old way they used to live isn't possible any more.\n\nWhy do you think Bob and Carrie always \"value a visitor\" in the ways of the old Inupiat? (p. 127)\n\nPoints to consider:\n\nIn a land with few visitors it is wise treat all with respect.\n\nThe Inupiaq had stories they told to remind people to always respect and care for visitors.\n\nWhy might Bob tell the boy to include too much water?\n\nPoints to consider:\n\nPerhaps because he is old and doesn't know, or to make the rice go further so it can feed more people.\n\nThey are in a hurry, too busy with jobs and modern life to slow down to see the details or to not \"rush\" and notice them.\n\nHow can Bob know thousands of intricate details about caribou? (p. 130)\n\nPoints to consider:\n\nBob and Carrie have spent most of their lives relying on caribou as their main source of protein and fat. Bob's knowledge of the animals comes both from years of hunting them, but also respect for the animals.\n\nWhy does Kantner feel insecure around Bob and Carrie? (p. 131)\n\nPoints to consider:\n\nHe's in awe of Bob's knowledge of the land and animals.\n\nWith the \"frontier falling apart\" he feels like he should know more, and is humbled in Bob's presence.\n\nWhat does Kantner mean by saying, \"We the children of changing times on a frontier falling apart?\" (p. 131)\n\nPoints to consider:\n\nPerhaps he is referring to growing up on the frontier as the lifestyle that raised them fades into the past a victim of changing times, laws, and technology.\n\nWhy do you think Bob loves the fringed gentian so deeply?\n\nPoints to consider:\n\nHe respects the fragility and beauty of the plant.\n\nThe flower has no practical use, but has its own spirit -- as Bob puts it, \"beauty, design, color, and perseverance.\" (p. 132)\n\nWhy might time in jail carry no stigma but bringing \"skinny\" meat home will? (p. 133)\n\nPoints to consider:\n\nSkinny meat means a person is a poor hunter, careless, or thoughtless, whereas jail time just means someone got into trouble.\n\nWhat does \"counting coup\" with numbers mean? (p. 134)\n\nPoints to consider:\n\nThe hunters are killing for the sake of killing and their reputation as hunters and not respecting their harvest.\n\nWhat does Kantner mean when he says \"Hunters raised on machines and video games\"? (p. 134)\n\nPoints to consider:\n\nKids who grow up riding fast machines and playing video games instead of learning from elders and learning to hunt the old fashioned way.\n\nWhy does Bob's reaction at news of the wolf kills differ from Kantner's?\n\nPoints to consider:\n\nKantner feels resentment towards the hunters and their lack of respect.\n\nBob shows no \"chagrin\" at the news, perhaps this is because he has dealt with the changes longer than Kantner.\n\nWhy does Kantner say he needs some of Bob's \"wisdom and peace?\" (p. 135)\n\nPoints to consider:\n\nBob doesn't seem to feel the angst and heartache that Kantner feels about the changing times.\n\nHow are wolves and polar bear \"fellow creatures\" to Bob? (p. 137)\n\nPoints to consider:\n\nHe has refused to kill them because he sees them as equals. He respects their intelligence and therefore they are \"fellow creatures.\"\n\nWhat does Kantner mean when he closes the essay by saying he has \"no idea what to do with the recognition\" that he has a \"bottomless respect for the creatures and creations of he land\"? (p. 140)\n\nPoints to consider:\n\nHe's sharing his love and passion for the land, as well as his frustration that he doesn't' t know what to do with his feelings, and in some ways with himself.\n\nFinal Questions:\n\nHow are the lives of Bob and Carrie like the fringed gentian?\n\nAnswer the questions Kantner poses himself at the end of the essay:\n\n\"Subsistence has melted in our hands. Living off the land, how did it drip away?\"\n\n\"How could the cash and the computers, the canned food and machines, have taken so much, left so little?\""

      "text": "Caribou Island\n\nA NovelQuestions for Discussion\n\n1. Caribou Island opens with Irene's recollection of her mother's suicide. How does this set the tone for what follows? How did this tragedy ultimately define Irene's life and her relationship with her husband, Gary? Could events have unfolded for her differently?\n\n2. Also at the novel's beginning, Irene tells her daughter, Rhoda, \"your father wants to leave me, and the first step is to make us move out to that island. To make it seem he gave it a try.\" Is Irene correct? What was the significance of the cabin and Caribou Island for Gary?\n\n3. Examine the characters and their personalities. Focusing on one or two, use examples from the book to create a profile. Did you like any of the characters? What were the motivations for their actions: What drove Gary to build the cabin on Caribou Island? Why did Irene go along with him? Why is Rhoda dating Jim? Why is Carl in Alaska? Why does Jim risk everything to be with Monique? What did each of them want—would they be happy or content if they got it?\n\n4. Alaska has long been considered our last wilderness. What are your impressions of Alaska? What role does the setting play in the novel? How is our idea of masculinity tied into notions of Alaska and the frontier? What does \"being a man\" mean to Gary, Jim, and Carl? How would Irene, Rhoda, and Monique define what a man is?\n\n5. How would you categorize Irene and Gary's marriage? What kept them together? Why didn't one or the other leave? Irene also tells her daughter, \"We all have rules, Rhoda. And your father's main rule is that he can never seem like the bad guy.\" Do you agree? What \"rules\" did Irene live by? What about Rhoda and Jim? What about yourself or others you know—do you have rules?\n\n6. Compare and contrast Irene and Rhoda and analyze their bond. When Rhoda breaks the news about her engagement to Jim, how does Irene react? Should she have kept her opinion to herself or does she do the right thing? Does her advice stem from bitterness or love?\n\n7. \"Gary knew he should feel lucky, but felt nothing except a mild, background terror of how he'd get through the day, how he'd fill the hours. He'd felt this all his adult life, especially in the evenings, especially when he was single. After the sun went down, the stretch of time until when he could sleep seemed an impossible expanse, something looming, a void that couldn't be crossed.\" Why might a man who feels—and fears—such emptiness, be drawn to a place like Alaska? What did Gary think he would find there? What did he ultimately find? Use examples from the story.\n\n8. Shortly after they begin building the cabin, Irene is plagued by debilitating headaches. Were the headaches real, or a manifestation of emotional distress? How does the family react to her distress?\n\n9. One of the themes of Caribou Island is change. Neither Gary nor Irene recognize the person they are today compared to who they once were—as Irene says, \"each new version refuting all previous.\" Do the events that impact us over the course of our lives change us that much? Is it possible to retain the core essence of self despite life's vicissitudes? Do these characters have that core or is its absence the root of their problems?\n\n10. Late in the book, Irene muses about the years past. \"It hadn't been a bad life, on the surface. Something elemental about it. Something that could have been true if it hadn't been all just a distraction for Gary, a kind of lie. If he had been true, their lives could have been true.\" Why does she think this? What isn't \"true\" about Gary and why weren't their lives \"true\" in Irene's eyes?\n\n11. As for her husband, Gary calls Irene \"a mean old bitch\" and accuses her of destroying his dreams. Are they both right? Are they both wrong? How much are each of them responsible for the state of their marriage and their lives?\n\n12. Could Irene's denouement have been prevented? How did you feel at the end? What do you think happens to Rhoda?\n\n13. What did you take away from reading Caribou Island?\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDavid Vann is the author of Legend of a Suicide, winner of France's Prix Médicis for best foreign book and a New Yorker Book Club pick; the bestselling memoir A Mile Down: The True Story of a Disastrous Career at Sea; and Last Day On Earth: A Portrait of the NIU School Shooter, Steve Kazmierczak, winner of the AWP Nonfiction Prize.

      "text": "Answers to the Questions on \"The Father\" (Both Classes)\n\n1. Outline the social concerns and attitude of Thord that are revealed\nthrough his actions and remarks on his first three visits to the priest.\n\nThord is concerned about his son's future and marriage. He is\nconcerned about his position and status in the community. For example,\nThord wishes his son to be baptized on Saturday and without anyone\nelse. This is special treatment. Thord seems to think that if he pays\nenough money, he will get everything he wants.\n\nThord is conceited and thinks that he can control everything. He\nseems selfish.\n\nHe gives quite a lot of money each time to the priest. He visits the\npriest on special, rare occasions and only when he wants something\nfrom him. He wants special treatment for his son. He is quite \"status\nconscious\". He never says thank you.\n\n2. The priest's character is revealed through his questions and\ncomments to Thord. Give three examples and explain what each reveals.\n\nHe seemed very interested in money. For example when he heard whom\nThord's son would marry, he mentioned she was the richest.\n\nHe keeps asking, \"Is there anything else?\" Could it be he wants\na thank you? It could mean he is thoughtful (Jack) or he could be\nasking for thanks. He wants to do his job better.\n\nNeither is he obsequious nor is he supercilious.\n\nHe is philosophical and is concerned with questions of faith, God,\nand religion.\n\nHe is not judgmental.\n\n3. Thord's son has become a \"blessing\" to him at the end of this\nstory. Explain what this means.\n\nIn the story \"blessing\" means that Thord finally realized that\nmoney and power could not bring him happiness. He sold half of his\nfarm and he decided to do \"some better thing\" in his life. It\nmeans to do something for himself and for his soul.\n\nIn the story \"blessing\" is a kind of hope found by the father.\nLater the father realized that money wasn't as valuable as he\nthought, so he learned what was valuable: life itself; his son.\n\nI think the meaning for the \"blessing\" is he should be glad of\nwhat he has right now because he is a powerful man and he has a good\nreputation and privilege. He needs to focus on these good things and\nforget the rest.\n\nAnything you have (such as a healthy son) is a blessing; to know\nthat it is a blessing is also a blessing. His son has transformed his\nlife completely.\n\nLife is not only power and money after he loses son.\n\nRemember to be \"good\" to your teacher, Jacquie! Hand in your\nparagraph assignment as soon as possible. I hope you like the story from\nChina, too."

In the first paragraph, she draws an extended analogy between the instruments of torture used in the Inquisition—rack, thumbscrew, instruments of torture with iron teeth—and the machinery used in the factories. A is not correct; she does not make an analogy using the legal system, though she attacks the laws. The gifts of the public she considers inadequate, but she does not use them in an analogy, making C wrong. She does not mention the Industrial Revolution, eliminating D. E is also wrong; the government is not compared to anything.\n\n2. E\n\n\"We have tried you citizens; we are trying you now …\" indicates that the townspeople are the ones on trial. The factory owners are not mentioned in the general group. A, therefore, is incorrect. The speech does not refer to the foremen or the locked doors, making B incorrect as well. C is incorrect; there is no condemnation of parents' sending their children to the factories. The unions are upheld as a positive force for safety for the working class, so D is inaccurate.\n\n3. D\n\n\"The life of men and women is so cheap and property is so sacred,\" she says. A is incorrect; Rose does not use the dead women and herself as a contrast. B is also wrong; the difference between the foremen and workers is not her subject. She does not make a distinction between the laws and their application, so C is incorrect. The subject of her speech is not the contrast between wages of workers and owners, and E is also incorrect.\n\n4. E\n\nThe second paragraph begins, \"This is not the first time girls have been burned alive in the city.\" Therefore, A is incorrect; deaths are not rare. Rose says, \"Every week I must learn of the untimely death of one of my sister workers. Every year thousands of us are maimed.\" These words also apply to B, which is also incorrect. There is no indication of the girls' carelessness; Rose refers to the firetrap structures, so C can be eliminated. Nor is there any indication of a sleeping foreman, making D incorrect.\n\n5. B\n\nRose concludes her speech with the sentence \"The only way they can save themselves is by a strong working-class movement.\" She tries even in the face of death to strengthen the union cause. A is inaccurate; she does not mention the newspapers. Response 3 can also be eliminated; she makes no reference to the owners or to legal redress. She does not fault the training that the girls receive, making the fourth option incorrect. Although she does call for more generous gifts, she does not think that will solve the problem, so choice 5 is wrong.\n\nGED Language Arts, Writing Practice Test Answers\n\n1. B\n\nCommas belong inside the terms in quotation marks. A is incorrect; the word is being distinguished as a slang or insider term and thus requires quotation\nmarks. C is also wrong. The word temporary is correctly spelled as written. D is incorrect. The comma is required because it introduces an\nappositive phrase that defines the term before the comma. E, likewise, is not correct. The United States is the name of a particular country; as such, it\nis a proper noun and, therefore, requires capitalization.\n\n2. D\n\nThis is a question related to parallel structure. Employs and generating need to be parallel verbs. The best way to achieve that is by\nmaking both present tense. A is incorrect; the staffing industry is a single unit not requiring a plural. Likewise, in B, the term is singular and\nneeds to remain so, making this a false answer. C cannot be done without adding more words, which is awkward. E is incorrect; this is not an interrogative\nstatement but a declarative one requiring a period.\n\n3. E\n\nThe problem in the sentence is the wrong homonym used. The word their is possessive, which is required in the sentence. They're is a\ncontract of they are, and makes no sense. Although it is common usage to use since when stating a reason, the word is best used as\nindicating passage of time. Because is used correctly, making A wrong. C is also wrong. Good and well are often confused, but good is correct here. D makes skills singular; this is not a correct choice. One hopes for a worker who has more than one skill.\n\n4. B\n\nThe issue is antecedent agreement; the pronoun they requires a plural noun, employees. A is incorrect because the original creates a\ndisagreement between the noun and the pronoun to which it refers. C is incorrect; it does not deal with the real issue and creates a further complication\nby adding a disagreement between subject and verb. D is also wrong. Omitting the hyphen in full-time and adding a disagreement between subject and\nverb does not correct the real problem. This is also true of E, which merely removes the hyphen.\n\n5. C\n\nThe problem with the way the sentence is written is that it creates a run-on via a comma splice. By using a semicolon to show that the thoughts of both\nsentences are related, the problem is eliminated. A is incorrect; the original contains a comma splice. B is also wrong. It does not solve the comma splice\nand creates a pronoun antecedent problem. D is incorrect because it creates a subject-verb agreement problem. E, likewise, creates a subject-verb agreement\nproblem in the first clause and is incorrect.\n\nGED Math Practice\nTest Answers\n\n1. A\n\nCandidate A's vote percentage is\nthe number of votes that he obtained divided by the total number of votes cast.\nThen, multiply that decimal by 100 to convert the decimal into a percentage.\nTherefore, Candidate A's Vote is: Percentage\n\n=51.8%\n\n2. D\n\nThe perimeter (P) of the\nquadrilateral is simply the sum of its sides, or\n\nCombine like\nterms by adding the variables (m terms) together and then adding\nthe constants resulting in:\n\nIn this\napplication, it appears that some of the variables do not have a number in\nfront of them; however, the absence of a coefficient indicates multiplication\nby 1 hence m = 1m, x = 1x, and so on.\n\n3. D\n\nFirst add the two straight 150\nyard portions. Also, note that the distance around the two semi-circle turns\ncombine to form the circumference of a circle. The radius (r) of that\ncircle is half of the dimension shown as the width of the track, or 15 yards.\nNow, taking the formula for the circumference of a circle, 2pr and adding it to the length of the two\nstraight portions of the track, we have\n\n.\n\nAnswer D is the\nclosest approximation to this calculated answer.\n\n4. C\n\nTo see this, consider the\nfollowing table, which shows the numbers of coins added to the first few\nsquares, and the equivalent powers of 2:\n\nSquare\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nCoins\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\nPower of 2\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\nThe table shows\nthat in this series, the number of coins on each square represents consecutive\npowers of 2, since the number doubles with each consecutive square. However,\nthe series of powers begins with 0 for the first square, so that for the 64th\nsquare, the number of coins will be 263.\n\n5. D\n\nThe slopes of perpendicular lines\nare reciprocals of opposite sign. For example, in the figure below, line A has\na slope of -1/2, while line B has a slope of 2.\n\nGED Science Practice Test Answers\n\n1. A\n\nEvolutionary fitness is a measure of the ability to transmit genes to subsequent generations. As such, it is characterized by the ability to produce offspring. Although the male wolf described in choice A died young, he lived long enough to produce 4 offspring, more than any of the animals described in the other choices. Therefore, his genes have the greatest chance of being passed on. It is important to realize that evolutionary \"success,\" or fitness, simply requires an organism to live long enough to reproduce, and is measured exclusively by reproductive success.\n\n2. D\n\nThe terms accuracy and precision, often used interchangeably in informal speech, have specific meanings as scientific terms. Accuracy describes how close a measurement is to the actual dimension that is being measured. In this case, both measurements have the same accuracy. Precision is the degree of exactness that characterizes a measurement, or the number of significant figures with which it can be reported. Nancy's measurement is the more precise of the two, because she has reported the length to the nearest millimeter, whereas Mark's measurement is to the nearest centimeter. Note that the ruler cannot measure the length to a greater precision than that which Nancy has specified because the millimeter is its smallest division.\n\n3. B\n\nThe cell body, containing the nucleus, is the control center of the cell and the site of its metabolic activity. Dendrites, which extend from this cell body, receive signals from other cells in the form of neurotransmitters. This triggers an electrical impulse, which travels down the axon to the next cell on the route of the signal. At the end of the axon, neurotransmitters are again released, cross the synapse, and act upon the following cell.\n\n4. A\n\nThe cell body contains the nucleus, as shown in the diagram. In all eukaryotic cells (cells containing a nucleus), the nucleus is the site where the chromosomes reside. The chromosomes carry the genes, which direct the activities of the neuron.\n\n5. E\n\nInformation flow is in one direction, moving from dendrite to axon within a neuron, and then crossing from axon to dendrite to move from cell to cell at the synapse. The electrical impulse that carries information along the axon is assisted by myelin, but there is no myelin at the synapse, so it can have no role there. The flow of information across the synapse is achieved through the medium of neurotransmitters, which diffuse across the synapse to interact with dendritic receptors on the other side.\n\nGED Social Studies Practice Test Answers\n\n1. A\n\nThe Mayan Empire collapsed internally, whereas the other civilizations were conquered by the Spanish. The Incan Empire was the last to fall, making B an\nincorrect choice. None of the empires was located in North America, as the head of the chart makes clear, so C is not valid. The Mayans were not conquered\nby Spain, as the other two empires were. D is thus incorrect. The final choice, E, covers information from outside the chart; still, it was not the only\nempire that offered human sacrifice, as students may recall from their general knowledge, making this an incorrect choice.\n\n2. C\n\nThe Spanish conquistadors were active in both Central and South America during the sixteenth century. A is incorrect; Portugal was active in Brazil, but\nthat location is not mentioned in the chart. The Mayan empire is older than both Aztec and Incan civilizations, making B incorrect. There is no indication\nthat the Incan warriors in Peru tried to assist the Aztec of Mexico when they battled the Spanish more than a decade before another conquistador would\narrive in Peru. E cannot be known from the chart, but it is false; Mayan peoples live in Guatemala.\n\n3. B\n\nThe railroad, which required only 6 to 8 days, offered a 10- to 20-day advantage over all other modes of transporting goods or people. A is an incorrect\nchoice because a steamboat to New Orleans combined with a packet ship to New York required 28 days. The route across the Erie Canal required 18 days,\nmaking C also incorrect. The keelboat, used in the earliest part of the nineteenth century, was only part of the cumbersome 52-day route that required both\nwater and overland travel to reach New York.\n\n4. E\n\nUsing keelboat and wagon required 52 days of travel. Combining steamboat, canal, and railroad cut the time by more than 30 days, a larger amount of time\nsaved than any other new development. Steamboat and packet required 28 days of travel, while the railroad took 6 to 8 days, a savings of 20 to 22 days,\nmaking A incorrect. Likewise, B is wrong; while the canal took 18 days, the railroad took 6 to 8 days, savings 10 to 12 days. The canal route took 18 days\nwhile the steamboat and packet required 28 days, thus saving 10 days and making C wrong. The keelboat and wagon is first chronologically and cannot have\nbeen a predecessor; thus D is incorrect.\n\n5. C\n\nThe men had expected their invention to end war; instead, it became a new weapon. A is often cited as a reference to the Spanish-American War of 1898. Thus\nit is incorrect. The Wright brothers, hoping that their invention would put an end to war, would likely not express the idea in B. Rickenbacker was a\nfamous World War I ace pilot, but given the Wright brothers' desires for peace and their own fame, they probably would not be interested in meeting him.\nThus D is incorrect. E is probably an exaggerated response; the Wright brothers did not regret their invention or experiments."

If so, examine the way your innermost thoughts often conflict with what\nyou believe you want in life.\n\nJessie is the one telling her story. What are the strengths and weaknesses\nof Jessie's first-person narration? Do you think she's able to remain objective\nwhen discussing her unhappiness, or when describing her family and friends?

She joins the Glenville Society\nCotillion, and she and her husband are members of the local country club.\nDiscuss how Jessie is influenced by what she reads in books and magazines, or\nsees in movies, and how her expectations of love and marriage may be\nunrealistic.

How much of\nJessie's dilemma do you believe is based on her desire to keep up with what\nsociety expects of her?\n\nWe know Turner only from the details Jessie reveals, and from the few\nscenes where he appears. What do you think of him as a husband, and what about\nTurner hasn't Jessie told us? Do you believe he loves Jessie? What could he be\ndoing to help her through this crisis?

What are your aspirations?\n\nIn the beginning of the book, Antonia introduces her cousin Veronica as the \"evil nemesis\" in her life (p. 8). Does Antonia let her feelings for Veronica affect her actions? How? Do you have someone like Veronica in your life?\n\nAntonia also has a best friend, Maria Romano. Examine their friendship and write a list of the attributes of a best friend in the style in which Antonia writes her lists.\n\nAndy Rotellini and Michael McGinnis are the two boys in Antonia's life. Compare and contrast them. Do they share any characteristics? What are their good points and bad points? How does Antonia decide which boy is right for her?\n\nDiscuss Antonia's desire to be the Patron Saint of the First Kiss and Kissing and the fact that it was her kiss on Mrs. Bevalaqua's cheek that seemed to precipitate Mrs. B.'s miraculous cure (p. 62). Do you think this is coincidence or are these aspects of the story linked?\n\nSee Antonia's guide \"To Become a Saint You Must Complete the Following.\" (p. 37) What are the possibilities of sainthood for Antonia?\n\nUnless otherwise stated, this discussion guide is reprinted with the permission of Square Fish"

Quote – What is something that sparked your interest, you didn't understand, something that you identified with or one thing that summed up the section for you?\n\n3. Question – What are you curious about after reading this section?\n\n4. Classroom Connection–How might you connect something that you have read about to your students in the classroom?\n\nReplies to This Discussion\n\nI seem to empathize with all three individuals. They were trying to live their lives the best they could under the circumstances. They were all planning to move forward. They had a sense of optimism even though they didn't know exactly what was up ahead. One \"breaking away\" experience in my own lifetime was going to study in London in my junior year of college for a semester. It was quite a leap, but I was looking forward to the challenge. I count it to this day as one of my best choices in life.\n\nThe story about Ida Mae's dad being in a coma and him being encased in an enclosed casket and buried was pretty unsettling. So sad! Reminds me of this article I read recently about a 95-year-old woman who people thought was dead, but six days later, she got up and started cooking because she was hungry. She was able to get out because the coffin had not been nailed: \n\nMr. Edd apparently didn't like that George Starling was leaving. I wonder how others felt about the Great Migration? Were they happy that Africans-Americans were leaving the South, or were they like Mr. Edd, afraid to lose dependable labor?\n\nThe \"Breaking Away\" portion was interesting. Many of our students may be able to discuss their circumstance. For those who may not be able to come up with one, maybe they could predict something that would cause it in the future.\n\n1. Each of the characters are captivating and I have thoroughly enjoyed following each in their journey. If I am most intrigued by Pershing Foster's story. He lives a life of relative privilege, yet he is constantly faced with individuals and seemingly insurmountable forces that seek to keep him \"in his place\". His determination to overcome them is inspiring. I found the social hierarchy within the black community that Pershing's story illuminates fascinating.\n\nAs a military spouse, I identify especially with Pershing's move to Austria. As a young bride, I followed my husband far from home and experienced both the fear of leaving home, the excitement of starting a new life and the ultimate realization that that new life wasn't quite what had thought it would be.\n\n2. A quote that summed up the section for me: \"'What's wrong with St. Francis?' Pershing shook his head. The man had lived there since before Pershing was born, and a central fact of colored people's existence hadn't registered after all these years. 'You know colored surgeons can't operate at St. Francis, Mr. Massur.' The man looked startled and caught himself. White-only and colored-only signs were all over town, but the store keeper had not thought about how segregation applied to the hospital. The storekeeper had watched Pershing grow into an upstanding young man and had known the Fosters for years. For a split second, the storekeeper seemed to see Pershing as no different than any other bright young physician. But Pershings words brought him reality: the rest of the white world did not see Pershing the way the storekeeper did, and that gave the storekeeper an uncomfortable glimpse of the burdens on one of his best customers.\"\n\n3. After reading this section, I am most curious to follow Pershing to California and see he really can obtain the life he seeks there, both professionally and personally.\n\n4. Classroom Connection–I'd like to recreate that white storekeeper's emotional response in students – spark that realization of how different life truly was and how the white community rationalized or ingored it. The personal stories that make this book so engaging are so valuable for the classroom - making connections and evoking responses that lead to lifelong learning.\n\nAll of you Ida Mae fans out there yesterday would have been her 99th birthday. Wilkerson posted this on Facebook yesterday. I apologize for my lateness but both of my kids were sick yesterday.\n\n\"Happy birthday to Ida Mae Gladney, one of the three protagonists in WARMTH! She would have been 99 years old today. Here's my favorite of picture of her from our trip to Mississippi. There, she met briefly with David McIntosh, who courted her and lost out to George Gladney, with whom she migrated to Chicago in 1937. When this picture was taken, Ida Mae had not seen her former suitor in 60 years.....The T-shirt she wore that day was true to how she lived. It read: \"When God closes a door, He opens a window!\"\n\nShould anyone need proof that the racism Wilkerson so eloquently describes in her depictions of black life in the early 20th century south is not a thing of the past, read Charles Blow's heart wrenching column in tomorrow's New York Times:\n\nI really enjoyed reading about Ida Mae. It was extremely interesting to hear the female perspective on the Great Migration. The fact that she knew that she had to be tough to make it was really inspiring to me. I found this picture of Ida Mae while looking for info. on the author. She took Isabel Wilkerson to see a cotton growing for the first time in Isabel's life.\n\nI think that I most relate to Ida Mae because of my path in life. She knew she had to be tough and couldn't show people her weaknesses. There were times that I knew I had to work harder to be taken seriously-in law school, and playing soccer just to name a few.\n\n\"An invisible hand ruled their lives and the lives all the colored people in Chickasaw County...\" I can't even imagine having to watch my every move, or risk being punished. What it must have been like back then-you couldn't look a white person in the eyes, don't make inappropriate comments, don't drink out of their water fountain, use their bathroom, sit in their restaurants. What a horrible way to live your life!!\n\nI am really curious to see what happens to these 3 people once they migrate. I am waiting to read the WHOLE story.\n\nI really think there needs to be some empathy created here. I would love to create more, \"Put yourselves in their shoes, during this time period\" kind of thought-provoking questions.\n\nWhile all the characters had their own obstacles, George Starling seemed to have the most factors working against him. Pershing Foster had access to education and a supportive, if not strict family. George had the ability for academics but neither the family support nor access. Ida Mae, in theory had the most going against her, as a woman in the South, but she was also part of supportive family and had a husband, who to the best of his ability, sheltered her from segregation. George's contentious relationship with his wife added to his difficulties. His effort to secure higher wages for the orange pickers directly challenged the labor and race systems in the South. It also shows how he tried to make the most of the situation, as when he paid cash for furniture and drove the taxi and went to Detroit, taking him away from his family. His situation seemed the most difficult and dire, and his story was the most engaging to me.\n\nQuote:\n\nPage 168\n\n'Pa, you know Jack don't drink coffee'\n\nThe treatment of Jack Fowler at settling time really brought home the awfulness of the situation. The forced compliance, the constant debt, the lack of options, save leaving – all right there.\n\nClassroom Connections\n\nOn page 131, Wilkerson lists many of the race riots that took place. Lessons on any of those would be fascinating. Beyond the causes and immediate outcomes, focusing on how many black families lost property and jobs connects to the wealth disparity in the country. It was almost impossible for the older generation to leave any wealth for the next generation, causing each generation to start over. I'm not sure other immigrant groups had the same difficulty. The Japanese during internment comes to mind, though I'm having a hard time thinking of another group subjected to the same level of violence and government indifference as African Americans(pp. 165-176)\n\nI really identify with Starling so much more than the other characters! So close to home and a person working hard to overcome station in life. The work that it took to ensure you made a living in a hot orange grove daily gaines my respect.\n\n2. Quote – What is something that sparked your interest, you didn't understand, something that you identified with or one thing that summed up the section for you?\n\nI found it quite interesting about the people who returned after moving to the city and how different they were. Attitudes, clothes and overall outlook seemed so different. They seemed to have more \"hope\".\n\n3. Question – What are you curious about after reading this section?\n\nI think the fact that I had no idea about the individual struggles of these people growing up in a completely \"white\" culture in the Northeast.\n\n4. Classroom Connection–How might you connect something that you have read about to your students in the classroom?\n\nTo teach what many African Americans had to endure to rise above \"expectations\", family separation, and uncertainty was overcome to help these people earn the respect they deserved."

How do those influences shape the woman she becomes?\n\n2. How does Marta's relationship with her father shape her early beliefs about God and His expectations? How is it different from the way Mama sees God? What seems to make the biggest impression on the way Marta views God? Does that change throughout the story? If so, what causes that change?\n\n3. At the end of chapter 4, Marta's mother gave her a blessing when she left home to make her way in the world. In what ways, verbal or otherwise, did your parents give you their blessing? If they didn't, what do you wish they had said to you? In what ways did you—or do you hope to someday—do the same for your own children?\n\n4. It has been said that women often marry a version of their father. How is Niclas like and unlike Marta's father? In what ways is Niclas both passive and aggressive? Marta sometimes seems to harbor resentment toward Niclas. Is that fair?\n\n5. Marta has a hard time trusting Niclas because of the way her father treated her mother. How do you think that makes Niclas feel? In what ways—good or bad—has your family of origin affected your marriage or close friendships?\n\n6. Niclas asks Marta to sell the boardinghouse she bought as the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. Is that an appropriate request? What do you think of the way Niclas makes the decision and communicates it to Marta? If you were Marta, what would you have done in that situation? Have you faced a similar decision in your marriage or family?\n\n7. Marta sometimes makes it difficult for Niclas to be the head of their household. Does Marta view herself as a helpmate to Niclas? Do you think he sees her in that way? How is he able to love Marta despite her sometimes-prickly nature?\n\n8. Why does Marta never tell Niclas—or anyone else in her family—that she loves them? How does Marta best show and receive love?\n\n9. In many ways, Marta is like the woman described in Proverbs 31. Which of the qualities described in that passage do you see in her? Which ones is she missing?\n\n10. After rescuing Elise from the Meyers in chapter 5, Marta tells her friend, \"I swear before God, Rosie, if I'm ever fortunate enough to have a daughter, I'll make sure she's strong enough to stand up for herself!\" How do Marta's family dynamics come into play later in life when she has children of her own?\n\n11. Marta loves Hildemara deeply. Yet of all her children, Hildemara probably feels the least loved. Why is that? Is treating children differently the same as favoring one over another? What challenges make it difficult to raise all the kids in a family exactly the same? How hard should parents strive to do so?\n\n12. Have you ever felt, as Hildemara did, that others in your family have unfairly received a greater share of love, financial provision, or some other valuable resource? How did you respond? What advice would you give someone in this situation?\n\n13. After Hildemara's incident with her teacher Mrs. Ransom, Hildemara tells her father that she prayed and prayed, but her prayers didn't change the situation. Niclas replies, \"Prayers changed you, Hildemara.\" What does he mean by that? Have you ever had a similar experience?\n\n14. Why is Marta so averse to Hildemara's decision to attend nursing school? Does she ever change her mind about Hildemara's chosen profession?\n\n15. For several months, Hildemara keeps Trip at arm's length. Why do you think she does that? What makes her finally admit her love for him?\n\n16. Trip, like many men of his generation, has tragic, life-altering experiences in World War II. Have you heard stories from or about men in your own family who were similarly affected? Have any of your loved ones been involved in more recent wars? How has war affected your family?\n\n17. Tuberculosis is much rarer today than it was in Marta's and Hildemara's lifetimes. Yet life-threatening and chronic illnesses have never been more prevalent. How has your family been impacted by serious illness? Discuss the strain illness can place on family dynamics, regardless of the \"relational health\" a family may have at the outset.\n\n18. If you could change one thing about the way you were parented, what would it be? And if you have children, is there anything you wish you could change about the way you've parented them? What is one step you could take in that direction?\n\n19. At the end of this book Marta is determined, with God's help, to make a fresh start with Hildemara. Do you think she will succeed? Why or why not? How do you think Hildemara will respond? Is there hope for this relationship?\n\n20. If you could sit down with Marta and Hildemara, what would you like to tell each of them? Is there someone in your family you need to talk with about mistakes or misperceptions from the past that are still affecting you today? If you have unresolved issues with a loved one who has passed away, who might you talk with to try to reach some closure for yourself?"

What would maybe not be so good about missing out on going to a regular school?\n\n2.\n\nWhat do you think about the way Ida B talks to and listens to the trees and the brook?\n\n3.\n\nIda B has always been called Ida B, except when she's in trouble and her parents use her full name. Do you have a nickname your family calls you at home that is different than what teachers call you at school?\n\n4.\n\nThe \"B\" in Ida B must stand for a middle name. What do you think would make a good middle name for Ida B?\n\n5.\n\nDid you ever have a teacher like Ms. Myers, Ida B's kindergarten teacher, who would only call people by their first names, even if they preferred a nickname? What do you think about that rule?\n\n6.\n\nWhat did you think about Ida B's invention of The Soap Mask that meant she didn't have to wash her face as often?\n\n7.\n\nIda B's mother's health seems to be much better at the end of the story. Even though her mother's cancer made the story very sad, were you expecting the story to have a happy ending or a sad ending? Why?\n\n8.\n\nIda B thinks that \"if a child waited to speak until all the grown-ups settled down and gave her some room to say her piece, most important things would never get said.\" Do you think kids in general get enough chances to \"say their piece\"? Why or why not?\n\n9.\n\nIda B eats the same food for breakfast and lunch every day because \"she's got too many things to think about.\" Do you like to eat the same foods all the time? Or do you like variety?\n\n10.\n\nHow would you have felt if you were Ida B, when her father told her he'd sold some of the apple orchard and that she'd have to go back to public school?\n\n11.\n\nWhen Ida B has to go back to public school after being homeschooled for four years, it seems much different than it was when she went in kindergarten. Do you think that it was school that had changed? Or do you think Ida B was now different?\n\n12.\n\nWhy do you think Ida B seems more lonely when she goes back to school, where there are lots of other kids, than she had been when she played by herself most of the day?\n\n13.\n\nIda B comes up with a plan to try to scare away the people who are building a house on the land that her father sold to them. Why do you think her plan backfired? And what could she have done differently?\n\n14.\n\nIda B's new teacher, Ms. Washington, seems to know what Ida B needs: time to adjust, space to herself, and important things to do, like helping Ronnie with math and reading aloud to the class. Would you like Ms. Washington for a teacher? Why or why not?\n\n15.\n\nIda B expected Clare, her classmate whose family is building a house on the land her father sold, to get back at Ida B for yelling at her and scaring Clare's little brother. But Clare doesn't do anything mean to Ida B. Were you surprised? Why or why not?\n\n16.\n\nDespite all of Ida B's plans, things get out of her control especially her emotions. Is it possible or even a good idea to make plans for everything? Why or why not?\n\n17.\n\nIf you were to write a different ending to this story, what might it be?\n\n18.\n\nIf you had Ida B for a friend, how would you try to help?\n\n19.\n\nHow can you tell Ida B likes trees? And how can you tell the author does?\n\n20.\n\nGrowing frustrated with her attitude, Ida B's daddy yells at her several times, which is out of character for him. Why do you think he reacts this way?\n\n21.\n\nWho in the book \"outplanned\" Ida B?\n\n22.\n\nDo you have a special tree or outdoor place?\n\n23.\n\nWhat do you think Ida B means when she says \"Apologizing is like spring-cleaning\"?"

Homes that were once happy are threatened by a mysterious illness.\n\nHere, a young boy named Leonard and his friends exist in a state of confusion and despair, as every year or so a boy from their school vanishes after venturing into the poisoned woods. Without conclusive evidence of foul play, the authorities consider the boys to be runaways.\n\nThe town policeman suspects otherwise but, paralyzed with fear, he does nothing. And so it is up to the children who remain to take action. Their plan to stop the forces of evil that are destroying their town is at the shocking and terrifying heart of The Glister .\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. What was your initial reaction to the disappearance of the boys? Were you expecting the story to go in a different direction?\n\n2. The story is set in what as once an area of natural beauty, now defiled by pollution and neglect. Is The Glister an \"environmental\" novel? Who does the author imply is responsible for the environment's decay? Who suffers from its effects?\n\n3. The novel is told from multiple perspectives, but Leonard is the only character whose thoughts are told in the first person. Why do you think this is? From where might he be telling the story?\n\n4. Leonard remarks, \"I can't help thinking that, if you want to stay alive, you have to love something.\" How does Leonard maintain a sense of optimism among his bleak surroundings?

      "text": "The Chocolate War\n\nChapters 37–39\n\nSummary\n\nChapter 37\n\nThe Goober arrives at the stadium just in time to hear the rules: \"...the kid whose written blow is the one that ends the fight, either by knockout or surrender, receives the prize...\" He had been out of school sick for a few days—sick either physically or emotionally, he was not sure. He had heard about the fight between Jerry and Janza and had forced himself from his bed to see it.\n\nThe fight begins. Carter draws a slip of paper from a cardboard box, and it directs Jerry to hit Janza in the jaw. Jerry pauses, the crowd gets impatient and Janza taunts him. Jerry swings, but the blow only glances off Janza's jaw. Janza smiles. Carter grabs the next slip of paper, which directs Janza to hit Jerry on the jaw. Jerry readies himself for the hit, and Janza hits him as hard as possible. Jerry feels pain throughout the length of his body, and although he knows Janza is strong, Jerry is surprised at the intensity of the blow. Before Jerry can recover, Carter picks another slip that directs Janza to hit Jerry in the stomach. The next ticket directs Jerry to hit Janza, and Jerry hits him in the face harder than either of them thought he could. Taking out his frustrations against Janza, Archie, the chocolate sale and the entire school, Jerry throws himself into the punch like he never has before. Then, Janza is directed to give Jerry an uppercut.\n\nStudents are calling for more action, getting into the fight. Carter draws a card that commands Janza to hit Jerry in the groin. Carter and Archie realize that they made a mistake, since they never said that the groin was off limits. Janza moves to strike Jerry and Jerry blocks the punch. The crowd gets angry, as it happened too quickly for most of them to realize, and they just saw Jerry block a punch. Janza, also angry, decides that all bets are off and begins wailing on Jerry. The students urge Janza on as he pours blow after blow upon Jerry, who is curled up trying to defend himself. Janza gets tired, and while he pauses to catch his breath Jerry strikes at him, knocking Janza off his feet. Janza, really angry now, smashes Jerry in the temple. The Goober counts the punches—sixteen in the row. The crowd chants for Janza to kill Jerry. Just as Jerry passes out, Obie sees Brother Leon in the stands and realizes he was there the whole time. Suddenly the lights go out. As Archie goes looking for the electric cable, Brother Jacques stops him.\n\nChapter 38\n\nThe Goober goes to Jerry and tries to wake him up. Goober calls out to him, scared, and finally Jerry comes to. Jerry is in bad shape, and Goober asks Obie to call for a doctor. Jerry tells the Goober what he has realized—that it is best to just do what they ask and not to disturb the universe. Brother Jacques asks Archie why he did it. The ambulance is just leaving the field and Jerry has a broken jaw and possibly internal injuries. Jacques tells Archie that the situation could have gotten even more out of hand. Archie tells him that the chocolates all got sold, and that this was his payoff. Brother Leon joins them, and tells Jacques that \"boys will be boys\" and tells Archie that he knows Archie did it for the school. Archie realizes that he is in the clear, forever—he, Brother Leon and The Vigils.\n\nChapter 39\n\nObie tells Archie that someday, he will get his. Archie reveals that he tipped off Brother Leon, calling him before the assembly because he figured \"he would enjoy himself. And I also figured that if he was here and part of the proceedings, he'd also be protection for us if anything went wrong.\" Archie also tells Obie never to pull anything like what he did with the black box ever again.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe fight is gruesome and it is ever bit as bad as the reader could imagine. Janza has no mercy, nor do the students who at once point even urge Janza to kill Jerry. Jerry is alone out there, at the mercy of the students who recently decided that he was not a revolutionary at all, but rather someone who considered himself better than them. Jerry gets in a couple of good punches, but he simply cannot hold his own against Janza. Brother Leon watches the whole thing—once again, Archie is right in guessing that Leon would have enjoyed himself. The fight now silently sanctioned by Leon, Archie knows he cannot get in trouble.\n\nThe Goober is there for Jerry after it is all over, but this single gesture of friendship is too little and too late. The Goober shows up to the fight because he cannot stay away. He knows what is going to happen, he knows the rules, and he knows Jerry is going to be punished. Why The Goober does not blow the whistle on the fight is unclear—one call to Brother Jacques revealing the true nature of the assembly and Jerry would never have been so brutally beaten. The Goober goes to Jerry's aid at the end, so at least Jerry does not have to lay there bloody, beaten and alone. Jerry believes he has figured out the secret and wants Goober to know: \"They tell you to do your thing but they don't mean it. They don't want you to do your thing, not unless it happens to be their thing, too. It's a laugh, Goober, a fake. Don't disturb the universe, Goober, no matter what the posters say.\" These statements are admissions of a final and deep defeat. Before, even when Jerry had been picked on and beaten up he could say that he was still strong enough to disturb the universe and do his own thing. In Chapter 38 he realizes that it simply is not worth it to oppose people like Archie and Brother Leon. He learned the hard way, and does not want The Goober to have to learn the same lesson.\n\nEven after Jerry's beating, Archie feels no remorse at all. He does not apologize, not even to Brother Jacques. Strangely, Brother Jacques does not require an apology or issue any kind of punishment at all. This is where Brother Leon comes in, shortcutting the conversation and in essence preventing Brother Jacques from coming down on Archie. The union of power between Leon and Archie is sealed.\n\nArchie warns Obie never to pull a stunt like he did with the black box, but he also enjoys the moment for its dramatic effect. Archie prides himself on the psychological punishment and in understanding people well enough to tailor the perfect assignment. Once again, he reveals that he actually does possess an understanding of people, but uses it for a cruel purpose. Cormier does not revisit Jerry in the last chapter, leaving the reading with a dismal feeling about Jerry's future. We do not know the final prognosis of Jerry's injuries, nor do we know how this traumatic series of events will shape Jerry's future. The reader can hope that Jerry will prevail, but the tone at the end is bleak, suggesting that Jerry's recovery will be long coming, if ever."

If you could have a special Grace, what would it be? How would you use it in your current life?\n\nWhich type of Grace do you think is more powerful—one that is an enhancement of physical strengths or one that is an enhancement of mental strengths?\n\nWhat are the things Katsa fears the most? How do these fears affect her thoughts, actions, and behavior?\n\nGracelings are described as \"outsiders\" and \"not normal.\" If the skills of a Graceling are not helpful to the king then they are ostracized from their community. Why do the townspeople treat the Gracelings in this way?\n\nHow does Katsa's understanding of friendship change throughout the story?\n\nThe Council is very important to Katsa. Why? What is the purpose and mission of the Council?\n\nPrince Po's grandfather, Prince Tealiff, tells Katsa that Po \"sees the strength in beautiful things.\" He explains that this is what makes Po different from his six brothers. How does Po's appreciation of beauty influence his connection to people, animals, and nature? Is his perception of beauty changed in any way by the end of the novel?\n\nKatsa is fiercely independent yet she is able to care deeply and love Po. Po is equally self-sufficient yet falls deeply in love with Katsa. How does the tension between being independent and being in love affect their relationship?\n\nKatsa ponders the traditions of marriage and begins to imagine a more unconventional, yet long-lasting, relationship for herself and Po. Do you have any thoughts about the institution of marriage? Do you think alternatives to marriage exist for people in love?\n\nIn what ways do the contours of the landscape both help and hinder Katsa and Po in their attempt to save Bitterblue from King Leck?\n\nKatsa learns that power throughout the Seven Kingdoms can be gained from a variety of sources. What are some of these sources? What opinions does Katsa have about people in positions of authority? Is she interested in having power or authority over others?\n\nKatsa spends much of her daily life involved in combat and fighting. Describe how she feels about combat at the start of the novel. Do her opinions about being a skilled fighter change by the end of the story? How and why?\n\nIn Conversation with Kristin Cashore,\n\nAuthor of GRACELING\n\nHave you always wanted to be a writer?\nI always wanted to be a reader and a daydreamer. Then, in college, I discovered that I also loved to write. I think it would be fair to say that I always suspected I wanted to be a writer, but didn't know it for sure until I was about nineteen or twenty. And then, of course, it took a few more years for me to get serious about actually doing it!\n\nHow did the character of Katsa come to you?\nUnsurprisingly, she came to me fighting—quarreling, to be more specific—inside my head with another character who grew into Po. In other words, Graceling began as conversations in my head between two characters who were furious with each other. My job was to listen to them argue, and figure out what they were so upset about, and what was going on in their world, and what that world was like. Katsa and Po kind of formed them selves for me—at the beginning, I was more of an observer than a creator.\n\nHow did the ideas for the landscapes in your book take shape?\nIn some cases, I had particular landscapes in mind from the beginning. For example, always knew Po came from a place that was somehow \"other\"; therefore, Lienid is an island, separate from the other kingdoms. In other cases, my landscapes developed for kind of silly reasons. For example, \"Uh-oh, I need it to take longer than this for Po and Katsa to get from point A to point B. Better grow an impenetrable forest and throw up a few uncrossable mountains!\"\n\nGraceling taught me to appreciate all the things a writer can do with landscapes, actually. When I was developing the companion book to Graceling, the landscapes were among the first things I felt and saw, and were as important to my writing process as the characters. I expect I learned to think that way from writing Graceling.\n\nHow did the concept of a Grace—and the way it is manifested in different characters—come to you?\nI'm not really sure. It was with me from the beginning—from the very start, Katsa had an unusual power that alienated her terribly from others. As I fine-tuned the concept of Graces, it seemed right to me that every Grace should be an extreme version of skills that people in our world actually do have. So, for example, there are people in our world who can run really, really fast; the corresponding Grace would be the ability to run even faster—inhumanly fast. There are people in our world who rarely get sick, so why not a Graceling who's incapable of getting sick? There are unusually perceptive people in our world; the corresponding Grace might be some form of mind reading. There are people with an unusually deep connection to the earth and nature; the corresponding Grace might be an ability to predict weather. And so on. I tried to avoid Graces that had too much of a sci-fi feel—for example, I don't think teleportation would be a believable Grace in the world of Graceling. Maybe I'm wrong; basically, I try to avoid inconsistencies, and hope for the best!\n\nIf you could have a special Grace, what would it be?\nIf only I hadn't just nixed the idea of a teleporting Grace! Every time I travel, my blog readers get to hear me complain about how I wish I could teleport. But I think I'd like a language Grace; I've never had an easy time learning foreign languages, and I envy people who do. Or maybe a health Grace, something to make me impervious to diseases. I wish I could pass that Grace out to my family and friends, actually!\n\nDid you have teen readers in mind when you wrote Graceling?\nI didn't have any readers in mind when I wrote Graceling. I wrote it for me. However, since I love young adult fantasy madly, I'm not surprised that what I wrote took on that form. And now I am thrilled—beyond thrilled—to be sharing it with teen readers, and adult readers, and all kinds of readers. It's a dream come true.\n\nAnother book is in the works. What can you tell us about it?\nI'm glad you asked this question, because the way the new book relates to Graceling is a little confusing. The new book is sort of a companion book and sort of a prequel to Graceling. It takes place across the mountains east of the seven kingdoms, thirty or forty years before the story of Graceling, in a rocky, war-torn kingdom called the Dells. There are no known Gracelings in the Dells, but there are beautiful creatures called monsters.\n\nMonsters have the shape of normal animals: mountain lions, dragonflies, horses, fish. But the hair or scales or feathers of monsters are gorgeously colored—fuchsia, turquoise, sparkly bronze, iridescent green—and their minds have the power to control the minds of humans. Fire, seventeen years old, is the last remaining human-shaped monster in the Dells. Gorgeously monstrous in body and mind but with a human appreciation of right and wrong, she is hated and mistrusted by just about everyone. The book is her story, and if you're wondering what connects it to Graceling, the answer is that (Graceling spoiler alert!) one of the minor characters in the new book is a creepy little boy with mismatched eyes who seems to have some peculiar verbal abilities. . . . The new book is by no means Leck's story, but it does reveal where he came from (and what happened to his eye!)\n\nI did not write Graceling with the intention of writing a prequel. But while I was writing Graceling, some things Po said about Leck's origins began to rattle in my mind—and Fire's story grew from that. Unfortunately, it makes for slightly confusing marketing, but I hope people will understand how the books work together, and preferably read them in the right order, Graceling first! (According to my readers so far, they don't need to be read that way, but I think it's a good idea.)\n\nWhat do you read? Do you read across genres?\nI love this question. You might want to store up some emergency provisions before I answer. I absolutely read across genres, and in fact, I read very little YA fantasy while writing YA fantasy. It feels too much like work to read stuff in my current genre, and it also freaks me out sometimes. I see similarities and begin to worry that my ideas aren't fresh; I compare myself and feel inadequate; it's a big mess. I can't wait, actually, to finish Bitterblue, because I intend to take a break from fantasy after that, and will finally be able to read the books of Megan Whalen Turner and Alison Croggon and some Robin McKinley books I haven't read yet. I miss YA fantasy. I also feel kind of out of it—there are books I'm supposed to have read, but haven't.\n\nAnyway, so much for the books I'm not reading. As for what I am reading—I'm always looking for reading that differs from my own writing, so that it can be a break from work and refresh my mind. In the past few weeks, here are some things I've read: China Court: The Hours of a Country House by Rumer Godden; TheAstonishing Life of Octavian Nothing, Traitor to the Nation, Volume One: The Pox Party by M. T. Anderson; Murder Must Advertise (a Lord PeterWimsey mystery) by Dorothy L. Sayers; Ramona Quimby, Age 8 by Beverly Cleary; and Moominsummer Madness by Tove Jansson. Here are some things I've bought: KristinLavransdatter by Sigrid Undset, translated by Tiina Nunnally (this happens to be one of my favorite books ever); the play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead by Tom Stoppard (one of my favorite plays); The Frog and Toad Treasury, written and illustrated by Arnold Lobel; The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banks by E. Lockhart; Dubliners by James Joyce; and Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid, illustrated byLisbeth Zwerger, who is a genius. And here are some things I've taken out of the library to read soon: Kabir: Ecstatic Poems, versions by Robert Bly; Little Brother by Cory Doctorow; and two Brother Cadfael mysteries by Ellis Peters. I've also been working my way through the audio versions of James Herriot's All Creatures Great and Small stories, which are fabulous, and fabulously read by Christopher Timothy.\n\nWhat music do you listen to?\nOh boy, oh boy! I hope you still have some emergency provisions left over. I grew up in a household where classical music was always being played, along with some stupendous classic stuff like the Beatles's AbbeyRoadand Simon & Garfunkel's Bookends. I remember being obsessed with Aaron Copland and fighting with my big sister, who always wanted to listen to the \"Appalachian Spring\" side of the record first (whereas I always wanted \"Billy the Kid\" first). I'm surprised my parents can even listen to certain music anymore. They must have gotten awfully sick of hearing it over and over.\n\nIt's hard to say what I listen to now, actually, because I love so many different kinds of music, and mentioning a few, I feel the weight of everything else I'm leaving out. But, since you asked, here are some folks I will always love: Bruce Springsteen, Ani DiFranco, Jane Monheit, Coldplay, Peter Gabriel, Sinéad O'Connor, a line of bagpipers could probably convince me to do anything, and nothing fills me with greater glee than a live performance by a good brass quintet. I love any song sung by a Muppet (especially Kermit). Oh, and Yo-Yo Ma was the speaker at my college graduation, and when he brought his cello up on stage and played Mark O'Connor's \"Appalachia Waltz\" and the first movement of Bach's first cello suite, I nearly swooned."

In your support of this book, please feel free to copy and distribute this guide to best facilitate your reading program. Thank you.\n\nAbout This Book\n\n\"Amy Bloom gets more meaning into individual sentences than most authors manage in whole books.\"\n\n--The New Yorker\n\nA great short story has the emotional depth and intensity of a poem and the wholeness and breadth of a novel. Amy Bloom writes great short stories. Her first collection, Come to Me, was a finalist for the National Book Award, and here she deepens and extends her mastery of the form.\n\nReal people inhabit these pages, the people we know and are, the people we long to be and are afraid to be: a mother and her brave, smart little girl, each coming to terms with the looming knowledge that the little girl will become a man; a wildly unreliable narrator bent on convincing us that her stories are not harmless; a woman with breast cancer, a frightened husband, and a best friend, all discovering that their lifelong triangle is not what they imagined; a man and his stepmother engaged in a complicated dance of memory, anger, and forgiveness. Amy Bloom takes us straight to the center of these lives with rare generosity and sublime wit, in flawless prose that is by turns sensuous, spare, heartbreaking, and laugh-out-loud funny.\n\nThese are transcendent stories: about the uncertain gestures of love, about the betrayals and gifts of the body, about the surprises and bounties of the heart, and about what comes to us unbidden and what we choose.\n\nFor Discussion\n\nIn A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You, there are many different portraits of family. How do think Amy Bloom would define a family? How do her characters act like traditional families, and how do they differ? How do you define a family, and do you think Bloom's families would fall under your definition? Why or why not? In \"Hold Tight\", how is a new family made?\n\nBloom's work has been praised for the way in which it portrays ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. Do you think this is correct, or should it be the other way around, extraordinary people in ordinary circumstances? Do these characters seem to be the people you come across in your life on a day to day basis? Why do you think Bloom would choose to make these people seem so everyday, so ordinary?\n\nMany of the characters in these stories are at critical moments in their lives where their impending actions will have a profound effect on the way in which the world perceives them, how they perceive themselves, and how other characters in the novel will choose to see them. What are some of these moments? What actions in life change our being? What internal moments change us? Which have a more profound effect in Bloom's novel in constructing identity? Which do you think should in life?\n\nHow does Bloom define love in her stories? How does she portray the love between a parent and a child, between friends, between lovers, between spouses? How do these types of love differ, and what do they have in common? Is love always forever? If not, why and when does it end?\n\nIn A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You, who seems to change more, Jane or Jessie? What types of changes occur in the story, both externally and internally. Which sorts of changes have an effect on the identity of the individual? How do you think their relationship will change as Jess begins to lead life as a man? To what extent does sexuality define a person? To what extent do external features make up ones identity, like a name, what one wears? Is identity an external or internal quality, or is it both? What do you think the significance the title\nA Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You is?"

Lee killed him with the knife after seeing what the soliders were doing to Harvey's heroes.\n\nWho did Ellie meet when they made contact with people tidying Kevin's farm?\n\nCorrie's Mum. Corrie's mum let her know that Corrie was still in a coma and that some 'chalkie' was turning people in that were related to the army and other such organisations.\n\nWhere did they stay while staking out Turner Street?\n\nChurch. They took shifts to go into the tower, which provided the best view of the goings-on.\n\nWho did Ellie and Fi see with the soliders?\n\nMajor Harvey.

I guess it comes from teachers using chalk.\n\nHow did they attack the occupied houses on Turner Street?\n\nSwitching on gas and setting timers, causing an explosion. All five chose a house to break into, and with Fi's knowledge knew where to look for the gas outlets.\n\nDid they succeed in killing the traitorous chalkie?\n\nn.

      "text": "A LONG WALK HOME\n\nQuiz\n\nUSING CONTEXT: IN THE SENTENCES BELOW, USE CONTEXT TO GUESS THE MEANING OF THE GIVEN WORDS.\n\nA LONG WALK HOME\n\nI grew up in the south of Spain in a little community called Estepona. I was 16 when one morning my father told me I could drive him into a remote village called Mijas, about 18 miles away, on the condition that I take the car in to be serviced at a nearby garage, Having just learned to drive and hardly ever having the opportunity to use the car, I readily accepted. I drove Dad into Mijas and promised to pick him up at 4 p.m., then drove to a nearby garage and dropped off the car. Because I had a few hours to spare, I decided to catch a couple of movies at a theatre near the garage. However, I became so immersed in the films that I completely lost track of time. When the last movie had finished, I looked down at my watch. It was six o'clock. I was two hours late.\n\nI knew Dad would be angry if he found out I'd been watching movies. He'd never let me drive again. I decided to tell him that the car needed some repairs and that they had taken longer that had been expected. I drove up to the place where we had planned to meet and saw Dad waiting patiently on the corner. I apologized for being late and told him that I'd come as quickly as I could, but the car had needed some major repairs. I'll never forget the look he gave me.\n\n\"I'm disappointed that you feel you have to lie to me, Jackson.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? I'm telling the truth.\"\n\nDad looked at me again. \"When you did not show up, I called the garage to ask if there were any problems, and they told me that you had not yet picked up the car. So you see, I know there were no problems with the car.\" Arush of guilt ran through me as I feebly confessed to my trip to the movie theater and the real reason for my tardiness. Dad listened intenly as a sadness passed through him.\n\n\"I am angry, not with you but with myself. You see, I realize that I have failed as a father if after all these years you feel that you have to lie to me. I have failed because I have brought up a son who cannot even tell the truth to his own father, I'm going to walk home now and contemplate where I have gone wrong all these years\".\n\n\"But Dad, its 18 miles to home. It's dark. You can't walk home.\"\n\nMy protests, my apologies and the rest of my utterances were use less. I had let my father down, and I was about to learn one of the most painful lessons of my life. Dad began walking along the dusty roads. I quickly jumped in the car and followed behind, hoping he would relent. I pleaded all the way, telling him how sorry I was, but he simply ignored me, continuing on silently, thoughtfully and painfully. For 18 miles I drove behind him, averaging about five miles per hour.\n\nSeeing my father in so much physical and emotional pain was the most distressing and painful experience that I have ever faced. However, it was also the most successful lesson. I have never lied to him since.\n\nby Jason Bocarro\n\nfrom Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul.\n\nI was 16 when one morning my father told me I could drive him into a remote village called Mijas, about 18 miles away, on the condition that I take the car in to be serviced at a nearby GARAGE\n\nBuilding\n\nRestaurant\n\nrepair shop\n\nHaving just learned to drive , and hardly ever having the opportunity to use the car, I READILY accepted.\n\nquickly\n\nquietly\n\nsadly\n\nBecause I had a few hours to spare, I decided to CATCH a couple of movies at a theater near the garage.\n\nFind\n\nwatch\n\nIgnore\n\nMy protests, my apologies, and the rest of my UTTERANCES were useless.\n\nFriends\n\nclothes\n\nwords\n\nWhen you did not SHOW UP, I called the garage to ask if there were any problems, ...\n\nappear\n\nput a hand up\n\npark your car\n\nJason didn't PICK UP the car until after six o'clock\n\nregard\n\nremember\n\ntake\n\nAfter Jason DROPPED OFF the car at the garage, he went to the movies.\n\nleft\n\nbought\n\nhide\n\nParents are responsible for BRINGING UP the children\n\npicking up\n\neducating\n\nspoiling\n\nI LET my father DOWN when I lied to him\n\ndisappoint\n\ndisagree\n\ndismiss\n\nMy father told I could drive him into a remote village called Mijas, about 18 miles away, .......... the condition that I take the car in to be serviced.\n\nby\n\non\n\nwith\n\nI drove up to the place where we had plan to meet and saw Dad waiting patiently ...... the corner"

      "text": "Study Guide\n\nAt Meredith we will follow Dr. Maathai's example and plant a green belt of trees on our grounds. The environmental message in the book is strong. As you read, however, you will find that Unbowed is a book about many ideas that apply to our lives and culture. Here are some topics to look for as you read:\n\nChildhood and family\nA sense of place or home\nRole models and core values\nShaping one's education\nThriving in the workplace\nWomen's place in public life\nSocial change\nPolitical activism: risks and rewards\nWomen's rights\nAmbition\nLeadership\n\nThe reading questions below ask you to think about these issues in preparation for small group discussions of the book.\n\nUnbowed Reading and Discussion Questions\n\nYou may have grown up in circumstances very different from those described by Wangari Maathai. In spite of the differences, what similarities do you find between your childhood and hers? You may want to think about relationships with your parents and siblings, the opportunities you enjoyed, and the way your time was spent.\n\nWhat aspects of Maathai's life contrast sharply with your own experience? Which are difficult for you to imagine or understand?\n\nThe early chapters of the book describe missionary work in African from an African's perspective. How does this description contrast with the ideas you have about mission work, particularly the spread of Christianity in third world countries?\n\nMaathai places a high value on the stories she was told and the environment she grew up in. In what ways is your identity connected with the physical place where you grew up (the land, the climate, the culture)? What stories and tales from childhood do you remember vividly? How have they shaped your identity?\n\nThis book is a memoir that draws upon more than fifty years of WM's life, including her youth and college years. If you were to begin a memoir at this point in your life, what incidents and impressions would you include?\n\nIn Chapter 3 Maathai describes the struggles between the British and the Africans, struggles that led to a guerilla war, the use of detention camps, and many deaths. What efforts does she make to narrate these events in an objective manner? What concerns you about the way this struggle was carried out?\n\nMaathai attends college in the United States at the time of the Civil Rights Movement and John F. Kennedy's short presidency. How do her impressions of the United States compare with your understanding of that time in history?\n\nWhat signs do you find throughout the book that Maathai is becoming an independent thinker? What signs do you find that Maathai is becoming aware of the challenges and responsibilities of being a strong and educated woman?\n\nHow did Maathai balance her status as an educated woman with the need to connect with poor, rural women? What strategies did she use involve people in the Green Belt Movement? Do you think these strategies were successful?\n\nThroughout her life, Maathai makes a number of choices that involve risk and controversy. Which of these choices do you find most interesting and/or troubling? Explain your response.\n\nWhat are some of the organizing and leadership strategies that Maathai introduces to her environmental and political activism? Which are especially effective?\n\nMaathai is often very critical of her government. This critique is especially strong when she describes what she believes to be the government's role in ethnic violence in Chapter 11. There is a similar debate in the United States over the value of such criticism, by individuals or by the press. Some say that criticism weakens the government by sharing too much information and showing disloyalty, while others suggest that the freedom to speak out is crucial to a strong democracy. After Reading Maathai's comments about Kenya, where do you stand on the issue of criticizing one's government?\n\nPlease choose a passage from the book that made a strong impression as you read.

If Jodee met Annie before all the things that happened in the gym, what do u think would have happened differently?\n\nIf Jodee met Annie before this gym thing happened would not have happened because she would have known what might have happened.

Why will Jodee not transfers to a different school, and if she did what might happen?\n\nShe will not run away from all this because she feels that she can bet them. If she does it probably follow here to here new school and she will be not able to escape it.\n\nYes I would but not for the help but to learn how to right correctly and to find help. But all thou if I had to go I would go to have help from friends\n\n2-Q. If you where Tim, would you have read the Journal and why?\n\nYes I would have but not to make every one mad at me but to show how or why I have been cool or how I sated cool. If I didn't I would have let the others read it but if I were to read it I would have shut the book and walked away.\n\n·If I were at a party of this nature, I would have made a call but not to my mom. I would have called Dara's mom. If I had called my mom I would have gotten into trouble. Also, if I had called my mom the party would have continued longer and something bad could happen.\n\n·Jodee could have reacted differently by not being upset at the party. That would have changed the outcome since her friends would not hate her.\n\n·No, I don't think Jodee needs to be blamed for this. It was the other kids brought this on themselves. What their parents do to them is not Jodee's fault.\n\n·If I was one of the students at the party and was punished for it I would have been grounded for the rest of the year and never to go outside unless told to. If I was grounded I would only have a bed and a chair in my room and no electronics for a year or unless I can prove that I am good.\n\n·No, this is one of the treatments that is based on a false opinion or lie. So, no I don't think that the treatment that Jodee is getting from the other kids is fair and it is not right.\n\nIn the group i was in we discussed what is hapaning to Jodee and her famaly and frends.The main discusion was that it was horible what the nun said to Jodees' parents and then we discussed why it was rong to do that. But we disagred on the reson why Jodees father didn't come home and that was mainly it.\n\n\"It was either shun or be shunned. The meaner you were to the \"rejects\" the more popular you became with members of your clique.\"\n\nI think the meaning of this quote is that if you don't make fun of the \"reject\" you'll become the \"reject\" but if you are the \"reject\" than what are the bullies? Are they the \"rejects\" not use? Or are they trying to make them self's feel better about them self's.\n\nThis quote is some what true because if you don't make fun of the \"rejects\" then the other will make you one of the \"rejects\" but in my opinion I think that id rather be the \"reject\" that the bully because there are more \"rejects\" that the bullies think there are.\n\nA few years back I was in a group of kids that made fun of about of people and I did make fun of a few people and then I thought is this the person I wanted to be? Or do I want to be some thing more so I left the group and I became one of the \"rejects\" and I noticed that I was better than what I was before."

How do her dorm life and home life contrast? When in your life have you had \"fish out of water\" experiences?\n\n2. Upon moving into the dorms, Norma is immersed in a culture of \"partying.\" Is this a culture that's familiar to you? Are all college dorms essentially similar? Do you see this culture as a \"normal\" coming-of-age experience or as a dangerous problem?\n\n3. Given that Norma realizes Jack is probably seeing other women—and that he doesn't spend a lot of time with her—why is she so attached to him? Why does she become attached to Chuck? In what ways are Jack and Chuck similar and different?\n\n4. This novel, in part, is about the challenges and allure of freedom. What is your definition of freedom? In what ways is Norma free and not free? What are the benefits and drawbacks of freedom?\n\n5. In what ways do Norma and her mother connect? In what ways do they conflict? Does Norma's relationship with her mother seem familiar or unfamiliar to you?\n\n6. Several novels are mentioned in this one, such as Fear of Flying and Go Ask Alice. What role do novels and reading play in this novel?\n\n7. Norma often reflects upon society's portrayal of, judgments about and expectations of women in terms of sex, sexuality, appearance, behavior, and relationships. What are some examples in the novel? What is Norma grappling with in terms of gender roles?\n\n8. There are many distinctive characters in For the May Queen. Who's your favorite character in the novel, and why?\n\n9. At the novel's opening, Norma and Billy sing \"Stairway to Heaven,\" which includes the lyric, \"It's just a spring clean for the May Queen.\" Look up the complete lyrics for this Led Zepplin song. Why do you think the novel is titled For the May Queen?\n\n10. Weddings and marriage are a recurring motif in this novel, such as Suzy's wedding plans, the marriage of Diana to Prince Charles, the soap opera wedding of Luke and Laura, Jack's impending marriage to his pregnant girlfriend. What role does this theme play in the book? What is Norma grappling with when she thinks about marriage?\n\n11. Did you figure out before Norma did the secrets of Stacy and Chuck—or were the revelations a surprise to you? When you look back on the novel, what clues might foreshadow these revelations?\n\nNo comments:\n\nBlurb-o-mania\n\nIn a way not often found in contemporary fiction, Kate Evans' poetic prose richly captures the awakening of a woman to what she truly needs in her life: poetry, art, and the love of another woman. --Susan Gabriel, author of Seeking Sara Summers\n\nAs with her first novel, For the May Queen, Kate Evans explores not so much a coming of age story as a coming to terms story in her new novel Complementary Colors. ... As we follow Gwen's journey for self-awareness, we are not so much rooting for her peace as we are cheering for her to come to terms with and embrace her truest desires. Whether she is imbued with confusion or clarity, we are rallying for Gwen's appreciation of her creative and sexual self as she comes closer to realizing and living her own truth. A deftly crafted exploration of self-identity as only Kate Evans can achieve. Brava! --Cynn Chadwick, author of Cat Rising, Girls with Hammers, Babies, Bikes, and Broads, and Angels and Manners\n\nKate Evans has carefully, firmly, and personally contextualized the ever present dilemma of being a woman poet: millennia of misogynistic assumptions about the worth of a woman's mind and the honoring of a woman's body. Through the pages of this engaging, well-crafted novel, Evans delineates the ways in which the language of men degrades the language of women. The good news is that Evans' protagonist doesn't take it lying down. --Merry Gangemi, Woman-Stirred Radio\n\nKate Evans has struck gold again with her second novel, Complementary Colors. Gwen Sullivan's self-discovery and exploration of her sexuality is one of the most realistic 'coming out' stories that I've ever read. It's organic, it's moving and, since both Evans and her heroine are poets, every line sings. --Collin Kelley, author of Conquering Venus\n\nDue Compliments for Complementary Colors\n\nDue to a glitch, the Acknowledgements won't appear in the electronic versions of Complementary Colors, but they will in the print version. Here they are for those who get e-versions:\n\nThe idea for this novel was sparked in Janelle Melvin's Cambridge home. Together we brainstormed for a few hours. The character sketches and chapter mock-ups I jotted down during that time are the skeleton beneath the flesh of this book. Janelle, you rock.\n\nThanks to Annie Tobin for reading and editing the galley proofs without saying, \"Hey, it didn't happen that way!\" Love to my sisters Crystal and Ann, and to my mom, Arlene, under whose wing I fell in love with books. Dad, I miss you.\n\nCollin Kelley, without your enduring support and American Idol updates, I don't know what I'd do. Blessings to the Woman-Stirred group for your ongoing encouragement: Merry Gangemi, Julie Enszer, Jan Steckel and Nicki Hastie. Kisses to my manuscript group: Martha Engber, Kathryn Madison and Jana McBurney-Lin. Thumbs up to all my real-time and cyber friends who read the first two chapters.\n\nI'm grateful to all my students because you inspire me every day. Ben Malto, Uber-creative guy, I appreciate you heaps. And my colleagues in the English Department at San Jose State University sure know how to throw a great author party that makes a girl feel appreciated.\n\nA penultimate, special shout-out to JP. And last, but certainly not least, kampai and salud to the fabulous Kimberlee and everyone at Vanilla Heart.\n\nOrder now\n\nPraise for FOR THE MAY QUEEN\n\n\"Intimate and engaging as the finest memoir\" --Jayne Pupek, author of Tomato Girl\n\n\"A page turner ... hooks the reader from the first paragraph with this story of love and friendship\"-- Patricia Valdata, author of The Other Sister\n\n\"Clever dialogue, unexpected twists and a meticulous sense of time and place evoke the immediacy of memoir. Funny, poignant and ultimately a testament to lasting friendship...\" --Collin Kelley, author of After the Poison\n\n\"...captures the nightmarish chaos of a young woman's attempt to find her way ... examines the hard choices that can make or break a spirit.\" — Martha Engber author of Growing Great Characters From the Ground Up\n\nAbout Me\n\nIn June 2013, my husband and I are setting out to explore the world. I will be blogging about our adventures. The author of four books, I taught university-level writing for many years, and now I'm a private writing coach."

We hope that this guide will\nprovide you a starting place for discussion, and suggest a variety of\nperspectives from which you might approach Home.\n\nAbout the Book\nA novel that enthralled America and garnered the Pulitzer Prize, Gilead\ntransported readers to a small Iowa town at the cultural crossroads of the\n1950s. Returning once again to that singular time and place, Marilynne Robinson\nhas crafted a wholly independent, deeply affecting novel taking place in the\nhouseholdof the Reverend Robert Boughton, whose closest friend John Ames\nnarrated Gilead in a voice at once tender and luminous.\n\nHome begins as Glory Boughton returns to Gilead at the age of\nthirty-eight to care for her dying father. Soon her brother, Jack, the family's\nprodigal son, joins her after twenty years away. Named for John Ames, his\ngodfather, Jack struggles to make peace with his past, marked by alcoholism and\nfailed attempts at conventional living. Yet he is his father's most beloved\nchild. In what may be their final reunion, Jack and Robert struggle to\nunderstand their difficult relationship, while Glory attempts to come to terms\nwith the lost promises of her youth.\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nWhat does \"home\" mean to Robert Boughton and his children? What does the\nBoughton house signify to his family? With whom do they feel most at home?\n\nHow does Glory's opinion of Jack change throughout the novel? What\nenables them to trust each other? In what ways is that trust strained? How\ndoes their relationship compare to yours with your siblings?\n\nHow is the Boughton household affected by the presence of a television\nset? How does this reflect a shift that took place in many households\nthroughout America in the 1950s? Were you surprised by Robert Boughton's\ncomments about African Americans, and by his reaction to the televised race\nriots?\n\nWhy do you think Robert loves Jack best, despite Jack's shortcomings?\nWhat is your understanding of Jack's wayward behavior? How would you have\nresponded to his theological questions regarding redemption?\n\nDiscuss the friendship between John Ames and Robert Boughton. What has\nsustained it for so many years? How did they nurture each other's\nintellectual lives, approaching life from Congregationalist and Presbyterian\nperspectives?\n\nWhat did Glory's mother teach her about the role of women? How was the\nBoughton family affected by the death of its matriarch?\n\nHow do the Boughtons view prosperity and charity? What is reflected in\nthe way Glory handles the household finances, with leftover money stored in\nthe piano bench? What is the nature of Jack's interest in Marxism? What is\ndemonstrated in the incident of the book on England's working classes (the\nstolen library volume that Robert Boughton considered dull)?\n\nHow do the themes of deception and integrity play out in the novel? Are\nall of the characters honest with themselves? Which secrets, in the novel\nand in life, are justified?\n\nWhat does Jack do with the memory of his out-of-wedlock daughter?

We see Eliza's father, but her stepmother is only mentioned in passing. Mrs. Higgins plays a large role, but her husband is never mentioned. The same goes for the Eynsford Hill family. What's Shaw trying to tell us here?\n\nDoes Alfred Doolittle's theory about the \"undeserving poor\" have any merit? Is he just a good speaker, or is he simply addressing a problem that most people ignore?\n\nCould Pygmalion take place in a different country, a country with a different language? Or is it a play specifically about England and English?\n\nWhy does Shaw end the play when he does? Is there any reason why Higgins and his mother are the only two people left on stage?\n\nMrs. Higgins mentions that her son only falls in love with older women. Henry himself claims that it's just a matter of habit, that he just can't be bothered with young women. Is Higgins simply too involved with himself and his work, or is there some deeper reason for his disinterest?\n\nEarly on in the book, Higgins mentions that English is \"the language of Shakespeare and Milton and The Bible\" (1.125). While he's right with the first two, the Bible definitely wasn't first written in English. What does this say about Higgins?\n\nHiggins never gives us his definition of the \"soul,\" but he sure loves to talk about it. Does he really even know what he's talking about?\n\nHiggins claims that he treats everyone equally, that he does not change his behavior under different circumstances. That said, does Higgins himself change over the course of the play?\n\nShaw originally wanted to include in the play scenes in which Eliza pretends to be a duchess. Instead, we only get to hear Pickering and Higgins discuss them. Does this change the way we think about the \"bet\"? Are we more likely to forget about Eliza's amazing feat, as Higgins and Pickering do as a result?"

      "text": "Synopsis\n\n.\n\nLiz Curtis HiggsDiscussion Questions\n\nDiscussion Guides\n\n1. Rowena McKie appears through only the first seven chapters of the book, but her influence is felt throughout the story. In what ways does she shape Jamie's past, present, and future? What, if anything, makes her a sympathetic character? How is she like her brother, Lachlan, and how is she different?\n\n2. Rowena clearly considers her deceptive plan to be necessary. How does she justify her actions? What does her behavior reveal about her relationship with her husband, Alec? And what of her other son, Evan? How has she convinced herself that he deserves such ill treatment?\n\n3. To what extent is a man like Jamie McKie—heroic one minute, cowardly the next—a believable character? When does Jamie behave heroically, and when do his weaknesses surface? How would you describe his overall character? What changes take place in Jamie's character from the first chapter to the last, and who or what brought about those changes?\n\n4. Rowena favors Jamie; Alec favors Evan. Can you recall specific examples of parental favoritism evident in Lachlan's treatment of Leana and Rose? And how do the sisters respond to their father in distinctive ways?\n\n5. Leana McBride has many positive qualities, but she is by no means perfect. What are her strengths, and what are her weaknesses? To what extent is she a heroine? a victim? a fallen woman? Regarding her relationship with Jamie, is she naive? foolish? obsessed? What outcome were you hoping for in Leana's life?\n\n6. Rose and Leana are vastly different—as opposite as Evan and Jamie—yet the sisters have a much healthier relationship. What words would you use to describe young Rose, and how did you feel about her as you got to know her? Did your opinion of her alter as the story unfolded? Which scene struck you as most true to life for two sisters living under the same roof?\n\n7. Despite Lachlan McBride insisting, \"There are to be no saicrets in this household,\" Auchengray overflows with secrets. What secrets does Leana keep? What are Jamie's secrets? And Rose's? As for Lachlan, secrets, lies, and deception are his currency, used to manipulate and coerce. How might you explain Lachlan's need to control the lives of those around him?\n\n8. The epigraphs that introduce each chapter were carefully chosen. My personal favorite is the Scottish proverb, \"A winter's night, a woman's mind, and a laird's purpose aften change.\" For you, which quote best captures the essence of the novel, and why?\n\n9. On her wedding night, Leana convinces herself she must climb into Jamie's bed. Were you surprised by her decision? appalled? Which, if any, of the reasons she offers in chapter 48 are valid? Did you find yourself scolding her…or rooting for her? What motivation, above all others, sent Leana tiptoeing into Jamie's room to \"seek his blessing\"?\n\n10. When he was a lad of seventeen, Robert Burns wrote: Such was my life's deceitful morning, Such the pleasures I enjoy'd! But lang or noon loud tempests, storming, A' my flowery bliss destroy'd. Jamie McKie might have penned those very sentiments himself on the first day of 1789. Why is Leana the target of his anger? How would you describe Lachlan's conduct toward Jamie that morning? Who is most to blame for this tragic turn of events—Lachlan, Jamie, or Leana? Even though she is not on the scene until later, how might Rose have contributed to this debacle?\n\n11. Neda and Duncan Hastings both serve as a moral compass for the story. Especially in chapters 59 and 67, how do they provide a sense of true north for Leana and Jamie? In what other scenes do Neda's willing ear and Duncan's ready wisdom offer much needed direction and stability?\n\n12. At what point in the story did the significance of the title, Thorn in My Heart, come alive for you? Leana eventually defines that thorn as her love for Jamie—\"the love that would not stop\"—but each character could claim to have a \"thorn\" in his or her heart as well. What might Rose's thorn be? And Jamie's? What thorns press upon Lachlan? Rowena?\n\n13. Three hundred years ago Matthew Henry wrote, \"Whom God loves he never leaves.\" That same truth, inspired by Genesis 28:15, echoes throughout the novel: I will never leave you. Even when Jamie's behavior is less than honorable, those words from his heavenly dream keep coming back to him. How does Jamie react each time he remembers that assurance? How might those words encourage you in your own spiritual journey?\n\n14. Leana came to a point of desperation before she came to a place of peace. What is the \"dark moment,\" the lowest point of Leana's trials? When does she begin to climb out of that darkness and move toward the light of hope? How does Rose aid her sister in that painful process of maturing? And how does Rose hinder Leana's efforts?\n\n15. In desperation, Jamie prays, \"Please, God, help me love her in return.\" What evidence do you see of such love for Leana in the final chapter of the novel? What does he say to her that suggests his heart is changing? What is his relationship with Rose at story's end? Which issues and conflicts are resolved by the last page, and which are merely on hold? What might the future hold for this thorny triangle?\n\n16. The one constant that permeates the story from beginning to end is bonny Scotland itself. Which passage in particular brought the Scottish Lowlands of the eighteenth century to life for you? In what ways are time and place critical to the telling of this story? In what ways does Thorn in My Heart transcend time and place?"

Christopher doesn't even know that \"quid\" is slang for \"pounds,\" (kind of like \"buck\" and \"dollar\").\n\nChristopher leaves the policeman and goes to buy his train ticket. But it turns out that isn't so easy either.\n\nThe man behind the window tells him where to go to catch his train. Christopher is still feeling terribly uneasy, so he imagines a red line along the floor that he can follow to the train, and says \"left, right, left, right\" quietly to himself, to try and calm down (191.104).\n\nA couple of people bump into him on his way to the train and he barks at them like a dog.\n\nFinally, he finds the train, gets on it, and, well, he's on his way to London."

      "text": "Reading Guide Questions\n\nCharlotte Gray begins in 1942. London is blacked out, while France suffers under a much greater darkness with half the country under Nazi occupation and the other half a \"Free\" Zone led by a French puppet government. After a brief but intense love affair with an RAF pilot whose plane disappears over France, Charlotte Gray, a volatile young Scottish woman, contrives to go to France and join the Resistance so that she might search for him. Her Resistance work moves her in ways she had hardly expected, and soon she decides to stay on under her assumed identity, finding that the struggle for the country's fate is intimately linked to her own battle to take control of her life.\n\nFor discussion: Charlotte Gray\n\nWhy does Charlotte so deeply identify with France? What tradition does the Loiseau family represent to her? Where, and in whom, does Charlotte recognize this tradition during her undercover work in France?\n\nWhy does Dr. Burch, the psychiatric examiner, mark Charlotte down as \"T. C. by 1/2\" (too clever by half) [p. 82]? Is this meant as a compliment or a criticism? Would you say it is an accurate description of Charlotte? Does it square with Daisy's view of Charlotte as \"unstable\" and \"vulnerable\" [p. 95]?\n\nCannerley, in England, feels \"frightened\" by the political decisions he is being compelled to put into force. \"Everyone he knew had made an accommodation with the war, with the demands on their lives of a national emergency, and it seemed to him that he had been drawn into the wrong compromise\" [p. 150]. Julien, in France, sees \"a chain of compromise and inertia, at no single point perceptible as choice in moral colors, had had in the end a cumulative effect\" [p. 154]. What accommodations and compromises have the following characters made: Cannerley, Bernard, M. Levade, Sir Oliver, Gerd Lindemann? At what point, and in what characters, can the choices be said to be positively evil?\n\n\"Did these statements [see p. 167], scored in the bold capitals of anonymity, express the true feelings of the French people? Was this what they would really say if they were free to speak? Charlotte chose to think not.\" What does the verb \"chose\" imply? Do you think that the author agrees with Charlotte? Do you think that the virulent French anti-Semitism of the inter-war and war years was a fearful response to the Nazi threat, or an already deeply ingrained part of French culture? What evidence can you provide for either possibility?\n\nWhy did M. Levade convert to Christianity? What do his God and his religion mean to him, and what strengths do they give him? Which aspects of his character are specifically Christlike, and which are more clearly human?\n\nJulien reads in Pascal's Pensées: \"[A] certain sort of evil is as hard to find as what is called good, and this particular evil is often on that account passed off as good. Indeed, it takes as much extraordinary greatness of soul to attain such evil, as to attain good\" [p. 317]. Julien connects this particular \"greatness of soul\" with Petain. What did Petain symbolize for the French people in 1918? What did he symbolize in 1935, and what during the action of the novel as figurehead of Vichy France? Does Julien's application to the Marshal of Pascal's thought strike you as appropriate?\n\nHow does Charlotte's relationship with M. Levade help her to come to terms with her own father?\n\nAfter Charlotte returns to England, Julien writes to her that \"history is already being rewritten\" [p. 396]. In what ways does the wartime France that Faulks describes differ from perceived ideas about the country? Has history indeed been rewritten, and if so, has it been done successfully? Julien goes on to say, \"This is a civil war as well as a national war; it is a fight for influence and for possession of history\" [p. 396]. If that judgment is true, then which forces in French society won the civil war?\n\nQuestions about the novels of Sebastian Faulks\n\nIn Birdsong, Stephen writes: \"I am driven by a greater force than I can resist. I believe the force has its own reason and its own morality even if they may never be clear to me while I am alive\" [p. 49]. How would you compare this force with the emotional and moral imperatives that drive Charlotte Gray? Is Anne Louvet's passion similar, or different?\n\nHow can you trace France, its character and its fate, through the three periods described in Faulks's novels: World War I, the 1930s, and the Occupation? How did the tragedies of each historical phase inevitably follow the one before it?\n\nHow did the feelings--hatred, aggression, sympathy--between the two sides, German and Allied, differ in the First World War from the Second? Specifically, how do Stephen's feelings toward the enemy in Birdsong differ from Charlotte's in Charlotte Gray?\n\nA number of the characters in Faulks's novels are survivors of the First World War whose lives, whether they are aware of it or not, are permanently changed by their wartime experiences. In some of them, like the patron of the Lion d'Or, the change is tragic and permanently crippling. In other characters--Hartmann, William Gray, the elder Levade--the effects are more subtle. What do each of these survivors have in common, and how have their early experiences helped to form the course of their subsequent lives? What about the innocent victims of the war--characters like Anne and Charlotte?\n\nWhy do you think that Stephen displays such a powerful will to survive in spite of the loneliness of his life and the unhappiness he has endured? What elements and events of his life have contributed to his instinct for self-preservation? Which other characters in the novels display this will, and which do not?\n\nAs officers, how do William Gray, Stephen Wraysford, and Anne Louvet's father differ in their approach to their responsibilities toward their men and themselves? Do you blame Gray for allowing his men to shoot the German prisoners? Do you fault Anne's father for his rebellion, or do you think that in fact he did the right thing?\n\nWhy has Faulks set the love stories that are Birdsong and Charlotte Gray against backdrops of war? Explore the various parallels drawn between desire and death, love and war. In what ways are the love scenes similar to scenes of battle and death?\n\nSuggestions for further reading Pat Barker, Another World, The Regeneration Trilogy: The Eye in the Door, Regeneration, The Ghost Road; Philippe Burrin, France Under the Germans; Charles de Gaulle, The Complete War Memories; Ford Madox Ford, Parade's End; Paul Fussell, The Great War and Modern Memory; Robert Graves, Goodbye to All That; Jaroslav Hasek, The Good Soldier Sweik; John Keegan, The Face of Battle, The First World War; Elizabeth McIntosh, Sisterhood of Spies: The Women of the O.S.S.; Eric Newby, Love and War in the Apennines; Michael Ondaatje, The English Patient; Wilfred Owen, Poems; Robert O.

What does the poem have to do with his feelings about life on the new planet?\n\n2.How important is technology to the survival of the group on the new planet? What things can they fall back on if they cannot use the technology that they had on Earth?\n\nComments\n\nIsabella R.\n\nFor your 1st question we talked about that we would rename it \"Memories and Changes\" It fits in with the story because father has old memories of Earth,and his life has changed and he has to start over. Not remembering this poem makes him miserable.On top of that Pattie asks about daffodils and clouds,which only adds to his misery.\n\n1/23/2012 4:09:29 PM\n\nBraden A.\n\nI don't think that technology is really that important. Although the ship might be of use, because father says in the book:But when that\nspace craft runs down,it's only metal junk,useful metal junk.\n\n1/23/2012 4:59:26 PM\n\nKaitlyn T\n\nQuestion No. 2 - The group did not think that technology was important on the new planet because their spaceship broke down and that was their only technology to use on the new planet Shine. The group had to find their own food in order to survive. They found candy trees (example page 47 - they had little crimson droplets oozing here and there from the bark. If you put out a finger to touch the droplet, your finger stuck, and when you pulled it off and licked it, it tasted sweet). The group also used the bark off the trees to build their houses. They planted seeds but that failed and then they finally grew wheat and that ended up being their main food supply.\n\n1/23/2012 5:19:07 PM\n\nGracie C.\n\nI think that technology is important to the survival of the group on the new planet or Shine because if they did not have the seed dropper it would take longer to plant the wheat and vegetables and they might not have grown. The things might that fallen back if they did not have the technology that they had on Earth would be planting the food.\n\n1/23/2012 6:46:50 PM\n\nJulia M.\n\n1.I think Father was saying he was lonely because he misses his wife who died years ago. He was probably remembering the picture on the slide projector of his wife on the beach with a brown sky in the background. 2.Technology is very important because if they had a computer they could find ways to make the wheat grow better. Since they don't have technology,except for the video games, it will be hard for surrvival because they will forget many things on earth. They can still eat a tiny bit of food every day and Sarah can still make the pancakes if they are safe to eat.\n\n1/23/2012 7:18:25 PM\n\nFlere\n\nGreat point Isabella! Why do you think forgetting the poem makes him so miserable?\n\n1/23/2012 8:47:39 PM\n\nFlere\n\nGreat passage to quote Braden!

Do you think they will ever get to a point where technology is as it was on Earth-or is this not needed for survival on Shine?\n\n1/23/2012 8:54:07 PM\n\nFlere\n\nGood idea Gracie! Technology isn't just computers. What definition of technology is being used ?

How do memories influence us?\n\n1/23/2012 8:58:50 PM\n\nKaitlyn T.\n\nTechnology is not needed for survival on Shine because the group has found other ways to survive without technology by using their own resources.\n\n1/24/2012 3:48:54 PM\n\nAdrian\n\nQuestion 2-I think that the technology in father's technology book was very useful because without the seed drill planting the wheat would have taken a lot longer.\n\n1/24/2012 4:05:42 PM\n\nNikhil V.\n\nTo let you know, I am answering question #2. I think they needed Father's technology book because if Father didn't bring the technology book they could not invent new stuff on the planet Shine.\n\n1/24/2012 5:21:50 PM\n\nAbigail D.\n\nI think technology is important is important on Shine becuase without technology the people on Shine would have to do every thing themself instead of machines doing the work.\n\n1/24/2012 5:33:51 PM\n\nKaitlyn T\n\nBraden A. - I agree with your answer to question no. 2 because the people on planet Shine can't use the technology from Earth and their spaceship as it is broke down. Therefore, they need to use find ways to survive (example -planting wheat & using the trees for food).\n\n1/24/2012 7:15:35 PM\n\nAva G.\n\nQuestin #1. Father quoted \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\" because it reminded him of Earth and what he left there.He misses the life he had on Earth and some of his friends and family.On page 32,Pattie did not remember what clouds or daffodils where and this made father have sorrow in his heart.\n\n1/24/2012 8:26:47 PM\n\nFlere\n\nAva-What parts of \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\" have to do with memories?\nAbby & Nikhil-Can you give an example of how this book has already helped them and a prediction about how it could help them?\nGood point Adrian! Can you predict other ways father can use the book to help them with survival?\n\n1/25/2012 7:29:41 AM\n\nDaniel F\n\nQustin 2 I think technology is very inportent on planet shine becaues people will get bored and they will need it to learn more about the planet. Katilyn T: I dont realy agree with Katilyn becaues with out tecnolgy they wouldnt realy be able to learn more about the plant and after the car runs out of gas they will have to have other tecnolgy to learn more about the planet\n\n1/25/2012 7:10:15 PM\n\nIsabel D.\n\nFather quoted I wandered lonely as a cloud because the poem reminded him of Earth and how he missed it. On page four he looked wistfully at the Oxford Complete Shakespeare and had to leave it behind. Father is sad without it because it reminded him of Earth and they don't have clouds on Shine.\n\n1/25/2012 8:19:23 PM\n\nIsabel D.\n\nJulia-I agree with your comment. I also think father misses his wife, but I think he was saying it because he misses all the joyful things on Earth.\n\n1/25/2012 8:32:00 PM\n\nFlere\n\nIsabel- What parts of the poem, besides the clouds, remind Father of Earth?\n\nDaniel-What do you mean by technology?\n\n1/26/2012 8:16:55 AM\n\nWilliam D.\n\nI think technology is important to their lives because on page 16 Malcolm needed to test the water before drinking it. They could have become dehydrated or poisoned without the chemistry kit. Also, on page 36, Father made a seed drill to help plant the wheat. If Father didn't make it they would starve. He used his book of technology for the idea.\n\n1/26/2012 5:58:12 PM\n\nWilliam D.\n\nBraden- I don't exactly agree with your idea of technology not being important. If technology wasn't important then why did Father bring the technology book. Although, I definitely agree with your idea of the spaceship being useful for parts.\n\n1/26/2012 6:15:16 PM\n\nadam were.\n\n1/26/2012 6:26:09 PM\n\nSophie E.\n\nPapa quoted i wondered lonly as a cloud because he misses the things in that poem like clouds and daffodils. He wanted his kids to remember too.It makes him sad to remember he will never see those things again.There will be flowers ,but there will never be daffodils there will be trees ,but there will never be oaks.\n\n1/26/2012 6:43:39 PM\n\nadam\n\nBraden, I think the metal technolgy is pretty important because there isn't any metal on the planet just wood and the tents from Earth. They could use the metal junk to make templates for wooden things in the same shape if they needed it.\n\n1/26/2012 6:55:18 PM\n\nSophie E.\n\nKaitlyn T. i disagree because i think technology can be used on planet Shine like earth like using the oil in the jelly fish to make lamps,and building the huts like they would on earth. There technology is differend ,but just as important.\n\n1/26/2012 6:57:15 PM\n\nColin V.\n\nBy the way, I am answering question 2. I would say that technology is not very important for them when they get to Shine. I think this because once they were there, the technology stopped working so they used things that were handmade. For example of things that they handmade on page 36 where Father made his seed drill. He made it with imagination and so they could plant the seeds more quickly. He used his book to make it. So, they can create new ways to do things by using Father's book.\n\n1/26/2012 7:19:07 PM\n\nColin V.\n\nAva G. I agree that Father is sorrowful about leaving Earth. I think he also misses other things like Shakespeare a lot.\n\n1/26/2012 7:27:24 PM\n\nAva G\n\nIsabella R-I agree with you! I agree with you because at the end of your response you said that Father was miserable because Pattie asked about daffodils and clouds. I think it reminded him of Earth because daffodils and clouds are on Earth.I also think that he went beyond thinking about daffodils and clouds and thought about his wife that died a few years ago. Father also thought of other things on Earth but Earth is long gone now.\n\n1/26/2012 8:17:34 PM\n\nFlere\n\nGreat examples William and Adam! Many people have differing opinions about technology. Let's look up the meaning of this word in the dictionary. You might be surprised by the meaning. Sophie has pointed out that using resources and inventing new, easier ways to do things is technology too, but it seems that Colin feels technology is computers and such. It was mentioned that \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\" could be renamed change and memories. Besides daffodils and clouds, what parts of the poem support this idea?\n\n1/27/2012 8:25:50 AM\n\nIsabella r\n\nI disagree with Braden.Father states that they NEED gadgets on pg.37,not that you answered wrong.He said\"We need not machines exactly,but gadgets,things you can make out of wood and string,things you can mend yourself,like the seed drill.\"In that sentence, he tells us that gadgets are useful, not junk. He even says it's USEFUL junk.\n\n1/29/2012 5:13:24 PM\n\nIsabella r\n\nTo answer your question,Mrs.Flere,(the second one)It made him miserable only to forget more of it , like if it a thought of \"Oh well,just another thing I'll never remember,and there is no hope of history of it written down.\" I don't really have evidence this is true from the book,but if I was there,that would be my thought. Oh, by the way,this is a great way(fun , but still thinking) of assigning homework!\n\n1/29/2012 5:22:25 PM\n\nTrinity R\n\nI think it is very important that Shine has technology because people may not know many things about Shine.They would not be able to use computers and some tools without technology.\n\n1/29/2012 7:34:13 PM\n\nTrinity R\n\nColin v. I disagree because it is still important that they have technology from Earth just to make sure that they will not get into trouble. They may need technology from Earth instead of handmade tools.\n\n1/30/2012 6:46:53 AM\n\nFlere\n\nI am glad you are liking the assignment Isabella! Trinity, what exactly do you think is meant by the term technology?\n\n1/30/2012 9:19:49 AM\n\nDylan A.\n\nFather thinks Shine is lonely and quite. He also misses all the joyful things on earth like clouds.\n\n2/2/2012 4:32:39 PM\n\nDylan A.\n\nI agree Adam that father was lonely because Shine was friendless.\n\n2/2/2012 4:39:21 PM\n\nAyden\n\nI think for the poem i wondered as lonely as a cloud is describing his feelings because he is going to leave earth friends and family\n\n2/2/2012 6:50:51 PM\n\nAdrian\n\nKaitlyn T. I don't agree with you because they will need technology if they fail to plant the wheat to store the candy tree sap.\n\n2/2/2012 7:22:28 PM\n\nLuke D.\n\n2. Mrs. Flere, you should give us computer assignments every two weeks that we are off,this is fun. Technology is very important. Even though the wheat turned to glass, the seed drill was important because Sarah figured out how to make pancakes out of the glass wheat(pg.64&65), and they were a big part in their diet. Father and his family were a great choice to bring to Shine because he made alot of useful things like the clothes loom(pg.68&69) and I think he will make more in the future. I think most of the other kids have good thoughts too. The Green Book is one of my favorite books.\n\n2/5/2012 7:30:17 PM\n\nIan w.\n\nWhat will they do to the rover they have now that its out of fuel?\n\n2/6/2012 7:06:50 AM\n\nTyler.N\n\nThis is for question 1.Father quotes I Wandered lonely as a Cloud because it reminds him of clouds and Earth.The poem has to do with Fathers feelings because Father doesn't understand what clouds mean untilhe gets to Shine,where there are no clouds and just like in the poem the poet doesn't relize the beaty of the daffidils until he is laying on the couch thinking about it.\n\n2/6/2012 4:34:42 PM\n\nCampbell L-M.\n\nI think that technology is important to their survival. If they did not have technology they would run into problems including not being able to do new things. Example father's seed planter was important in order to plant seeds. They could use hand crafted tools they invented from wood and rocks if they did not have Earth's technology.\n\n2/6/2012 6:26:43 PM\n\nWilliam P\n\nThe technology is very important because without the rations they would not of been eating for a long time.They could fall back on the rations because Sarah made the wheat edible.\n\n2/6/2012 7:42:37 PM\n\nWilliam P\n\n(comment on William D) I completely agree with your comment because You could not just drink the water you would need the chemistry kit and it is important technology.With the technology book when father made the seed drill the book was a great use of technology.That is what I think about your comment William D.\n\n2/6/2012 8:14:16 PM\n\nIsabel D.\n\nTechnology is useful on Shine because it builds shelter and light. They can use old techniqes for farming.\n\n2/7/2012 7:05:43 AM\n\nCaitlin F.\n\nQuestion 1: I think father quoted I wandered lonely as a cloud as a Cloud because it was a what he was thinking and he thought of it like an important memory. Father probably said it also to try to make Pattie remember Earth because in the book it said Pattie forgot a lot about Earth and Father could have helped her.\n\n2/7/2012 3:48:41 PM\n\nLucas B\n\nFather quotes \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\" because they are wandering around a new planet by themselves like a cloud.I understand how that feels because I moved from North Carolina to Granville and I didn't know anybody,but I think they will be happy like I am in Granville.\n\n2/7/2012 5:22:32 PM\n\nLucas B\n\nAdam- I agree with what you said except the part when you said father thinks Shine is bare.He thinks it's bare at first but then he changes his mind because moth people and the jellyfish show up.\n\n2/7/2012 6:01:47 PM\n\nAinsley O.\n\nAfter Sarah said \"I'm the king of the castle get down you dirty rascle...\" father said\"Don't you have anything else to say\",and he started saying\"I wandered lonely as a cloud,/That floats on high over vales......\nHe said that because they barely remember clouds and other memories on Earth.The story is all about remembering and working together.\n\n2/7/2012 8:22:15 PM\n\nAinsley O.\n\nI agree with Isabel D!Father did quote the poem\"I wandered lonely as a cloud\"because he missed Earth!\n\n2/7/2012 8:28:29 PM\n\nTyler.N\n\nI disagree with adam because Father probly quoted I Wandered Lonley as a Cloud because it reminded him of clouds and daffidils.Since Shine doesn't have any of those things,it reminded him of Earth.\n\n2/8/2012 7:24:45 PM\n\nSarah L.\n\nQuestion #1 Father quoted \"I wandered lonely as a cloud\" because he thought Sarah wasn't saying something nice. He started to say the poem because he thought it was something better to say. He said \"Can't you think of anything better than that\" at the bottom of page 31. His feelings are sadness because he left the earth behind. Also, he's probably lonely since he had a wife that died on earth many years ago.\n\n2/8/2012 7:42:26 PM\n\nJon Dickerman\n\nIT is important for there to be technology on Shine because if they didn't have technology they wouldn't be able to survive. There wouldn't be a way to plant food, to build houses or to create light. Without these things there would be no life on Shine (I read my book at school and left it there, so I don't know what page this is from).\n\n2/8/2012 7:46:58 PM\n\nSarah L.\n\nI like your opinion Kaitlyn T. but technology can just be simple tools that make our life easier. That's what the dictionary says. Father thought technology was important. He made a seed drill. That was technology. I disagree with the answer you made about technology, but agree with the answer you made about food.\n\n2/8/2012 8:42:47 PM\n\nFlere\n\nSarah, I appreciate your point about technology. It is true that technology is defined as something that makes life easier.\n\n2/9/2012 10:31:55 AM\n\nNicole\n\nFather quoted \"I Wanderd Lonely as a Cloud\" maybe because he missed Earth and he was lonely. He also could be saying that because he wanted to remember the clouds because there are no clouds on planet Shine. The poem probably ment he might have been feeling sad and alone. He was also just floating around not knowing what to do.\n\n2/9/2012 5:21:10 PM\n\nNicole\n\nI like your idea Sarah L, but I thought he was saying the poem to remember Earth and tell how he felt.\n\n2/9/2012 5:34:02 PM\n\nMegan M.\n\nSome technology could actually help the group survive on Shine. For example, they can use fertilizer, seeds, tools, etc. to grow food. They can also use technology to make a fire to keep them warm, cook food, and boil water. Instead of buying tools they could make their own. They could use them to plant food, make a fire, build shelter, etc.\n\n2/9/2012 7:13:39 PM\n\nMegan M.\n\nKaitlyn T- I agree with your response. However, they might need technology to live longer such as medicine and hospitals.\n\n2/9/2012 8:10:02 PM\n\njon.d\n\nDaneil.F I disigre with you because you said that the people would get bored so they would use the Earth computers to find more about Shine ,but rember when they said in the book that all of the Earth technology ran out? Also you said that the people would get bored ,but what I think is that the children play there games and the adults read there books.\n\n2/9/2012 8:18:38 PM\n\nesme\n\nTechnology is important on shine because even the smallest invention will help them live. Also, one of the things that would fall back is growing crops as fast as on Earth.\n\n2/10/2012 3:50:08 PM\n\nEsmé C-P\n\nI agree with Jon. They wouldn't be able to survive without houses or light.\n\n2/10/2012 3:55:06 PM\n\nKathleen S.\n\n#1: Father quoted I wandered as lonely as a cloud because it was about Earth and they would never see Earth again. He may also have quoted the poem because he wanted everybody to try and remember Earth and remember all the beautiful sights there were on Earth. When Father forgot the words to the poem it had a huge impact on people especially Father because it seemed liked he was forgetting Earth.\n\n2/12/2012 5:57:00 PM\n\nMichael Donelan\n\nFather quoted \"I Wander Lonely as a Cloud\" because he was sad they had left Earth and that he was forgetting the planet he had grown up on.\n\n2/12/2012 6:07:42 PM\n\nKathleen S.\n\nSophie E. How do you know there will never be daffodils or oaks? There could be. Daffodils and oaks could start the same ways they started on Earth. Some trees will change a little bit and begin a new kind of tree, then change some more."

Jane Green's novel, Another Piece of My Heart, opens with an anonymous quote: \"Happiness is not having what you want, but wanting what you have.\" What exactly does this mean? How does it apply to Andi? To Emily? To other characters in the book? Would you say the quote applies to your life? How?\n\n2. As the novel so vividly portrays, being part of a blended family can be extremely challenging. What are some of the mistakes Andi and Ethan make? What should they have done differently? What are some of the challenges that you and your own family have faced together?\n\n3. From the beginning, Ethan's younger daughter, Sophia, is very accepting of Andi, while his adolescent daughter, Emily, is resentful and rude. When it comes to dealing with big issues like divorce and second marriages, do you think it's harder for younger children or for teenagers? How is it different, and why?\n\n4. After five years of living together as a family, Andi still feels uncomfortable confronting or disciplining Emily—mostly because Ethan is a defensive dad. Do you think most parents are overprotective and blind to their children's faults? Do you believe \"it takes a village\" to raise a child—or it's none of your business? Have you ever given and/or received child-rearing advice? How did it go?\n\n5. The author describes the relationship between Andi and Emily as \"a pendulum swinging from love to hate.\" Have you experienced anything like that in your own family? Is it normal or acceptable for teenagers to \"hate\" their parents or stepparents? Should you simply wait for the child to \"grow out of it\" or try to actively deal with the problem? How?\n\n6. Andi's neighbors tell her that \"Ethan feels constantly guilty\" about his divorce and its impact on his children—which is why he lets Emily get away with so much bad behavior. Emily, in turn, seems to take advantage of his guilt. Have you ever felt guilty over something that affects your family? Have you ever felt manipulated by a loved one?\n\n7. Andi notices some dramatic differences between the home she grew up in and the family she married into—especially when it comes to setting \"boundaries\" with children. Do you think parenting has changed in recent years? Are parents more lenient today? Are children more spoiled? Would you raise a child the same way you were raised, or would you do it differently?\n\n8. After Ethan tells Andi that he doesn't want to adopt a child, he feels her pull away from him, as if \"a switch has been flicked\" in their relationship. Is he justified in his feelings on the subject of adoption, or is he being selfish? Is Andi justified in her feelings? What sort of things can change the way you feel about a loved one?\n\n9. Nearly halfway through the book, the author begins to write some of the chapters from Emily's first-person point of view. Why? How does each character's point of view play a role in the story? Which character's point of view do you relate to the most? Which character do you relate to the least?\n\n10. Andi, Brooke, and Emily represent three types of mothers. How are they different? How are they alike? Does Emily have the right to call herself Cal's \"mother\" after leaving him with Andi for three years? Do you think Andi has a legal right to have full custody? And, at some point in the future, do you think Emily should be able to get her child back?—children, careers, bills, chores—— ~ Goodreads\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\n1. In the prologue of Home Front, we see Jolene's early life and the incident that leads up to her parents' deaths. How does this scene lay the groundwork for her personality and her choices in the remainder of the book?\n\n2. When Michael says, \"I don't love you anymore,\" he wonders fleetingly if he'd said the words so that Jolene would fall apart or cry or say that she was in love with him. What does this internal question reveal about Michael? About Jolene?\n\n3. When Jolene learns of her deployment, she is conflicted. She thinks that she wants to go (to war), but that she doesn't want to leave (her family). Can you understand the dichotomy she is experiencing? Discuss a mother's deployment and what it means from all angles—honor, love, commitment, abandonment. Can you understand a soldier/mother's duty? Do you think it's harder for a mother to leave than a father? Is there a double standard?\n\n4. Jolene and Michael's twelve-year marriage is on the rocks when the novel begins. Did you blame both of them equally for the problems in their relationship? Did your assignment of blame change over the course of the novel?\n\n5. Jolene worries that Betsy will see her deployment as abandonment. Do you agree with this? Think of yourself at Betsy and Seth's age: how would your twelve-year-old-self have reacted to your mother going off to war?\n\n6. When Michael sees Jolene for the first time in Germany, he is so overwhelmed by the magnitude of her injuries that he can't be strong for her. He reveals both pity and revulsion. Discuss his reaction. How do you think you would handle a similar situation?\n\n7. At home, Jolene can't cope with her new life. She can't reconcile the woman she used to be with the woman she has become. She wonders how it could be harder to return from war than to fight in it. What does she mean by this? A soldier gets a lot of training and preparation before going to war. Should there be more preparation for returning home?\n\n8. Early in Jolene's homecoming, Mila says: \"We all knew how hard it would be to have you gone, but no one told us how hard it would be when you came back.\" What do you think about this comment? Do we romanticize homecomings and thereby somehow set ourselves up for disappointment? What could her family have done to make Jolene's return an easier transition?\n\n9. At the beginning of her physical therapy, Jolene asks Conny how she is supposed to forget about her injury if it keeps hurting. What does this question reveal about Jolene's personality and her attitude toward her injury? How does this attitude hinder her recovery? How does it help her?\n\n10. Dr. Cornflower describes Jolene as a woman who has spent a lifetime in the Army getting what she wants from a system that doesn't want to give it to her. What does he mean by this? Do you agree? How is a woman's career in the military different from any other career? How is it similar?\n\n11. During the Keller trial, Michael turns in the middle of his opening address to look at Jolene. Why did he choose this very public forum as the time to address the Iraq War with his wife?\n\n12. Although the dire effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are as timeless as war itself, the counseling and support services provided to military men and women returning from war are often insufficient, and the public is often ill-informed about the vast consequences of the disorder. What did you already know about the disorder, and what insights did you gain from reading Home Front?\n\n13. Discuss the various relationships formed between parent and child, from Michael's relationship with his daughters and his grief for his father to Jolene's relationship with Mila. Which struck the most resounding chord for you? Why?\n\n14. On page 177, Jolene thinks about the word \"heroes\" and all that it means in the shadow of loss. For her, heroes were her fallen comrades. What is the definition of a hero to you? Who is one of your own heroes? How do our heroes reflect our values?\n\n15. This book explores a lot of dramatic situations and powerful emotions. Has reading it changed you in any way? What was the most important thing you learned in reading this book? Who would you like to recommend the book to and why?\n\nWho's Online\n\nTHE MINDFUL READERS VISITORS\n\nHEY, THAT'S US!\n\nBut, oh, the blessing it is to have a friend to whom one can speak fearlessly on any subject; with whom one's deepest as well as one's most foolish thoughts come out simply and safely. Oh Dinah Craik, A Life for a Life, 1859"

      "text": "The questions, discussion topics, and suggested reading\nlist that follow are intended to enhance your group's reading of Kent\nHaruf's Plainsong. We hope they will provide you with new angles from\nwhich to approach and discuss this powerful tale of seven lonely lives\nset on the stark but beautiful High Plains of Colorado.\n\nIn the small town of Holt, Tom Guthrie, a high school teacher, fights to keep his life together\nand to raise his two boys after their depressed mother first retreats\ninto her bedroom, and then moves away to her sister's house. The boys,\nnot yet adolescents, struggle to make sense of adult behavior and their\nmother's apparent abandonment. A pregnant teenage girl, kicked out by\nher mother and rejected by the father of her child, searches for a secure\nplace in the world. And far out in the country, two elderly bachelor brothers\nwork the family farm as they have their entire lives, all but isolated\nfrom life beyond their own community.\n\nFrom these separate strands emerges a vision of life--and of the community and landscape that\nbind them together--that is both luminous and enduring. Plainsong is a\nstory of the abandonment, grief, and stoicism that bring these people\ntogether, and it is a story of the kindness, hope, and dignity that redeem\ntheir lives. Utterly true to the rhythms and patterns of life, Plainsong\nis an American classic: a novel to care about, believe in, and learn from.\n\n1. Why might Kent Haruf have chosen Plainsong as the title for this novel? What\nmeaning, or meanings, does the title have in relation to Haruf's story\nand characters?\n\n2. How does Haruf characterize the landscape of Holt and its surroundings, and how does\nhe use landscape to set the emotional scene? In what ways are his characters\nshaped and formed by the land around them?\n\n3. Few hints are given in the novel about what life might have been like for the Guthrie family\nbefore Ella left. What do you imagine that life to have been like? What\nsort of a marriage did Tom and Ella have, and what made it go wrong?\nWhat might account for Ella's nearly total withdrawal even from the\nchildren she seems to love?\n\n4. How do the three teenagers having sex in the abandoned house inform and affect Ike and\nBobby? What does this sight tell them about sex? About love? About the\nrelationships and power struggle between men and women?\n\n5. Do you believe there are marked differences between Raymond and Harold McPheron? If\nso, what are they?\n\n6. Why do you think the McPheron brothers have chosen to spend their lives together rather\nthan start families of their own? Are they lonely or unhappy before\nVictoria's arrival, or do they feel sufficient in themselves? What does\nMaggie mean when she tells them, \"This is your chance\" [p. 110]?\n\n7. What parallels can you draw between the McPheron brothers and the young Guthrie boys?\nWhy is the relationship so close in each case? What sort of a future\ndo you see for the Guthrie boys? Do you think they will marry and have\nfamilies?\n\n8. The McPheron brothers think they know nothing about young girls. Is that the case? Has their\nsolitary life close to the earth handicapped them so far as human relations\ngo, or has it, in fact, provided them with hidden advantages?\n\n9. What examples of parents abandoning children--either by desertion, emotional withdrawal,\nor death--can be found in this novel? What do these incidents have in\ncommon? How does abandonment affect children, and how does it shape\ntheir lives and relationships?\n\n10. It is usually women who are portrayed as nurturers, but in this novel, men--Tom Guthrie\nand the McPheron brothers--provide shelter and comfort. How do men differ\nfrom women in this respect? What do these men offer that a woman might\nnot be able to?\n\n11. \"These are crazy times,\" Maggie Jones says. \"I sometimes believe these must be the craziest\ntimes ever\" [p. 124]. What does she mean by this? In what way are our\ntimes \"crazier\" than earlier eras? How does such \"craziness\" affect\nthe lives of young people such as Victoria, Ike, and Bobby?\n\n12. What motives and feelings might have driven Tom to sleep with Judy when it was really\nMaggie he was interested in? Why might Maggie have seemed momentarily\nfrightening or intimidating to him?\n\n13. Why do the Guthrie boys befriend Iva Stearns? What are they looking for in this tentative\nfriendship? Do they find what they are seeking?\n\n14. Why do the Guthrie boys go to the McPheron brothers after Iva's death rather than to someone\ncloser to home, like their father or Maggie? Is there any indication\nthat they connect Iva's death with their mother's abandonment? Why do\nthey place their mother's bracelet on the train tracks, then bury it?\n\n15. The inhabitants of Holt and its surroundings are extremely laconic: they speak only\nsparingly, as though they mistrust words. What might cause this? In\nwhat way does it affect the characters' relationships with one another?\n\n16. How would you describe Holt, Colorado? What are its limitations, its disadvantages, and what\nare its strengths? In what ways is it typical of any American small\ntown, and in what ways is it different? What help does it provide for\npeople who need healing, like the characters in this book?\n\n\"A novel so foursquare, so delicate and lovely . . . it has the power to exalt the reader.\"\n\n—The New York Times Book Review\n\n\"Resonant and meaningful\n. . . . A song of praise in honor of the lives it chronicles [and] a story about people's ability to adapt and redeem themselves, to heal the wounds of isolation by moving, gropingly and imperfectly, toward community.\""

      "text": "Reading Guide Questions\n\n\"Alice Munro has a strong claim to being the best fiction writer now working in North America. Runaway is a\nmarvel.\" –The New York Times Book Review\n\nThe\nintroduction, discussion questions, suggestions for further reading,\nand author biography that follow are intended to enhance your group's\nconversation about Alice Munro's superb new collection, Runaway. In\nthese eight tales, we find women of all ages and circumstances, their\nlives made palpable by the subtlety and empathy of this incomparable\nwriter.\n\nReading Guide\n\n\"Runaway\"\n\nWhy\nis Sylvia so fond of Carla? Is Sylvia right, given the circumstances,\nto suggest that Carla leave her husband and give her the means to do so?\n\nWhen Carla tells her parents she wants a \"more authentic\" life, what\ndoes she mean by this [p. 33]? How much does Carla know about\nauthenticity or about life?\n\nWhat is Clark's appeal for Carla? What darker suggestions does the\nstory make about Clark's character? It seems that Clark has wanted to\nget rid of Carla's beloved pet goat: why? What resonance does Carla's\nvision of the goat's bones lying in a nearby field have for the\nreader's understanding of her future?\n\n\"Chance\"\n\nWhy\ndoes Juliet decide to pursue Eric, a man she has met briefly only once?\nIs this a haphazard adventure, or does she go to Whale Bay with a\ndetermination about what she wants? She has told Eric about her studies\nin Greek and Latin, \"I love all that stuff. I really do\" [p. 71].\nLater, she thinks of her love of the classical languages as her \"treasure\" [p. 83]. Why does she choose a man whose reading includes\nonly National Geographic and Popular Mechanics [p. 82]?\n\nConsider the end of the story: \"She can tell by his voice that he is\nclaiming her. She stands up, quite numb, and sees that he is older,\nheavier, more impetuous than she has remembered. He advances on her and\nshe feels herself ransacked from top to bottom, flooded with relief,\nassaulted by happiness. How astonishing this is. How close to dismay\"\n[p. 85]. What does this passage express about Juliet's situation and\nher feelings?\n\n\"Soon\"\n\nWhen Juliet finds the print of Chagall's I and the Village\nand\nbuys it for her parents, she tells Christa, \"It makes me think of their\nlife. . . . I don't know why, but it does\" [p. 88]. What is the\nsignificance of this painting as a gift and that Juliet later finds it\nhidden away in their attic? What does Juliet come to understand about\nher parents' marriage?\n\nSara tells Juliet, \"When it gets really bad for me–when it gets so bad\nI–you know what I think then? I think, all right, I think–Soon. Soon I'll see\nJuliet\"\n[p. 124]. Why does Juliet refuse to acknowledge this statement from her\ndying mother? What makes the final paragraph of the story so effective\nin conveying the moment's cold emotion?\n\n\"Silence\"\n\nLike\nCarla in \"Runaway,\" Juliet seems to take pride in her choice of an\nunconventional life. Does Penelope punish her mother for denying her\nthe comfortable, conventional life she experiences with her friend\nHeather's family [p. 144]? Is Juliet right or wrong to share with\nPenelope, just after Eric's death, tales of their arguments and his\ninfidelity and to describe the burning of his body on the beach [p.\n149]? Is it possible that Juliet says something during this time that\nis, for Penelope, unforgivable? To what extent does the story repeat\nthe pattern of \"Soon\" and Juliet's rejection of her own mother?\n\nWhat does Juliet not see about herself that is clear to the reader?\nWhat aspects of her character are problematic? Is she admirable? Is she\na narcissist? Is she \"lacking in motherly inhibitions and propriety and\nself-control\" [p. 156]? How does she handle the suffering inflicted\nupon her by Penelope and the diminishment of her life as she ages?\n\n\"Passion\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Travers is talking about Tolstoy's\nAnna Karenina\nwith Grace, she says her sympathies shifted from Kitty, to Anna, to\nDolly, \"I suppose that's just how your sympathies change as you get\nolder. Passion gets pushed behind the washtubs\" [p. 172]. Does passion\nhave several meanings in this story? What does passion mean for each\ncharacter?\n\n\"The ease with which [Grace] offered herself\" to Maury is \"a deliberate\noffering which he could not understand and which did not fit in at all\nwith his notions of her\" [p. 173]. Later, Grace realizes it would have\nbeen \"a treachery to herself\" to think of marrying Maury [p. 190]. What\nchanges for Grace when she spends time with Neil? What causes this\nprofound shift in perspective? What do she and Neil have in common?\n\nThe story opens with Grace's return forty years later to find the\nTraverses' house on the lake, which is the site of \"old confusions or\nobligations\" [p. 161]. Why does Munro choose not to tell us what\nGrace's life is like now and how the choices she made that day have\naffected her?\n\n\"Trespasses\"\n\nHarry\ntells Lauren about Eileen's first child and the circumstances of that\nchild's death when she unknowingly picks up the box containing the\nfirst child's ashes [pp. 203—04]. What do we learn about his character\nfrom the way he narrates the story and his attitude toward Lauren as he\ntells her? What does he imply about Eileen? How does Lauren's response\nreflect her feelings toward her parents and to the life they've chosen?\n\nLauren, as Delphine points out, is \"a kid that is not short of information\" [p. 220]. We don't learn until page 226, however, that\nLauren is only ten. Why does Munro withhold this information until\nfairly late in the story?\n\nWhy do Harry and Eileen decide to make a ceremony of scattering the\nfirst child's ashes? What is the impact of Harry's words, \"This is\nLauren . . . and we say good-bye to her and commit her to the snow\"\n[pp. 233—34]? What is the effect of the story's final paragraph about\nLauren's reaction to the burrs clinging to her pajamas?\n\n\"Tricks\"\n\nThis\nstory is based on the Shakespearean plots that involve twins, mistaken\nidentities, and precise symmetry. Such tricks of plot, Robin thinks,\nare supposed to be a means to an end, \"The pranks are forgiven, true\nlove or something like it is rekindled, and those who were fooled have\nthe good grace not to complain\" [p. 268]. Why is the key to the mystery\nrevealed to Robin so late in the game? Why did the lovers base their\nhappiness on such a risky proposal? After finding out what had come\nbetween herself and Danilo, Robin reflects, \"That was another world\nthey had been in, surely\" [p. 269]. What was this other world?\n\nThe title of this story might also be \"Chance.\" What does Munro suggest about the power of chance in shaping a life?\n\n\"Powers\"\n\nThe\nstory opens with Nancy's diary and her first person voice. What do we\nlearn about Nancy's character in this intimate narrative form?\nAccording to Ollie, Nancy is \"not outstanding in any way, except\nperhaps in being spoiled, saucy, and egotistical\"; as a girl she was \"truly, naturally reckless and full of some pure conviction that she\nled a charmed life\" [pp. 285, 287]. Is this an accurate description of\nNancy?\n\nLike several other stories in this collection, \"Powers\" takes place in\nat least two time periods. It begins in 1927 and ends some time in the\nearly seventies. What is the effect of this dual immersion in the early\nand late stages of the characters' lives? How accurately does this\nstory project the sense of reality in its main character's voice and\nher immersion in a particular time and place?\n\nWhat does Nancy want or expect from marriage? Why does she marry Wilf?\nDoes it seem that she would prefer to marry Ollie? Why or why not? Does\nNancy warn Tessa against Ollie out of jealousy, or out of a realistic\nconcern that he is not to be trusted?\n\nDoes the story's ending describe a dream [pp. 330—35]? A vision? Why\ndoes it provide Nancy with a \"sense of being reprieved\" [p. 335]? What\ndoes it tell us about Nancy's conscience and about her lifelong\ninvolvement with Tessa and Ollie?\n\nFor discussion of Runaway\n\nMost\nof these stories involve young women who act upon a strong desire for\nsexual or romantic fulfillment or for escape from a stifling life. Is\ndesire liberating or confining? Do these characters really know what\nthey want or need? Does Munro suggest that desire is provisional and\nsubject to change? Do the stories imply that life is inherently\nunstable and unknowable?\n\nWriter Alan Hollinghurst has observed, \"Munro's stories have always\nfelt exceptionally capacious; they have the scope of novels, though\nwithout any awkward sense of speeding up or boiling down. . . . It's\nalmost impossible to describe their unforced exactness, their unrushed economy\" [The Guardian, February 5, 2005]. Which techniques does\nMunro employ to accomplish this illusion of space and time in only\nforty or fifty pages?\n\nIn \"Soon,\" Juliet comes across a chatty letter she had written to Eric\nthe summer she visited her parents [p. 124]. In it she finds \"the\npreserved and disconcerting voice of some past fabricated self\" [p.\n125]. How does this idea of false self-representation work in various\nstories? Do characters tend to misrepresent themselves mainly in\nletters, or in person as well? Do they believe in these \"fabricated selves\" that they create for themselves and others?\n\nMost of the stories in Runaway\ninvolve an older woman who is looking back at a determining moment in\nher youth. How do these characters view their younger selves? What are\nthe qualities that accompany their reminiscences about the\npast–sentimentality, irony, bitterness, regret, a desire to change the\nstory?\n\nSuggested Reading\n\nCharles Baxter, Harmony of the World\nRichard Ford, A Multitude of Sins\nBrian Friel,\nThe Faith Healer\nHenry James, What Maisie Knew\nWilliam Maxwell,\nAll the Days and Nights\nJohn McGahern, Amongst Women\nLorrie Moore,\nLike Life Flannery O'Connor, A Good Man Is Hard to Find\nCarol Shields,\nUnless; William Trevor, The Collected Stories\nEdith Wharton,\nEthan Frome"

      "text": "Reading Guide\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhen Nora wakes up in the middle of a graveyard, she doesn't know how much her life is about to change. As a matter of fact . . . she doesn't know much of anything. She doesn't remember a single thing about the past five months, including the fact that she's been missing—kidnapped—for eleven weeks. Her mom and Vee are happy to have Nora home, but they also seem to be hiding something from her. How much do they know? How much will Nora eventually remember? And why does that brooding dark-haired boy with mysterious skills seem so familiar?\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\n· How does being kidnapped change the way that Nora is treated by her family and friends? In what ways does her kidnapping change how Nora feels? Are there any similarities between her postkidnapping frame of mind and how she felt in the previous books when she was firmly entrenched in the Nephilim struggles?\n\n· In Chapter 10, Nora says of her amnesia that \"ignorance was the lowest form of humiliation and suffering.\" Do you agree with this assessment? Are there any benefits to her amnesia? Does the fact that she eventually learns what has happened to her put Nora in a better position?\n\n· Why do most of the people who know about Nora's past not tell her about it? Are their reasons valid, particularly in light of everything that Hank Millar is doing? Who does talk to Nora about her past, and why?\n\n· How is Nora's relationship with Scott different now than it was before she was kidnapped? Why is she so quick to believe his tales of Nephilim and fallen angels? Do you think she would have been more skeptical of him if someone else had helped her fill in the gaps in her memory?\n\n· The vagabond at the cemetery wants to collect a reward for finding Nora. Is he the only one who hopes to gain something from his association with her? Have there been other occasions in her life where Nora was considered a \"reward\" by someone? Are there times where she uses other people, instead of always being used by them?\n\n· Hank Millar believes that he is fighting for justice—hence his creed, \"Justice before mercy,\" and the variations on his \"Black Hand\" nickname. Do you think there is any justice involved in what he's doing? Do his ends ever justify his means? Can you think of other ways that he might have gone about getting justice for the Nephilim?\n\n· Why doesn't Scott want to wear the Black Hand's ring? What makes him decide to put it on and not take it off? Does Nora's opinion of the ring change over the course of the book?\n\n· Nora decides to tell her mom and Vee all about the Nephilim and what has happened to her over the past months. Do you think this will help her situation? Will they be more or less safe once they know everything? Would they have believed her if she'd told them earlier?\n\n· Does Nora have any choice but to swear the oath that turns her into a Nephilim? What reasons does she have for not swearing the oath? Are there any benefits to her becoming a Nephilim?\n\n· Why does Patch agree to let Nora take the lead in the final confrontation with Hank? Which of them was more wronged by Hank? Does anyone else have a reason to want to see Hank brought to justice?\n\n· If Hank hadn't had Patch's wing feather, Nora would have let him live. Why didn't she want to kill him? Do you think Hank would rather live or die?\n\nActivities\n\n· Nora's amnesia leaves her with no memory of key events in her life, and she must rely on others to fill in the gaps. Ask a family member or one of your friends to describe an event in your life that you shared with them. Did you learn anything new or get a different perspective from hearing their version?\n\n· Everyone thinks that Nora was abducted by a stranger. What can you do to help keep yourself or the children in your community safe? Find a self-defense class in your town that will teach you how to protect yourself. Is there any sort of \"stranger danger\" training in the elementary schools in your area where you can volunteer?\n\n· The Nephilim and the fallen angels swear a lot of oaths.

So she\nlet her be, and fell back on her own wits.\n\nFirst she thought of escape, only to abandon the idea,\nfor her mistress was in no state to face its perils.\nMoreover, whither should they go? Then rescue\ncame into her mind, but, alas! who would rescue them?\nThe great men in London, perhaps, as a matter of policy,\nbut great men are hard to come at, even for the free.\nIf she were free she might find means to make them\nlisten, but she was not, nor could she leave her lady\nat such a time. What remained, then? So to\ncontrive that they should be set free.\n\nPerhaps it might be done at a price—­that\nof Cicely's jewels, of which she alone knew\nthe hiding-place, and with them a deed of indemnity\nagainst her persecutors. Emlyn was not minded\nto give either. Moreover, she guessed that it\nmight be in vain. Once outside those walls, they\nknew too much to be allowed to live. And yet within\nthose walls Cicely's child would not be allowed\nto live—­the child that was heir to all.\nWhat, then, could loose them and make them safe?\n\nTerror, perhaps—­such terror as that through\nwhich the Israelites escaped from bondage. Oh!\nif she could but find a Moses to call down the plagues\nof Egypt upon this Pharaoh of an Abbot—­those\nplagues with which she had threatened him—­but\nalthough she believed that they would fall (why did\nshe believe it? she wondered), she was as yet impotent\nto fulfil.\n\nNow Thomas Bolle! If only she could have words\nwith that faithful Thomas Bolle, the fierce and cunning\nman whom they thought foolish!\n\nThis idea of Thomas Bolle took possession of Emlyn's\nmind—­Thomas Bolle, who had loved her all\nhis life, who would die to serve her. She strove\nin vain to get in touch with him. The old gardener\nwas so deaf that he could not, or would not, understand.\nThe silly Bridget gave the letter that she wrote to\nhim to the Prioress by mistake, who burnt it before\nher eyes and said nothing. The monks who brought\nprovisions to the Nunnery were always received by\nthree of the sisters, set to spy on each other and\non them, so that she could not come near to them alone.\nThe priest who celebrated Mass was an old enemy of\nhers; with him she could do nothing, and no one else\nwas allowed to approach the place except once or twice\nthe Abbot, who was closeted for hours with the Prioress,\nbut spoke to her no more.\n\nWhy, wondered Emlyn, should less than half-a-mile\nof space be such a barrier between her and Thomas\nBolle? If he stood within twenty yards of her\nshe could make him understand; why not, then, when\nhe stood within five hundred? This idea possessed\nher; these limitations of nature made her mad.\nShe refused to accept them. Night by night, lying\nbrooding in her bed, while Cicely slept in peace at\nher side, she threw out her strong soul towards the\nsoul of her old lover, Thomas Bolle, commanding him\nto listen, to obey, to come."

He put a toad in Marilla's bed but fortunately for Marilla, confessed this to Anne.

Anthony Pye, in the tradition of the Pyes, gave Anne much grief for some time. One day, Anne came to school with a toothache and she whipped Anthony Pye with her pointer, something she swore would never happen.\n\nWhy does Anne decide to celebrate her birthday in the spring?\n\nShe liked the idea of having a birthday in the spring. Anne decides to unofficially celebrate her birthday in the spring because she liked the season so much better, what with all of the new flowers coming up and the puddles and such.\n\nWhile out with her friends celebrating her birthday, Anne and her friends discover an abandoned house and a lovely garden. Who owned the house and garden previously?\n\nJordan & Hester Gray. Jordan built the garden for his wife Hester who was dying of the consumption.

Then I had a vision of Jamie in his get-up and Casey as the priest pulling off some scheme together and laughed out loud. Now, on to the questions. -- Carla, 08:39:50 09/24/07 Mon[14]\n1. Both Casey and Jamie seem to enjoy \"becoming\" someone else, and both are very good at it. They're also both very good, and more than willing, at using \"whatever means necessary\" to get the information they need. Are there are any other similarities between the two men?\n\n2. Who do you think wanted Casey dead? And why torture him like that, why not just shoot him and through his body in the Lough or leave it in Dun Siog?\n\n3. What did you think when Jamie told Pamela what he'd done with Casey?\n\nChapter 38: The Maidstone\n\n1. If you were Pamela, would you want to know what it was really like in the prison, or would you prefer to remain in ignorance?\n\n2.Why did Casey stand up so boldly to the Sergeant, knowing what it would mean for him personally?\n\nI have a busy day tomorrow, so I'm posting questions for three chapters to day. New questions will come either late tomorrow evening or on Monday morning. Enjoy the rest of your weekend! I will to admit to finding this section of the book difficult to read, I can only imagine living through the writing of it, never mind actually LIVING through it. The sick feeling I get in my stomach, and my agony on Pamela's behalf are testament to Cindy's incredible skill as a writer. -- Carla, 11:05:43 09/22/07 Sat[19] Chapter 34: And Justice for None\n\n1. What struck you when reading this chapter? I'll put my thoughts down once a few of you have answered.\n\n2. Why do you think Casey trusts Jamie?\n\n3. What was it that Pamela inadvertently revealed to Jamie about the state of her marriage?\n\nChapter 35: Pat\n\n1. Why do you think the young soldier would react with such cruelty and brutality to the old man seated next to Pat in the Barracks gym? Why do you think some people react to the loss of normal social constraints in such ways and others maintain their humanity?\n\n2. The second half of this chapter simply left me sick to my stomach with fear and hate. Feeling so strongly on behalf of a character in a book (although he's real, of course), made me think how much worse it must be in real life. Just an observation, please feel free to weigh in with any thoughts, questions or observations of your own.\n\nChapter 36:The Devil and Mrs. Jones\n\n1. Who do you think Joan is? And why would Colleen, a nun, visit a Protestant house?\n\n2. Joan is yet another of the wonderful secondary characters Cindy has breathed to life and who helps us see yet another facet of Jamie. What did you make of their interaction?\n\n3. Why is Jamie willing to go so far and risk so much to find Casey? Is it out of love for Pamela? A sense of responsibility for her? So he can live with himself should the worst happen? All or none or some other reason altogether?\n\nThe title of Part Three, Nothing Sacred made me think about what I hold sacred in my life. So, without further ado, here's my first question:\n\n1. What's sacred to you? Not in the sense of religious items or beliefs or practices, but what are the things that you need in your life in order to feel whole? What ideas, principles or things (in the broadest sense of the word, not necessarily meaning items) are sacred to you?\n\n2. Does our society have too many, or too few, sacred things?\n\nChapter 33: With Extreme Prejudice\n\n1. If Liam was known to be part of the IRA, why would Casey think his house was safe? Why not flee farther afield? And why take Pamela and Lawrence with him? Why not send them to Jamie's house where even the British Army would fear to tread? Why not ask Jamie to help hide them?\n\n2. Could you separate yourself out as Pamela did and take pictures of your husband being hauled off half-naked by soldiers to any number of horrible fates?\n\nChapter 31 - ... And Everywhere that Mary Went -- Elaine (), 19:13:42 09/19/07 Wed[13]\n1) This chapter exudes a wonderful sense of pastoral contentedness. What aspect of Pamela's past might have contributed to the ease with which she settles into country life here in Coomnablath? (Remember, this was the same exotic young woman who performed a sensual dance in the firelight for Jamie, and the same sophisticated lady who played hostess to a Boston political powerhouse.)\n\nChapter 32 - The Tears of Saint Lawrence\n\n1) After reading this chapter, do you feel that Pamela has now been fully cleansed of Love Haggerty? Is your response based on a feeling, or is there evidence to support it?\n\n2) It didn't seem like Casey to be quite so abrupt with Lawrence after receiving the pocketwatch. How did you feel about Casey's reaction?\n\n3) \"I guess I always thought people could tell just by lookin' at me, what I was, what I'd done.\" It seemed as though Lawrence's words could just as easily have come from Pamela - not regarding the rape on the train but rather what happened while in Boston. Why did Lawrence open up so candidly with Pamela at this time? Why did it not happen sooner, or not happen at all?\n\n4) Not a question, but a couple of comments here. Feel free to respond to them if you wish.\n\n(a) Casey tells Pamela, \"Now I've got a handful of orphans ...\" To me, it seems as if every living creature residing in that little cottage is an orphan in one way or another, not just Lawrence and the various animals, but Casey and Pamela as well. It's kind of nice that they've all found each other.\n\n(b) I readily accept that Pamela is gorgeous, smart, talented and selfless to the degree that she risks her life with some regularity. In fact, I love Pamela and have said more than once that I feel a need to protect her. But I must admit that, even if you think it shallow of me, I am truly gratified to know this perfect woman cannot cook worth a damn.\n\nChapter 28 - Lucky You, Lucky Me -- Elaine, 19:25:34 09/18/07 Tue[23]\n1) Was it wise, do you think, for Pamela and Casey to invite Lawrence into their home? How would you feel if this opportunity presented itself to you - what would you do?\n\n2) \"... the right thing is rarely the easy thing ...\" Casey tells Robin. What was the hardest decision you've ever had to make? Were you glad you made that decision, would you do it again if you had to?\n\nChapter 29 - Paddy's Lament\n\n1) Was Casey avoiding his destiny as Robin suggested? Where was he most needed, outside or inside the organization?\n\n2) Based on the dialogue between the two men, do you think Robin has given up on his need for revenge? Why or why not?\n\n3) Speculate with me, please. Do you think there will ever be a time when Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will be unified? Why do you feel the way you do?\n\nChapter 30 - A Little Irish Homestead\n\n1) I loved the little ritual Pamela observed at the lighting of the cottage's first fire in the hearth. Have you any ritual(s) that your family has observed over the years? Tell us about it/them.\n\n2) How does Victor's story reflect the story of the nation in which he lives? Why was it necessary that Pamela be witness to this tragic event?\n\n3) This chapter shows us the tightrope that Pat seems to be walking. Friend and foe are keeping a close eye on him from either side of the tightrope, each thinking he's too closely involved with the other. Has there ever been a time in your life when you were the outsider, the one who was regarded with trepidation? Or have you ever felt that someone, perhaps your boss or colleague, secretly wanted you to fail? Tell us about that time.\n\nChapter 24 - Nine Tenths of the Law\n\n1) Cindy tells us why the work of Jan Vermeer reflected the essence of Jamie. She used words like 'personal darkness,' and 'light-ridden brush.' After studying the paintings of one or more of the following artists whose works appear in Kirkpatrick's Folly, tell us why they would appeal to Jamie:\n\n2) A proverbial pissing match. A new tattoo. \"Mine,\" he had called her as he made love to her that night. Just a man reconnecting with old mates over a few pints? Or was Casey responding to some subliminal message telling him to assert himself, to establish some level of ascendancy over Pamela? If he warned Pamela against Joe Doherty, why was he not heeding his own advice? What is Pamela thinking as she hears the story of this evening's hijinx? (Key sentence, p. 222: \"...but when is a man wise when his pride's at stake?\")\n\nChapter 21 - Deuces Wild -- Elaine (), 21:07:37 09/14/07 Fri[24]\n1) Based on your first impression of Robin, what are your thoughts now that you know he and Casey were old friends? Did you have any sense of relief after reading their chummy conversation?\n\n2) What went through your mind as you read the last line of this chapter?\n\nChapter 22 - The Boys of Summer\nAfter some rather heavy chapters, we enjoy some light-heartedness and laughter in the form of adolescent exploits, burned biscuits, even knitting. The very picture of tranquility. I don't know about you, but I think this chapter allowed me to breathe again.\n\n1) \"I think a man or woman sees themselves as beautiful through their parent's eyes first ...\" Share with us your thoughts on this statement by Casey.\n\n2) I'll bet you can name a long list of women who have fallen for musicians. We all know beautiful actresses who have married raunchy-looking, albeit gifted, rock stars with bad reputations. Exactly what is this attraction for musicians all about, why does it happen?\n\n3) Who is really at the heart of the Melissa story?\n\n4) Was there a clue in this chapter as to the still unpaid debt that Robin mentioned at the end of Chapter 21?\n\nChapters 23 & 24 will be covered on Monday. Have a great weekend, everyshammie!\n\nPART TWO - A Little Irish Homestead -- Elaine (), 06:36:03 09/14/07 Fri[66] Chapter 18, Scotsman's Lament\nI love this title because it has a direct link to music which plays a significant role in the chapter. In music, a Lament is a mournful tune, a very old form of music in fact. If we had actual tunes to go along with David's psalms in the Bible, I personally believe many of them would be considered Laments. The Lament has a special relationship to Scottish traditional music as it is often played by bagpipes.\n\n1) Did you think the melee in The Cracked Pot was just a random occurrence, or did you guess that it was all planned in advance?\n\n2) Is there any significance to the fact that this pub was owned by a Protestant?\n\n3) So ... based on this chapter, what's your impression of Robin?\n\n4) Cindy introduces us to characters in this chapter that we will never see again. As is her style, we come to know these people immediately, and care about them. Why are they only present for one chapter? Why would she give us reason to like them, especially since they're on 'the other side' of The Troubles?\n\nChapter 19 - Home Again, Home Again\n\n1) What might Pamela have been thinking as she glanced at Kirkpatrick's Folly from her kitchen window \"several times a day?\"\n\n2) Given all that happened in Boston and how she practically sold her soul to save Casey, and then her debate with Fr. Kevin in Chapter 17, we see Pamela in devout prayer at the end of this chapter. Where do you think Pamela is in terms of her spirituality?\n\nChapter 20 - Kirkpatrick's Folly\n\n1) Why does Pamela fall suddenly into ease when Maggie opens the front door - and her arms - to Pamela? Her mood changes later when Maggie asks if she was 'just visiting.' What was it about Maggie's question that caused Pamela unease?\n\n2) Jamie is with Pamela for what seems to be less than 10 minutes yet he clearly sees that she is not herself. \"Despair, disillusion, loss?\" What is Jamie attuned to in Pamela that Casey seems to have missed?\n\n3) Kirkpatrick's Folly is composed of a variety of architectural styles, yet somehow it seems made to order for Jamie. How is he both 'Georgian' and 'Victorian' in his personal style?\n\n** I'm adopting Maggie's line about Casey as my own: \"I'd likely be more than even that laddie was willin' to take on.\" ;-)\n\n1) Love thinks it's time to become respectable? Is that sarcasm on Agent Gus' part?\n\n2) Why would Casey's name be in the file the Feds are putting together with Love's help? Surely his personal vendetta against Casey has nothing to do with taking down the Bassarelli Family.\n\n3) Evidently Pamela's relationship with Love came with conditions….Casey remaining alive and well. Wouldn't this have put some doubt in Love's mind about Pamela's motive for being with him?\n\nChapter 16: 'All the Way Home'\n\nI really didn't come up with many questions here.\n\nThank God Casey is back and not just physically! I could've spit when that wee shite Love was taunting him through the window.\n\n1) Casey is alarmed by the smug expression on Love's face when they are talking about men or women being for sale. We know what's probably going through Love's mind. What do you think Casey is thinking at this moment?\n\nChapter 17: 'Into the Mystic'\n\nI really only have one question here.\n\nAre you as shocked, disappointed or sick to your stomach over what Pamela is choosing to do here as you were about her decision to sleep with Love? Why or why not?\n\nThank You so Much Shammies for a great start to this discussion. I am a 'back of the class' sorta gal – going first is not something that comes easy to me. I just hope I did justice to the story so far and gave y'all enough to keep you talking\n\nMermaid Discussion Day 5 -- Marilyn, 15:30:10 09/11/07 Tue[36]\nI'm a little 'off' today Shammies. I did a quick spell check - my grammar is a lost cause ;-) I have unexpected company popping in here so I apologize for any errors but I wanted to go ahead and get these posted..seems to be a good time of day for discussion *g* I'll fix any booboo's later!\n\nChapter 12: 'Emma'\n\n1) Knowing what she does about Emma's involvement in trying to frame Casey, why does Pamela take the chance with her? What makes her think Emma might cooperate?\n\n2) In the same vein, why does Emma cooperate now..after all these years? How would she know so much about the drug trafficking?\n\n3) Do you think Emma's son is Loves? If so, and the story about the other boy is true, does Love know? What are the reasons for getting rid of one illegitimate son and not the other?\n\nChapter 13: 'After Camelot'\n\n1) So, Jamie recommends Pamela to Lucas North. Does that man know everyone?? I'm thinking Jamie must not know the trouble Pamela & Casey have got themselves into – especially Pamela, or wouldn't he try to help her? Would he not have kept tabs on her one way or another, just to make sure she's alright?\n\n2) I really didn't realize just how sharp the edge was Pamela was playing on here until Mark Ryan. What does Mark gain, or what was the purpose for his veiled threat on Casey's life?\n\nChapter 14: 'In the Blink of an Eye'\n\n1) Is the dream significant to what's about to happen?\n\n2) Ok, Olie surprised me! As Elaine said earlier, I should've known. Then Paul Bunyon (Hallbjorn) standing out there on the free floating ice..well that surprised me too. How about y'all, did you see this coming?\n\n3) Olie admits he'd tried several times to kill Casey. When? How would Casey not have known this?\n\n4) Have you seen the Northern Lights? I have not, but imagine if I ever get the chance, it will be one of those moments of grace for me."

      "text": "October Sky\n\nReading Group Guide\n\n1. As you read this memoir, did you begin to feel as if you knew the people involved? Did you like them? Do you think youd have been happy to live in Coalwood in the late 1950s? If you had, what position in it would you have wanted? Coal miner? Foreman? Teacher? Housewife? Preacher? Doctor? Rocket Boy or Girl? Football Star?\n\n2. Was this memoir similar in its construction with others that youve read? What do you think of the memoir genre? Do you think it might be difficult to write a memoir that is interesting to readers?\n\n3. How would you describe this book? Would you call is a mans book or a womans book? Were you fearful it might be too technical? Is it just a story of a boy with a dream or the story of a small mining town? Or is it something grander and deeper?\n\n4. Do you think Homer Senior and Elsie love each other? What is the principle cause of their conflicts? What is the importance of the mural Elsie is painting in the kitchen? Why is Homer Junior called \"Sonny\" in the book? Why did his teachers insist on calling him by that nickname rather than the one his mother wanted?\n\n5. How would you describe Sonnys father? Why does Homer Senior take Sonny into the mine, risking Elsies wrath? Why does he arrange for rocket materials when he seems so antagonistic to the rocket building? How does the conflict between his mom and dad motivate Sonny? Why was Geneva Eggers so important in Sonnys understanding of his father?\n\n6. In the first paragraph of the book, Homer writes that his hometown was \"at war with itself over its children.\" What does this mean?\n\n7. Nearly all the women in Coalwood are shown to be strong women, a trait they must have to say goodbye daily to their husbands and sons who work in the dangerous mine and may not return that night. Although most of the women of Coalwood make the best of their lot, they want a better life for their children. How can they help this to happen? Are they feminists before the term existed? How about the teachers called \"The Great Six?\" Whats their role in Coalwood? What is your opinion of Elsie, Sonnys mother? Is she too harsh with her husband in her attempt to better her life and that of her sons? And Miss Riley? What did it say about her when she stood up for the Rocket Boys against the feared principal, Mr. Turner?\n\n8. Does the book tell a universal story? Could it be set in other times or is it specific to Coalwood and West Virginia in the late '50s? The book has been translated into eight languages and people from all over the world say Homer \"told their story,\" yet they have never held a rocket or even seen a coal mine! The book is dedicated \"To Mom and Dad and the people of Coalwood.\" Why do you think Homer made that dedication?\n\n9. Many schools from fifth grade to college are studying Rocket Boys/October Sky in their classrooms, including English, math, and science classes. That makes it a pretty unique book! This is an adult book, but it is told from a young mans point of view. Why do you think teachers are picking this book to study and why are they writing Homer that they think it was their most popular class read ever, sparking the most thoughtful discussion? (See the Web sites Teachers button and the letters from them for many examples.)\n\n10. This story is also about the rewards and costs of nonconformity. Who conforms, who doesnt and what are the consequences of their actions? Is that a problem today and can this story help those who tend to go against the expected norms? How was Quentin a nonconformist? How about the other boys?\n\n11. In Chapter 22, Mr. Turner, the Big Creek High School principal, wryly tells Sonny, \"In the queer mass of human destiny, the determining factor has always been luck.\" But in Chapter 26, Homer writes, \"Theres a plan. If you are willing to fight hard enough, you can make it detour for a while, but youre still going to end up where God wants you to be.\" Are these quotations about human fate really in conflict with each other? How do they apply to the story?\n\n12. Rocket Boys/October Sky is an excellent way to think about and discuss the many steps it takes to achieve a goal. Sonnys idea of building rockets starts as simply a dream, but then he brings in the other boys and even approaches Quentin, the school outcast. The Rocket Boys first look upon their rocket-building as interesting and fun but then it becomes a challenge to defy expectations. Only much later does the idea of entering the science fairs occur to them. Discuss the importance of incremental steps in your life. Do you believe an incremental approach has validity in all walks of life, academic and otherwise? Why does Quentin believe in the necessity of obtaining what he calls a \"body of knowledge?\"\n\n13. Miss Riley, the physics teacher, seems to regard education as a challenge and adventure. Sonny rises to meet the formidable task she sets before him. He writes, \"I had discovered that learning something, no matter how complex, wasnt hard when I had a reason to want to know it\"(p. 168). That challenge is taken to the next level by Miss Riley when she gives him the book Principles of Guided Missile Design, saying, \"All Ive done is give you a book. You have to have the courage to learn whats inside it\"(p. 232). Discuss Miss Rileys motivational techniques.\n\n14. When Sonny thinks of giving up rocketry altogether, Miss Riley tells him: \"Youve got to put all your hurt and anger aside so that you can do your job ... Your job, Sonny, is to build your rockets.\" When Sonny asks why thats so important, she answers, \"If for no other reason, because it honors you and this school\"(p. 296). Its clear that she means it also honors Coalwood. Discuss the concept of civic pride. How do the Rocket Boys help the town? Why are they celebrated in the newspapers? In church? In the Big Store? By both sides of the unionization conflict? Why do so many attend their rocket launches? Is it just because the football team is on year-long suspension?\n\n15. Discuss the motivational aspects contained within this story. How did Sputnik motivate Sonny? Is his mother trying to be motivational after he blows up her rose garden fence with his first rocket? (\"I believe you can build a rocket. [Your father] doesnt. I want you to show him Im right\"(p. 52).) Early in his career as a rocket builder, Rocket Boy ODell says, \"A rocket wont fly unless someone lights the fuse\"(p. 105). How important is it to find motivation in all our endeavors? Would the boys have gotten to the science fair without being motivated by something larger than themselves?\n\n16. The final chapter in the book (before the epilogue) finishes with the launch of the last rocket of the Big Creek Missile Agency. Homer Senior is invited to launch this rocket. Why do you think this invitation was made? Why do you think he accepted?\n\nWhat Our Readers Are Saying\n\nAverage customer rating based on 1 comment:\n\nitpdx, May 26, 2009 (view all comments by itpdx)\nThis is a gem. After the Soviet launch of Sputnik, Hickam and his buddies decide to build their own rockets. With Mark Twain-like humor, he writes about the troubles they get into and the subtle and the overt community support as these local kids reach for space. He also describes adolescent experiences with love, sex, booze, trying to make sense of the world and figuring out their places. Hickam's mother is pushing for a way for him to escape the dying town and the dangers of the mine while admonishing him not to blow himself up. His father is the manager of the mine and his response is much more complicated and undecipherable to Hickam. He describes the small town ambiance perfectly--how, if a kid does something wrong, his parents know all about it before he gets home. There are so many wonderful people in this story. The doctor who stitches them up and dispenses advice. The black and white ministers who try to respond to Hickam's revelation that God is plane geometry. The young high school science teacher who inspires, pushes and supports the boys. The union shop steward who tries to balance his responsibilities to the workers and the community as a whole. The head of mine security (essentially the local cop) who knows when to protect, when to punish and when to leave the kids to their parents.\nHighly recommended.\n\nWas this comment helpful? | Yes | No (1 of 6 readers found this comment helpful)\n\n\"Synopsis\"\nby Libri,\nOriginally published as \"Rocket Boys\", this bestseller--based on a true story--follows a group of boys in a small West Virginia town in 1957 as they light up the skies with their flaming rockets and dreams of glory.

      "text": "God, survival, and tiger behavior. It's hard to imagine a more invigorating combination of discussion topics. We hope that the following questions will enrich your reading of Pi's fantastic journey. After all, Pi didn't have to make his voyage alone; neither should you. May this guide serve as a pleasant companion..\n\n1. In his introductory note Yann Martel says, \"This book was born as I was hungry.\" What sort of emotional nourishment might Life of Pi have fed to its author?\n\n2. Pondicherry is described as an anomaly, the former capital of what was once French India. In terms of storytelling, what makes this town a appropriate choice for Pi's upbringing?\n\n3. Yann Martel recalls that many Pondicherry residents provided him with stories, but he was most intrigued by this tale because Mr. Adirubasamy said it would make him believe in God. Did Pi's tale alter your beliefs about God?\n\n4. Early in the novel, we discover that the narrator majored in religious studies and zoology, with particular interests in a sixteenth-century Kabbalist and the admirable three-toed sloth. In subsequent chapters, he explains the ways in which religions and zoos are both steeped in illusion. Discuss some of the other ways in which these two fields find unlikely compatibility.\n\n5. Yann Martel sprinkles the novel with italicized memories of the \"real\" Pi Patel and wonders in his author's note whether fiction is \"the selective transforming of reality, the twisting of it to bring out its essence.\" If this is so, what is the essence of Pi?\n\n6. Pi's full name, Piscine Molitor Patel, was inspired by a Parisian swimming pool that \"the gods would have delighted to swim in.\" The shortened form refers to the ratio of a circle's circumference divided by its diameter. Explore the significance of Pi's unusual name.\n\n7. One reviewer said the novel contains hints of The Old Man and the Sea, and Pi himself measures his experience in relation to history's most famous castaways. Considering that Pi's shipwreck is the first to focus on a boy and his tiger, how does Life of Pi compares to other maritime novels and films?\n\n8. How might the novel's flavor have been changed if Pi's sole surviving animal were the zebra or Orange Juice? (We assume that if the hyena had been the only surviving animal, Pi would not have lived to tell us his story.)\n\n9. In chapter 23, Pi sparks a lively debate when all three of his spiritual advisors try to claim him. At the heart of this confrontation is Pi's insistence that he cannot accept an exclusively Hindu, Christian, or Muslim faith; he can only be content with all three. What is Pi seeking that can solely be attained by this apparent contradiction?\n\n10. What do you make of Pi's assertion at the beginning of chapter 16 that we are all \"in limbo, without religion, until some figure introduces us to God\"? Do you believe that Pi's piousness was a response to his father's atheism?\n\n11. Among Yann Martel's gifts is a rich descriptive palette. Regarding religion, he observes the green elements that represent Islam and the orange tones of Hinduism. What color would Christianity be, according to Pi's perspective?\n\n12. How do the human beings in your world reflect the animal behavior observed by Pi? What do Pi's strategies for dealing with Richard Parker teach us about confronting the fearsome creatures in our lives?\n\n13. Besides the loss of his family and possessions, what else did Pi lose when the Tsimtsum sank? What did he gain?\n\n14. Nearly everyone experiences a turning point that represents the transition from youth to adulthood, albeit seldom as traumatic as Pi's. What event marks your coming of age?\n\n15. How do Mr. Patel's zookeeping abilities compare to his parenting skills? Discuss the scene in which his tries to teach his children a lesson in survival by arranging for them to watch a tiger devour a goat. Did this in any way prepare Pi for the most dangerous experience of his life?\n\n16. Why did Pi at first try so hard to save Richard Parker?\n\n17. Pi imagines that his brother would have teasingly called him Noah. How does Pi's voyage compare to the biblical story of Noah, who was spared from the flood while God washed away the sinners?\n\n18. Is Life of Pi a tragedy, romance, or comedy?\n\n19. Do you agree with Pi's opinion that a zoo is more like a suburb than a jail?\n\n20. How did you react to Pi's interview by the Japanese transport ministers? Did you ever believe that Pi's mother, along with a sailor and a cannibalistic cook, had perhaps been in the lifeboat with him instead of the animals? How does Yann Martel achieve such believability in his surprising plots?\n\n21. The opening scene occurs after Pi's ordeal has ended. Discussing his work in the first chapter, Pi says that a necktie is a noose, and he mentions some of the things that he misses about India (in spite of his love for Canada). Would you say that this novel has a happy ending? How does the grown-up version of Pi contrast with his little-boy scenes?\n\n\"Let me tell you a secret: the name of the greatest living writer of the generation born in the sixties is Yann Martel.\"\n\n—L'Humanité\n\n\"A story to make you believe in the soul-sustaining power of fiction and its human creators, and in the original power of storytellers like Martel.\"\n\n—Los Angeles Times Book Review\n\n\"If this century produces a classic work of survival literature, Martel is surely a contender.\"\n\n—The Nation\n\n\"Beautifully fantastical and spirited.\"\n\n—Salon\n\n\"Martel displays the clever voice and tremendous storytelling skills of an emerging master.\"\n\n—Publishers Weekly\n\n\"[Life of Pi] could renew your faith in the ability of novelists to invest even the most outrageous scenario with plausible life.\"\n\n—The"

Alex is Victoria's son.\n\n2. The three boys are all in the same class at school. Rufus and Alex are old friends and Connor is new at the school.\n\n3. The scene takes place in London, in a \"good\" neighbourhood. The women are having coffee at Nancy's house, in her \"drawing room\".\n\n4. Nancy has been living there for six months and has moved to England from Dallas, Texas, in the USA.\n\n5. She has very expensive furniture (\"acres of mahogany\") and lots of expensive \"state-of-the-art\" technological gadgets, such as a huge TV set and a sound system.\n\n6. a) Hayden works long hours in the City : a taxi collects him at 6.00 AM and he gets home around eight in the evening.\nb) There was a misunderstanding between Nancy and Philly: she thought he returned from work at 6.00 PM.\n\n7. Nancy controls her husband's diet, and doesn't allow him to drink alcohol during the week. She makes him exercise at the week-end: they go jogging.\n\n8. Victoria is being sarcastic. She doesn't think Hayden's life is fun at all: he works very long hours and when he gets home, he isn't allowed to indulge or relax. Nancy makes sure he eats healthy food, she stops him from drinking and she makes him do sport at the week-end. In the reader's opinion, Victoria disapproves of their American lifestyle: they are too health-conscious and hardworking.\n\n9. Nancy has done everything to avoid embracing the British culture: she has enrolled at the American Library, found an American GP. Her son is only at the local school because the American school was full. And she is looking for an American hairdresser because London \"salons are a little… dull\".\n\n10. a) Ute is an au-pair who works for Nancy; Consuela is Victoria's cleaning-lady.\nb) Victoria is respectful of her paid help: she enquires about Ute, because she is interested in her welfare. Nancy doesn't have the same point of view. She expects too much of Ute: she must do the shopping, the cleaning, the ironing, as well as help Connor with his homework. She is critical of Ute, and doesn't take her feelings or abilities into consideration. She pays for a service, and expects perfection.\n\n11. Philly is more likely to feel closer to Victoria: \"Philly choked on her biscuit. Victoria translated\" (l.54-55)\"Philly and Victoria exchanged a glance\" (l.58).\n\n12. \"An attempt at conversation\" : the three women have little in common, apart from their sons being in the same class; Nancy is very American and doesn't understand the values of the other two women. Quote: \"There followed a stilted (=difficult, uneasy) attempt at conversation\" (l.18)\n\nSubject 1 (a+b)\na) Suggestion: Popularity shouldn't depend on what you have. Material possessions or how rich your parents are do not make you more or less interesting. Only shallow people will be interested in you for your clothes, your video-games. Real friends will look deeper at your human qualities : if you are a good friend, if you are generous and caring, if you are a good listener, or if you are funny and jolly and make your friends laugh.\nb) A prestigious job is not necessarily a well-paid job. It could be a job which gives you public recognition, or a job that is useful to your community. Examples : people who work for NGOs or scientist who look for cures for diseases. You needed to describe the job and give the reasons why you think it is prestigious.\n\nSubject 2\nSuggestion: An individual is responsible for his or her own learning because no one else can learn for them. If you are growing up in a wealthy western society, then you have lots of opportunities to learn and succeed. However, not everyone has the same opportunities in life, or the same abilities. For some people it can be more difficult to remember lessons or understand coursework. For others, their social environment or family background make it less easy for them to succeed. In the text, Ute is an au-pair in England: it is suggested she hasn't learned the language yet (that is why au-pairs travel to a foreign country). Learning takes time. You have to make allowances for that."

      "text": "The Glass Castle\n\n1. Discuss the metaphor of a glass castle and what it signifies to Jeannette and her father. Why is it so important that, just before moving to New York, Jeannette tells her father that she doesn't believe he'll ever build it?\n● I can't be sure about what the glass castle means exactly to Jeannette, but a few ideas come to mind. The glass castle can symbolize a lot of things about their family. One thing it can show is that they aren't afraid to hide their life, and what goes on in it. Everybody can see the good and the bad, that's how life is; it has good and bad. Something else is that in order to build a house out of something as fragile as glass; they need to start with a really good foundation, the same way with a family.\n2. The first story Walls tells of her childhood is that of her burning herself severely at age three, and her father dramatically takes her from the hospital: \"You're safe now\" Why do you think she opens with that story, and how does it set the stage for the rest of the memoir?\n● I think Jeannette started the memoir with the story of her getting badly burned for a couple of reasons. It showed that from a young age she was allowed to experiment with anything and that her parents let her be dependent and I think that made her feel good; even though her parents shouldn't have let her make hot dogs at the age of three by herself. I think the part about her dad taking her out of the hospital \"Rex Walls style\" shows a lot about their dad, good and bad. In a way it shows that he wants what is best for his kids even if it isn't what is technically right.\n3. Were you surprised to learn that, as adults, Jeannette and her siblings stayed close to their parents? Why do you think that is?\n●When I found out that Jeannette and her siblings were staying close with their parents I was surprised but also equally not surprised. When they were younger they stuck together and even though they had problems they had faith in their parents. Their parents...\n[continues]"

      "text": "Reading Group Guide\n\nThis reading group guide forThe Bird House includes an introduction, discussion questions, ideas for enhancing your book club, and a Q&A with author Kelly Simmons. The suggested questions are intended to help your reading group find new and interesting angles and topics for your discussion. We hope that these ideas will enrich your conversation and increase your enjoyment of the book.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nEvery family has its secrets. But when you are the last survivor tending to the dark fires of memory, and your own mind is fading, who do you share them with? Your diary or your eight-year-old granddaughter? Or do you simply let them fade away, along with your memory?\n\nThe Bird House is a moving story of secrets, lies, and relationships. It is a close look at the hardship and heartbreak that one woman can withstand during a lifetime. As an elderly woman, Ann Biddle is struggling to both remember and come to terms with the life she has led. It is through her young, but wise granddaughter, Ellie, that Ann finds a way to deal with her past and finally reveal the secrets that have come to taint the present.\n\nTOPICS AND QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\n\n1. Ann reveals within the first chapter that her memory is failing. How did this confession affect your reading? Was Ann an unreliable narrator? Explain your answer.\n\n2. Bird houses are a recurring theme throughout the novel—besides the title itself, Ellie chooses bird houses for her \"Aspect\" school project. Do you think the bird houses hold some sort of symbolism? Why or why not?\n\n3. Throughout the novel, we get bits and pieces of what Ann's husband, Theo, was like. Do you think Ann is fair with his depiction? If the novel had been narrated by Theo, how do you think he would have described himself? How would his perspective differ from Ann's?\n\n4. In the beginning, Ann describes her daughter-in-law, Tinsley, as almost perfect. She even attributes her granddaughter's wonderful demeanor to Tinsley. When do you see Ann's opinion begin to change? Why do you think it changes so drastically? Do you think they will ever completely resolve their differences?\n\n5. Ann thinks the world of Tom and Ellie. In her mind, they can do no wrong. Do you feel the same? Or do you think she is fiercely loyal to them because they are her flesh and blood?\n\n6. Adultery recurs throughout the novel and is also a shared commonality between Ann, her mother, and Tinsley. How do you think this bonds the women together? Does this shared connection help them relate to one another? Or could it also have an opposite effect on their relationships?\n\n7. Ann, her mother, and Tinsley all have completely different personalities and lead completely different lives. What do you think lead each woman to cheat on her partner?\n\n8. There were multiple instances throughout the novel where Ann's daughter, Emma, acts in an odd, and even malicious, manner. Do you think this is a result or an effect of the anger and resentment she feels for losing her daughter at such a young age?\n\n9. Do you blame Ann for her daughter's death? Do you think Ann blames herself? Why do you think she kept this a secret for such a long time?\n\n10. When Ann confronts Tinsley about her affair, she claims to have the best intentions. Do you agree with how Ann handled this discussion? If you were in Ann's position, what would you have done?\n\n11. Ann never gave her father the chance to give his side of the story, and after his death she discovers he was not her biological father. Do you think she should have given him the chance to explain himself? And do you think this was what he was trying to tell her?\n\n12. Ann reveals a great deal about her past, and even present, to Ellie. Do you think this relationship was inappropriate? Why or why not?\n\n13. On page 272, Ann says to Ellie: \"'If you ever have to choose between a man who's serious and a man who's fun, choose the fun one. Promise me.'\" Do you agree with Ann? Who do you think was the \"fun one\" and who was the serious one? Theo or Peter?\n\n14. Did you like that the novel was told from only Ann's perspective? Or would you have a more objective, third person narrator?'\n\nENHANCE YOUR BOOK CLUB\n\n1. Ellie decides to do her school project with the \"Aspect\" of bird houses. Make your own bird house and share it with the group.\n\n2. Ann and Ellie work very hard to create their family tree for Ellie's school project. Visit  or pick up a copy of Shaking the Family Tree: Blue Bloods, Black Sheep, and Other Obsessions of an Accidental Genealogist by Buzzy Jackson, to learn more about how to make a family tree of your own.\n\n3. Not all elderly people have the family and friends that Ann has. Volunteer at a nursing or retirement home with members from your book club. Sit down with someone and ask her to tell you stories of her past.\n\n4. Learn more about Kelly Simmons on her website at  and her blog at \n\nA CONVERSATION WITH KELLY SIMMONS\n\nWhat was your inspiration for The Bird House?\n\nMy daughter brought home an assignment from school that asked her to do a series of projects based on the family history that required interviewing a grandparent. I thought to myself, hmmmm, this assignment could really backfire, couldn't it? With a troubled grandparent, an innocent little girl, and a few family secrets, all hell could break loose! The idea rattled around in the back of my mind for a year or so while I started two other novels. Then I decided it was too powerful a story to ignore and focused my attention on it.\n\nAs your second novel, was the writing process easier or more difficult? What were the differences and similarities in writing The Bird House compared to Standing Still?\n\nIt was a bit easier in the editorial stages because I'd been through the process already. And as with Standing Still, I found the voice of the main character quickly. However, the actual writing was more difficult. The structure of The Bird House, with its twin diaries forty years apart, entwining and untangling, proved challenging. That being said, the most difficult part for me is always choosing material. I guess because of my advertising background, I'm a brainstormer—I generate lots of ideas for novels.\n\nThe main character, Ann, is suffering from early onset of Alzheimer's. Do you personally know anyone suffering from the disease?\n\nYes, our family has struggled with having a loved one diagnosed, as have several of my friends' families. It's a reality for many people, and in the beginning stages, it's so hard to pinpoint and accept.\n\nHow did you research Alzheimer's to make sure Ann's symptoms were realistic?\n\nI interviewed siblings, spouses, and children of Alzheimer's patients, rather than doctors, to hear their stories and to try to get the details right. I wanted the family's perceptions of the symptoms, not the textbook symptoms, if that makes sense.\n\nWhy did you decide to write the novel in the first person? Why did you want readers to get only Ann's perspective?\n\nAnn's perspective works best because her faulty memory makes her an unreliable narrator. I wanted readers to feel the tension and the worry of not knowing what she was going to do or say, or if they could trust her version of events. I love ambiguity and subtlety in a story, and so many novels with multiple narrators or an omniscient narrator go overboard and reveal more than is necessary. It's kind of a TMI situation for me. And I guess I am somewhat obsessed with first-person unreliable narrators, as Standing Still had one too!\n\nYou are a former creative director with a specialization in marketing to women. The Bird House is primarily about women, told from a woman's perspective. Do you think you will ever write a novel from a man's perspective? Or would you rather stick to what you know best?\n\nWell, I admit I have a righteous feminist streak, almost as if I was born in another era. I just really feel the indignation and the struggle deeply. Writing male characters can be a joy, but overall, there are so many more women's stories I want to explore.\n\nYour first novel, Standing Still, deals with anxiety disorders and abduction, while characters in The Bird House cope with Alzheimer's and the death of a child. Why did you choose to pair these dark subject matters in both your novels?\n\nMy agent once told me that I was \"obsessed with what's hidden.\" I'm also obsessed with the things I'm afraid of—which are fairly numerous! If you combed through the magazine articles and newspapers I read, the movies I see, the TV I watch—you'd see immediately I have a fascination with gritty stuff—crime and police, mysteries. By melding them into my work, I'm shedding some feminine, suburban, maternal light on them.\n\nAnn and Ellie are very close throughout the novel. Were you close to either of your grandmothers?\n\nI was close to both of them—the book is dedicated to them—and have amazing, warm, hilarious memories of them both. Because my mother was ill when I was young, these relationships were especially important to me.\n\nWhat are you currently reading? Who are your favorite authors?\n\nI just finished Little Bee, which was my choice for my mother-and-daughter book group. A few of my favorite authors are Ann Beattie, John Irving, and Lionel Shriver. But I love so many!\n\nAre you working on a third novel? What is next for Kelly Simmons?\n\nYes, I'm polishing up a new novel called The Book Addict. Words to live by!"

I'll see that you're put up to twelve when you\ncome back.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" smiled Philip. \"I'm beginning to want some new\nclothes badly.\"\n\n\"If you stick to your work and don't go larking about with the girls like\nwhat some of them do, I'll look after you, Carey.

Two years?\n\nHe was startled at the change in his uncle. When last he had seen him he\nwas a stout man, who held himself upright, clean-shaven, with a round,\nsensual face; but he had fallen in strangely, his skin was yellow; there\nwere great bags under the eyes, and he was bent and old. He had grown a\nbeard during his last illness, and he walked very slowly.\n\n\"I 'm not at my best today,\" he said when Philip, having just arrived, was\nsitting with him in the dining-room. \"The heat upsets me.\"\n\nPhilip, asking after the affairs of the parish, looked at him and wondered\nhow much longer he could last. A hot summer would finish him; Philip\nnoticed how thin his hands were; they trembled. It meant so much to\nPhilip. If he died that summer he could go back to the hospital at the\nbeginning of the winter session; his heart leaped at the thought of\nreturning no more to Lynn's.

      "text": "The entire first section of the first chapter deals with the particulars of how Norland was inherited first by Mr. Dashwood from his uncle and then by John Dashwood from his father only a year later. Since this inheritance is really what sets the acdtion of the novel in motion, it's a good place to start with our group read. There are also a number of legal/inheriting property issues there that are not easy for someone in the 21st century to understand!\n\nWe first read that Mr. Dashwood was the 'legal inheritor' of the estate, but also that he was the person to whom his elderly uncle 'intended to bequeath it' When I read it, I always feel that is saying the same thing twice. If he was the legal inheritor, could his uncle's 'intent' to bequeath the estate to him mean he might not inherit Norland, if the elder Mr. Dashwood changed his mind?\n\nHere is a thread I dug up from the S&S archives that explains the difference between the two.\n\nWhat's interesting is that the film adaptations, and S&S2 in particular, make it seem that there was no possible way that Elinor, Marianne and Margaret could have inherited anything from Norland, no matter what. That was not precisely the case. The property was not entailed when their old uncle had it, and single women (or widows) were allowed to inherit or own property at that time--they just risked losing control of it upon marriage until the Married Woman's Property Act came into effect late in the 19th century.\n\nIn fact, the narrator in S&S sounds both disappointed and surprised that the girls did not get anything from their uncle except their 1000 pounds a piece, with language such as 'severe disappointment' and 'destroyed half the value of the bequest' On the other hand, when the Dashwood famiy history is recounted and we read there were \"many generations\" that had been \"long established in Sussex\", it is perhaps more surpising that Henry Dashwood expected or hoped his uncle would do anything different than what he did. A childless elderly man had the opportunity to know his family estate would be passed down for at least three more generations, fully intact, in the Dashwood line.\n\nDoes it really seem to anyone, upon a close reading of Chapter 1, that Henry Dashwood ought to have realistically expected to inherit anything more for his wife and daughters than what they got?"

Homes that were once happy are threatened by a mysterious illness.\n\nHere, a young boy named Leonard and his friends exist in a state of confusion and despair, as every year or so a boy from their school vanishes after venturing into the poisoned woods. Without conclusive evidence of foul play, the authorities consider the boys to be runaways.\n\nThe town policeman suspects otherwise but, paralyzed with fear, he does nothing. And so it is up to the children who remain to take action. Their plan to stop the forces of evil that are destroying their town is at the shocking and terrifying heart of The Glister .\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. What was your initial reaction to the disappearance of the boys? Were you expecting the story to go in a different direction?\n\n2. The story is set in what as once an area of natural beauty, now defiled by pollution and neglect. Is The Glister an \"environmental\" novel? Who does the author imply is responsible for the environment's decay? Who suffers from its effects?\n\n3. The novel is told from multiple perspectives, but Leonard is the only character whose thoughts are told in the first person. Why do you think this is? From where might he be telling the story?\n\n4. Leonard remarks, \"I can't help thinking that, if you want to stay alive, you have to love something.\" How does Leonard maintain a sense of optimism among his bleak surroundings? When and why does his attitude later shift?\n\n5. How does Leonard feel about his mother? Is his attitude justified?\n\n6. What do you think of the way sex is portrayed in the book?

His father\nrefuses; he feels he is too old to start over in a new\nplace.\n• The Weisels' former servant, Martha, begs the family to\nlive with her; the elder Wiesel is too proud to accept.\n• Shortly before the evacuation of the ghetto, someone\nknocks on the Wiesels window, but is gone before\nanyone can answer.

They beat\nher into submission.\n• Madame Schachter's cries were prophetic.\n• Upon arriving at Auschwitz the deportees are\nshaken by the sight of the black smoke from the\ngigantic chimney.\n• They are seeing the crematory, and its purpose\nbecomes the central source of horror\nthroughout their time in the camps.\n• Selection is the process by which it is decided which\nprisoners will live as laborers and which will feed the\ncrematory.\n• Selections are conducted quickly and dispassionately.\n• First, men and women are segregated.\n• Groups march toward the infamous Dr. Mengele; he\nquestions them about age, health, and occupation.\n• The questions are cursory and the decisions are\nrandom.\n• Eliezer and his father lie to save their lives.\n• While marching toward Mengele, another prisoner\nasks their ages and corrects their reply; \"Eighteen\nand forty\" he orders.\n• If the two were truthful, they would be too young\nand too old for labor.\n• Eliezer quickly lies about his occupation calling\nhimself a farmer. A student may be considered\nuseless.\n• Birkenau is euphemistically described as the\n\"reception center\" for Auschwitz, the death\ncamp where Jews and others are slaughtered\nand burned.\n• The prisoners are selected for either labor or\ndeath at Birkenau.\n• Being subjected to one atrocity after another\ntakes its toll physically, emotionally, and\nspiritually.\n• But, it is the ditch filled with babies that forever\nshakes Eliezer's steadfast faith in God.\n• Eliezer never questions God's existence, but he\ncondemns a God that permits such atrocities.\n• Eliezer sees a second ditch and it seems that he is\nbeing directed toward it.\n• Deciding that he wishes to be the master of his\nown fate he quickly plans to break ranks and\nthrow himself against the electrified fence.\n• He offers a final prayer.\n• Two steps before the ditch, the prisoners are\nherded into the barracks instead.\n• The prisoners are quickly stripped of independence and\nindividuality and are left naked and vulnerable as their captors\nexamine them.\n• Kept awake through the first cold night, broken, sickened, and\nweeping, prisoners are forced to run for what seems like an\neternity the next day.\n• They are dosed with disinfectant, showered and dressed in ill-\nfitting prison garb.\n• Eliezer's father receives a savage beating for asking to go to the\nbathroom; even Eliezer does nothing to help his father.\n• They are to work and if their work is not satisfactory they will die.\n• The prisoners offer total submission to their\ncaptors.\n• They lose the independent will to object to their\ntreatment, and they are willing to turn on other\nprisoners to save themselves.\n• In using prisoners to maintain order, the Nazis\nare able to easily control large groups of\npeople.\n• An unidentified prisoner advises Eliezer and his father on\nthe ages they must reply to survive the selection.\n• Many prisoners cling to hope and humanity through\nreligion. They are able to accept the existence of the camps\nby rationalizing that God is testing them.\n• Often the prisoners in charge are as brutal as their captors.\nThe Polish block leader is an exception; he offers kind words\nand emphasizes that prisoners must not lose their faith or\nabandon each other.\n• Eliezer lies to a relative who asks him about his wife and\nchildren. Eliezer gives the man the last happiness he ever\nknows by saying that he has not heard from them.\n• Buna is a labor camp and the two Wiesels are\nselected for labor.\n• Upon leaving Auschwitz the prisoners march\nfor hours to Buna.\n• With so many Germans fighting in the war the\nworkforce has been depleted; the workforce is\nsupplemented with prisoners, and Eliezer\nworks at a warehouse with civilians.\n• As the child dies, one of the prisoners asks,\n\"Where is God?\" At that moment the child,\nwho is silently suffering a prolonged,\nagonizing, public death on the gallows,\nsymbolizes God to Eliezer.\n• Kapos are prison officials in charge of the work\ncrews.\n• They are characterized as being brutal, sadistic,\nand having enough power to be corrupt.\n• The prisoners realize that a single bomb could kill\nhundreds of prisoners, but they welcome the\nbombs joyfully.\n• Periodic air raids mean that the war is moving\ncloser to the camp, and when the front line reaches\nthe camp the surviving prisoners will be liberated.\n• One air raid lasts an hour and Eliezer wished it\nwould last one hundred hours. Prisoners\ncheerfully clear away the ruins of the raid.\n• Upon facing the possible death by Allied\nbombs Eliezer says, \"…we were no longer\nafraid of death, at any rate, not of that death.\"\n• A death that would also bring about the death\nof their captors is not frightening after what\nthey endured.\n• Eliezer's anger towards God deepens.\n• Eliezer admonished God for tormenting the other\nprisoners' minds with his continued presence.\n• Eliezer accuses God of active responsibility for\ntorturing the Jews.\n• Eliezer's rebellion against God leaves a profound\nvoid in his heart.\n• The prisoners run about in preparation for the\ndisplay to get some color in their flesh.\n• They run past Mengele to create an illusion of\nstrength and to prevent Mengele from being\nable to note their identification numbers.\n• Father gives Eliezer his only belongings: a knife\nand a spoon.\n• Eliezer's father believes that this will be his\nfinal good-bye to his son.\n• Eliezer tries to refuse them, but his father\ninsists, and Eliezer takes his \"inheritance.\"\n• Eliezer's foot becomes painfully swollen during the\nJanuary cold.\n• The doctor says the he needs an operation. Another\npatient warns him that being hospitalized makes one\nprime target for selection.\n• Faced with possible amputation if the foot is not cured,\nhe accepts the danger of the hospital.\n• The operation is done without anesthetic. He learns\nthat his foot will heal, but he must recover for two\nweeks, making him vulnerable to the next selection.\n• Two days after the operation, rumors spread that\nthe Russian army is on its way to liberate Buna.\n• The prisoners learn that they will be marched from\nthe camp.\n• Eliezer leaves the hospital to find his father.\n• They must choose either: Eliezer leaving the\nhospital and joining the father in the march, or his\nfather joining Eliezer in the hospital. They choose\nthe march believing that the Nazis will surely kill\nany prisoners left behind.\n• The realization that his death would leave his\nfather alone helps Eliezer summon the strength\nto continue.\n• The two Wiesels take turns inspiring each other\nto continue.\n• Eliezer prays that he should not do the same to\nhis father.\n• It is difficult for Eliezer to fight the feelings that\nhis own chances for survival would increase\nwithout his father to support.\n• Speaking with the abandoned Rabbi helps\nrefocus Eliezer's commitment to his father.\n• As the elder Wiesel is sent to the left with the\nobviously weak, Eliezer creates a confusion that\nallows him to bring his father back to the right.\n• Since the Nazis are pressed for time because of the\napproaching Russian army, the selection process\nbreaks down.\n• Many prisoners are killed in the process, but\nEliezer and his father survive.\n• An elderly man's son lunges at him for a morsel of\nbread, even as the father tries to share it with him.\n• The two incite the other hungry prisoners, and\nafter the fight, the father and son are both dead.\n• If the bond between father and son is broken, then\ngenocide is realized even if the crematory fires are\nextinguished; they no longer need the fires to kill\nthem; they are destroying each other.\n• Eliezer's father suffers from dysentery and will\nsurely die; the doctors see no point in treating\nhim.\n• Caregivers are no longer willing to \"waste\"\nany resources on the dying.\n• Eliezer feels intense guilt and blames himself\nfor doing nothing when the guard attacks his\nfather.\n• Eliezer's father is gone after their phenomenal\nstruggle, yet Eliezer cannot cry. Worst of all he\ncannot fight the feeling that he is \"…free at\nlast.\"\n• Eliezer cannot save his father, so his feelings of\nguilt are irrational.\n• As the front approaches the surviving Jews are\nordered to gather in the camp. News spread\nthat they will be executed on the spot.\n• The camp resistance movement interferes with\nthe execution, and instruction is given to ignore\nthe order.\n• Five days later the resistance movement stages\na rebellion , freeing the prisoners shortly before\nliberation by the American army.\n• The prisoners eat.\n• \"Our first act as free men was to throw\nourselves onto the provisions. We thought\nonly of that. Not of revenge, not of our\nfamilies. Nothing but bread.\"\n• After surviving the selection, the abuse, and\nthe starvation of the camps, Eliezer nearly dies\nof food poisoning after liberation.\n• Ironically, the very sustenance he needs to\nsurvive almost kills him when he finally gets it.\n• Eliezer has not looked at himself in the mirror\nsince deportation from the ghettos.\n• When he finally regains enough strength to\nlook at himself in a mirror, he says he sees a\ncorpse.\n• Physically he is alive, but Eliezer's spirit has\ndied."

      "text": "PASSAGE: How did one village bring disaster on itself? On a morning in early spring, 1873, the people of Oberfest left their houses and took refuge in the town hall. No one knows why precisely. A number of rumors had raced through the town during recent weeks, were passed on and converted to news; predictions became certainties. On this particular morning, fear turned into terror, and people rushed through the narrow streets, carrying their most precious possessions, pulling their children and dashing into the great hall. The doors were nailed shut, and men took their turns watching out the window. Two days passed. When no disaster came, the fear grew worse, because the people began to suspect that the danger was already in the hall, locked inside. No one spoke to anybody else; people watched each other, looking for signs. It was the children who rang the great bell in the first bell tower-a small band of bored children found the bell rope and swung on it-set the bell clanging. This was the traditional signal of alarm, and in a moment the elders were dashing in panic to all the other bell towers and ringing the bells. For nearly an hour, the valley reverberated with the wild clangor-and then, a thousand feet above, the snow began to crack, and the avalanche began; a massive cataract of ice and snow thundered down and buried the town, silencing the bells. There is no trace of Oberfest today, not even a spire, because the snow is so deep; and, in the shadow of the mountains, it is very cold. Which word best expresses the main idea of the passage?\n\nEnglish 3 & 4) - How did one village bring disaster on itself?

      "text": "Indiana Cousins Discussion Questions by Wanda Brunstetter\n\n1. A tragic accident can change the course of a person's life. Of the six people who survived the van accident in A Cousin's Promise, whose lives do you think were the most affected?\n\n2. There was a lot of blaming going on after the accident. Was Loraine justified in blaming herself for suggesting that she and her friends take a trip to Hershey Park? Was her guilt self-inflicted, or did it come about because of the comments Wayne's mother made?\n\n3. There are times in people's lives when they become riddled with guilt over something they think they should or shouldn't have done. What are some ways we can work through such guilt? How can we help someone who is riddled with guilt and blames themselves unnecessarily for something that happened?\n\n4. When Wayne learned that he'd lost a leg as a result of the accident, he fell into depression and called off his wedding, thinking he was less of a man and could no longer provide for a wife and a family. What, if anything, did Wayne's friends and family do to help him come to grips with his loss?\n\n5. Some people might have a tendency to over-protect or smother someone who has gone through a tragedy such as Wayne did. What are some things that Wayne's mother could have done differently to help Wayne deal with his loss?\n\n6. Even though Wayne seemed determined to push Loraine away, she was equally determined to keep her promise to marry him. Do you think this was a result of her guilt over the accident, or did she love Wayne unconditionally and want to be his wife despite his handicap?\n\n7. When Jake Beechy, Loraine's old boyfriend, returned to Indiana, she felt comforted, yet confused. She'd been in love with Jake once and wondered if she could love him again, yet she still had feelings for Wayne. The more Wayne pushed Loraine away, the closer she got to Jake, and the guiltier she felt. Were Loraine's feelings for Jake deep enough that she should have been able to let go of the promise she'd made to Wayne? Or should Loraine have kept her promise to Wayne despite her past feelings for Jake?\n\n8. If Loraine decided to choose Wayne because she felt sorry for him, how do you think it might have affected their future?\n\n9. Is there ever a time when it's all right to break a promise you've made? Is so, what are some examples of when it might be all right?\n\n10. Was Loraine's mother right in thinking that Wayne would be a burden to Loraine if she married him? How might Priscilla have been more supportive to her daughter during such a difficult time?\n\n11. Loraine's cousin Ella was opposed to Loraine going out with Jake. What were her reasons, and were they justified? How did Ella's attitude toward Jake affect her relationship with Loraine? How might Ella have been more supportive?\n\n12. What life's lessons did you learn from reading A Cousin's Promise, and which scripture verses from the story spoke to your heart the most?"

And it\nwon't do father any harm. It was just an accident.\"\n\n\"You were cowards,\" said Jerry with judicial scorn, \"and you gave way to your\ncowardice. That is why you should be punished. Everybody will laugh at you about\nthis, and that is a disgrace to the family.\"\n\n\"If you knew how awful the whole thing was,\" said Faith with a shiver, \"you\nwould think we had been punished enough already. I wouldn't go through it again\nfor anything in the whole world.\"\n\n\"I believe you'd have run yourself if you'd been there,\" muttered Carl.\n\n\"From an old woman in a cotton sheet,\" mocked Jerry. \"Ho, ho, ho!\"\n\n\"It didn't look a bit like an old woman,\" cried Faith. \"It was just a great,\nbig, white thing crawling about in the grass just as Mary Vance said Henry\nWarren did. It's all very fine for you to laugh, Jerry Meredith, but you'd have\nlaughed on the other side of your mouth if you'd been there. And how are we to\nbe punished? I don't think it's fair, but let's know what we have to do, Judge\nMeredith!\"\n\n\"The way I look at it,\" said Jerry, frowning, \"is that Carl was the most to\nblame. He bolted first, as I understand it. Besides, he was a boy, so he should\nhave stood his ground to protect you girls, whatever the danger was. You know\nthat, Carl, don't you?\"\n\n\"I s'pose so,\" growled Carl shamefacedly.\n\n\"Very well. This is to be your punishment. To-night you'll sit on Mr.\nHezekiah Pollock's tombstone in the graveyard alone, until twelve o'clock.\"\n\nCarl gave a little shudder. The graveyard was not so very far from the old\nBailey garden. It would be a trying ordeal, but Carl was anxious to wipe out his\ndisgrace and prove that he was not a coward after all.\n\n\"All right,\" he said sturdily. \"But how'll I know when it is twelve?\"\n\n\"The study windows are open and you'll hear the clock striking. And mind you\nthat you are not to budge out of that graveyard until the last stroke. As for\nyou girls, you've got to go without jam at supper for a week.\"\n\nFaith and Una looked rather blank. They were inclined to think that even\nCarl's comparatively short though sharp agony was lighter punishment than this\nlong drawn-out ordeal. A whole week of soggy bread without the saving grace of\njam! But no shirking was permitted in the club. The girls accepted their lot\nwith such philosophy as they could summon up.\n\nThat night they all went to bed at nine, except Carl, who war already keeping\nvigil on the tombstone. Una slipped in to bid him good night. Her tender heart\nwas wrung with sympathy.\n\n\"Oh, Carl, are you much scared?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Not a bit,\" said Carl airily.\n\n\"I won't sleep a wink till after twelve,\" said Una. \"If you get lonesome just\nlook up at our window and remember that I'm inside, awake, and thinking about\nyou. That will be a little company, won't it?\"\n\n\"I'll be all right. Don't you worry about me,\" said Carl.\n\nBut in spite of his dauntless words Carl was a pretty lonely boy when the\nlights went out in the manse. He had hoped his father would be in the study as\nhe so often was. He would not feel alone then. But that night Mr. Meredith had\nbeen summoned to the fishing village at the harbour mouth to see a dying man. He\nwould not likely be back until after midnight. Carl must dree his weird\nalone.\n\nA Glen man went past carrying a lantern. The mysterious shadows caused by the\nlantern-light went hurtling madly over the graveyard like a dance of demons or\nwitches. Then they passed and darkness fell again. One by one the lights in the\nGlen went out. It was a very dark night, with a cloudy sky, and a raw east wind\nthat was cold in spite of the calendar. Far away on the horizon was the low dim\nlustre of the Charlottetown lights. The wind wailed and sighed in the old fir-\ntrees. Mr. Alec Davis' tall monument gleamed whitely through the gloom. The\nwillow beside it tossed long, writhing arms spectrally. At times, the gyrations\nof its boughs made it seem as if the monument were moving, too.\n\nCarl curled himself up on the tombstone with his legs tucked under him. It\nwasn't precisely pleasant to hang them over the edge of the stone. Just suppose-\n-just suppose--bony hands should reach up out of Mr. Pollock's grave under it\nand clutch him by the ankles. That had been one of Mary Vance's cheerful\nspeculations one time when they had all been sitting there. It returned to haunt\nCarl now. He didn't believe those things; he didn't even really believe in Henry\nWarren's ghost. As for Mr. Pollock, he had been dead sixty years, so it wasn't\nlikely he cared who sat on his tombstone now. But there is something very\nstrange and terrible in being awake when all the rest of the world is asleep.\nYou are alone then with nothing but your own feeble personality to pit against\nthe mighty principalities and powers of darkness. Carl was only ten and the dead\nwere all around him--and he wished, oh, he wished that the clock would strike\ntwelve. Would it never strike twelve? Surely Aunt Martha must have forgotten to\nwind it.\n\nAnd then it struck eleven--only eleven! He must stay yet another hour in that\ngrim place. If only there were a few friendly stars to be seen! The darkness was\nso thick it seemed to press against his face. There was a sound as of stealthy\npassing footsteps all over the graveyard. Carl shivered, partly with prickling\nterror, partly with real cold.\n\nThen it began to rain--a chill, penetrating drizzle. Carl's thin little\ncotton blouse and shirt were soon wet through. He felt chilled to the bone. He\nforgot mental terrors in his physical discomfort. But he must stay there till\ntwelve--he was punishing himself and he was on his honour. Nothing had been said\nabout rain--but it did not make any difference. When the study clock finally\nstruck twelve a drenched little figure crept stiffly down off Mr. Pollock's\ntombstone, made its way into the manse and upstairs to bed. Carl's teeth were\nchattering. He thought he would never get warm again.\n\nHe was warm enough when morning came. Jerry gave one startled look at his\ncrimson face and then rushed to call his father. Mr. Meredith came hurriedly,\nhis own face ivory white from the pallor of his long night vigil by a death bed.\nHe had not got home until daylight. He bent over his little lad anxiously.\n\nMr. Meredith rushed to the telephone. In ten minutes Dr. Blythe was at the\nmanse. Half an hour later a wire was sent to town for a trained nurse, and all\nthe Glen knew that Carl Meredith was very ill with pneumonia and that Dr. Blythe\nhad been seen to shake his head.\n\nGilbert shook his head more than once in the fortnight that followed. Carl\ndeveloped double pneumonia. There was one night when Mr. Meredith paced his\nstudy floor, and Faith and Una huddled in their bedroom and cried, and Jerry,\nwild with remorse, refused to budge from the floor of the hall outside Carl's\ndoor. Dr. Blythe and the nurse never left the bedside. They fought death\ngallantly until the red dawn and they won the victory. Carl rallied and passed\nthe crisis in safety. The news was phoned about the waiting Glen and people\nfound out how much they really loved their minister and his children.\n\n\"I haven't had one decent night's sleep since I heard the child was sick,\"\nMiss Cornelia told Anne, \"and Mary Vance has cried until those queer eyes of\nhers looked like burnt holes in a blanket. Is it true that Carl got pneumonia\nfrom straying out in the graveyard that wet night for a dare?\"\n\n\"No. He was staying there to punish himself for cowardice in that affair of\nthe Warren ghost. It seems they have a club for bringing themselves up, and they\npunish themselves when they do wrong. Jerry told Mr. Meredith all about it.\"\n\n\"The poor little souls,\" said Miss Cornelia.\n\nCarl got better rapidly, for the congregation took enough nourishing things\nto the manse to furnish forth a hospital. Norman Douglas drove up every evening\nwith a dozen fresh eggs and a jar of Jersey cream. Sometimes he stayed an hour\nand bellowed arguments on predestination with Mr. Meredith in the study; oftener\nhe drove on up to the hill that overlooked the Glen.\n\nWhen Carl was able to go again to Rainbow Valley they had a special feast in\nhis honour and the doctor came down and helped them with the fireworks. Mary\nVance was there, too, but she did not tell any ghost stories. Miss Cornelia had\ngiven her a talking on that subject which Mary would not forget in a hurry"

Really sick. Feverishly sick. He starts hallucinating and sleepwalking. He finds himself grappling for a boat by the river, lighting a lamp for Magwitch. He thinks Miss Havisham is roasting in a furnace in the corner of his room. He talks to himself.\n\nHis creditors show up one day, but Pip only vaguely remembers them. They tell him he's arrested and make him get up and get dressed, but Pip is so weak.\n\nHe can't remember what happens next, but he soon realizes that people are trying to help him and to take care of him. These \"people\" become Joe. Pip discovers that Joe has come to take care of him.\n\nPip feels super guilty, because Joe is wonderful as ever and showers him with love.\n\nIt takes Pip a while to heal, but he soon gets better. He realizes that Biddy has taught Joe how to write.\n\nJoe tells Pip that Miss Havisham has died and that she has divided up her wealth appropriately, not forgetting Mr. Pocket or Herbert.\n\nJoe tells Pip that Orlick robbed Mr. Pumblechook, tied him to a bedpost, slapped him around, and stuffed flowers in his mouth. Orlick is now in jail. Finally.\n\nJoe and Pip go on a field trip into the country one Sunday, just like old times. Pip is eternally grateful to Joe. He tries to tell Joe about Magwitch and about the last few years, but Joe stops him, saying that what's in the past is in the past.\n\nJoe apologizes to Pip for never having been able to stop Mrs. Joe from beating him as a little boy. He tells Pip that he always felt that when he did try to stop her, she beat Pip more severely. Thus, Joe tried to keep himself from intervening so that Pip would not get as badly hurt.\n\nPip gets healthier and healthier, stronger and stronger, and, as he does so, Joe starts to act differently around him. Joe starts to call Pip, \"sir\" again which basically rips Pip's heart out.\n\nOne Sunday night before bed, Joe asks Pip how he is feeling. Pip replies that he's feeling quite nice. When he wakes up the next morning, he finds a note from Joe saying goodbye. Joe includes a receipt to show that all of Pip's debts have been paid off.\n\nPip is devastated. So are we.\n\nPip cooks up a plan. He decides he will follow Joe home, he will propose to Biddy, and he will work side by side with Joe in the forge."

      "text": "1. Why did the author title this novel The Journeys of Socrates? What journeys does Socrates (Sergei) take? What sorts of terrain does he traverse and how does it reflect his inner journey? If you had to choose a different title for the novel, what might that be?\n\n2. Does Sergei have a home? What place(s) serve as his home? What homes does he (find and) lose? Does his boyhood visit to the Abramovich's cabin shape his sense of home? How do his perspectives about home and family develop over the course of the novel? When the novel ends, has he finally reached home? If not, when might that happen? Has it become his nature to journey once again?\n\n3. What role does God play in the novel? What about organized religion? Heaven and hell? Early in the novel, Sergei asks his grandfather Heschel about \"the path to Heaven\" and Heschel tells him, \"I believe that one day you will blaze your own pathŠyou will find your own way.\" Does Sergei experience hell? Does he find heaven?\n\n4. What did you learn about Russian Jews and Cossacks by reading The Journeys of Socrates? What role do each play in Sergei's life? Are Jews and Cossacks innate enemies? Is Sergei a Jew, a Cossack, both, or neither? How does Sergei reconcile these distinct identities within himself? How does each tradition influence him?\n\n5. What role does the survival training play in Sergei's development? What do those days in the wilderness teach Sergei about himself? What does he learn about the natural world? About Dmitri Zakolyev? Why did Zakolyev choose Sergei as a partner? What strategies must Sergei follow to maintain peace with Dmitri? Are they effective? After he helps Dmitri to free himself, Sergei observes, \"He knew that in saving Dmitri Zakolyev, he had made an enemy for life.\" Why has Dmitri become an enemy? Could Sergei have made a different choice? Why? How does the survival test prepare Sergei for later trials?\n\n6. Why do Sergei's grandparents give him the nickname \"Socrates\"? Heschel describes Socrates the Greek as being \"among the wisest and the best of men.\" What do you learn about Socrates the Greek by reading The Journeys of Socrates? Is the name a good choice? How does Sergei resemble Socrates the Greek over the course of the novel? What else do you know about the ancient sage?\n\n7. Young Sergei has lost his parents and grandparents. In Sara Abramovich he first finds a mother. During his journeys, he meets a series of father figures-Chief Instructor Ivanov, Heschel, Benyomin, Alexei Orlov, Razin, and Serafim. Many (if not all) of these men also serve as teachers in Sergei's life. What key lessons does he learn from each man? How do they each influence Sergei's beliefs and actions? From whom, by the novel's end, has he learned the most?\n\n8. Dmitri Zakolyev calls our protagonist \"Sergei the Good.\" Is Sergei comfortable with this title? Why or why not? What roles do Good and Evil play in the novel? Is Sergei always \"Good\"? Is Dmitri always \"Evil\"? How does Sergei's resolve to seek revenge change his conceptions of Good, Evil, and Justice? How do his years of study with Serafim further influence his views?\n\n9. How does Serafim's influence change Sergei's vow and mission? Serafim tells Sergei, \"You fight the dragonŠyou become the dragon.\" Do you agree? Is it possible for anyone to fight evil without becoming the dragon? What distinction does Serafim draw between man's responsibilities and God's? How does Serafim suggest Sergei can find peace?\n\n10. How does Dmitri Zakolyev resemble totalitarian leaders like Joseph Stalin or Mao Zedong? Why did men follow him? Why did they eventually tire of his leadership? Was Zakolyev's character shaped by his personal history or something more? How were Sergei and Zakolyev similar? Is Zakolyev also searching for peace? Could he have found redemption? Might Sergei have taken Zakolyev's path or was there an innate difference? What might that difference be?\n\n11. How do the women characters-(Natalia, Esther, Valeria, Anya, Shura, and Paulina)-show strength and courage? How do they influence the men in their lives? What draws Anya to Sergei? How is Valeria Panova different from Sara Abramovich? In what ways do these women shape the story (if they didn't exist, how would the story be different)?\n\n12. Near the end of the story, the young couple leaves Sergei to begin their own life. Why do they need to part ways with him? Does Sergei understand their decision? How have his travels and struggles enabled him to make peace with his memories, weather the pain of the present, and accept the uncertainty of the future?\n\n13. What is a warrior? Who in The Journeys of Socrates are warriors? What qualities make them so? At what point in the novel does Sergei become a warrior? (When he is chosen for initiation into the elite guard? When he leaves the Nevskiy Military School? When he completes training with Serafim? When he defeats Zakolyev?) Is young Paulina a warrior? When she chooses to stop fighting, does she stop being a warrior?\n\n14. What is a \"peaceful warrior\"? Why does Heschel call Socrates the Greek a peaceful warrior? How does a peaceful warrior differ from a warrior? When does Sergei become a peaceful warrior?\n\n15. How does Sergei Ivanov (Socrates) change over the course of the novel? Who has he become by the novel's end? Serafim has suggested that the true warrior must \"fight for a cause larger than\" himself. Has Sergei discovered this cause? Do his battles continue in a new arena, or has he found peace? Socrates is about to begin a new journey-where might he go next?"

What do you think they get from their relationships with one another that they aren't able to get from a man?\n\nThroughout the book it's clear that Reagan has major doubts about her own self-worth and her place in the group. This view of herself is manifested in her attitude towards men and her friends' lives. Why was she so consumed with jealousy rather than love? How is she able to overcome this and approach life with a more positive outlook?\n\nWhen Freddie and her mother finally sit down and talk, Rebecca says, \"I saw that it would be more selfish to come back into your life than it had been to leave it in the first place.\" Did you find this explanation adequate? How did Rebecca's decision to not come back and get Freddie affect Freddie's life in a positive way and make her the woman she ultimately became?\n\nIn many ways The Friendship Test is a novel of forgiveness and acceptance. Freddie must forgive her parents and her husband, the friends must forgive Reagan for her outbursts, Matthew must accept that Sarah is gone, Reagan must accept that Matthew does not love her. What does it mean to forgive? How do forgiveness and acceptance help each character move on with their lives?\n\nAt one point Tamsin opines that Freddie is \"putting obstacles in the way of her own happiness.\" Many of us often do this out of fear or the feeling that we don't deserve to be happy. How does Freddie overcome this?\n\nThroughout the novel we are shown the many different types of love found in life: love between a husband and wife, love between friends, love between mothers and their children. How would you compare Freddie's love for Harry with her father's love for her? How about Matthew's love for Sarah and Freddie? How does love change and grow? Can love become unhealthy?\n\nAbout the Author\n\nElizabeth Noble was born in England and graduated from Oxford University, with a BA (Honors) in English language and literature. After taking a break from her career in publishing to have her two daughters, she decided to do what she had been threatening to for years -- she wrote The Reading Group her first novel which soon became a bestseller in both the United Kingdom and United States. The Friendship Test is her second novel and luckily for fans, her third novel, Alphabet Weekends, is in the works."

The transition from black country blues and white hillbilly music into rock and roll takes place in a roadhouse outside Memphis. The characters are larger than life and yet believable in the way that it takes giants sometimes to effect cultural change. The author knows blues and early rock in the intimate way of a guitarist caressing people's lives out of his guitar strings. This is one super book!\n\n—Book Sense 76 Citation\n\nPink Cadillac brings both of its milieus, the present world of record collecting and its 1950s Memphis setting, to brilliantly vivid life.

His astonishing portrayal of Thomas \"Bearcat\" Jackson, as a brilliant, flawed, larger-than-life tragic hero is achingly real."

Does it just mean a plan to go out, or something more specific to the time period?\n\nI believe you are correct in your interpretation of it referring to plans to go out. Of course we know that the Gardiners were by no means horrid and mean to Lydia. Under the circumstances they were very prudent to keep her under wraps. Lydia who was always wanting to be going and doing and wanting to be seen perceives it this way seeing herself as a prisoner in their home. She has no sense of wrong-doing or the effects of her actions on her family. At some point, in a letter I believe, she was talking of attending balls even after she was married and dancing with all the officers, etc. which had me rolling my eyes upward. She hasn't even the tiniest ounce of decorum.\n\n2. I believe I have heard it said that the person of higher rank must request the introduction: \"Elizabeth had mentioned her (Lady C's) name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.\" This would seem to confirm this rule of etiquette.\n\n3.

      "text": "Kidnapped\n\nChapters 1–3\n\nSummary\n\nChapter 1: I Set Off Upon My Journey to the House of Shaws\n\nThe first chapter introduces David Balfour, the hero of the novel. David is a young boy of seventeen who has grown up in the town of Essendean, in the Lowlands of Scotland. David's father has recently died, leaving David an orphan, since his mother died some time ago. David is now preparing to leave Essendean to seek his fortunes elsewhere in the world. He meets Mr. Campbell, the minister of Essendean, and a good friend to David and his late father. Mr. Campbell reveals the father's dying wishes to David. He wants David to take a letter to the House of Shaws in Cramond, near Edinburgh, which is where the father comes from. This means that David is, in fact, from a wealthy family, though he has grown up in poverty. David is to take the letter to Ebenezer Balfour, his uncle. Campbell then gives David four things: first, the little money left over from his father's estate; a Bible; a shilling; and a recipe for a healing ointment.\n\nChapter 2: I Come to My Journey's End\n\nDavid walks two days toward Edinburgh. It is his first time in the city, and he is taken aback by the sight. He is especially interested in the ships he sees in the harbor. But he continues westward past Edinburgh, toward Cramond, where the House of Shaws is situated. He sees a troop of British soldiers (Redcoats) and is pleased by it.\n\nOnce he reaches Cramond, David begins asking for the House of Shaws, and is meant by some strange looks. He continues on, and finally asks someone about the House without revealing his connection to it. He discovers that the house seems to have little respect in the countryside, especially Ebenezer himself. David becomes disillusioned with the prospect of the House of Shaws, and suspects that his uncle is a mean old man. He almost turns back, but decides to press on. He comes upon a woman who points the House of Shaws out to him: a huge, decrepit old house that contrasts sharply with the beautiful countryside. As he stands there, the woman curses the house and its sole occupant.\n\nFeeling very disappointed, David goes down to the house and knocks. He gets no answer, and must resort to pounding on the door to finally get some attention. An old man pops out of the window, armed with a gun, and demands to know David's business. David replies that he has a letter for Ebenezer, and gives his name. The man seems most interested in the fact that David's father is dead.\n\nChapter 3: I Make Acquaintance of My Uncle\n\nThe old man allows David into the house, which is bare and just as run-down as the outside. The old man has many locks upon the door, and David thinks he is a servant. He is shocked to learn that the old man is, in fact, his uncle. The uncle asks whether he has read the letter he has brought, and David confesses that he hasn't. The uncle then asks whether he expects something, and David replies that he expects nothing, though he had hoped he might have wealthy relatives that would help him in life. David quickly becomes annoyed and angry with his ornery, suspicious uncle.\n\nEbenezer sends David to bed in a completely pitch-dark room. The next day, he badgers David with questions while being mildly hospitable. David tells him about Mr. Campbell, and Ebenezer threatens to throw him out if he sends word to anyone about the poverty of the House of Shaws. David then makes to leave, and Ebenezer tries to be friendly again. But when Ebenezer decides to go out, he tells David that he'll have to lock him out. David tells him that if the uncle locks him out, he'll never return, which distresses Ebenezer. The uncle decides not to leave.\n\nDavid tells Ebenezer it's plain that he doesn't him, and offers to leave, but Ebenezer protests, claiming they will get along fine.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThese early chapters set up the initial premise of the novel. David Balfour, a poor boy, is actually from a wealthy family, and is presumably in the position to inherit a great fortune. It seems like a fairy tale, and it partly is. Since the focus of the novel will be upon David's adventures with Alan Breck Stewart and not very much with David's quest to get his rightful inheritance, one might wonder why Stevenson bothers with the inheritance sub-plot in the first place.\n\nThere are several reasons for Stevenson creating this situation. First, he intended Balfour to represent one of his own ancestors, the well-known family of the Balfours, so it would be a misrepresentation to make David a poor boy. Second, and more importantly, Stevenson is writing for children, and some of those children may not be wealthy. It is every boy's dream to suddenly discover he is heir to a great inheritance. Finally, by making David one of the gentry (the upper class), Stevenson may have made the book more appealing to adults who want to believe they're reading something respectable, and not just a young boy's fantasy novel.\n\nThe attitudes of those he talks to toward the House of Shaws contribute to David's own growing sense of disappointment, which reaches a climax at the sight of the rickety old house. The house is large, but it has become run down and destroyed.\n\nEbenezer Balfour seems evil before he is even introduced, and his interest in David's father's death only makes the case against him worse. Stevenson makes no attempt to play on the reader's identification of the house with the man, as both are rotten. What makes Ebenezer interesting is the conflict that seems to rage within him. On the one hand, David is absolutely right. Ebenezer treats him like a thief, hates to have him in the house and lets him know, and clearly does not like David at all. Yet Ebenezer seems reluctant to let David leave once he has come to the house. Even after the reader has finished the story, Ebenezer's behavior makes little sense, since David is at this point not interested in claiming the decrepit House of Shaws and believes the family has no money.\n\nIt may be possible that the uncle is suffering from an inner conflict. On the one hand, he has fond memories of his brother, and he wants to do well by his brother's son. But on the other hand, he may feel vengeful toward David's father, and want to take out that vengeance upon David. He is probably also greedy and is worried that David will eventually try and claim his inheritance, which technically he has the right to do, as the eldest son of the eldest brother, though David does not know this; he thinks that Ebenezer is older than his late father. Whatever the reasons for his eccentric behavior, Ebenezer is clearly a villain, and this will not change by the end of the book."

Elie Wiesel's story does not focus solely on the negative images of the concentration camp. At certain\npoints in the memoir, he writes about events that gave him hope. Chronicle both the events and\nemotions that led Elie to wish for death and those that encouraged him to keep fighting to live.\n4. Wiesel describes people who give up hope during their time in the concentration camp. Find\nexamples of passages that illustrate the reasons why people choose to lose hope. Why are some people\nable to persevere and others not?\n5. The title of this novel alludes to one of the themes present in the memoir. Trace scenes of darkness\nand light.

The novel concludes with Elie looking into a mirror and stating that \"a corpse stared back\" at him.\nWhy does Wiesel end his memoir in this fashion? Given Wiesel's desire to \"keep memory alive\" of the\nHolocaust, how does the ending accomplish that feat? How does Wiesel seem to want readers to\nremember the Holocaust?\n7.

How do they see one another, and how true do you think their first impressions turn out to be? Use examples from the novel to support your opinion.\n\nThroughout Blue Asylum, attempted rescue is a recurring theme: Wendell and the lamb, Iris and the baby, Iris and Ambrose, Dr. Cowell and Iris. Do you think Iris had any influence over whether Ambrose lived or died? What lessons do you think she learned by the end of the story?\n\nDescribe Dr. Cowell's criteria for a \"sane\" wife. Then, compare Dr. Cowell's relationship with his wife, Mary, to what the doctor tells his women patients they should be to their husbands. How well does his own marriage hold up to his proposed ideal? How do these expectations, fairly representative of Americans in the late nineteenth century, influence the behavior of the women in this novel? How did it make you feel to learn some of the circumstances under which women were committed to asylums during this time period?\n\nThe United States found itself grappling with major shifts in the way people were measured toward the end of the nineteenth century: the abolition movement considered whether African slaves were as equally human as their white masters and what role they should play in society; the women's suffrage movement challenged men to see their wives, sisters, and daughters as intellectual equals who deserved a voice in government; the Civil War raised questions of states' rights versus the need for national identity via federal oversight, and pit American against fellow American based on little more than geography. In what ways does Blue Asylum address these issues? Identify the opinions expressed by various characters throughout, and imagine yourself in their shoes. Do you sympathize more strongly with one \"side\" than another? Why or why not?\n\nWhen Iris undergoes the water treatment, she tells Dr. Cowell, \"This is not treatment. This is torture\" (p. 83). He believes she is insane, and yet he can't let go of her accusations. He tells his wife, \"She called it torture! As though I were some kind of monster!\" Why do you think he is so disturbed by Iris's words, even as his wife reminds him that his patients have taken leave of their senses (and by extension, their opinions of his treatment aren't worth his regard)?\n\nOn page 115, Dr. Cowell finds himself feeling that he \"somehow returned to his youth, as though if he had turned to a mirror in mid-rant he'd see a man with a smooth, young face and a black beard with no hint of grey.\" Contrast this moment with his feeling expressed on page 47 that the island was taking his youth: \"Were he not trapped here, with the lunatics and his moody, attention-demanding wife and son, he'd have been able to remain a younger man.\" Do you feel any sympathy for Dr. Cowell? Why or why not?\n\nWendell is obsessed with the memory of his first childhood love, Penelope, a teenage inmate of the island who commits suicide before the opening of Blue Asylum. How does his unrequited love of Penelope affect Wendell's feelings for Iris? What first draws him to her? If his parents had been more involved in his life, do you think Wendell would have felt the same about the two women? Why or why not?\n\nIn what ways does Wendell identify with the inmates at Sanibel? How does he set himself apart from them?\n\nThe relationships in this novel are beautifully and authentically rendered - they are complicated and complex and rarely what they first appear to be. Discuss Dr. Cowell's relationship with his wife and child, and also with the inmates collectively. Do you think the Cowells love each other? Do you think Dr. Cowell loves his work more or less than his family, and why? Use examples from the novel to justify your opinion.\n\nLydia tells Iris that the latter's love for Ambrose means \"God still sees you not as a lunatic but as His child\" (p. 123). Identify the role that religion plays in the novel, including the characters' expressions of faith and religious feeling.\n\nWhen Iris first asks Wendell to help her escape from the island, he hesitates. With what is he struggling? Why does he first refuse to help Iris and Ambrose? Do you think he's right, or is it like Iris says, that he's just like his father? What ultimately changes his mind?\n\nIt's fairly clear early in the novel that Iris was unfairly committed to the asylum, and the social issue of people (women in particular) being sent off to asylums for simply being \"different\" shines through the narrative. But what about other inmates, like the man whose feet are too heavy, or the woman who intensely feels for every living creature? Who does and doesn't belong in the asylum? Where do you think one properly draws the line of madness?\n\nDr. Cowell changes his mind about Iris several times throughout the novel. What prompts him to consider for the first time that Iris might be telling the truth - that she is the victim of her husband's lies and base character? What changes his mind again?\n\nWhen he finally catches up with her, Dr. Cowell kindly tells Iris that she has made Ambrose \"as happy as he could have been\" (p.262). Do you agree or disagree? Was Iris wrong to take Ambrose with her? What elements factored into Ambrose's eventual breakdown during the war? Why do you think his discovery of Seth's true identity sent him over the edge? Do you think he ever could have recovered from his trauma?\n\nThe color blue plays a significant role in the novel. Identify the ways in which the author uses the color to evoke certain moods or meanings. What various meanings does the color have for each character?\n\nThis novel takes a look at the effects of betrayal on multiple levels. Iris and Lydia betray their husbands' and society's expectations of proper, married women. Dr. Cowell betrays his sacred oath to heal and never harm his patients. Wendell betrays his father's trust. And all of these are set against the backdrop of perhaps America's first and worst betrayal - the war in which she turned on herself, where brother fought against brother. Identify each instance of betrayal in the novel and discuss each character's motivations. Do you feel anyone is 100% justified in their actions? Why or why not?\n\nThough the main action of the story takes place in a setting so far removed it may as well be another country, the effects of the Civil War still cast a shadow on almost every aspect of the novel. From the restriction of goods to the posttraumatic stress haunting Ambrose, identify and discuss how the war influences the characters and events of Blue Asylum. Consider how this influence differs or is similar to the effects of war on Americans today.\n\nDiscuss the ending of the novel. Why do you think the author chose to end with Dr. Cowell back at the asylum, waiting for the mad old woman to come in for her appointment, and with the image of the woman dancing on the beach with her imagined husband? What is the significance of the birds' perspective of the scene?\n\nDiscussion questions written by Ally Peltier.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, this discussion guide is reprinted with the permission of Mariner"

How would the novel have been different had the author decided not to let the reader know the ending in advance? Could the story have been told in another way, as simply a remembrance for instance, and still had the same impact?\n\nAmanda lost her husband to cancer, and Adrienne lost Paul to an accident. Adrienne also lost her husband to a younger woman. Yet Adrienne found a way to heal, despite her losses, while Amanda has not. Is this difference a function of age and maturity, or simply the passage of time? If it's both, do you believe that Amanda will eventually fall in love again? Is that important to her?\n\nRodanthe is described in detail. How does the setting play a role in the story? Could this story have occurred in a larger city? Why or why not?\n\nThe novel deals with the themes of love and sacrifice. How did the major characters—Adrienne, Paul, Amanda and Robert Torrelson—sacrifice? How did love play a role?

Would you like to read a novel based on the love story between Robert and his wife?\n\nWhat do you make of the relationship that develops between Paul and Adrienne? Was it love at first sight? Do you think it's possible to have such an intense connection with someone you've only just met?\n\nMark plays a central role in letting us get to know Paul Flanner.

      "text": "Dear Jan- An Analysis\n\nReread the letter to Jan at the beginning of this chapter and note any passages you now find suspect; then read the analysis below:\n\nParagraph 2-Gavin sees friendship largely through American eyes, which is only natural. Take his response to the friend who asked Gavin to lie for him: while such behavior is probably not something many Americans (certainly not Gavin) would consider asking of a friend, it may be well within the bounds of friendship in some cultures.\n\nParagraph 3-Gavin also interprets the next incident, concerning his grandmother, through American eyes. It does not appear that Gavin's grandmother has loomed large in his life. Like many American families, the grandparents may have lived some distance away and not been actively involved in Gavin's everyday life. Hence, his grandmother's passing away does not have so strong an impact on him. In the case of Gavin's friend, however, it is possible that several generations of the family inhabit the same household, or live close by, and the bonds between grandson and grandparent are as close as those between mother and son. The death of one's grandmother would be a major event-and one that Gavin should have mentioned immediately to someone he considered his friend.\n\nParagraph 4-This same cultural difference is at work in paragraph 4. To Gavin, the death of a cousin, whom one might see once or twice a year at the holidays, hardly justifies four days off from work. But once again, the closely knit family structure in many cultures means that cousins might be as close to each other as brothers and sisters. Moreover, some cultures may expect more response at the time of a death than merely attending the funeral or sending a sympathy card.\n\nParagraph 5-Finally, regarding his girlfriend, Gavin doesn't make any mistakes here, as such, except to interpret all of her behaviors from his American point of view. It's true that in the United States, bringing your sister along on a date is unusual and might make one think this was something less than a date, but in Gavin's host country, for all he knows, it may be the norm. Accepting the invitation to go out may be a powerful message in that culture, more powerful than he realizes, and the significance Gavin assigns to holding hands and kissing may or may not be the same in the local culture."

After Doris cries, her mother tells her \"to act more grown up.\" DO you think that is good advice? Why or why not?

      "text": "Jane Eyre\n\nChapters 5–10\n\nSummary: Chapter 5\n\nFour days after meeting Mr. Brocklehurst, Jane\nboards the 6 a.m. coach and travels alone\nto Lowood. When she arrives at the school, the day is dark and rainy,\nand she is led through a grim building that will be her new home.\nThe following day, Jane is introduced to her classmates and learns\nthe daily routine, which keeps the girls occupied from before dawn\nuntil dinner. Miss Temple, the superintendent of the school, is\nvery kind, while one of Jane's teachers, Miss Scatcherd, is unpleasant,\nparticularly in her harsh treatment of a young student named Helen\nBurns. Jane and Helen befriend one another, and Jane learns from\nHelen that Lowood is a charity school maintained for female orphans, which\nmeans that the Reeds have paid nothing to put her there. She also\nlearns that Mr. Brocklehurst oversees every aspect of its operation:\neven Miss Temple must answer to him.\n\nSummary: Chapter 6\n\nOn Jane's second morning at Lowood, the girls are unable\nto wash, as the water in their pitchers is frozen. Jane quickly\nlearns that life at the school is harsh. The girls are underfed,\noverworked, and forced to sit still during seemingly endless sermons.\nStill, she takes comfort in her new friendship with Helen, who impresses\nJane with her expansive knowledge and her ability to patiently endure\neven the cruelest treatment from Miss Scatcherd. Helen tells Jane\nthat she practices a doctrine of Christian endurance, which means\nloving her enemies and accepting her privation. Jane disagrees strongly\nwith such meek tolerance of injustice, but Helen takes no heed of\nJane's arguments. Helen is self-critical only because she sometimes\nfails to live up to her ascetic standards: she believes that she\nis a poor student and chastises herself for daydreaming about her\nhome and family when she should be concentrating on her studies.\n\nSummary: Chapter 7\n\nFor most of Jane's first month at Lowood, Mr.\nBrocklehurst spends his time away from the school. When he returns,\nJane becomes quite nervous because she remembers his promise to\nher aunt, Mrs. Reed, to warn the school about Jane's supposed habit of\nlying. When Jane inadvertently drops her slate in Mr. Brocklehurst's\npresence, he is furious and tells her she is careless. He orders\nJane to stand on a stool while he tells the school that she is a\nliar, and he forbids the other students to speak to her for the\nrest of the day. Helen makes Jane's day of humiliation endurable\nby providing her friend with silent consolation—she covertly smiles at\nJane every time she passes by.\n\nSummary: Chapter 8\n\nFinally, at five o'clock, the students disperse,\nand Jane collapses to the floor. Deeply ashamed, she is certain\nthat her reputation at Lowood has been ruined, but Helen assures\nher that most of the girls felt more pity for Jane than revulsion\nat her alleged deceitfulness. Jane tells Miss Temple that she is\nnot a liar, and relates the story of her tormented childhood at\nGateshead. Miss Temple seems to believe Jane and writes to Mr. Lloyd\nrequesting confirmation of Jane's account of events. Miss Temple\noffers Jane and Helen tea and seed cake, endearing herself even\nfurther to Jane. When Mr. Lloyd's letter arrives and corroborates\nJane's story, Miss Temple publicly declares Jane to be innocent.\nRelieved and contented, Jane devotes herself to her studies. She\nexcels at drawing and makes progress in French.\n\nSummary: Chapter 9\n\nIn the spring, life at Lowood briefly seems\nhappier, but the damp forest dell in which the school resides is\na breeding-ground for typhus, and in the warm temperatures more\nthan half the girls fall ill with the disease. Jane remains healthy\nand spends her time playing outdoors with a new friend, Mary Ann\nWilson. Helen is sick, but not with typhus—Jane learns the horrific\nnews that her friend is dying of consumption. One evening, Jane\nsneaks into Miss Temple's room to see Helen one last time. Helen\npromises Jane that she feels little pain and is happy to be leaving\nthe world's suffering behind. Jane takes Helen into her arms, and\nthe girls fall asleep. During the night, Helen dies. Her grave is\noriginally unmarked, but fifteen years after her death, a gray marble tablet\nis placed over the spot (presumably by Jane), bearing the single\nword Resurgam, Latin for \"I shall rise again.\"\n\nSummary: Chapter 10\n\nAfter Mr. Brocklehurst's negligent treatment\nof the girls at Lowood is found to be one of the causes of the typhus\nepidemic, a new group of overseers is brought in to run the school.\nConditions improve dramatically for the young girls, and Jane excels\nin her studies for the next six years. After spending two more years at\nLowood as a teacher, Jane decides she is ready for a change, partly\nbecause Miss Temple gets married and leaves the school. She advertises\nin search of a post as a governess and accepts a position at a manor\ncalled Thornfield.\n\nBefore leaving, Jane receives a visit from\nBessie, who tells her what has happened at Gateshead since Jane\ndeparted for Lowood. Georgiana attempted to run away in secret with\na man named Lord Edwin Vere, but Eliza foiled the plan by revealing\nit to Mrs. Reed. John has fallen into a life of debauchery and dissolution.\nBessie also tells Jane that her father's brother, John Eyre, appeared\nat Gateshead seven years ago, looking for Jane. He did not have\nthe time to travel to Lowood and went away to Madeira (a Portuguese\nisland west of Morocco) in search of wealth. Jane and Bessie part\nways, Bessie returning to Gateshead, and Jane leaving for her new\nlife at Thornfield.\n\nAnalysis: Chapters 5–10\n\nThis section details Jane's experiences at Lowood, from\nher first day at the school to her final one some nine years later.\nJane's early years at Lowood prove to be a period of considerable\ntribulation, as she endures harsh conditions, cruel teachers, and\nthe tyranny of Mr. Brocklehurst. Moreover, the harsh conditions\nshe experiences as a student at Lowood show us that, despite Jane's\nintelligence, talent, and self-assurance, she is merely a burden\nin the eyes of society, because she is poor.\n\nThe most important thematic elements in this section are\nthe contrasting modes of religious thought represented by Mr. Brocklehurst and\nHelen Burns. Mr. Brocklehurst is a religious hypocrite, supporting\nhis own luxuriously wealthy family at the expense of the Lowood\nstudents and using his \"piety\" as an instrument of power over the\nlower-class girls at Lowood. He claims that he is purging his students\nof pride by subjecting them to various privations and humiliations:\nfor example, he orders that the naturally curly hair of one of Jane's\nclassmates be cut so as to lie straight.\n\nThe angelic Helen Burns and her doctrine of\nendurance represent a religious position that contrasts with Mr.\nBrocklehurst's. Utterly passive and accepting of any abjection,\nHelen embodies rather than preaches the Christian ideas of love\nand forgiveness. But neither form of religion satisfies Jane, who,\nbecause of her strong sensitivity to indignities and injustices,\nreviles Brocklehurst's shallow devotional displays and fails to\nunderstand Helen Burns's passivity. As Jane herself declares: \"when\nwe are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very\nhard . . . so as to teach the person who struck us never to do it\nagain\" (Chapter 6). Helen's doctrine of endurance\nand love is incompatible with Jane's belief in fairness and self-respect."

In what ways do the School's physical descriptions mirror actual events in the novel? Is Hoffman's description of the Chalk House foreboding for its inhabitants?\n\nThe line between past and present, living and dead, is often blurred in the story, creating a mystical, haunting atmosphere in which anything seems possible. How does Annie Howe \"live on\" at the Haddan School? What mystical or supernatural qualities did Annie Howe display while she was alive? Are there any ghosts in the novel, and if so, how do these ghosts from the past inform the state of things in the present?\n\nHow are Carlin Leander and August Pierce different from the other students at the Haddan School? What does each do in an effort to mask that difference? Do they succeed in this effort?\n\nAlmost every major character Carlin Leander, Abel Grey, Betsy Chase, Dr. Howe is forced at some point to deal with the death of someone close to them in THE RIVER KING. Carlin believes she is still in contact with Gus Pierce after his death, while Abel Grey cannot even talk of his brother's suicide at an early age. Which do you believe is the best way to deal with such loss? In your opinion, does Gus Pierce actually visit Carlin after his death and leave her gifts, or is there another explanation for this? What was your reaction when Gus Pierce \"appears\" in a photograph taken after his death?\n\nThroughout THE RIVER KING, Abel Grey and Betsy Chase undergo significant character changes, both internally and externally. Discuss.\n\nThanks to the deceitful actions of Abel Grey, Harry McKenna gets expelled from The Haddan School and loses his admission into Dartmouth, despite the fact that he didn't actually cheat on his exam. Is this fair? Does Harry McKenna deserve a more severe punishment for his role in Gus Pierce's death?\n\nHaddan is divided between the haves and the have-nots or, the Haddan School students and the Haddan town residents. In what ways does the symbolic distance between the two become greater over the course of the novel? In what ways does this distance become shorter?\n\nBoth Abe and Carlin Leander feel guilty for the death of someone close to them -- in Abe's case, his brother Frank, and in Carlin's case, Gus Pierce. In what other ways are the two characters alike, especially by the end of the novel?\n\nWhat effect does the revelation about Abe's true grandparents have on Abe? Does it help explain anything about his personality? Why might Abe be aptly dubbed \"The River King\"?\n\nDeath imagery abounds in the second half of the novel. The last paragraph, however, contains a more hopeful image of Carlin swimming in the river one late afternoon. This parting sequence provides a positive contrast to the mostly dark images found up to that point: \"the fish had grown used to her, and they swam along beside her, all the way home.\" Does this suggest the possibility of a brighter future for Carlin after the tragedy of Gus's death? Why do you think Carlin decides to swim in the river every day? Why, in your opinion, does Gus stop \"visiting\" her?\n\nUnless otherwise stated, this discussion guide is reprinted with the permission of Berkley"

What do they make them of?\nWhere do they come from? Why do we buy them just to sell them again?\nWhy are some crooked and others round? Who makes the holes in them, and\nwhy are so many of them blind?\"\n\nAny\nkind of a reply did not satisfy me, but I was soon forced to realize\nthat my elders knew little more than I myself about the pearls they\nhandled every day. It never ceased to seem strange to me that they did\nnot care, and that, like all their rivals in the trade, they never\ntormented themselves with idle questions but were content to\nconcentrate on the main chance and the profits to be made from the\nsmall bales of merchandise in which they dealt.\n\nSome\nof my curiosity was of the childish sort. I had vaguely heard that\nthere were \"real\" and \"imitation\" pearls, and in my own mind I had at\nlast worked out a satisfactory explana­tion of the difference between\nthem. If one paid for pearls with paper money, they were imitations,\nand if with silver, real. Frequently, however, my parents paid for a\nbatch with both paper and silver. Were these pearls real imitations?\nAnd again my father would sell real pearls to the Neapolitans for paper\nmoney, and I would think it very stupid of him.\n\nBut\non the whole my wonderings were legitimate enough, and in later years I\nhave often been heartily sorry that there was no one then to tell me\nstories of the oyster, laved by the ocean, deep in her marine groves of\nsea-pink, sea-anemone and coral, producing beauty in her breast.

      "text": "Developed in collaboration with Hill and Wang, the publisher of Night.\nOprah.com |\nJanuary 16, 2006\n\nReading Questions for Adult Discussions\n\n1. As Night begins, Eliezer is so moved by faith that he weeps when he prays. He is also searching for a deeper understanding of the mystical teachings of the Kabbalah. How does Eliezer's relationship with his faith and with God change as the book progresses?\n\n2. What literal and symbolic meanings does \"night\" have in the book?\n\n3. Early in the book, after Moishe the Beadle escapes his execution, no one, not even Eliezer, believes his tales (p. 7). Even when the Germans arrive in Sighet and move all the Jews into ghettos, the Jewish townspeople seem to ignore or suppress their fears. \"Most people thought that we would remain in the ghetto until the end of the war, until the arrival of the Red Army. Afterward everything would be as before\" (p. 12). What might be the reasons for the townspeople's widespread denial of the evidence facing them?\n\n4. Think of the kapos and the little blonde pipel who is hanged on page 64. Who are the bystanders? Who are the perpetrators? Who are the victims in Night? Do these roles sometimes overlap?\n\n5. At the end of Night, Wiesel writes: \"From the depths of the mirror, a corpse was contemplating me. The look in his eyes as he gazed at me has never left me\" (p. 115). What parts of Eliezer died during his captivity? What was born in their place?\n\n6. What scenes from Night do you remember most vividly? Have they made you look at the world or your family differently?\n\n7 How has Elie Wiesel fulfilled this purpose with this book? How does this statement make you feel about your place in the world?\n\nReading Questions for Families\nDeveloped in collaboration with Hill and Wang, the publisher of Night.\n\n1. In the first few pages of the book, Eliezer describes his family: He goes to school, he has three sisters, and his parents run a shop. How is his life similar to yours? How is it different?\n\n2. While Nazi terror is only a rumor or distant threat, Eliezer's father chooses to remain in Sighet. Once they are forced into the ghetto, Eliezer's father tells his older children that they can go live with their former maid in her village, but that he will stay in the ghetto with their mother and little sister. Eliezer says, \"Naturally, we refused to be separated\" (p. 20). Can you sympathize with their choice? What would it feel like for a family to have to choose to leave their home or separate from each other? Are there places in the world where families are faced with this decision now?\n\n3. As their world becomes increasingly cruel, what do the small moments of kindness, like an extra piece of bread or a shared prayer, mean to Eliezer and his father at Auschwitz?\n\n45. Early in the book, Eliezer says his father \"rarely displayed his feelings, not even within his family, and was more involved in the welfare of others than with that of his own kin\" (p. 4). When they begin the march to the small ghetto, Eliezer sees his father cry for the first time (p. 19). In what ways does the Holocaust change their relationship?\n\n6. Did reading Night make you look at the world and your family differently? How is the Holocaust similar to other atrocities you've studied in your history or social studies classes at school? How does this book make you feel about the world today?\n\nReading Questions for School Students\nDeveloped in collaboration with Hill and Wang, the publisher of Night.\n\n1. Talk about how the Nazis' program of persecution against the Jewish people in Sighet was carried out in gradual steps (p. 9). First, the German officers moved into private homes. They closed the synagogues. They arrested leaders of the Jewish community, forbade the Jews from owning any valuables under penalty of death, and forced them to wear the Star of David on their clothes. Jews no longer had the right to frequent restaurants, to travel by train, to attend synagogue, or to be on the streets after 6 o'clock in the evening. Then, they were forced to leave their homes and move into designated ghettos. And from the ghettos, the Jews were deported to the concentration camps. How do you think the Jews felt as the persecution escalated? Why do you think they followed the Germans' rules? Should they have stood up? Would you have reacted differently?\n\n2. On p. 23, Wiesel describes a scene familiar to anyone who has sat in the back of a movie theater: \"Freed of normal constraints, some of the young let go of their inhibitions and, under cover of darkness, caressed one another, without any thought of others, alone in the world.\" How does the shadow of Nazi terror transform the ordinary moments Wiesel describes?\n\n34 Think of conflicts and wars you've studied in your history or social studies classes at school. How does this statement make you feel about your place in the world?\n\n5. When Night begins, Eliezer is so moved by faith that he weeps when he prays—but he is only 12 years old. How does Eliezer's relationship with his faith and with God change as the book progresses? When the book ends, he is 16 years old. How would you describe him?\n\n6. At which points did you identify with Eliezer? Who did you identify with most in Night?"

Throughout Everything We Ever Wanted, Sylvie's house, Roderick, is as much a character in the novel as it is a setting. How do other homes in this story play a role? What is the significance of the empty houses on Spirit Street? Of Catherine's house in Maryland? Is it significant that Bronwyn and the members of Back to the Land don't have houses?\n\n2. Both Sylvie and Joanna have complex relationships with their mothers. In what ways do these relationships affect the two women's choices throughout the novel? Are they seeking approval from their mothers, or are their decisions a form of rebellion?\n\n3. Early on in the novel, we learn that Scott is not only adopted, but also black in a white family. How do these realities affect Scott's relationship with his family and his community? Do you see race as a factor that separates Scott?\n\n4. Many of the tensions in the book are caused by what is left unsaid. Charles doesn't tell Joanna about Bronwyn, James never told Sylvie the details of the bracelet, and Scott doesn't volunteer any information about the wrestling team. How do you think this story might have turned out differently if the characters had been more open? What other instances in the novel can you think of where events are propelled by characters' withholding the truth?\n\n5. James, Joanna, and Scott all feel disconnected from the looming shadow of the Bates family. How do their choices reflect this discomfort? Do you see this lack of acceptance by the Bates family as real, or are these three characters' insecurities largely of their own making?\n\n6. This novel often seems built on the conflicts that arise from oppositions: wealthy versus middle class, the suburbs versus the city, adopted versus biological. What other oppositions can you think of? How are they significant to the story?\n\n7. Much of the central drama revolves around Swithin, the elite school that Sylvie's grandfather rebuilt, even though all of the Bates-McAllisters have long since graduated. Why do you think the school still plays such a big role in the characters' lives? What is the significance of Sylvie's final decision regarding the Swithin board?\n\n8. Sylvie's grandfather, Charlie Roderick Bates, is one of the most important figures in the Bates-McAllister family's life, yet no central character besides Sylvie ever knew him. In what ways does Charlie continue to influence the Bates-McAllister family?\n\n9. On pages 208–209, Joanna tells Scott about her childhood excitement and eventual disappointment regarding the arrival of the Kimberton Fair. Why do you think Joanna shares this story? How would you relate this story to the rest of the novel?\n\nAbout the Author\n\nSara Shepard graduated from New York University and has an MFA in Creative Writing from Brooklyn College.

It's no longer than\nthrough the village and you\ncan take care of yourself in the\ndark, I reckon.\"\n\"I reckon so, Jane,\" he answer\ned. \"Good night, my lass.\" He\npressed his hat down on his head\nand started out along the road.\nIn a moment the darkness had\nswallowed him up he was gone\neven while she heard his foot\nsteps in the mud.\nSuddenly she staggered back as\na tremulous thought blanched her\ncheek and set her heart beating\nfuriously.\nThe bridge! The bridge was\nup. He did not know. He would\nwalk confidently there where the\nfirm girders ran, offering their\ntreacherous support, and he\nwould walk into nothingness.\nAnd those currents! the cur\nrents in her own heart ! She who\nhad risked all might win all; her\nman, her child, her home, for this\none worthless life.\nThe impulse to run after him\nmastered her, but suddenly a low\nwail from the room behind re\ncalled her.

      "text": "Pride and Prejudice Chapter 3 Summary\n\nAlthough the women of the house question Mr. Bennet repeatedly to give them more information regarding Mr. Bingley, Mr. Bennet refuses to satisfy their curiosity.\n\nThe women must resort to hearing the details from their neighbor, Lady Lucas, who reports that Mr. Bingley is handsome, agreeable, and loves dancing. Jackpot.\n\nIn accord with the societal norms of the day, Mr. Bingley returns Mr. Bennet's visit. The two men sit in the library for about ten minutes, and we learn that, although Mr. Bingley had hoped to see the young ladies (the grapevine has informed him that they're beautiful), he has to make do with their father.\n\nThe Bennet girls manage to catch a sight of Mr. Bingley.\n\nFollowing his visit, the Bennets send Mr. Bingley an invitation to dinner.\n\nMr. Bingley sends his regrets, saying that he has to go into town. This sends Mrs. Bennet into a flurry of: Why is he going into town? Will he always be traveling? Why doesn't he want to stay at Netherfield?\n\nLady Lucas tells Mrs. Bennet that Mr. Bingley's reason for going into town is to bring back lots of guests for the upcoming public ball.\n\nIt turns out that Mr. Bingley brought only four people back from town: his two sisters (one of whom is married), his brother-in-law, and a young man.\n\nOoh, a young man.\n\nFirst, though, we have to get a description of Mr. Bingley and company.\n\nMr. Bingley is good looking and easygoing.\n\nHis sisters are fashionable, elitist snobs.\n\nThe brother-in-law is named Mr. Hurst, and he's a gentleman.\n\nMoving on to the young man: His name is Mr. Darcy. More importantly, he has an income of ten thousand a year (which is a ton of money).\n\nOoh, what a good-looking, nice, wonderful man, everyone says.\n\nA little while later, everyone's all, \"Ooh, what a jerk!\"\n\nSo what happened?\n\nWell, it turns out that Mr. Darcy is very proud. It's clear that he considers himself better than everyone else at the ball. In all fairness, he's out in the boonies of England, which makes him the equivalent of a Manhattan socialite at a square dance.\n\nAlthough Mr. Bingley is also, figuratively speaking, a Manhattan socialite at a rural square dance, he delves right into the party. He talks to everyone, dances all night, and expresses disappointment that the ball ends early. Solution: He'll throw his own ball!\n\nMeanwhile, the locals can't stand Mr. Darcy. He dances only twice (once with each of Mr. Bingley's sisters), doesn't talk to anyone, and stalks around the drawing room, disapproving of everything.\n\nDue to an unequal male/female ratio, Elizabeth has to sit out two of the dances. As she's sitting down and minding her own business, she overhears a conversation between Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy.\n\nThe conversation goes something like this:\n\nMr. Bingley: Hey, Darcy, there are some really gorgeous girls here. Why don't you go dance with some of them?\n\nMr. Bingley points out that Jane's sister (Elizabeth) is available and also good-looking. (Yes, and sitting so close that she can hear every word the men are saying.)\n\nMr. Darcy looks at Elizabeth and gives her the old once-over; he then turns to Mr. Bingley and delivers one of literature's most famous put-downs: \"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me.\"\n\nElizabeth laughs it off and tells the story to all her friends.\n\nThe entire Bennet family has a great time at the ball, and it's clear that Mr. Bingley is interested in Jane.\n\nWhen Mrs. Bennet and her daughters return home, they find Mr. Bennet still awake.\n\nMrs. Bennet immediately launches into a play-by-play of Mr. Bingley's movements and all his dance partners, until Mr. Bennet finally begs her to be quiet. (He does this in a rather roundabout fashion, i.e., expressing his wish that Mr. Bingley hadn't danced so much.)\n\nAfter trying to talk about the ladies' fashions at the ball and being rebuffed again, Mrs. Bennet finally settles on the topic of Mr. Darcy's rudeness."

      "text": "Billings Senior High School\n\nBillings, Montana\n\nDiscussion Director: Your job is to develop a list of questions that your group can discuss about this part of the novel. Your questions should be ones that require thought and get everyone talking and sharing their opinions and reactions. The best discussion questions come from your own thoughts, feelings, and concerns…do not use questions that can be answered with yes/no or just a factual detail. You will have a minimum of 5 questions.\n\nYour job for today's discussion:\n\nPose each of your questions to the group for discussion.\n\nAsk for group members' comments/questions on this section of the book\n\nBe sure members are all participating in discussions.\n\nTurn in questions with group work.\n\nFill out group record sheer (w/ input from members).\n\nAssign roles for the next meeting.\n\nBe sure to meet with Miss K. before \"closing up shop\" with your group today.\n\nSample Question Starters:\n\nWhat did you think about……..? (name a specific event, action, etc)\n\nWhy do you think that………?\n\nWhat do you think will happen next/if……..? (ask for predictions of events and characters' actions)\n\nWhat is happening at the part when……..?\n\nWhat do you think ___________ (event/incident) means?\n\n***It is OKAY to ask questions that may not have specific answers…YAY, You! This is called analyzing a text!\n\nLiterary Luminary\n\nLiterary Luminary: It is your job to read aloud parts of the story to your group in order to help your group members remember some interesting, powerful, puzzling, or important sections of the text. You decide which passages or paraphrases are worth reading aloud, and justify your reasons for selecting them. Be sure to write down the page numbers of your passages, a brief summary of the quotes (or the paraphrases of the passages), and your reasons for selecting them. You will have a minimum of three passages.\n\nYour job for today's discussion:\n\nBefore class, locate at least 3 passages for discussion. Jot down your ideas, reactions, and thoughts for each quote before you meet with your group—these will provide a springboard for your group's discussion.\n\nInitiate discussions around your quotes. Be sure everyone has their book open to the page you are on—read your quotes aloud.\n\nExplain to your group why you chose that passage and ask for comments. Do they agree? Disagree? Did they have a different reaction?\n\nProvide feedback on what your group discussed with your passages. Add ideas to your notes from reading.\n\nTurn in your passages with group work today.\n\nSome reasons for choosing passages to share:\n\nPivotal Events\n\nInformative/Important (maybe a clue? is it foreshadowing?)\n\nDescriptive (figurative language, strong verbs, flow, cool-sounding)\n\nSurprising/Startling\n\nScary/Demented\n\nThought-Provoking\n\nFunny\n\nControversial (different group members may have different reactions)\n\nConfusing (Did people \"get\" this?)\n\nPersonally meaningful\n\nCharacter Captain\n\nCharacter Captain: Your job is to share observations you have about the characters in the book. Choose a variety of adjectives (at least 5) to describe 3-5 characters in your book. Support your adjectives with an example taken from your reading assignment. Be specific in your descriptions of traits (i.e.: instead of \"nice\" try \"thoughtful\" or \"generous\"). The more specific you are, the better your discussions will be with your group.\n\nYour job for today's discussion:\n\nBefore class, prepare your list of characters and adjectives.\n\nLook for passages that specifically illustrate your character descriptions.\n\nAsk for feedback from other group members. Add ideas to your list.\n\nTurn in character list at the end of the period.\n\nSample Character Ideas—Look at the following:\n\nCharacter thoughts\n\nHow other characters interact with him/her\n\nClothing/Style\n\nReactions to events/characters/situations\n\nInteractions with others\n\nWhat character says\n\nChoices a character makes\n\nVocabulary Visionary\n\nVocabulary Visionary: You will be looking for new vocabulary throughout the section that you read. Your job is to come to class with at least 5 new vocabulary words, supply the sentence from the text, and a definition for the word (in the correct context).\n\nYour job for today's discussion:\n\nBring at least 5 new vocabulary words to share with your group.\n\nHave the sentence for each word (with the page number), as well as a contextually correct definition.\n\nShare words with your group—read sentences out loud.\n\nTurn in words, definitions, and sentences with group work.\n\nIdeas for choosing words—choose words that are:\n\nImportant\n\nUnfamiliar\n\nDifferent\n\nPuzzling\n\nFunny (funny sounding)\n\nUsed in an unusual way\n\nInteresting\n\nEnd-of-Book Assignments\n\nYour entire group is responsible for the following. You can divide and conquer as you see fit...and in the end, you need just one copy for all. You will have a total of 15 entries for all...\n\nCharacter Descriptions: The character descriptions are a one-paragraph explanation of a character. In the end you will have between five and eight character descriptions. You will be assessed on the content, word choice, fluency, and conventions of your descriptions.\n\n(Example: From Shakespeare's Othello CliffsNotes... Othello A Moor (an African), a general in the defense forces of the city state of Venice. His successful profession brings him high status in Venice, but his foreign origins and color separate him from those with whom he lives and works. He is a military man, with a reputation for courage in battle and good judgment in military matters. Othello falls in love and marries Desdemona, but during the campaign against the Turks, Othello is tricked by Iago into believing that his wife has been unfaithful with his lieutenant, Cassio. Iago works on Othello's personal and social insecurity until Othello believes the combination of Iago's lies and flimsy circumstantial evidence. Inflamed with jealousy, he smothers Desdemona in her bed, only to find out too late that he has been misled and has killed the woman who loved him faithfully. In despair, he kills himself.\n\nKey Quotes: For the key quotes, you will choose three and five importantpassages from the text. You will need to write them down (directly...not just a summary for this one) and then write a paragraph explaining why each passage is key. The passages you choose should be strong enough to evoke emotion, show an important event, or describe a character in a memorable way. You will be assessed on the quality of your paragraph (content, organization, voice, conventions).\n\nReview Questions and Answers: The review questions and answers are basically like essay questions for your text. They should be questions that are analytic in nature, not comprehension questions. For your group, you will have between three and five questions and answers. Each question you pose should be answered in the form of an RSVP essay. You will be assessed on both the quality of questions and the clarity, content, organization, conventions of your answers.\n\nReferences: alphabetic list of sources used for papers (author bio, book context, analysis--if used...the book itself is also a source!) in correct MLA format. Every group will have a references list...this will be graded on use of proper format. Questions on format? Go to \"The Owl\" at Purdue University for help.\n\nEach group member is responsible for one of the following (but each group turns in only one of each). These are to be in MLA format (typed, double-spaced, MLA heading, header with last name and page number, 12-point Times New Roman font...) and are roughly 1 1/2-3 pages in length.\n\nAuthor Biography: This is like an overview of the author. While it may encompass some of the information from the book you read (since they are biographies and autobiographies--for the most part...sorry, Alive groups, your book is not...), but could also include information outside of just the book content. Assessment will be based on the 6-traits rubric (x 1.5)\n\nBook Context: This assignment is the historical context of what is happening in your book. You don't have to give an entire history, focus on one key part. For example, if you were to complete this task for Because of Romek, you might look at JUST life in Auschwitz or JUST life in the Tarnow ghetto.\n\nBook Synopsis: This paper is, in essence, a summary of the book. It gives more than a paragraph description of the book, but is less than each of the chapter summaries combined.\n\nCharacter Analysis: For this paper, look at the main character and prove something about him/her. This is similar to what you completed with Romek. One idea might be to look at the circumstances the person had to overcome throughout his/her life. Perhaps it is showing how the experiences that person has been through shape his/her life.\n\nThematic Analysis: The thematic analysis is a look at a theme that runs throughout a book. So, think about why the author would write the book--what is the purpose? It may be to give others hope, to show the horrors of a particular time/place..."

Songs floated through me and stayed. Lullabies, mixed with the soft smells of bedtime, slept with me. Harmonies made me smile. It's like I've always had a painted musical soundtrack playing background to my life. I can almost hear colors and smell images when music is played. Mom loves classical. Big, booming Beethoven symphonies blast from her CD player all day long. Those pieces always seem to be bright blue as I listen, and they smell like fresh paint. Dad is partial to jazz, and every chance he gets he winks at me, takes out Mom's Mozart disc, then pops in a CD of Miles Davis or Woody Herman. Jazz to me sounds brown and tan and it smells like wet dirt.\"\n\nWrite a descriptive paper that uses sensory imagery. Describe a specific scene and bring it to life with your words. Use vivid verbs and powerful adjectives and adverbs as you write. Use as many of the senses as you can. (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste)\n\nNARRATIVE PAPER\n\"From the very beginning Mrs. Valencia gave me no sympathy. Instead of sitting me in the special little chair my parents had bought for me, she plopped me on my back in the middle of the floor on a large, soft quilt. The first time she did that, I looked up at her like she was crazy. I cried. I screeched. She ignored me, walked away, and flipped on her CD player. Loud marching band music blared through the room. I liked it. Then she came back and put my favorite toy--a rubber monkey—a few inches from my head. I wanted that monkey.\n\nMrs. V sat down on the quilt. \"Turn over, Melody,\" she said quietly. Sometimes she can make her voice really soft. I was so shocked I stopped yelling. I couldn't turn over. Didn't she know that? Was she nuts? She wiped my nose with a tissue. \"You can turn yourself over, Melody. I know you understand every word I say to you, and I know you can do this. Now roll!\" Actually, I'd never bothered to try very hard to roll anywhere. I'd fallen off the sofa a couple of times, and it hurt, so I usually just waited for Mom or Dad to move me to a comfortable position.\n\n\"Look at how you're laying. You're already on your side--halfway there. Use all that screaming and hollering energy you've got to take you to another position. Toss your right arm over and concentrate!\" So I did. I strained. I reached. I tried so hard I farted! Mrs. V cracked up. But slowly, slowly, I felt my body rolling to the right. And them unbelievably, plop! I was on my stomach. I was so proud of myself--I screeched.\n\n\"I told you so,\" Mrs. V said, victory in her voice. \"Now go get that monkey!\"\n\nWrite a narrative paper from the point of view of Mrs. V. Tell what kind of life she must have lived to become the person that she is. Discuss her hidden strengths and her attitude toward Melody.\n\nEXPOSITORY PAPER\n(a) \" I had to blink a little to figure it all out. Everything you see on TV is fake. I saw the place where they film the news. When I watch it on television at home, it looks like the reporters are sitting in front of a huge window that shows all of downtown. But it's just a painting, and it's pretty small. So is the desk where the reporters sit. It seems so much bigger from home.\n\nI recognized a couple of the reporters who I watched every day. I couldn't believe how skinny the morning lady was. On TV she looks normal sized. I'm going to look like a huge balloon when the cameras show me.\n\nSpeaking of cameras, they were huge—like giant black mechanical space beings on wheels. Guys with headphones and women with clipboards ran around checking stuff. The back part of the studio was dark, but the place where the contest would take place was lit brightly. I could see the place where the teams would stand, and the big red buttons they would push for the answers.\n\nWrite an expository (explanatory) paper that describes a room at your school, a building, or any other specialized room such as a computer lab. Tell what is unusual or unexpected about the place. Use as many specifics as possible.\n\nPERSUASIVE PAPER\n\" Fifth grade is probably pretty rocky for lots of kids. Homework. Never being quite sure if you're cool enough. Clothes. Video games. Parents. Wanting to play with toys, and wanting to be grown up all at the same time. Underarm odor. I guess I have all that, plus about a million different layers of other stuff to deal with. Making people understand what I want. Worrying about what I look like. Fitting in. Will a boy ever like me? Maybe I'm not so different from everyone else after all.\n\nIt's like somebody gave me a puzzle, but I don't have the box with the picture on it. So I don't know what the final thing is supposed to look like. I'm not even sure if I have all the pieces. That's probably not a good comparison, since I couldn't put a puzzle together if I wanted to. Even though I usually know the answers to most of the questions at school, lots of stuff still puzzles me.\"\n\nWrite a persuasive paper that discusses one of the following options: (a) \"Melody is just like every other fifth grader.\" (b) \"Melody is very different from the rest of the world.\" (c) Melody is unique in that she is very much like other children, yet not like them at all.\" Be sure to use specifics to support your answer.\n\nPOINT OF VIEW PAPER\n\" The windows were almost completely fogged up, and got even worse as I continued to act like I'd been possessed by demons. Mom looked at me as if I had lost my mind. She screamed at me, \"Stop it! Are you crazy?\"\n\nBut I wouldn't stop. I couldn't. I banged on the car window, pulled Mom's shirt, hit her head. I pinched her, or at least tried to.\n\n\"I can't take any more, Melody!\" Mom screamed over the thunder. \"I hate it when you get like this. You've got to learn to control yourself! Now QUIT!\" She put her hand on the keys to start the car.\n\nI screamed, reached over, and tried to pull the keys from her. I scratched the back of Mom's hand.\n\nShe smacked me on the leg. She'd never raised a hand to me before. Never. I still didn't stop screaming and kicking and jerking. I had to tell her. I had to tell her that Penny was out there! Never had I wanted words more. I was going out of my mind.\"\n\nRead the passage above and explain how the point of view of the character who makes the observation influences the description.

Penny really was a perfect kid. After just a few months she was sleeping through the night and smiling through each day. She sat up exactly when babies are supposed to do that, rolled over right on schedule, and crawled on cue. Amazing. And it seemed so easy! Sure, she fell on her face a few times, but once she got it, she was off! Penny zoomed like a little wind-up toy. She learned the toilet was fun to splash in, and that lamps will fall if you grab the cord. She learned that Golden Retrievers are not ponies, peas taste funny, dead flies on the floor are a no-no, but candy is really good. She laughed all the time.

Surrounded by opulence and corruption, she befriends her glamorous and seductive sister-in-law, Lucrezia Borgia, whose jealousy is as legendary as her beauty. Some say she has poisoned her rivals, particularly those to whom her handsome brother Cesare has given his heart. So when Sancha falls under Cesare's irresistible spell, she must hide her secret or lose her life. Caught in their sinister web, she must summon her courage and use her cunning to outwit them at their own game. The Borgia Bride is based on a true figure and weaves real history and fiction to create a tale seething with conspiracy, sexual intrigue, and drama.\n\n1. How do you feel about Sancha's childhood experiences shaping her personality as an adult? What parts of her temperament do you think were inherited, and which shaped by experience?\n\n2. What common traits does Sancha share with her brother Alfonso? What do you believe accounts for the difference in their personalities? Do you believe the fact that Sancha was older made a difference? Do you see Alfonso's goodness as a weakness? Which character do you admire more?\n\n3. How do you feel about Jofre as a character when he first appears in the novel?

Outside of their shared affection for Alfonso, what was the basis for this bond?\n\n8. Who was more in control of the House of Borgia's politics: Pope Alexander or Cesare? Do you believe that Alexander feared Cesare, or that the two schemed together, with Alexander often playing the innocent?\n\n9. When faced with the choice between her husband and her son, could Lucrezia have acted differently? Discuss the consequences of her actions.\n\n10. Do you think Cesare's slaughter of the condottiere of the noble houses of Italy was a wise or unwise political move?\n\n11. Do you believe the Pope and Cesare could have succeeded in their quest to unite all of Italy under their rule? Why or why not? Do you feel Pope Alexander was a shrewd politican, or did he often alienate useful factions?\n\n12. If Sancha had married Cesare, could she have influenced him for good?

      "text": "Book Group Discussion Questions\n\nFrom the publisher (HarperCollins):\n\nGregory Maguire fashioned the name of Elphaba (pronounced\nEL-fa-ba) from the initials of the author of The Wizard of Oz, Lyman\nFrank Baum-L-F-B-Elphaba. Wicked derives some of its power from the\npopularity of its source material. Does meeting up with familiar\ncharacters and famous fictional situations require more patience and\neffort on the part of the reader, or less?\n\nWicked flips the Oz we knew from the classic movie on its head.\nTo what extent does Maguire's vision of Oz contradict the Oz we're\nfamiliar with? How have Dorothy and the other characters changed or\nremained the same? Has Wicked changed your conception of the original?\nIf so, how?\n\nThe novel opens with a scene in which the Witch overhears\nDorothy, the Lion, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Woodman gossiping about\nher. She's \"possessed by demons,\" they say. \"She was castrated at birth\n. . . she was an abused child . . . she's a dangerous tyrant.\" How does\nthis scene set the stage for the story, and what themes does it\nintroduce?\n\nWhat is the significance of Elphaba's green skin? What are the\nrewards of being so different, and what are the drawbacks? In Oz -- and\nin the real world -- what are the meanings associated with the color\ngreen, and are any of them pertinent to Elphaba's character?\n\nOne of Wicked's key themes is the nature and roots of evil. What\nare the theories that Maguire sets out? Is Elphaba evil? Are her actions\nevil? Is there such a thing as evil, a free-floating power in the\nuniverse like time or gravity? Or is evil an attribute of the actions of\nhuman beings? (Hint: Turn to pages 231 and 370 for scenes that will draw\nyou into the conversation.)\n\nDiscuss the importance of the Clock of the Time Dragon. Does the\nClock simply reflect events, or does it shape them? Why is it\nsignificant that Elphaba was born inside it? That Turtle Heart was\nkilled by it? What revelations does it offer to Elphaba and the reader\nwhen she reencounters it at the end of the book?\n\nThe first section of the book ends powerfully but enigmatically\nwhen the young Elphaba is discovered under the dock, cradled in the paws\nof a magical beast as if sitting on a throne. How do you interpret this\nscene, and what do you think it foretells, if anything?\n\nThe place of Animals in society is an important theme in Wicked.\nWhy does Elphaba make it her mission to fight for Animal rights? How\nelse does social class define Oz, and why?\n\n[Galinda] reasoned that because she was beautiful she was\nsignificant, though what she signified, and to whom, was not clear to\nher yet\" (page 65). Discuss the transformation of Galinda, shallow Shiz\nstudent, to Glinda the Good Witch. How does she change -- and by how\nmuch? What is her eventual \"significance,\" both in Oz and in the story?\n\nDiscuss the ways in which Elphaba's determination and\nwillfulness lend purpose and order to her life, and the cost of being\nsuch a strong character. Elphaba isn't the only strong female character\nin Wicked. How do Nessarose, Glinda, and Sarima deal with the issues of\npower and control? Where do each of them draw strength from? Is the\nworld of Maguire's Oz more or less patriarchal than millennial\nAmerica?\n\nWicked is an epic story, built along the lines of a\nShakespearean or Greek tragedy, in which the seeds of Elphaba's destiny\nare all sown early in the novel. How much of Elphaba's career is\npredestined, and how much choice does she have? Do you think that she\nwas no more than a puppet of the Wizard or Madame Morrible, as she\nfears?\n\nEarly in their unlikely friendship, Galinda catches a glimpse of\nElphaba and thinks she \"looked like something between an animal and an\nAnimal, like something more than life but not quite Life\" (pages 78-79).\nDiscuss the dual, and sometimes contradictory, nature of Elphaba's\ncharacter. Why does Elphaba insist that she doesn't have a soul?\n\nWho or what is Yackle? Where does she appear in the story, and\nwhat role does she serve in Elphaba's life? Is she good or evil -- both\nor neither?\n\nWas Elphaba's story essentially a tragedy or a triumph? Did she\nfail at every major endeavor, and thus fail at life; or because she\nrefused to give up or change to suit the opinions of others, was her\nlife a success? Is there a possibility that Dorothy's \"baptismal splash\"\nredeemed Elphaba on her deathbed, or was this the final indignity in a\nlife of miserable mistakes?"

      "text": "Lay down beneath the train tracks as a locomotive passed over him. He won two roubles for this feat. The other boys ran away when the train came, and were afraid that Kolya had been smothered and died.\nNowhere in the novel is there mention of a Ramos Kuzhov.\nIt was Pheidippides who ran 26 miles from Marathon to Athens. He died afterward.\n\nLatin. Kolya believes that the classical languages \"stupefy the intellect.\" He's first in his class in Latin, but he still thinks it beneath him. He loves studying mathematics and natural science the most. Kolya's not too fond of history, but he doesn't think it's nearly as insignificant as the classical languages.\n\nWhat was the name Kolya asked a young man if he knew, that caused so much commotion?\n\nSabaneyev. Kolya walked away brusquely as if it was imbecilic to not know who Sabaneyev was. The young man had impudently stopped Kolya to ask him if he was at his pranks again. Kolya tells him that he's on Trifon Nikitich's business, and the young man doesn't need to know about it.\nAs Kolya leaves, the young man asks the people around him who Sabayenev is. One lady suggests that it must be a man who worked for the Kuzmitchovs, but another contradicts this statement. Somebody says it must be Alexey Ivanitch Tchizhov.\nKolya doesn't really know a Sabaneyev.\n\nHow did Ilyusha make the dog run away, which caused the former much remorse?\n\nHe threw the dog a loaf of bread with a pin stuck in it.. Smerdyakov taught Ilyusha this nasty trick. Toss a bread with a pin in it to a dog; it'll eat anything. Ilyusha saw Zhutchka eat his bread and run away. It frightened him so much, and he was very remorseful. His parents bought him a mastiff pup, but it didn't comfort him.\nFinally, Kolya, a former friend of his, brought his dog Perezvon to his house. As it turned out, Perezvon was really Zhutchka. Kolya had taught it a few tricks, and Ilyusha was grateful to see Zhutchka again. The dog must've spit out the bread, because it certainly would've died with the pin in its belly.\n\nWhat is the name of the dog Ilyusha wishes to see again and feels remorse for causing pain to?\n\nZhutchka. Zhutchka is a \"rough-haired dog, of medium size,\" whose coat is lilac-grey. He's blind in his right eye, and his left ear was torn.\nPerezvon is the name Kolya gives Zhutchka so that he can surprise Ilyusha.\n\nWhat is the answer to the question Kolya's history teacher couldn't answer?\n\nTeucer, Dardanus, Ilius, and Tros. A boy, Kartashov, looked in Smaragdov and found the answer. However, when he told the rest of his schoolfellows, Kolya asked him, \"In what sense did they found it? What is meant by founding a city or state? What do they do? Did they go and each lay a brick, do you suppose?\"\nBelgrade is the capital of Yugoslavia.\nMary is the Wife of William of Orange, who ruled England under a constitutional monarchy after the Glorious Revolution in 1688.\nNo one knows how Alexander the Great died, but poisoning is one theory.\n\nWhat was the question Kolya asked his history teacher that the latter couldn't answer?\n\nWho founded Troy?. Dardanelov was the teacher who couldn't answer the question about the founders of Troy. Kolya Krassotkin had read it in Smaragdov, a historian whose books his dead father had owned"
