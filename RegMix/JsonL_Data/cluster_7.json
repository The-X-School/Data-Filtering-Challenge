If your mission is to find a tree for your landscape, you'll encounter a plethora of trees from which to select and a multitude of questions — which to take home? How to select a tree?\nA myriad of items to consider flash through your head, but there are three critical considerations on the suitability of trees in our area: the tree's cold-hardiness and water requirements, and the acidity (alkalinity for West Texas) of the soil into which the tree will be planted.\n\nDear Neil: Can a persimmon tree be pruned to a more desirable shape? Mine bears an abundance of fruit, but the upper branches are getting beyond reach from a ladder.\nAnswer: You shouldn't really try to reshape a persimmon tree to fit your harvesting needs. While you can do that with peaches and plums if you start when they're brand new trees, persimmons don't lend themselves nearly as well to pruning to direct their growth. It would just try to regrow to its former shape and size."

Most\nfruit trees are trained to a central leader system,\nwhile peach, plum, and apricot trees are normally\ntrained to an open center or open vase system. The\ncentral leader system consists of a central trunk Figure 32. A heading back cut is made to a young\naround which scaffolds (primary side branches) apple tree at planting.\nMidwest Home Fruit Production Guide 27\nBare‑root trees should be cut or headed back to 24\nto 28 inches above ground at planting . All broken\nor damaged limbs should be removed . This pro‑\ncedure allows branches to form at desired heights,\nimproves the strength of the tree, and provides a\nbalance between the top and the roots .\nAs the branches reach four to six inches in length,\nspring‑loaded clothes pins can be used to form\nproper crotch angles . Crotch angles refer to the\nbranch angles between the central leader and the\nside shoot . Typically, side shoots (laterals) should\nbe spread out to form an angle of 60 to 70 degrees\nbetween the leader and the side shoot . Branches\nwithout a wide branch angle are overly vigorous\nand have a weak point of attachment to the central\nleader . These branches frequently break under a Figure 34.

      "text": "An EDIBLE WOODLAND SUSTAINABLE GARDEN\n\nGo to this web site; \nI was thrilled to read this article which clearly states what the average person can plant that can be eaten in a partially shaded woodland garden.\n\nThis is a copy of the article, just in case the writer changes the site.\n\nWoodland Garden Plants\n\nThe present-day cultivation of large areas of single annual crops such as wheat might seem, on the surface, to be a very productive and efficient use of land (average wheat yields this century have increased more than three-fold to over 3 tons per acre). When other factors are taken into account, however, it can be argued that this is a very unproductive and unsustainable use of the land.\n\nA woodland, on the other hand, might seem to be a very unproductive area for human food (unless you happen to like eating acorns). By choosing the right species, however, a woodland garden can produce a larger crop of food than the same area of wheat, will require far less work to manage it and will be able to be sustainably harvested without harm to the soil or the environment in general.\n\nI do not intend to go into any more details of the pros and cons of annuals versus perennials here. If you would like more information on this subject then please see our leaflet Why Perennials.\n\nOne of the main reasons why a woodland garden can be so productive is that such a wide range of plants can be grown together, making much more efficient use of the land. The greater the diversity of plants being grown together then the greater the overall growth of plant matter there is. Thus you can have tall growing trees with smaller trees and shrubs that can tolerate some shade growing under them. Climbing plants can make their own ways up the trees and shrubs towards the light, whilst shade-tolerant herbaceous plants and bulbs can grow on the woodland floor.\n\nThis leaflet is going to look at some of the many plants that can be grown as part of a woodland garden. A wide range of edible plants are discussed together with brief details of their cultivation needs. Although other details of the plants uses are not mentioned here, it should be realised that woodlands can also provide a wide range of non-food uses. The most obvious is their wood, of course, but they can also provide fibres for cloth and paper, oils, medicines and a whole host of other commodities.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, the plants detailed below are fairly tolerant of most soil types so long as they are not water-logged. The larger trees and climbers will obviously be able to make their own way up into the sun, the smaller plants will grow well in the dappled shade of the trees unless the text says otherwise.\n\nTrees and Shrubs.\nAmelanchier alnifolia. The Juneberry is a small shrub, growing about 6ft tall and suckering to form a thicket. The fruit ripens in early July and looks somewhat like a blackcurrant. It is juicy and has a delicious flavour with a hint of apple in the taste. For best yields grow it on the sunny edge of the woodland. Birds absolutely adore this fruit so either grow lots so that there will be some for you, or put a net over the plants just before the fruit is ripe.\n\nAraucaria araucana. The monkey puzzle is a large tree that has the potential of being the highest yielding nut crop that can be grown in Britain. A staple food of the native Indians in areas of Chile, the nuts are about the size of an almond and have a very pleasant mild flavour. The main problems with the tree are that it is very slow-growing (it takes about 40 years before it bears its first crop of seeds) and you need to grow both male and female plants in order to obtain the seed. Unfortunately there is no way of telling the sexes apart until they flower and so you need to grow at least 5 trees in order to be fairly sure that you have a mix of the sexes. When grown for its seed, this tree is not really suitable for small areas of land, but if you have the space then why not plant a grove of them to feed future generations? The trees are very wind- resistant and grow best in the wetter western half of the country.\n\nCaragana arborescens. The Siberian pea tree is a very easily grown shrub or small tree. It demands a sunny position, so put it on the sunny edge of the woodland, and it is happier in the eastern half of the country where it prefers the drier conditions and the colder winters. The seed is about the size of a lentil and is usually freely borne. It is best cooked and can be used in all the ways that you normally use cooked beans.\n\nCastanea sativa. Sweet chestnuts are large trees that prefer a well-drained slightly acid loam though they also grow very well in acid infertile sandy soils. Seeds are usually freely produced in Britain, though they are seldom as large as the seeds you can buy in shops. There are some named varieties such as \"Marron de Lyon\", though you will still not usually obtain quite the same standard of seed as those from shops. This is because the sweet chestnut is really a tree for continental climates and prefers areas with hotter summers than we normally experience in Britain. It is at its best in the south-eastern part of the country and should be given a sunny position.\n\nCephalotaxus harringtonia drupacea. The Japanese plum yew prefers light soils though it is not too fussy so long as you don't try and grow it on dry gravelly or chalky soils. It is a medium to large shrub, growing well in the shade of other trees and disliking full sun unless grown in less sunny areas of the country such as western Scotland. The fruit is about 3cm long and, when fully ripe is sweet and juicy. It contains a single large oily seed and this is also edible, though it often has a slight bitterness if eaten raw. There are male and female plants, the females produce prolific crops most years if there is one male for about every five females.\n\nCornus mas. The Cornelian cherry is a large shrub or small tree for the sunny edges of a woodland. The oval fruits are ready in late summer and early autumn, when fully ripe they have a pleasant rich flavour. Cornus kousa is a larger tree with fruits that look a bit like a strawberry. Whilst the skin is tough and bitter, the inside is soft and lush with a delicious sweet flavour. We find that the easiest way to eat it is to bite a small hole in the skin and then suck out the delectable flesh. The sub-species C. kousa chinensis is said to grow and fruit better in this country.\n\nCorylus species. Our native hazel is a common large shrub of woodlands, succeeding in most soils and in full sun or light shade. The plants flower in early spring and, since the weather is so unpredictable at this time of year, there are years when the crop is extremely poor. If you want to grow the plant for its edible seeds then there are many named varieties available with larger seeds.\n\nCrataegus species. Whilst I would not really recommend our native hawthorns for their fruits, there are a number of N. American and Asiatic species with very pleasant fruits. These are about the size of a large cherry and contain 5 seeds which usually stick together and are thus effectively like the seed of a cherry. The fruits range in colour from yellow to red and deep purple. In the tastiest species they are juicy and have a very rich flavour. My personal favourites include C. arnoldiana with a mealy texture, C. schraderiana which is so juicy that it almost melts in the mouth and C. tanacetifolia which is crisp and somewhat apple-like. Grow these small trees on the sunny edge of the woodland.\n\nElaeagnus x ebbingei. This is a plant that is commonly grown as a hedge in gardens where it forms an extremely wind- resistant screen 6ft or more high. Left to its own devices it grows about 15ft tall and wide. An extremely tolerant plant, it grows in full sun, deep shade and most soils – its only real dislike is waterlogged soils. The plant flowers in late autumn and ripens its fruit in April, long before the traditional early fruits such as strawberries and unripe gooseberries. When fully ripe these fruits have a delicious rich flavour, their single large seed can also be eaten and has a vague hint of peanut in its taste. This plant is an extremely good companion, helping to enrich the soil with nitrogen and thereby boosting the growth of neighbouring plants. It has been found, for example, that when planted in an orchard it can increase the yields of fruit treess such as plums and nuts by 10%. Not all forms of this plant fruit well, but we are in the process of developing reliable cultivars and believe that this plant has the potential to become a commercial crop in the future.\n\nJuglans regia. The walnut is an extremely useful tall-growing tree with edible nuts and many non-food uses. It is rather antisocial in a woodland, however, since it secretes certain substances that inhibit the growth of other plants.Grow at least a couple of trees close to each other to help with fertilization, but do not grow lots of trees close together since this will depress or even prevent the growth of other plants around them. There are many named varieties available with larger fruits – you could try obtaining some of the Polish varieties that have recently become available since these are likely to do well in this country.\n\nMalus sylvestris domestica. This is the cultivated apple. I do not intend to go into details of the common fruits in this leaflet, other than to say that apples make excellent small or large trees (depending on rootstock used) for the sunny side of woodland gardens.\n\nPrunus species. This genus contains the cultivated plums and cherries, both excellent plants for a sunny position in a woodland garden.\n\nPyrus communis. Pears are another commonly cultivated fruit for sunny areas in the woodland.\n\nQuercus ilex. The holm or holly oak is a large spreading but slow-growing evergreen tree. Very tolerant of maritime exposure, it will in time offer a high degree of shelter from the elements, though its dense shade will severely limit what can grow underneath it. The seed is rather smaller than our native acorns, but unlike them it is very often free of bitter tannins and can be eaten raw or cooked like sweet chestnuts. Trees usually fruit very well in this country. The sub- species Q. ilex ballota has been cultivated in southwestern Europe for its sweet-tasting seeds, though it is not such a reliable cropper in this country.\n\nRibes species. This genus includes the cultivated gooseberries and currants, all of which are excellent small shrubs for the sunny edges of a woodland or for light shade.\n\nRubus species. This includes the cultivated blackberries and raspberries, both of which are excellent woodland plants in sun or light shade. There are also a number of N. American species of raspberries, including R. deliciosus, R. leucodermis, R. occidentalis, R. parviflorus and R. spectabilis which also do very well in the woodland. They need a warm fairly sunny position if they are to fruit well. The flavour is very nice in a good summer, though in cooler summers the flavour does not develop fully. R. phoenicolasius, the Japanese wineberry, is a very ornamental raspberry from Asia. Its fruits are about half the size of cultivated raspberries but the have a lovely flavour and are virtually free of maggot damage since the developing fruit is enveloped in the calyx until just before it comes ripe.\n\nTilia x europaea. Our native lime trees have the nicest-tasting leaves that I have yet eaten from a tree. We use them as a major ingredient in salads, replacing lettuces which are so much hassle to grow. Only the young leaves should be used, though these can be produced from April right round to September from the sucker growth that is often found at the base of the trees. T. cordata and T. platyphyllos are our other natives and can also be used.\n\nClimbing plants.\nActinidia deliciosa. The Kiwi fruit has become relatively well known in recent years, though many people do not realise that it can fruit very heavily when grown in this country. A very vigorous climber, it can either be grown on a frame or into a large mature tree (though harvesting fruit 70ft or more above the ground can be quite a problem). Try to place the plant on the southwestern side of the garden so that it gets plenty of sun but is sheltered from the rising sun since the young growth in spring can be damaged by frosts.\nApios americana. This is a herbaceous climbing plant with a delicious edible root that can be eaten raw but is best baked. Grow it on the sunny side of the woodland and either give it supports or let it climb into small shrubs. Yields of the wild species are fairly low, but new cultivars are being developed with much higher yields and this plant might become commercially cultivated in the future. One correspondant says that this plant has some \"anti nutritional factors, such as trypsin inhibitors … so it should be cooked before being eaten\"\n\nHumulus lupulus. Our native hop can climb to a height of 20 feet and succeeds in sun or semi-shade. The young shoots can be eaten in the spring, you harvest them when they are about 1 ft long and cook them like asparagus. The flavour is said to be unique and to many tastes delicious, I just find them unique. Female plants produce a cone-like seed head which is used as the bitter flavouring and preservative in beer. This seed head is also widely used as a medicinal herb, its sedative properties make it an ideal material to stuff pillows with since it aids restful sleep.\n\nLathyrus tuberosus. This low-growing herbaceous climber produces small black tubers that are absulutely delicious baked. Unfortunately the yields are rather low but since it can be grown along the woodland edge below other productive plants (and also helps to enrich the soil with nitrogen) then its harvest can be viewed as a very tasty bonus from the land.\n\nSchisandra grandiflora rubriflora. This deciduous climber grows about 20ft tall and produces bunches of small red fruits looking somewhat like small loose bunches of grapes. The fruits are about a third of an inch in diameter and have a delicious sweet flavour. Grow it in semi-shade in a slightly acid soil, though it will succeed in slightly alkaline soils if lots of organic matter is added.\n\nVitis vinifera. Grapes are well enough known, so I will not give them much space here. If you live in the warmer parts of the country then you could try growing them along the sunny edge of the woodland.\n\nOther perennial species.\nAllium ursinum. The native wild garlic grows abundantly in hedgerows and woods. It comes into growth in mid to late winter and we use the leaves raw or cooked. They have a very pleasant mild garlic flavour and add a zest to salads at this time of the year. The flowers and small bulbs can also be used. A. triquetrum, the three-cornered leek grows well on the sunnier edges of the woodland. These plants come into growth in the autumn and can supply their leaves throughout the winter. (See our leaflet on Wild garlic for more information about this plant.)\nCampanula persicifolia. This harebell (or bluebell if you live in Scotland) is a beautiful plant that produces a flowering stem about 3 ft tall in the summer. The flowers have a delicate sweet flavour and make a very attractive addition to the salad bowl. The mild-flavoured leaves can be harvested for about 9 months of the year and used in salads.\n\nCryptotaenia japonica. Japanese parsley is not really a parsley but the leaves taste vaguely like it if you use a considerable amount of imagination. All other parts of the plant can also be eaten, the seeds being used as a flavouring, the stem used as a celery substitute and the root eaten raw or coooked. The plant grows about 1½ feet tall and prefers a moist shady position under trees, where it will often self-sow. Keep it away from slugs, though, because they will decimate it.\n\nErythronium species. Dog's tooth violets are dainty low-growing woodland bulbs related to lilies. They flower in early spring and disappear completely by early summer. The bulbs can be eaten raw or cooked and have a nice sweet flavour. Any of the species can be used, we find that the cultivars \"Pagoda\" and \"White Beauty\" are easy to grow and increase freely.\n\nFagopyrum dibotrys. Perennial buckwheat is a very vigorous plant for light shade in the woodland. It can grow 2 metres tall and spreads freely when well placed. The leaves can be cooked and eaten like spinach, for which they make an acceptable though not inspiring substitute. The leaves, however, are a good source of rutin and this can have a very beneficial effect on the circulatory system – it is used in the treatment of arteriosclerosis, high blood pressure and rheumatism, for example.\n\nLilium species. Lilies are ideal plants for the woodland. Although it might seem a sacrilege, some lily species are cultivated for their edible bulbs (the growers actually prevent the plant from flowering so that it puts more energy into the bulb). If you ever find that you have too many of any particular species then you could always try eating a few bulbs. If you want to cultivate plants for their bulbs then I would recommend trying the tiger lily, L. lancifolium.\n\nMontia sibirica. Miner's lettuce is an evergreen herbaceous plant that succeeds in deep shade as well as in the sunnier areas. A short-lived perennial, it usually self-sows freely and makes an excellent ground cover in the woodland. The leaves can be harvested for salads all the year round and the flowers can also be used.\n\nMyrrhis odorata. Sweet Cicely has delicious aniseed-flavoured leaves that are available from late winter until early the next winter. This herbaceous perennial prefers moister soils and is a native plant that is well able to look after itself.\n\nRumex acetosa. We have a form of sorrel that virtually never flowers and produces its lemon-flavoured leaves all twelve months of the year. You cannot eat it in large quantities because it contains oxalic acid (which is what gives it the lemon flavour) and this can bind up certain of the nutrients in food, making them unavailable to the body. In moderate amounts, however, it is a very tasty and nutritious food. Grow it in the sunnier parts of the woodland.\n\nStreptopus amplexifolius. Wild cucumber grows very well in the cool shade of a woodland where it can reach a height of 3 feet. Its fruit can be eaten raw or cooked and is juicy with a cucumber flavour. Do not eat it in large quantities at your first try since it can be laxative until your body gets used to it. The young shoots can be eaten raw in salads or cooked like asparagus and also have a cucumber-like flavour whilst the root is sometimes used in salads and, surprise surprise, also has a cucumber flavour. I wonder if this is why they call it the wild cucumber?\n\nUrtica dioica. Stinging nettles are well enough known to anyone who has had a brush with them. Surprisingly few people, however, know that the leaves are edible when cooked, are highly nutritious and are also very tasty. Harvest the young shoot tips in spring and early summer – if you want to harvest them later in the year then cut down a patch to encourage fresh growth. Do not eat the older shoots since these can develop substances that are an irritant to the kidneys. Wear gloves when harvesting the leaves to avoid being stung – when cooked the leaves lose all of their ability to sting.\n\nViola odorata. Sweet violet is a low-growing carpeting plant that provides mild-flavoured edible leaves all the year round and deliciously sweet edible flowers throughout the winter. This plant has become quite a favourite salad of mine in the last year. A native plant, it is quite capable of looking after itself along the woodland edge.\n\nReaders Comments\nPlants for a Future does not verify the accuracy of reader comments, use at your own risk.

As it was not in any of my horticultural reference books, I decided to do an internet search to see what kind of conditons it would flourish in. To my surprise, the North Carolina State University declared it a poisonous plant!\n\nI then discovered your page, which confirmed my original information, which lists it as an edible plant. I don't know which source is correct, yours or the University's, but I don't think I will be eating it anytime soon!\n\nWoodland Garden Plants\nSun May 20 14:09:44 2001\n\ni think jeeves is great but i want information and pictures that kids 10 and under could understand please help\n\nUnfortunately, USDA zones aren't useful except for perhaps determining maximum cold resistence (all they measure are miniumum temps). Britain is smack dab in front of the Gulf Stream, so has warm winters. However it is very far north, so has long winters and cool summers. USDA zones 8 and 9 in the US are perhaps equivalent to Europe in the maritime Pacific Northwest and northern California, but not in the Southeast US.\n\n270 frost free days leaves about 95 with frost. # Frost-free days is somewhat useful for annuals but little else. Temperate perennials/trees need winter chilling (hours between 32 and 45 Fahrenheit). I guarrantee that NW FL (USDA zone 8) does not have 95 days of potential frost (& presumptively \"chill\"). It usually has only 400 (or less) chilling hours, and only about 3-7 days (nights?) of frost. Temps get down to low 20s F (in some cases 15 F), but these killing frosts occur unpredictably, scattered amoungst 60/70 Fahrenheit days from late December to late February. W. European weather is probably more regular. Spain and Italy can raise both subtropical crops (citrus, banana passionfruit)—lack of killing frosts—and European plums/apples/hazels/etc—prolonged winter chill. Neither group is reliable in the Deep South of the US; indeed, native species (mayhaw, rabbiteye blueberry, scuppernong) and a small number of exotics from Asia (kaki) and Uruguay (feijoa, jelly palm) are the only ones to thrive. And if the Limeys saw wild scuppernongs—120+ ft woody lianas with aerial roots (Bartram's \"flying buttresses of the live oak forest\"), I don't think they'd recommend planting vines, let alone grapes, at \"woodland edges.\" Kinda hard to harvest and control.\n\nI have a hard time taking gardening advice/books from Europe and West Coast USA seriously. Unfortunately most authors come from such areas, so the rest of us waste alot of money planting things and watching them die, in order to find the tiny percentage that work. Some of the species that \"work\" become weeds—witness Kudzu, which swallowed Georgia after FDR's bureaucrats decided it would be good for errosion control.\n\nAnyone have scuppernong (Vitis rotundifolia) recipes?\n\nWoodland Garden Plants\njrb Thu Jan 30 19:03:22 2003\n\nFound this page interesting.

Here in central PA, we call them teaberries, and always enjoy chewing the refreshing berries while in the woods. A local old time dentist, Dr. Hummer. now long deceased, told me a story about traveling to local schools during the depression,providing dental check-ups.He noted that kids that lived around the barrens here had a remarkable absence of cavities and he noted fresh sweet breath. On questioning the kids, he said that most walked through the woods on the way to and from school and nibbled teaberries,and their leaves and twigs along their way Has anyone else heard of this phenomenon,or could it be mere coincidence?\n\nWoodland Garden Plants\nNancy Bazemore Fri Jan 6 2006\n\nI am trying to purchase scuppernong plants.

Something tells me, though, that we will have to learn by making lots of mistakes before finding out which of the plants can survive in our sandy, poor soils with frosts getting to -30 Celsius.\n\nWoodland Garden Plants\nnatschultz Fri Nov 2 2007\n\nTo find plants suitable to other areas (colder, warmer) just look up the botanical (Latin) Family name and very often there are many different species in that family that are suitable to very different climates. For example, all oaks are in the Quercus family, but different species grow in different climates. Same with Tillia, although they are all pretty much temperate zone (Tillia's common names vary – Lime Tree in England, Linden tree on continental Europe and some parts of the USA, and it is also known as Basswood in many parts of the USA); they are all the same tree though, just that there are a few different species. The European native has larger leaves than the American one which is known as Littleleaf Linden or Greenspire in common parlance. Most plant families have a cold weather species; the Lingonberry is a great small shrub in the far North that is similar (but better than) a cranberry (popular in Scandinavia and Russia). It also grows in the Northern USA and Canada.\n\nWoodland Garden Plants\nMarko Mon Apr 7 2008\n\nHow about Black Elder?

Most of the plants mentioned sound unappetizing or mildly toxic, nearly all require some sun which precludes truly growing them in a forest, at least not the types I've ever seen. As a possible addition to conventional food production sure, as a replacement clearly not.\n\nWoodland Garden Plants\nMagicStarER Thu Apr 24 2008\n\nWhat a wonderfully informative site and with many new concepts I just learned about for the first time here. I will be coming back to read more. With the destruction and monopolization of our seed supply effected by the huge seed corporations, we must now plant ONLYHEIRLOOMSEEDS or one day, we will turn around and have nothing to plant and nothing to eat. Using wild plants as food is another alternative that people are going to have to look at as a way to keep from starving to death. The time to get started on heirlooms and wild foods in your garden is NOW!!!\n\nElder flowers dipped in batter and lightly fried are delicious. Be careful with raw berries though, they need to be cooked/processed or you'll be ill. Young hawthorn leaves are tasty and I've eaten checkers which I think are some sort of sorbus berries. There are masses of flowers that can be made into wines, I'd recommend dandelion and elderflower as two of the best. They're easy to make too – I learnt how to from my grandmother years ago – and the ingredients are (mostly) free.\n\nWoodland Garden Plants\nLeni Mon Dec 8 2008\n\nTo Jurek Ambroszczyk: Try rowan tree – Sorbus aucuparia var.moravica, you can get it in Czech Republic (its local variety, called also \"Moravský sladkoplodý\"). It has edible berries, and it can survive about anythink from dirty streets to poor, mountain soil and harsh weather. Use – similar to cranberries.

Another one to add to your list for those in the states and has been shown to have great medical benefits (according to Dr. Jerry McLaughlin – can watch videos on net) to it is american pawpaw, not to be confused with papaya. Looking to add some of them to my yard. Great thing about it is if you pass information on about what is planted in the yard to future owners and dwellers, they can benefit from the knowledge and efforts and carry on some of the knowledge that has been lost to the grocery store society of today. If I do not enjoy many of the plants I plant, hopefully someone in the future will.\n\nwikipedia – Pawpaw page\n\nWoodland Garden Plants\nJohn Fitzgerald Thu Sep 10 2009\n\nMost of the plants in the list are non-native. Is there a danger of them becoming an \"invasive species\" and a problem outside the woodland garden? I would be concerned as bio security is an international problem. Many of these invasive species have hybridised with native, altered the evolutionary path of native biota. I think we need more research into the wider dynamics of such a medley of global species on our native flora. I am thinking of planting a woodland garden and would be grateful of advice\n\nAdd a comment/link:\nEnter your comment about this page here.\nNote: please don't expect a quick reply to comments/questions posted here?

      "text": "iGeneral Information: An\nexcellent, small, irregularly-shaped Pine, the size and\nshape of Japanese Black Pine is variable reaching a\nheight of 25 feet and a spread of 20 to 35 feet. The\nexceptionally dark green, five to seven-inch-long\ntwisted needles are borne in groups of two.\nAlthough trees may or may not have a central leader\nprune to develop\none if the tree will be grown to a large size. Branches\nare held horizontally in a picturesque silhouette and\nsometimes can outgrow the central leader forming an\nattractive multistemmed specimen tree. Black pine is a\nnative of Japan. It prefers but does not insist on\ncolder climates; needs special care if grown in the\nwarmer regions. It has\nrough bark and dark needles. Occasionally a black pine\nwill have a \"witches' broom\" growth on a branch caused\nby a fungus infection. It is a thick clump of branchlets\nhaving dwarfed foliage. Trees propagated from witches'\nbrooms make ideal bonsai subjects as they are\ncharacterized by compact foliage and needles which are\nvery short and erect. Bonsai propagated from witches's\nbroom stock are called \"Yatsubusa\".\n\nFamily:Pinaceae\n\nLighting:They require full\nsun and good air circulation. Turn the tree from time to\ntime so that light reaches all parts of the foliage.\n\nTemperature:Zone 6 through\n8. The black pine does not like extreme heat, especially\nin the area of its roots. Spray the foliage with water\ndaily during the summer.\n\nWatering: May be allowed to\ngo dry between waterings. Needs good drainage.\n\nFeeding: Fertilize with an\nacid based fertilizer.\n\nPruning and wiring: Do\npruning during the early growing season. On all 2-needle\npines, begin pinching at the end of spring when the buds\nhave matured. First pinch the undesired weak buds and a\nweek later pinch the undesired strong ones. (Just\nopposite for 5-needle varieties.) Then, as a result of\nthis first pinching, selectively remove buds in the weak\nareas, leaving only the biggest and strongest. In the\nstrongest areas leave the weak buds, removing the\nbiggest and strongest. Remove needles growing from the\ntop and bottom of branches, leaving only lateral\nneedles. Every other spring, if the tree is healthy, you\ncan remove all of the new candles. The following fall,\nbuds will appear where the candles were removed. This\nserves to greatly shorten the internodes and increase\nfoliage density.\n\nPropagation: Black pines\nmay also be grown from seeds sown in sand in early\nApril. Seeds should be soaked in water for two days to\nhasten germination. Be sure to discard any seeds which\nare floating in the water. Black pines may also be\npropagated by grafting and from cuttings.\n\nRepotting:Repot in Spring\nbefore the buds begin to swell. A soil mix of coarse\nsand, calcinated clay and peat works well. The container\nmay have to be larger than aesthetics dictate so the\nfeeder roots do not dry out and die at the end of a\nsummer day. Don't under pot a black pine. To take up\nnourishment, pines need to have a special type of fungus\nin the soil around their roots. This fungus appears as a\nwhite, stringy material. When repotting, make sure some\nof this helpful fungus is included in the new soil mix.\n\nPests and diseases: Usually\nnone serious, except Pine wilt nematode in the east and\ntip moth on recently transplanted Pines. The Maskell\nscale has recently devastated large numbers of trees in\nNew Jersey.\n\nSome adelgids will appear as white cottony growths on\nthe bark. All types produce honeydew which may support\nsooty mold. European Pine shoot moth causes young shoots\nto fall over. Infested shoots may exude resin. The\ninsects can be found in the shoots during May.\nPesticides are only effective when caterpillars are\nmoving from overwintering\nsites to new shoots. This occurs in mid to late April or\nwhen needle growth is about half developed.\n\nBark beetles bore into trunks making small holes\nscattered up and down the trunk. The holes look like\nshotholes. Stressed trees are more susceptible to\nattack. Keep trees healthy. Sawfly larvae caterpillars\nare variously colored but generally feed in groups on\nthe needles. Some sawfly larvae will flex or rear back\nin unison when disturbed. Sawflies can cause rapid\ndefoliation of branches if left unchecked.\n\nPine needle miner larvae feed inside needles causing\nthem to turn yellow and dry up.\nPine needle scale is a white, elongated scale found on\nthe needles. Pine tortoise scale is brown and found on\ntwigs. Depending on the scale, horticultural oil may\ncontrol overwintering stages. Pine spittle bug lives and\nhides in a foamy mass. Zimmerman Pine moth larvae bore\ninto the trunk. The only outward symptoms may be death\nof parts of the tree or masses of hardened pitch on the\nbranches. The larvae of Pine weevils feed on the sapwood\nof the leaders. The leader is killed and the shoots\nreplacing it are distorted. First\nsymptoms are pearl white drops of resin on the leaders.\nThe leaders die when the shoot is girdled as adults\nemerge in summer.\n\nAphids, mealy bug & red spider. Scale, shoot-tip moths\nand beetles may attack the tree and can best be\ncontrolled with a systemic insecticide. Do a preventive\nfungicide spray every two to three weeks with Benomyl®\nor Daconil®."

      "text": "Quaking Aspen Populus tremuloides\n\nQuaking Aspen is one of the tree species thay may be found in our local hills. In the fall a grove of aspen will change color at the same time. This is because the individual trees are clones of the founding tree. Notice how the leaves of the aspen 'tremble' in the breeze. They shimmer differently than leaves of other trees. Why do you think this is so? If you want to find out, compare the petiole (leaf stalk) structure of the aspen to that of other tree species.\n\nSyringa, Idaho's State Flower Philadelphus lewisii\n\nThis is Idaho's State Flower. It is commonly referred to as Syringa or Mock-orange. It blooms in the spring and its flowers are generally white. The area of Idaho where you most likely will see it growing in the wild is in the central and northern regions.\n\nNow that you have seen the Idaho State Flower you may be wondering what the Idaho State Tree is and where it is located on the walk. The Idaho State Tree is the Idaho White Pine (Western White Pine). Unfortunately no specimen of this species is located on the ISU campus. One reason for this is that the Idaho White Pine requires acidic soil to grow, but the soil in our area is highly alkaline. If you want to see the Idaho White Pine in its native habitat, you must venture to the northern part of our state.\n\nOriental Arbor-vitae Thuja orientalis\n\nThere are different varieties of Oriental Arbor-vitae. This one is not as tall or thin as another variety might be, but it does exhibit the vertically growing fanlike branches that can be found in any variety of Oriental Arbor-vitae.\n\nWisconsin Weeping Willow Salix blanda\n\nThe branches of this species droop and hang down; thus the name \"Weeping\" Willow. Its leaves are generally greenish yellow. If today is windy, notice how the branches sway with the wind. The diameter of the trunks of these trees can get quite large. Can your arms fit around the trunk of this specimen?\n\nPotentilla, Cinquefoil Potentilla fruticosa\n\nPotentilla is a member of the rose family. Its flowers are bright yellow and bloom throughout the summer. Do these specimens have thorns like the common rose? This species grows wild on the Fort Hall bottoms.\n\nJapanese Barberry Berberis thunbergii\n\nThe Japanese Barberry has small needle-like spines. How might these spines benefit the plant? Imagine how sharp they might be.\n\nColorado Blue Spruce Picea pungens\n\nThe cones of the Colorado Blue Spruce are tan with papery, tapering scales. The length of these cones range from 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm). This species generally has green or bluish green needles. What color are the needles of the specimen you are viewing? Stop and take a view around the quad area. How many colorado Blue Spruce do you see? This is the most common species of tree on the ISU campus. The states of Utah and Colorado have adopted this species as their state tree.\n\nHorse-chestnut Aesculus hippocastanum\n\nThis species is the Horse-chestnut. Its leaves are in a fan formation of usually 7 leaflets. If fruit is present, notice how prickly it is. The buds located at the end of the twigs are resinous and sticky. Reach out and touch the buds to feel ust how sticky they are.\n\nEastern Hackberry Celtis occidentalis\n\nRub your hand on the trunk of this tree. Feel how rough it is and how warty it looks. If leaves are present, see if you notice any bumps on them. The bumps are caused by a small wasp that deposits its eggs in the leaf. This causes the leaf to grow a bump which provides protection and food for the developing wasp larvae. The wasps do not appear to harm the tree. The Hackberry resists drought and is an excellent shade tree.\n\nAmerican Elm Ulmus americana\n\nThe Zelkova is a member of the elm family and is purported to survive Dutch elm disease better than the American Elm, though it is not immune. As this specimen matures look for the small roundish fruit it produces. This fruit is much different in appearance than the papery, wing-like fruit produced by other members of the elm family.\n\nCamperdown Elm Ulmus glabra var. camperdownii\n\nRub your fingers over the leaves of the Camperdown Elm. Does the feel remind you of sandpaper? The top of this tree was grafted onto the trunk of a Siberian Elm. To see where the graft was make look for a big knob-like area where the branches come out from the trunk.\n\nSiberian Elm Ulmus pumila\n\nThis species is the Siberian Elm. This species is commonly planted in arid regions because of its ability to withstand drought and heat. Some people consider this species a weed tree. The fruits, which are produced in the spring, are flat and paper-like and float on the wind."

The germination is usually hindered by hard seed coats and embryo dormancy. Utilizing proper after ripening and cold moist stratification procedures, germination can be stimulated. Seed should be covered with at least 1/8 to 1/2 inch of soil on nursery beds. Fall seedings should be mulched for winter protection.\n\nWhen seedlings are acquired, the sex of the plant is typically indeterminable, in contrast to those propagated vegetatively. In late fall root suckers can be directly dug and transplanted, while actively growing softwood cuttings are taken from late spring to mid-summer. The cuttings are first placed under glass or plastic, but once roots form and begin to grow, they can be transplanted into containers or nursery beds for further development."

Poison ivy is the major cause of allergenic dermatitis in the eastern United States, which causes inflammation, blistering, and itching of the skin. Honestly, it can be down right painful and uncomfortable!\n\nThis first photo Here is a photo of some poison ivy climbing a tree here in Jackson Park.\n\nLeaves occur on petioles and are divided into three leaflets which are generally oval in shape. Leaflets may be either toothed, untoothed, or lobed. Older leaves are generally either toothed and lobed or untoothed and lobed.\n\nThe two lateral leaflets occur on very short petioles, while the central leaflet occurs on a much longer petiole. Although leaf shape is highly variable, the lateral leaflets are often distinctly lobed on one side of the leaflet and not on the other. Each leaflet is hairless and ranges from 3/4 to 4 inches in length and width.\n\nThis picture taken a few feet from the first picture is not poison ivy, but instead it is boxelder. A tree in the maple family that is commonly mistaken for poison ivy. If you look closely, you will see that the leaflets of a boxelder are opposite and those of poison ivy are alternate.\n\nFriday, June 5, 2009\n\nThere's been a bumper crop of slime molds in landscape beds this year, and we'll see them throughout the summer and into the fall. By far the species most often noticed is Fuligo septica, a.k.a. the \"dog vomit\" slime mold. Despite the unpleasant name, it is completely harmless to humans, animals and plants.\n\nSlime molds spend most of their lives as amoeboid cells or inconspicuous plasmodia that creep slowly through soil, leaf litter, mulch, etc. A plasmodium feeds by engulfing bacteria, spores, and bits of organic matter. It eventually moves out to a more exposed location on top of mulch, pine straw, a stump, a low-growing plant, or even the foundation of a building. There it stops moving and transforms into a fruiting (spore-producing) body. This is when Fuligo septica first gets noticed as a bright yellow, frothy mass a few inches to up to a foot in diameter. It quickly fades to a dull orange and then a light tan as its surface dries to a crust. After a few days it breaks apart to release its dark-colored spores, which blow away to start the life cycle anew. Within a week or two, all that's left is a dusting of leftover spores and bits of gray or yellowish crust.\n\nControl measures for Fuligo septica are neither effective nor necessary. If considered intolerably unsightly, they can be removed by hand or washed off with a hose, but there's a good chance that new ones will pop up at a later date, though probably not next year, unless new mulch is applied.\n\nTuesday, June 2, 2009\n\nFor those of you who are interested in bees and bee issues, there is another blog for you to consider.

This slowly kills trees or shrubs. To avoid planting too deeply in the future, position a plant at the same depth as it was in its container. However, be alert for plants which were already repotted or balled and burlapped too deeply in the nursery. If necessary, brush away soil at the base of the tree until you see where the trunk widens (the flare) as it transitions to the root system, then plant. In addition, do not dig a planting hole deeper than the container. This results in loosened soil under the plant. When this soil settles, the plant will sink and, as soil washes back around the trunk, the trunk gets buried"

      "text": "Trees provide protection from cold winter winds\n\nJanuary 07, 2011|Celeste Maiorana\n\nBy Celeste Maiorana\n\nIn late December, in the wake of the storm that didn't give us the snow that was predicted but did deliver the winds, I took a woodland walk with my family. As we stepped outside, the effects of the wind could be heard and seen, roaring through and tossing the tops of the trees with great vigor. At ground level, though, it was much more calm. We sauntered along the path, enjoying the sunshine, which has seemed too-often absent lately. As we approached the western boundary, which runs along open pasture and cropland, we suddenly felt the full force of the wind. It now felt much colder. We pulled our scarves up over our faces and our hats more securely down over our ears and hurried along the edge of the woods, eager to make the turn once more into the protection of the forest. Protection from the full effects of the wind is just one more benefit that trees provide. While a deciduous stand of at least 35 to 50 feet wide will provide a nice windbreak, even single rows of evergreen trees on the north and west sides of your house will do the same. By reducing the speed of air flowing over your home, a windbreak reduces the rate of cold air infiltration and slows heat transfer from inside to outside, reducing your heating costs up to 25 percent. Foundation plantings around your home create a still air space between them and the house wall, further slowing heat transfer through the wall. However, on the sunny sides, it is good to let the sun strike the wall of the house and shine through windows to add interior heat and slow heat conduction from the inside to out. Trees planted for summer shade should be deciduous, and their branches should be removed until relatively high above the ground to take full advantage of the winter sunshine. You might think that planting trees to save energy isn't really worthwhile because they take too long to grow. But most trees grow pretty rapidly when they're young, so it doesn't take long to reach a height that will start blocking the wind. This is especially true if you start with 3 to 5-foot trees rather than seedlings Of the evergreens common in our area, blue spruce is an example of a slow grower, and white pines and Norway spruce are examples of fast growers. If you want to plant a double row you can place slower growing varieties to the south and north (closer to the house) than the faster growers and create a beautiful, varied array of textures and colors. Even if you move away before you reap the savings on heating costs, you will have the pleasure of their beauty and that of the birds and other creatures who will be drawn to the habitat you created. And they will be extracting and storing carbon as they grow, doing their part to combat global warming. Trees do provide an enormity of benefits. In storms and high winds, though, they can drop branches or uproot, sometimes causing harm to people and property. To minimize this risk, it is important to prune your trees from time to time. Always remove dead or damaged branches as soon as possible, and promote symmetrical growth and balance between the tree's height and spread. Trees planted for windbreaks should not have their lower branches removed, but they might benefit from lateral trimming of branches to reduce spread and decrease the risk of breakage in heavy snow and ice storms. In very high winds, skip the woodland walk for an activity away from trees.\n\nCeleste Maiorana is a member of the Washington County Forest Conservancy District Board.

      "text": "PEST AND DISEASE CONTROL\n\nPest and disease attack in trees is a problem that is most commonly treated with harmful chemicals and pesticides. However, the infestation of pests or diseases is typically a symptom of a larger issue. The health of the tree and its ability to defend itself from infestation are of primary concern. When a tree is stressed, unable to absorb necessary nutrients from the soil, or expending too much of its energy on healing itself from storm damage or vandalism, it leaves the tree susceptible to attack because it does not have the energy or resources to defend itself.\n\nAt TREEMASTERS, we prefer to take a preventative approach to dealing with pests and disease. If your tree is strong and healthy because it is receiving sufficient sunlight and water, and drawing plentiful nutrients from the healthy soil around it, it will be much more resistant to pests and diseases and better able to defend itself.\n\nOwner Tad Jacobs is a licensed Qualified Applicator in the state of California. While TREEMASTERS prefers to not use pesticides and chemicals for the treatment of diseases or insect attack, we realize there may be conditions that require their use. Most commonly in Marin County and Northern California, Sudden Oak Death attacks and kills thousands of trees per year. The application of the compound Agri-Fos can help trees defend themselves against this aggressive tree pathogen that otherwise would be removed.\n\nAnother blight affecting the trees of Northern California is a disease known as Pine Pitch Canker. This fungus has affected thousands of Monterey pine trees along the California coast, although it has not limited itself to Monterey pines exclusively. It has also been found in Bishop pines, Knobcone pines, Torrey pines, and Italian Stone pines, among others. Trees affected by this disease will typically show signs of infection with the dying of branch tips and browning needles, and eventually sunken cankers appear on the trunk of the tree that seep a yellowish resin.\nPine Pitch Canker is spread most rapidly through boring insects such as bark, twig, and cone beetles that carry the disease from one tree to another. Because it is a fungus, the spores will also become airborn and be carried by the wind. There is no known cure for Pine Pitch Canker, although there are treatments to remediate boring beetle infestations if they are present. These treatments help prevent the spread of the disease throughout the tree.\nFor more information on Pine Pitch Canker and its potential effects on your trees, please visit the Pine Pitch Canker Task Force, or read this article from Ranchandcountry.com.\n\nA TREEMASTERSI.S.A. Certified Arborist can help you develop a comprehensive plan for preventing pests and disease in your trees. If you believe you have an infestation, TREEMASTERS will assist you in the remediation of the problem and the careful planning for the health of the tree.\n\nPest And Disease Control F.A.Q. Q: Can Disease Or Insects Be Spread From One Tree To Another?\nA: Any tree that is weak or stressed is susceptible to attack by pests or diseases. It stands to reason that if one tree is infested, the surrounding trees might be in danger of being attacked as well. Any infested tree should be treated or removed immediately in order to prevent the spread of the pests or diseases to other trees. However, surrounding trees should be inspected as well to make sure they are strong and able to defend themselves. Dirty tools, such as chainsaws or pole-saws can also contribute to the spread of pathogens. For this reason, TREEMASTERS cleans and disinfects all of our tools between jobs and at the end of each work day to prevent the contamination of healthy trees.\n\nQ: What Causes Trees To Contract Diseases Or Attract Harmful Insects?\nA: Trees are left vulnerable to attack by disease and pests because they are stressed or weak and unable to defend themselves. If a tree is not receiving sufficient sunlight, water, or soil nutrients, or is recovering from damage or vandalism, it may not have the energy to defend itself against an attack.\n\nQ: How Do I Keep My Trees From Attracting Pests And Contracting Diseases?\nA: The best way to prevent pests and diseases is to ensure that your tree is receiving everything it needs to produce food, grow, and remain healthy. TREEMASTERS can assess the condition of your soil, tree and foliage to make sure it is healthy and make recommendations to help prevent against attack.\n\n\"Providing great care and attention to the One Tree we are working on at that moment.\"\nPhone: 415-455-9933 Fax: 415-455-9934 Email: Treemail@Treemasters.com\n3175 Kerner Blvd. San Rafael, CA 94901"

      "text": "Frequently Asked QuestionsIn either early Spring or throughout the Fall. The reason is that the soil temperature is low and the tree's roots can easily acclimate to the new soil where it will live for the rest of its life without stress. It takes about 30-45 days for a tree to root-in and begin living on its own without the additional care required to sustain its life. If a drought would occur, a minimum of 25 gallons or 1\" of water would be required per tree per week to keep them alive.\n\nMost woody plants do especially well when they are set out in the fall. Serious horticulturists prefer fall plantings since it allows the plants the balance of the fall, all winter and all spring to establish their new roots before the summer's hot, dry weather. Spring and summer plantings can also work well so long as you hand-water the new plants for the first season.Most trees and shrubs do best when transplanted in the spring or fall, however I have found that with proper care you can transplant most pants just about any time. One more note about planting, a plant can be put in the ground any time of year as long as the ground is not frozen. It is the act of cutting the roots of a plant that is can kill it. A plant purchased at the nursury has already been transplanted and can be put in the ground any time as long as it gets watered.\n\nThe best spacing is about one tree in an area measuring 30 feet x 30 feet, or 50-60 mature trees per acre. Initially, a maple grower may start with a higher density of trees but will thin several times to achieve a final density of 50-60 trees per acre. The bottom 4-6 feet or tapping zone will be reduced in value by defects associated with tapping. Above this zone, the quality of the wood will not be affected by tapping.\n\nCarefully prepare a hole large enough to accommodate the roots fork over the bottom of the hole to break up any pan that may be present and incorporate some organic matter, make sure it is well rotted as fresh material can scorch the root system. We would advise staking newly planted trees even on strong rootstocks while they establish and weak rooted stock should be securely staked for life.\n\nThe old arborist saying goes, \"the best time to prune is when the pruners are sharp,\" meaning that trees can be pruned at any time. This is still true for most trees, although there are some points to consider and some limited exceptions to the rule.\n\nThe choice over whether to divide large plants really depends on your growing goals and situation. You may wish to grow the plant into a larger 'specimen plant' that will produce larger and more flowers reliably, or you may want to produce divisions for trade or sale if the plant is in demand. Because most of our plants 'work by producing seed, we are very hesitant to divide them unless they fall apart at a division point when they are repotted.\n\nIt will depend on the grass. Warm-season grasses such as the various bermudas, zoysias and St. Augustine should be planted from April through September. May is an outstanding time, since summer's blast hasn't quite hit yet. If you plant in the summer you'll have to be much more concerned about keeping the grass moist until it can root into the ground. Cool-season grasses fescue and rye are planted in mid-September.\n\nThe best planting time for USDA hardiness zone 6 and south is the early fall; for zone 5 and north, the spring is better. (See the USDA zone map, to determine your zone. A draft version of an updated map is available here.) Loosen and remove some of the potting medium until root ends are pulled out of the mix and extended out into the soil when planted. Work soil around extended roots with your hands, packing with feet will tear roots. Most plants grow better in soils high in organic matter.\n\nWe have set up an automatic calculator on the site that makes it easy for you to enter any number of trees that you would like. In the order process when asked for the number of trees you would like to plant choose \"Tree Preserve\" and add your desired quantity in the box. The cost is $6. per shade, fruit or flowering tree and $7. per evergreen tree. The correct total dollar amount will appear automatically at check out."

      "text": "How to Plant Seedlings\n\nThis is basic information pertaining to reforestation. Some landowners will encounter problems that are peculiar to their specific lands. If you need advice in this area, contact a Georgia Forestry Commission District or County office A qualified forester will help you.\n\nWinter is the time to plant forest tree seedlings in Georgia. Although the quality of trees has been greatly improved through research in recent years, survivability of seedlings depends largely on care taken in storing, transporting, and planting.\n\nHere are some tips:\n\nStoring\n\nAt delivery, inspect the packages of seedlings before accepting and make sure your order is correct and check for damages. Then unload immediately.\n\nMinimize storage time, especially early in the season.\n\nDo not wash or shake gel from seedling roots. Gel applied to roots at the nursery prevents drying out during transport and decreases transplanting shock.\n\nDo not prune the roots of packed seedlings. Seedlings need every single tiny root to absorb moisture and nutrients from the ground, so the more root surface the better the growth. If some seedlings have roots that are excessively long, remove\nthem individually, and trim slightly.\n\nDo not allow seedlings to dry out from wind or sun. Ample moisture is the key factor - \"if they dry, they die.\"\n\nAllow air to circulate to prevent heating when in packages. Bags/bales should not be stacked over two deep per layer unless spacers are used to provide air circulation between layers. Spacers should provide 2-4\" of air space.\n\nAvoid temperature extremes. Fluctuations\nin temperature, especially excessive heat, during storage and transport\ncan result in seedling trauma.\n\nDo not attempt to plant seedlings that have been thoroughly frozen in the pack. Freezing irreversibly damages the root system, leading to seedling death. Slightly frozen seedlings, however, are acceptable and should be thawed naturally. Do not handle seedlings in this state, as it leads to cracking and breaking.\n\nTransporting\n\nDo not transport seedlings in truck beds containing fertilizer, chemical, or fuel residues.\n\nProtect plants from weather extremes when transporting to planting site. Vehicles used for transporting seedlings should have a light colored tarp to shade and protect seedlings. At least 12\" of air space should be left between the\nprotective cover and the top of the bags/bales to avoid heat build up.\n\nPlanting\n\nPlant seedlings within a 2-week period after acceptance.\n\nPlant when soil is moist.\n\nPlant bare-root seedlings during cooler temperatures as they are more\nconducive to seedling survival and healthy growth. (after November 1 if\nsoil moisture is plentiful - preferably after December 1 and before\nMarch 1.)\n\nWhen hand planting, carry plants to site in container with sufficient mud,\nsawdust, or wet moss to cover and keep seedling roots moist.\n\nRemove only a single seedling at a time from bucket when hand-planting, or\nenough seedlings from planter tray for immediate use. Do not expose\nroots to drying wind and sun.\n\nPlant seedlings deeply. The correct planting depth should be at least as deep\nas the plant grew in the nursery. Greater exposure to the soil and its\nwater content - even one-half inch of added depth of planting -\nsignificantly improves survival rates.\n\nUse mechanical planting if possible. Although slightly more expensive,\nplanting mechanically yields better results and is an investment that\npays off. Make sure the machine is properly adjusted to get the proper\nplanting depth and to avoid J-rooting.\n\nHow Many Trees Should I Plant?\n\nThe density of an initial planting of trees depends upon both the species and objectives of the landowner. In general, landowners planting strictly for timber production will plant Loblolly, Slash or Longleaf pines and will tend to plant at higher densities. Landowners that have other objectives, such as wildlife habitat, may plant pines and other species at a lower density to satisfy their goals. A compromise initial spacing for timber and wildlife is between 500 and 600 seedlings per acre.\n\nCheck with your forester or wildlife biologist for more information about species selection, planting densities and typical site preparation and care after planting to expect good results. The following table shows the most common tree planting densities."

      "text": "Sudden Oak Death\n\nTens of thousands of oaks have been killed by a new disease known as Sudden Oak Death (SOD). SOD was first reported in California in 1995. As of fall 2001, the disease has been confirmed in eight counties along the central California coast, and now in an isolated area in southern Oregon.\n\nWhat is the Sudden Oak Death pathogen, (Phytophthora ramorum)?\n\nThis species has only recently been named following its discovery as a pathogen on rhododendrons in Germany in 1992. The pathogen, isolated in 2000 from dead and dying oaks in California, is the same species as that found in Germany on rhododendrons. This pathogen causes a canker disease in oaks referred to as Sudden Oak Death along with numerous other diseases, including leaf spot and shoot dieback in a number of other hosts.\n\nSymptoms of Sudden Oak Death\n\nBleeding or sapping from the main steam or trunk\n\nWilted shoots\n\nBark beetle infestation\n\nRapid change in foliage color from green to brown\n\nThe first symptom is bleeding, an oozing or seeping of a reddish-brown to tar black thick sap. Bleeding typically occur first in the lower bole of trees\n\nDark spots on bark with exuding brown to tar black thick sap.\n\nBlack \"Zone Lines\" are found under cut away bark.\n\nTransmission of Phytophthora ramorum\n\nField observations suggest that the pathogen is transmitted through the air. Therefore leaf infections of other hosts is associated with increased likelihood of disease in neighboring oaks. Much, however, remains to be learned.\n\nDefining the threat in the Great Lakes Region\n\nPin oak (Quercus palustris) and northern red oak (Quercus rubra) are equally or more susceptible to this pathogen than the three oaks affected in California suggesting that species in the Great Lakes Region are at high risk to the disease.\nThe pathogen favors cool, moist conditions and further research is needed to determine if environmental conditions and other factors in eastern and northern forests are suitable for establishment and spread of the pathogen"

They\nhave simple, entire or toothed, usually alternate leaves and bear\nvery small flowers in catkins, before or with foliage.\n\nMany Salix species\nare very vigorous growers and are extremely tolerant of neglect.\nThere are many Salix species suitable for bonsai. One of the most\nfrequently used species is Salix babylonica and its many varieties\nthat tend to have a weeping habit. Salix do not lend themselves\nto typical bonsai forms and are normally seen with thick trunks\nand graceful weeping branches.\n\nBONSAI CULTIVATION\nNOTES\n\nPOSITION Full\nsun though protect from scorching Summer sun. Though frost hardy\nto at least -10°C, temperatures below -3°C can cause dieback of\nfine branches so some frost protection should be afforded.\n\nWATERING Salix prefer plenty of moisture and should never be allowed to\ndry out. They are very thirsty plants and require regular watering,\nparticularly during hot periods. It is often recommended that\nWillows are stood in a shallow tray of water during the Summer\nmonths; my personal feeling is that this is only recommended on\nvery hot days where excess water will either evaporate or be taken\nup by the tree within a few hours.\n\nFEEDING Every\ntwo weeks from Spring until late Summer.\n\nREPOTTING Salix require repotting in Spring as buds extend. It is not necessary\nto repot twice in a season as has been stated in some bonsai text.\n\nPRUNING Cut\nback very hard in late Winter, continually trim back shoots during\nthe growing season. For Salix grown in a weeping form, branches\nare cut back nearly to the trunk each Winter and replaced by new\nbranches (which need wiring downwards) each Spring.\n\nPROPAGATION Salix are one of the easiest plants to propagate (other than S.\ncaprea/ Pussy or Goat Willow); softwood or hardwood cuttings can\nbe taken at any time. The thicker the cutting, the greater the\nsuccess rate; cuttings 5\" thick (or more) can be taken easily\nfrom hardwood in late Winter.\n\nPESTS AND DISEASES Aphids, caterpillars, sawflies, willow scale and rust may be a\nproblem.\n\nSTYLING Ideally\nstyled in weeping or cascade forms in all"

      "text": "Gardeners use evergreen holly in the garden as specimens and as hedges, but if you haven't seen the new hollies that are available then you should look at them again for many different uses in the garden.\n\nHollies can be divided into two main groups, the well-known evergreen, mostly prickly sort and the lesser known deciduous hollies that are also included in the genus Ilex.\n\nWhen first observed it seems that they should not belong together. One type is prickly, one is not. One loses its leaves and the other does not. But when observed closely, they are classified together due to the following characteristics.\n\nOne of the most important to gardeners is that the male and female flowers are on separate plants, so you will need to make sure that you have both male and females nearby to ensure pollination, and therefore fruit set — one male plant tucked at the back or in the middle of five to seven female plants. This is referred to as being dioecious. The leaves of hollies are alternate, with either a spiny or serrated margin. If the leaves are opposite and it looks like an evergreen holly it is likely to be Osmanthus or False Holly.\n\nThis month we will discuss deciduous hollies and next month evergreen.\n\nDeciduous hollies or Winterberries are great to grow in a wet to average spot in the yard, where they can be allowed to grow and send up suckers. They do need sun to part shade, with more berries in the sunnier position. Winterberries are native to the Eastern US, where they can be found growing at the edge of the woods, especially alongside streams. They make a wonderful informal screen when planted in a double zig-zag row. They have edible fruit, and so support many animals and birds.\n\nNow is a great time to buy and plant them. It is always good to buy a plant when it is in its main season of interest so that you can see if you actually like it. Fall is a wonderful time to plant as the roots can get established during the autumn and spring before the plant has to put the effort into the new leaf growth.\n\nWhen you take the plant out of the pot, remember to break up the root ball. Most containerized plants are potted up in peat moss-based compost. If that is left on the root ball and it dries out, it almost repels water, and the plant dies a dry death. You can be quite rough with it and use your shovel to make vertical cuts around the ball to make sure that there are no encircling roots.\n\nThe main deciduous holly that is grown in gardens is Ilex verticillata, or a cross with another deciduous holly Ilex serrata (the Japanese Winterberry). Remember that as well as the showy female plants there should be a suitable male pollinator nearby, as these hollies are grown for the red or gold fruit that stays on the plant until eaten by the birds. As these hollies bloom either early or late in the season, the correct male plant is needed.\n\nIlex'Sparkleberry' was one of the earliest varieites that I grew. This cultivar received the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society's Gold Medal Plant Award, for an outstanding landscape plant in 1988. The fruit is red and stays on for a while through the autumn and then the birds eat it. This can get to be 10 to 12 feet tall, but it can easily be cut back. It does best in full sun. The pollinator would be 'Apollo.'\n\nThese days one of the most commonly sold cultivars is Ilex'Winter Red' (PHS Gold Medal 1995), which grows to about 8 feet. The fruit on this shrub are larger than 'Sparkleberry', and persist longer into the winter. Check this holly out in the Formal Native Plant garden here at the Landscape Arboretum. If we have snow this winter, these holly twigs and berries against the white backdrop make wonderful photos.\n\nIf you are not a red person there is a fairly new sport of 'Winter Red' called 'Winter Gold' (PHS Gold Medal 2005), with pumpkin colored fruit. We have this growing in the Albright Winter Garden so you can come and see it before deciding if it is a must have plant for your garden. The pollinator male for these females would be 'Southern Gentleman.'\n\nIf you have a smaller garden, choose 'Red Sprite,' which only reaches 3 to 4 feet tall. Use 'Jim Dandy' as the pollinator.\n\nOnce you know this plant, you will see that it has become quite popular in gardens, especially birding gardens. Identification of Winterberries is more obvious while the berries are on the holly, but make sure that you remember to observe the plant in the spring and summer when it is not so showy. A highly recommended plant."

The earliest known nursery was Thomas Payne's in Fremont Township, established in 1841. Within a decade, Payne had 100,000 trees in his inventory, including Norway spruce and apple varieties.\n\nOne of the best known nurseries on the North Shore was the Clavey Nursery of Highland Park, founded in 1885 by Frederick Clavey. Later the company was known as Ravinia Nurseries. F.D. Clavey is shown (above) in his nursery, circa 1910.\n\nClavey started his business by selling trees off farm lots. To Clavey, the best trees came from fields where cattle had nibbled on them making them trimmed and bushy.\n\nThis estimate (above) for work at the Rothschild home in Highland Park includes extensive sodding and the planting of nine spireas all for less than $100.\n\nTrees were dug by hand and transported by horsedrawn wagon.

      "text": "Availability: Available in-store or local delivery only.\nProduct Code:FRU-00245\n\nDescriptionLandscape Uses, Planting and Care\n\nPLANTING: Amend soil by mixing up to 50% compost with existing soil when digging the tree hole. Plant tree so that soil level in container is level or slightly higher than surrounding soil. Water in to remove air pockets around roots and mulch with wood chips. The first season, water regularly to establish tree.\n\nSCAFFOLD TRAINING: Improperly trained fruit trees have very upright branch angles which can result in excessive vigor and serious limb breakage under a heavy fruit load. Larger branches can be spread out using short wooden boards with a notch cut in each end to catch the branch. Hanging weights on branches or tying it down with string wrapped loosely around the limb are other useful methods for spreading branches. All upright growth from scaffold branches should be either pulled down to a horizontal position or removed.\n\nPRUNING: Pruning fruit trees during winter dormancy will invigorate the tree and cause it to grow and branch more the following season. It's best to do dormant pruning in late winter or early spring, after the risk of severe freeze is over. Be sure to remove any dead or diseased wood also. After the tree resumes growth in the spring, continue to train the scaffold branches of the tree as you did the previous growing season. Prop lateral branches out to a 50 to 60 degree angle. Summer pruning will devigorate the tree and cause it to grow less in that growing season.\n\nFRUIT THINNING: Fruit trees often set a heavier crop of fruit than limbs can withstand. To ensure good fruit size, return bloom for the following year, and to prevent tree breakage, it is necessary to thin the fruit. Every apple blossom results in a bloom cluster of 5 to 6 blossoms. Apples should be thinned when they are about the size of a dime. Cut off enough fruit so that the remaining apples are spaced 4-6\" apart, and leave only one fruit per cluster. It may seem like very few fruit remain, but you will harvest higher-quality fruit, potentially reduce insect and disease problems, and increase the chances for a full crop the next season.\n\nFERTILIZING: Adequate nutrition is essential for quality apple production. The best thing you can do is top-dress with compost every year. Optimum soil nutrients should result in growth of between 12 and 18\" a year. A general rule of thumb for adding additional fertilizer is to apply a combined 2/3 pound of bone meal and 1/3 Texas greensand to each tree the first year, double that the second year, and triple the third and subsequent years. Fertilizer should be broadcast on the soil surface around the drip line of the tree. The \"drip line\" is the circular line at the outer ends of the branches.\n\nIf you think you have an insect or disease problem, contact us. It's important to identify the pest accurately so a safe and effective treatment can be selected."

      "text": "Introduction\n\nThis cultivar of Norway Maple has a height and spread of 15 to 20 feet. The dense, compact, rounded crown fills with greenish-yellow flowers in the spring. Norway Maple's dense shade and shallow root system competes with lawn grasses, and the shallow roots can make mowing under the tree a little difficult, but this is less of a problem on this small cultivar. The tree is easily transplanted, grows slowly, is adapted to a wide variety of soils (including alkaline) and has brilliant yellow fall color unmatched by most trees. It can also tolerate coastal conditions. Well adapted to street tree plantings where there are overhead wires. If you are looking for a compact, meatball-on-a-stick tree which requires no pruning, this may be the tree for you.\n\nUse and Management\n\nTrunks can crack on the southern side during the winter initiating some trunk decay, but the tree usually remains intact. A variety of birds are known to use seeds as a food source. Seeds germinate readily in the landscape and could become a nuisance.\n\nPests\n\nLeaf stalk borer and petiole-borer cause the same type of injury. Both insects bore into the leaf stalk just below the leaf blade. The leaf stalk shrivels, turns black, and the leaf blade falls off. The leaf drop may appear heavy but serious injury to a healthy tree is rare.\n\nGall mites stimulate the formation of growths or galls on the leaves. The galls are small but can be so numerous that individual leaves curl up. The most common gall is bladder gall mite found on silver maple. The galls are round and at first green but later turn red, then black, then dry up. Galls of other shapes are seen less frequently on other types of maples. Galls are not serious, so chemical controls are not needed.\n\nAphids infest maples, usually Norway Maple, and may be numerous at times. High populations can cause leaf drop. Another sign of heavy aphid infestation is honey dew on lower leaves and objects beneath the tree. Aphids are controlled by spraying or they may be left alone. If not sprayed, predatory insects will bring the aphid population under control.\n\nScales are an occasional problem on maples. Perhaps the most common is cottony maple scale. The insect forms a cottony mass on the lower sides of branches. Scales are usually controlled with horticultural oil sprays. Scales may also be controlled with well-timed sprays to kill the crawlers.\n\nIf borers become a problem it is an indication the tree is not growing well. Controlling borers involves keeping trees healthy. Chemical controls of existing infestations are more difficult. Proper control involves identification of the borer infesting the tree then applying insecticides at the proper time.\n\nDiseases\n\nVerticillium wilt symptoms are wilting and death of branches. Infected sapwood will be stained a dark or olive green but staining can't always be found. If staining can not be found do not assume the problem is not verticillium wilt. Severely infected trees probably can't be saved. Lightly infected trees showing only a few wilted branches may be pulled through. Fertilize and prune lightly infected trees. This treatment will not cure the problem but may allow the tree to outgrow the infection. Girdling roots will cause symptoms which mimic verticillium wilt.\n\nScorch occurs during periods of high temperatures accompanied by wind. Trees with diseased or inadequate root systems will also show scorching. When trees do not get enough water they scorch. Scorch symptoms are light brown or tan dead areas between leaf veins. The symptoms are on all parts of the tree or only on the side exposed to sun and wind. Scorching due to dry soil may be overcome by watering. If scorching is due to an inadequate or diseased root system, watering may have no effect.\n\nNutrient deficiency symptoms are yellow or yellowish-green leaves with darker green veins. The most commonly deficient nutrient on maple is manganese. Implanting capsules containing a manganese source in the trunk will alleviate the symptoms. Test soil samples to determine if the soil pH is too high for best manganese availability. Plants exposed to weed killers may also show similar symptoms.\n\nTar spot and a variety of leaf spots cause some concern among homeowners but are rarely serious enough for control.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1.\n\nThis document is ENH-194"

      "text": "Overview\n\nBrief Summary\n\nYellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) is the most valuable of the native birches. It is easily recognized by the yellowish-bronze exfoliating bark for which it is named. The inner bark is aromatic and has a flavor of wintergreen. Other names are gray birch, silver birch, and swamp birch. This slow-growing long-lived tree is found with other hardwoods and conifers on moist well-drained soils of the uplands and mountain ravines. It is an important source of hardwood lumber and a good browse plant for deer and moose. Other wildlife feed on the buds and seeds.\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nComprehensive Description\n\nDescription\n\nThis tree is typically 60-75' tall at maturity with a single trunk that spans up to 3½' across. In open areas, the crown is large and widely spreading, while in dense forested areas it is small and irregular. For the typical variety of Yellow Birch, trunk bark is grayish yellow to bronze and somewhat lustrous, peeling away in papery sheets that are curled along their margins. For a more southern variety (var. fallax), trunk bark is gray to dark brown and wrinkled; it does not exfoliate to the same extent as the bark for the typical variety of this tree. The bark of branches and twigs is reddish brown, brown, or gray with scattered white lenticels; their inner bark has a mild wintergreen aroma. Young shoots and spur shoots are light green and usually pubescent. The leaves are arranged alternately along the twigs on short spur-shoots; there are one or two leaves per spur-shoot. The leaf blades are 2½-4' long and 1¼-2½' across; they are ovate in shape and doubly serrated along their margins. The upper surface of these blades is dark green and either glabrous or sparsely covered with short stiff hairs; the lower surface is medium green and pubescent along the veins. The petioles are ¼-½' long, pale green, and short-pubescent. Yellow Birch is monoecious, forming male (staminate) and female (pistillate) catkins on the same tree. Male catkins occur at the tips of last year's twigs in groups of 3-6. During the blooming period, they droop downward and become 2½-4' long. At this time, the male catkins are narrowly cylindrical and yellowish purple. Each male catkin consists of numerous male florets and their bracts. Male florets occur in groups of 3 behind each bract; each male floret consists of 2 stamens. Each bract is oval-orbicular in shape and ciliate along its margins. Female catkins occur individually on short spur-twigs near the petioles of leaves; they are sessile or nearly so. The female catkins are upright, ovoid-oblongoid in shape, and greenish, ultimately becoming ¾-1¼' in length at maturity. Each female catkins consists of numerous female florets and their bracts. Female florets occur in groups of 3 behind each bract; each female floret consists of a naked ovary and a pair of styles. The bracts are ¼-½' long, 3-lobed and ciliate along their margins. The blooming period occurs during late spring for about 1 week. The florets are cross-pollinated by the wind. The female catkins turn brown as their winged seeds (samaras) ripen. Each seed body is about 1/8' long, ellipsoid-ovoid in shape, and somewhat flattened. Membranous wings extend on opposite sides of each seed; they are a little less wide than the seed body. The woody root system is relatively shallow and widely spreading. This tree reproduces by reseeding itself.\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nDescription\n\nGeneral: Birch Family (Betulaceae). These are native trees mostly 15-20(-30) m tall, with straight trunks and variable crowns; mature bark smooth and shiny, usually separating into thin layers, giving a shaggy appearance; lenticels dark, horizontally; twigs with odor and taste of wintergreen, usually with small resinous glands. Leaves are deciduous, alternate, simple, narrowly ovate to broadly oblong, 6-10 cm long, base rounded to cuneate or cordate, margins sharply doubly toothed, apex acuminate, usually softly hairy beneath along major veins and in vein axils, often with scattered, minute, resinous glands. Male (pollen) and female (seed) flowers are in catkins, borne separately, but on the same tree. Seed catkins are erect, ovoid, 1.5-3 cm long, generally remaining intact after release of fruits in late fall, scales 3-lobed, sparsely to moderately hairy; pollen catkins elongate and hanging. Seeds (nutlets) have wings narrower than body. The common name pertains to the yellow color of the bark and fall leaves.\n\nVariation within the species. Two varieties have been recognized (see Fernald 1950; Braun 1961); var. macrolepis differs from typical variety alleghaniensis in its larger fruiting catkin scales (8-13 mm long vs. 5-8 mm), with more elongated basal portion. Erdmann (1990) and Furlow (1993) regard the species as variable but without formally recognized varieties.\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nDistribution\n\nThe range of yellow birch extends from southern Newfoundland, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Anticosti Island, the Gaspe peninsula, and Maine west to southern and southwestern Ontario and Minnesota; south to northern New Jersey, northern Ohio, extreme northern Indiana and Illinois; and south in the mountains to South Carolina, extreme northeastern Georgia, and eastern Tennessee [76 Southward yellow birch grows at higher elevations, appears more sporadically, and finally is restricted to moist gorges above 914 m (3,000 ft).\n\nThe largest concentrations of yellow birch timber are found in Quebec, Ontario, Maine, Upper Michigan, New York, and New Brunswick (96). About 50 percent of the growing stock volume of yellow birch in North America is in Quebec For current distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nPhysical Description\n\nMorphology\n\nDescription\n\nYellow birch is a native, deciduous tree. It usually ranges from 60 to 75 feet (18-23 m) in height and up to 2 feet (0.6 m) in diameter, and occasionally grows to 100 feet (30 m) in height and 4 feet (1.2 m) in diameter [14,44,53]. Open-grown yellow birch crowns are long and wide spreading; in more dense forest crowns are short and irregularly rounded [53]. The trunk usually divides into a few spreading branches but lateral shade produces a straight trunk that extends nearly to the top of the tree. In dense stands the trunk is free of branches for over half the height of the tree [53]. The bark is somewhat lustrous, separating in thin layers [14] which exfoliate and result in a finely shaggy appearance [44]. On old trunks, the bark is deeply grooved and about 0.5-inch (1.2-cm) thick [25]. The root system of yellow birch is generally shallow but variable. There is a well-developed extensive lateral root system; roots spread horizontally or may penetrate more than 5 feet (1.5 m). Yellow birch is monoecious [32]. The fruit is a winged nutlet 0.13- to 0.14-inch (3.2-3.5-mm) long (not including the wings) [14].\n\nYellow birch is slow growing [32]. Average longevity is approximately 150 years, but maximum longevity is over 300 years [58].\n\nThe largest concentrations of yellow birch are found in Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick, Maine, upper Michigan, and New York. About 50 percent of the growing stock volume of yellow birch is in Quebec [32].\n\nPublications listing yellow birch as a dominant or codominant species in vegetation classification schemes include:\n\nThe natural forests of Maryland: an explanation of the vegetation map of Maryland [15] Field guide: Habitat classification system for Upper Peninsula of Michigan and northeast Wisconsin [24] White Mountain landscapes [36] A forest classification for the Maritime Provinces [79] A classification of the deciduous forest of eastern North America [88] Vegetation-environment relations in virgin, middle elevation forests in the Adirondack Mountains, New York [101] Vegetation of the Great Smoky Mountains [123] Classification of forest ecosystems in Michigan [126]\n\nPeriodic droughts are damaging to yellow birch because of its shallow roots [55].\n\nElevation: In the Adirondacks and the Appalachians, yellow birch reaches its maximum importance in the transition zone between low elevation deciduous forest and montane spruce-fir forests. In the Adirondacks, it occurs at elevations ranging from 100 feet (30 m) to 3,413 feet (1040 m), but is uncommon above 3,000 feet (914 m) [10,39,61,67]. The lower slopes to about 2,310 feet (700 m) are dominated by sugar maple, American beech, and yellow birch. Between 2,310 feet and 2,970 feet (700-900 m) is a transition zone to spruce and spruce-fir forests. In the southern Appalachians the highest importance value for yellow birch occurs at mid- to high-elevations from 2,800 to 3,000 feet (853-914 m) [19,23]. In western Great Smoky Mountains National Park, yellow birch tends to be more concentrated in protected coves at lower elevations, and spreads out of the coves at higher elevations [19Soils and Topography\n\nYellow birch grows over a large area with diverse geology, topography, and soil and moisture conditions. In Michigan and Wisconsin it is found on glacial tills, outwash sands, lacustrine deposits, shallow loess deposits, and residual soils derived from sandstone, limestone, and igneous and metamorphic rock (95). Soils are also derived from granites, schists, and shales in other parts of its range.\n\nGrowth of yellow birch is affected by soil texture, drainage, rooting depth, stone content in the rooting zone, elevation, aspect, and fertility. Yellow birch grows best on well-drained, fertile loams and moderately well-drained sandy loams within the soil orders Spodosols and Inceptisols and on flats and lower slopes (45). It also grows on Alfisols typical of the humid temperature forest region. Rootlet development is profuse in loam but poor in sand. Even though its growth is poor, yellow birch is often abundant where drainage is restricted because competition from other species is less severe.\n\nIn the Lake States birch grows best on well- and moderately well-drained soils and on lacustrine soils capped with loess. Its growth is poor on poorly-drained lacustrine soils, shallow soils over limestone, and coarse-textured sandy loams without profile development (95). Site quality between the best and poorest sites differs by more than 9 m (30 ft) at 50 years.\n\nIn the Green Mountains of Vermont birch grows on unstratified glacial till up to 792 m (2,600 ft) (109). Here, thickness of the upper soil horizon as influenced by elevation and aspect have been used to estimate site index-birch grows better at lower elevations than higher elevations and on northeast aspects than southwest aspects.\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nClimate\n\nYellow birch grows in cool areas with abundant precipitation. Its northern limit coincides with the 2° C (35° F) average annual temperature isotherm, and its southern and western limits coincide with the 30° C (86° F) maximum temperature isotherm (31). Although the average annual temperature is about 7° C (45° F) throughout its range, temperature extremes range from -40° C to 38° C (-40° F to 100° F) (45). Annual precipitation rtinges from about 1270 mm (50 in) in the East to 640 mm (25 in) in central Minnesota at its western limit. More than half of the precipitation may be snow. Snowfall ranges from 152 to 356 cm (60 to 140 in) and averages 229 cm (90 in) in the north. The growing season ranges from 60 to 150 days and averages about 120 days.\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nDispersal\n\nEstablishment\n\nAdaptation: Yellow birch is a characteristic tree of the northern Appalachians and the hemlock hardwoods forest of the Great Lakes region, at elevations of mostly 0-500 meters but up to 1050 meters. In the Appalachians and the Adirondacks, yellow birch reaches its maximum importance in the transition zone between low elevation deciduous forest and montane spruce-fir forests. Yellow birch occurs on moist, well-drained soils of various types of uplands and mountain ravines and along stream banks and in swampy woods. It may also grow where drainage is restricted, but growth may be correspondingly poor. Flowering: April-May, beginning before leafing; fruiting: July-August.\n\nGeneral: Yellow birch reproduces primarily by seed, normally first at about 40 years but optimally at about 70 years – trees under 20 years sometimes produce seed. Good seed crops are produced at intervals of 1-4 years, usually with little seed produced in intervening years. Viability under natural conditions decreases around the second year.\n\nSeeds germinate and grow best on moist mineral soil enriched with humus, but those in undisturbed stands usually germinate on mossy logs, decayed wood, in cracks in boulders, and on wind thrown tree hummocks. Seedlings cannot pierce compacted hardwood litter. Scarification of seedbeds improves seedling establishment, but organic matter should be left mixed in with the mineral soil. Seed dormancy is broken (under artificial conditions) by stratification or by exposure of wet seed to cool-white fluorescent light. Seeds can be stored 2-4 years or longer without losing viability.\n\nGap conditions are conducive to yellow birch seedling establishment, and seedling survival is better on disturbed microsites. Mortality of seedlings is usually very high. Seedlings surviving their first year survive to sapling and larger stages only where there is sufficient light, although some shade improves seedling survival.\n\nYellow birch has been termed \"a persistent successional species.\" Its presence in mid- to late-successional stands depends on local disturbance; it cannot reproduce under a closed canopy and requires soil disturbance and light for seedling survival. Older trees do not sprout. In northern hardwood ecosystems, yellow birch reaches maximum importance levels within 15 years of disturbance, and those levels are maintained for at least 100 years. In many old-growth stands, yellow birch usually decreases in importance as the stand ages, but the species is often a component of old growth types and sometimes occurs as a major component of climax stands, perhaps through a combination of longevity and micro-succession. Yellow birch often reaches 150 years; the average age in old growth woods may be 200-250 years. Maximum age is over 300 years.\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nAssociations\n\nFaunal Associations\n\nVarious insects feed on the foliage, bore through the wood, suck plant juices, or feed on the seeds of Yellow Birch and other birches (Betula spp.). These species include caterpillars of the butterfly Nymphalis vau-album j-album (Compton Tortoiseshell) and the caterpillars of such moths as Acronicta betulae (Birch Dagger Moth), Peridea ferruginea (Chocolate Prominent), Venusia comptaria (Brown-Shaded Carpet), and others (see Moth Table). Other insect feeders include Calaphis betulaecolens (Common Birch Aphid) and other aphids, Erythridula praecisa and other leafhoppers, the psyllid Cacopsylla hartigii, Corythucha pallipes (Birch Lace Bug), the plant bugs Lygocoris fagi and Orthotylus necopinus, the stink bug Banasa dimiata, Kleidocerys resedae (Birch Catkin Bug), the larvae of Agrilus anxius (Bronze Beech Borer) and other wood-boring beetles, the leaf beetles Altica betulae and Calligrapha ignota, the larvae of such sawflies as Arge pectoralis (Birch Sawfly) and Dimorphopteryx melanognathus (Fringed Birch Sawfly), and larvae of Oligotrophus betheli (Birch Seed Midge). See the Insect Table for a more complete listing of these species. Because of the thin bark, the Yellow-Bellied Sapsucker drills holes and feeds on the sap of Yellow Birch. The seeds, catkins, and buds are eaten by such birds as the Ruffed Grouse, Common Redpoll, Black-Capped Chickadee, Purple Finch, White-Winged Crossbill, and Slate-Colored Junco. Among mammals, the Red Squirrel feeds on the seeds, the White-Tailed Deer and Cottontail Rabbit browse on seedlings and saplings, and the Beaver gnaws on the bark and wood. Some vertebrate animals use birches and other trees as a source of cover and reproductive habitat. For example, such species as the Red Bat (Lasiurus borealis), Hoary Bat (Lasiurus cinereus), and Silver-Haired Bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans) use trees for summer roosting sites, maternity colonies, and hibernation.\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nDiseases and Parasites\n\nDamaging Agents\n\nYellow birch is a very sensitive species that is more susceptible to injury than its common associates. It is windfirm on deep, well-drained loam and sandy loam soils but is subject to windthrow on shallow, somewhat poorly drained soils. Thin-barked yellow birch is susceptible to fire injury. Seedlings and saplings are killed outright by even light surface fires. The fine branching habit of yellow birch makes it susceptible to damage from accumulating ice or snow loads. Large trees are frost hardy (91) but late spring frost can kill 10-year-old seedlings, especially on litter seedbeds under full and partial shade. Winter sunscald can be a problem on the south and southwest sides of birch boles. Birch foliage and twigs are injured by wind-borne salt spray. Seed germination is also greatly reduced by 0.20-percent salt concentrations in the soil (6). Simulated acid rain at pH values from 3 up to 4 stimulated birch germination (80) but foliar damage occurs at pH levels of 3 or less and seedling growth reductions at pH 2.3 (127). Yellow birch seedlings are tolerant to atmospheric pollution of ozone at 0.25 p/m (67) and sensitive to 3.5 p/m of sulfur dioxide (66).\n\nPost-logging decadence is a localized decline from which most trees recover. It consists of top dying and some mortality following heavy cutting in mature and overmature stands. Yellow birch is more susceptible to root, stem, or crown injury and more severely affected than its common hardwood associates. Weakened trees are often attacked and eventually killed by the bronze birch borer.\n\nA decline of yellow birch and paper birch trees, called birch dieback, caused widespread mortality between 1932 and 1955 in eastern Canada and northeast United States. It affected yellow birches of all sizes, even in undisturbed virgin stands. The first visible symptoms of dieback are similar to those of decadence. Foliage in the upper crown appears small, curled, cupped, yellowish, and thin. Following this, tips of branches die, then dying progresses downward, involving entire branches and often more than half the crown within 2 or 3 years. Trees are usually killed within 3 to 5 years by the bronze birch borer, which with root rot fungi, the gold ring spot virus, and other pests have been considered secondary agents associated with birch dieback. Many researchers have attributed birch dieback to adverse climatic conditions, drought, and increased soil temperature, over an extended period, which caused rootlet mortality that weakened the trees and predisposed them to attacks by the borer. Others have considered over-maturity, past cutting practices, killing of associated trees by disease and the spruce budworm, and defoliating insect outbreaks on birch as initially responsible for weakening the trees. More recently the apple mosaic virus (49) and the \"frozen soil\" theory (59) have been suggested as the possible triggering mechanisms for birch dieback. Under the \"frozen soil\" theory, shallow-rooted birch trees in years without snow cover are apparently unable to replace moisture losses from their stems through both frozen rootlets and those broken from frost heaving. To date, no single \"triggering\" cause of birch dieback has been widely accepted, but the condition is probably the result of one or more of the indicated stress factors.\n\nTop-dying and reduced growth of yellow birch crowns have also been associated with heavy birch seed crops (51). This dieback occurs the year after bumper seed crops and is limited to the peripheral 0.6 to 0.9 m (2 to 3 ft) of branch tips on mature trees and usually just the past season's growth on younger trees.\n\nDiscoloration and decay are the major causes of defect and loss in wood quality of yellow birch (75,92). Discoloration and decay develop more rapidly in yellow birch than other diffuse-porous northern hardwood species (60,107). Some of the nonhymenomycetes most frequently isolated from discolored wood associated with birch wounds are Libertella betulina, Trichocladium canadense, Phialophora spp., Phialocephala spp., Hypoxylon spp., and Nectriaspp. (32,103,104,107).\n\nMechanical wounds with more than 320 cm² (50 in²) of exposed wood are important entrance courts for decay fungi (92). Pholiota limonella, P. aurivella, Polyporus versicolor, Daldinia concentrica, and Hypoxylon spp. are aggressive invaders of these larger wounds (76,104,106). D. concentrica and Hypoxylon spp. also invade branch stubs. Extensive decay is usually associated with larger mechanical injuries more than 20 years old and frost cracks more than 10 years old. Species of Phialophoraare often found in tissues near frost cracks (33). Bacteria, Graphium spp., Phialophora spp., Polyporus spp., Pholiota spp., and Nectriaare the microorganisms most frequently associated with increment-bore wounds in birch (60). Increment-bore wounds cause reddish-brown decay columns from 74 to 213 cm (29 to 84 in) long within 2 years following boring.\n\nNectria galligena is the most common and damaging stem disease of yellow birch. It causes perennial targetlike cankers, a twig blight, and subsequent crown dieback (59). The fungus can penetrate saplings, small branches, buds, and wounds but usually enters the host through cracks originating at branch axils from heavy snow or ice loads (7). Nectriacankers cause localized defects that reduce stem quality and weaken the stem, increasing the chances for wind breakage (45).\n\nDiaporthe alleghaniensis causes a black sunken canker and shoot blight of yellow birch (1). Natural infections probably enter through bud scale scars, frost cracks, leaf scars, wounds, and other injuries (2). Cankers appear on shoots, stems, and petioles of seedlings in the spring and summer and foliage wilts and browns in the summer. Outbreaks of D. alleghaniensisoccur only when conditions are optimum for infection and growth (70). Normally the fungus is weakly pathogenic and thins out less vigorous and overtopped seedlings.\n\nStereum murrayicauses elongated, sunken, bark-covered stem cankers and a yellow-brown stringy trunk rot of yellow birch. Cankers are common on branch stubs and decay usually extends about 0.3 m (1 ft) above and below cankers on pole-sized trees (106). Decay can be extensive in overmature yellow birch. Phellinus laevigatusalso produces characteristic sunken, bark-covered cankers on mature and over-mature trees. Single cankers indicate extensive decay. It is more common on dead than living trees. Inonotus obliquusproduces black, clinker-like, sterile conks that develop in trunk wounds and branch stubs. Sometimes conks of L.obliquus and Phellinus igniariusoccur on dead branch stubs in the center of Nectria cankers. A sterile conk indicates from 50 to 100 percent cull (59) and decay extends from 1.5 to 2.1 m (5 to 7 ft) above and below each conk. Inonotus obliquus is an aggressive decay fungi that can invade and kill tissues around these sterile conks (106).\n\nArmillaria mellea, the shoestring root rot, is the most common and important root and butt decayer of yellow birch trees (106). The fungus causes a white root rot with black rhizomorphs on the roots.\n\nGanoderma applanatum usually occurs on dead birches but sometimes rots the centers of trunks and infects roots and butts through wounds (106). Perennial, hoof-shaped conks of Fomes fomentarius, the tinder fungus, are common on dead birch. The fungus also has been associated with decay in living and dead branches of dieback birches. Piptoporus betulinus, Fomitopsis pinicola, and Polyporus lucidusalso are primarily decayers of dead wood but they may extend into centers of living trees (59).\n\nConiothyrium spp., common twig-inhabiting fungi, injure yellow birch seeds and seedlings (108). They are associated with weevils that tunnel through the cones and destroy or injure the seeds.\n\nThe bronze birch borer (Agrilus anxius) is the most serious insect pest of yellow birch. It attacks both healthy and weakened birches (83) but apparently can normally complete its life cycle only in dead or dying wood in weakened trees. Mature and overmature trees left severely exposed after logging and in lightly stocked stands are more subject to attack then trees in well-stocked stands. Adults deposit their eggs in bark crevices of upper branches. Grubs hatch, bore meandering tunnels underneath the bark that cause top dying, then move progressively lower down the stem and kill the tree within 2 or 3 years. The Columbian timber beetle (Corthylus columbianus) bores deep into the sapwood of vigorous birches of all sizes (3). A flatheaded borer (Chrysobothris sexsignata) occurs commonly on birch in the East. The ambrosia beetle (Xyloterinus politus) is a secondary insect that attacks weakened and wounded birches. Adults bore holes through lenticles in the bark and make galleries (105).\n\nAlthough yellow birch is not a preferred host of the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), the elm spanworm (Ennomos subsignarius), the hemlock looper (Lambdina fiscellaria), or the saddled prominent (Heterocampa guttivitta), caterpillars of these species defoliate birch in severe outbreaks. Two to three years of successive defoliation can kill birch trees (122). Dusky birch sawfly larvae (Croesus latitarsus) prefer small saplings of gray birch but also defoliate yellow birch saplings by feeding inward along leaf edges (3). The lace bug, Corythucha pallipes, can be a very injurious insect, especially on young birch (25). A treehopper (Carynota stupida), a stink bug (Elasmuche lateralis), an aphid (Euceraphis betulae), a lygaeid bug (Kleidocerys resedae germinatus), and a scale insect (Xylococculusbetulae) are other commonly to abundantly occurring sucking insects of yellow birch (3). E. lateralis and Kleidocerys resedae germinatus also feed on catkins. The birch seed midge (Oligotrophus betheli) lives in birch seed and makes it infertile.\n\nYellow birch is a preferred food of the snowshoe hare and the white-tailed deer. White-tails are especially fond of browsing seedlings during the summer, and green leaves and woody stems in the fall, and they favor succulent sprouts over slower growing seedlings. Heavy or repeated browsing often kills seedlings. Moose often severely browse it. Porcupine feeding often damages birch crowns, reduces wood quality, and sometimes kills the trees. Red squirrels cut new germinants, eat seeds, store mature strobiles, and feed on birch sap.\n\nYellow birch is a favorite summer food source of the yellow-bellied sapsucker on its nesting grounds. Heavy sapsucker feeding can reduce growth, lower wood quality, or even kill birch. The common redpoll and many other songbirds eat yellow birch seed. Ruffed grouse feed on the catkins, seeds, and buds.\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nGeneral Ecology\n\nFire Management Considerations\n\nRegression coefficients relating bark thickness to diameter at breast height have been published for yellow birch [51].\n\nThe moisture content of the inner bark of yellow birch ranges from 44 to 65 percent, depending on season of sampling. The heat of combustion of dry yellow birch bark is 9,200 Btu [129].\n\nSite Preparation: Fire has been used to create suitable seedbed conditions for yellow birch regeneration [1]. In New York, the number of yellow birch seedlings was higher on postharvest plots that had been prescribed burned and scarified than on plots that had either been prescribed burned or scarified, or on control plots [11]. Prescribed fires have been used for yellow birch seedbed preparation in Ontario. The fires were conducted in late fall, after sugar maple and beech leaf and seedfall and before the major portion of yellow birch seeds were dispersed. Low-intensity surface fires consumed litter and killed advance regeneration of sugar maple. These fires did not significantly reduce the number of stems (all species) greater than 0.6 inch (1.5 cm) d.b.h., though basal scarring was evident. Fire-prepared plots resulted in higher stocking of yellow birch than unburned plots, and reduced the development of sugar maple [6,16].\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nPlant Response to Fire\n\nYellow birch is a poor sprouter following top-kill by fire. Seed germination and seedling establishment are enhanced by fire disturbance. Yellow birch frequently forms pure patches following fire. In Wisconsin northern hardwood forests it often comprises 60 percent of the hardwood thickets [80]. Most of the research on yellow birch regeneration is associated with logging regimes, so it is not clear what role fire plays in yellow birch regeneration in unmanaged stands. It is likely that a low-intensity, patchy fire would create conditions that favor yellow birch regeneration by reducing the hardwood leaf mat and exposing mineral soil, but leaving mature trees as a seed source [1].\n\nIn northern hardwood forests, postfire regeneration is likely to include at least a small proportion of yellow birch. Major postfire species in this area are paper birch, gray birch (Betula populifolia), aspens, red spruce, and pines (Pinus spp.) [32,89]. In the Laurentian Highlands of central Quebec, yellow birch is present in low numbers in early postfire succession on well-drained sites in montane mixed forests. The main colonizers are balsam fir and paper birch [22]. In North Carolina spruce-fir forests, which rarely burn, yellow birch was important in postfire regeneration [103]. Gibson [42] reported that former Atlantic white-cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) swamps developed into red maple or red maple-yellow birch stands following fire. In northwestern Pennsylvania, a ridge that supported a dense stand of eastern hemlock and mixed hardwoods was converted by fire to a stand composed of red maple, black cherry, yellow birch, and water birch (B. occidentalis) [54].\n\nIn northern hardwood types in Wisconsin, low-severity surface fires seem to favor sugar maple over yellow birch and beech. Severe fires, however, destroy existing sugar maple reproduction and create openings in the canopy, favoring yellow birch. The composition of a northern hardwood stand was traced to three distinct fires, each of which was followed by an increase in the proportion of yellow birch [80]. Birches (yellow birch, sweet birch, and paper birch) exhibited a pulse of reproduction after a surface fire in Connecticut, peaking in density around 25 years. By 55 years after the fire birch density on burned and unburned stands was similarly low [117].\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nImmediate Effect of Fire\n\nYellow birch seedlings and saplings are killed by even low-severity fires [32]. Small trees were killed by fire that left large trees in a northern hardwoods forest unharmed [105]. Large trees usually survive fire; Martin [85] mentioned the presence of large, old yellow birch that predate a fire that initiated a red maple-paper birch stand in Ontario.\n\nA subjective ranking of tree fire resistance compiled by Starker [106] listed yellow birch as twelfth out of twenty-two species rated.\n\nFire Ecology\n\nYellow birch is susceptible to fire injury due to its thin bark [32]; young yellow birch do not usually survive fire. Mature trees may survive because the thin forest floor under large yellow birch does not usually support severe or persistent surface fire [90]. Yellow birch germinates readily on early postfire sites [91,92,115].\n\nForest Type: Heinselman [52] suggested that the presence of yellow birch in old mixed forests is hard explain without fire disturbance; however, other authors describe yellow birch as opportunistic with respect to fire but not fire dependent [90]. Lorimer [77,78] reported that the presence of yellow birch (in land survey records) is not a reliable indicator of previous fire. In Massachusetts, a beech-hemlock forest containing yellow birch developed on an island where fire had not occurred for many years. The land surrounding the island is occupied by fire-dependent pitch pine (Pinus rigida) and scrub oak types. In the 1940's the island forest was broken up by a hurricane, which corresponds with the age of many yellow birch [30].\n\nFire Frequency: Yellow birch typically occurs in forests with fire-free intervals of at least 150 to 300 years; the fire regime is characterized by crown and severe surface fires in combination [52]. The presettlement hemlock-northern hardwood forests experienced fire infrequently [2]. In Wisconsin, mesic hemlock-northern hardwood forests north and east of the transition zone between the fire-dependent prairie-savanna mosaic and nonfire-dependent forest probably experienced fire periodically prior to the fire-suppression era. The presence of large, late-successional species indicates that the average interval between stand-replacing fires was longer than the average lifespan of major tree species in the region [20]. In the Great Lakes States and Acadian Forest region, presettlement northern hardwoods-pine-spruce-fir forests probably had a semieven-aged structure where less shade-tolerant components were maintained by long-return interval disturbances such as fire or windstorms. Most fires in these forests were severe surface fires, occurring only after prolonged drought, and usually affecting forests that were breaking up due to other factors (and thus had heavy fuels). Estimates for Maine presettlement fire return intervals range from 806 to 1,923 years [77].\n\nIn the twentieth century, forest types containing yellow birch in New Brunswick have either experienced no fires or have had very long fire-free intervals. For sugar maple-yellow birch-fir in New Brunswick, the mean annual area burned between 1931 and 1970 was about 0.16 percent of the total area of that type [119]. A similar study for Nova Scotia reported that 0.03 percent of the total area (of sugar maple-yellow birch-fir) burned annually between 1915 and 1975 [120]. In northern Maine, hardwood forests were estimated to have a fire return interval of approximately 800 years [2]. Northern hardwood forests had estimated fire return intervals (from data spanning 1903-1956) of 910 years for Maine and 770 years for New Hampshire [35].\n\nFire Season and Conditions: At low elevations in the southern Appalachians, lightning-caused fires occur less often in the hardwood forests than in pine-hardwood forests. Fire frequency by forest type is related to the month of occurrence. Fires that occur before May usually start at higher elevations; after May, more fires start at lower elevations and are concentrated in the pine-hardwood type, possibly because after hardwoods have leafed out fuel moistures are too high to support fire [8]. In Maine, northern hardwoods are less likely to burn than other forest types, and are more susceptible to fire damage. Ignition and spread of fire are unlikely except during the most severe droughts [89].\n\nSuccessional Status\n\nYellow birch is intermediate in shade tolerance. Leak [71] assigned yellow birch to the category of persistent successional species. Yellow birch is described as opportunistic due to its habit of producing abundant small seed [40]. Yellow birch seeds comprised a higher than expected proportion (compared to the abundance of mature trees) of the seed rain and seedbank of a mixed forest [56]. The presence of yellow birch in mid- to late-successional stands depends on local disturbance [28,71]; it cannot reproduce under a closed canopy and requires soil disturbance and light for seedling survival [32]. Birches respond to gaps of all sizes, with a peak density found in gaps of about 2,800 square feet (250 sq m) in Pennsylvania. In the southern Appalachians, birches exhibited a peak density in 10-year-old gaps [102]. In southern Appalachian spruce-fir forests, yellow birch seedlings were the most abundant species in gap plots but not in closed-canopy plots. They exhibited the highest growth rate of any species in gaps [122]. The origin of the gap is apparently important; in upper Michigan, yellow birch apparently failed to establish readily in gaps formed by stem breakage because soil was undisturbed [87]. Yellow birch decreased between 1964 and 1986 in red spruce-Fraser fir (Abies fraseri) stands, even though there was loss of the Fraser fir to insect attack [18].\n\nYellow birch seedlings do not successfully compete with advance regeneration of other northern hardwood species, grasses, and forbs [32]. However, in sugar maple-beech-yellow birch forests, seedlings of the three dominants were approximately equally abundant [40]. In mature hemlock-hardwood forests in New York, yellow birch was the third most common seedling species, distributed randomly as to canopy type [26]. Yellow birch seedlings tend to occur in clumps. The abundance of yellow birch seedlings in Quebec was almost always negatively correlated to that of other tree species even though its seed abundance was positively related to that of other species [57]. Sugar maple seedlings produce an allelopathic substance that inhibits the root growth of yellow birch seedlings [112].\n\nEarly Successional Stands: Yellow birch is a common early to mid-successional associate in aspen-birch stands [28]. In northern hardwood ecosystems, yellow birch reaches maximum importance levels within 15 years of disturbance, and those levels are maintained for at least 100 years [81]. On Isle Royale, Michigan, a paper birch-dominated stand that originated after fire early in this century is undergoing canopy invasion by sugar maple and yellow birch [50]. In New Hampshire, succession was monitored after experimental deforestation and 3 years of vegetation suppression. Yellow birch comprised 0.6 percent of total biomass in the first year of succession, and increased to 11.8 percent in the nineteenth year [97]. Second-growth stands usually contain approximately the same percentage of yellow birch as virgin stands [32]. Yellow birch occurs on fine till with importance peaking at about 80 years. On sandy soils, the trend is indistinct, probably declining over time [71]. On old fields in Tennessee, succession included small amounts of yellow birch in 15-year-old stands. Yellow birch occurred at maximum density on 42- and 48-year-old plots, was present in lower numbers on the 63-year-old plot, and was not present in the old-growth plots [21].\n\nMid- to Late-Successional Stands: Yellow birch is abundant in mid- to late-successional balsam fir-yellow birch-paper birch-white spruce (Picea glauca) stands on Isle Royale [50]. It is a major gap-phase component of sugar maple-beech-yellow birch and hemlock-yellow birch cover types [32]. The age distribution of yellow birch in a virgin northern hardwoods forest was somewhat irregular: There were many 10-year-old saplings, no 40-year-old trees, and many 100-year-old trees [69]. In Wisconsin, even-aged northern hardwoods contain a high proportion of yellow birch and uneven-aged stands tend towards pure sugar maple [80]. In many old-growth stands, yellow birch gradually decreases in importance as the stand ages. In Tennessee, in both hemlock-mixed forest and mixed deciduous forest, yellow birch decreased between 1935 and 1987 in undisturbed stands [17].\n\nClimax Stands: Cary [128] described a climax forest in Maine consisting of red spruce, American beech, maples, and yellow birch. Hansen and others [50] described a yellow birch-sugar maple type as the climax forest on Isle Royale, Michigan. These forests have not experienced major disturbances for more than 120 years and include yellow birch of up to 150 years of age [50]. Yellow birch was present in old-growth forests in New York. The average ages of yellow birch trees in two stands were 200 and 250 years [75]. Forcier [40] explained the presence of yellow birch in climax stands as a combination of longevity and micro-succession. At the single tree level, yellow birch is replaced by sugar maple which is replaced by beech, which, following a small-scale disturbance, is replaced by yellow birch [40].\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nRegeneration Processes\n\nYellow birch reproduces primarily by seed; seedlings and young saplings will sprout but sprouts are weak and short lived. Older trees do not sprout [32,74].\n\nReproductive Age and Seed Crop Production: Under normal conditions, yellow birch first reproduces at about 40 years. Optimum seed production occurs at about 70 years of age. However, seeds have been produced by 7-year-old open-grown saplings, and heavy seed crops have been produced by 30- to 40-year-old yellow birch in open-grown positions or in thinned stands. Yellow birch produces good seed crops at 1- to 4-year intervals, usually with very little seed produced in intervening years [1,32]. Out of every 10 years, yellow birch averages 1 heavy seed year, 3.5 medium years, 4.5 light or very light years, and 1 year of seed failure [82]. The maximum number of successive good crops was 4 years [45]. Yellow birch is a prolific seed producer, and viability is usually good [32], although seed quality is variable from year to year [60,82]. Seed longevity up to 8 years has been achieved under laboratory conditions; under natural conditions viability drops off rapidly the second year [58,60]. However, Roberts and Dong [99] reported that a substantial amount of yellow birch regeneration was derived from 2-year-old seed.\n\nSeed Dispersal: Yellow birch seed is disseminated by wind, most of the seed falling after cold weather begins. The winged nutlets may travel up to 1,320 feet (400 m) over crusted snow [32]. Effective dispersal is approximately 2 to 4 times tree height [74]. Korstian [65] estimated that if yellow birch seeds are released from 50 feet (15 m), in a 5 mile per hour wind, 50 percent will fall within 700 feet (213 m) of the release point, and 90 percent within 820 feet (250 m).\n\nSeedling Establishment and Growth: Yellow birch seedlings require overhead light, crown expansion space, and plentiful soil moisture and nutrients to compete with faster growing associates; conditions found in gaps are conducive to yellow birch seedling establishment [1,32]. Some shade improves seedling survival [82]. In one study, heavily shaded (14-25% of full sun) yellow birch seedlings grew taller and had more leaf area than those in full sun, but unshaded seedlings accumulated more biomass [127]. Mortality of yellow birch seedlings is usually very high [121]. In one study, minimum mortality was estimated as 97 percent 14 months after germination. Seedling survival is better on disturbed microsites; seedlings that germinate on litter are unlikely to survive [26,40]. Seedlings surviving their first year survive to sapling and larger stages only where there is sufficient light [121]. Surviving seedlings in hemlock-northern hardwood forests occur on microhabitats with slightly lower canopy cover than in the surrounding area, primarily under coniferous rather than mixed canopies [26]. Growth is better on humus over sandy loams than on decayed logs, mineral soil, or litter [124].\n\nVegetative Reproduction: Greenwood cuttings of yellow birch have been successfully rooted and overwintered. Propagation by grafting is also possible [32].\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nReaction to Competition\n\nYellow birch is generally considered intermediate in shade tolerance and competitive ability (45). It is more shade tolerant than the other native birches, but less tolerant than its major associates, sugar maple (Acer saccharum), beech (Fagus grandifolia), and hemlock (Tsuga). Yellow birch is the major gap-phase component of the forest cover types Sugar Maple- Beech-Yellow Birch and Hemlock-Yellow Birch. It cannot regenerate under a closed canopy; it must have soil disturbance and an opening in the canopy (125). It tends to be stable on moist sites but gives way with age to more tolerant species on dry sites.\n\nYellow birch is often a pioneer species following fires but is usually less abundant than aspen (Populus), pin cherry (Prunus pensylvanica), and paper birch (Betula papyrifera). Birch seedlings cannot compete successfully with advance regeneration, grass, and herbaceous plants. An allelopathic relation between yellow birch and sugar maple seedlings has been noted (118). Advance sugar maple regeneration offers the stiffest competition in the Sugar Maple-Beech-Yellow Birch cover type, while red maple (Acer rubrum) sprouts are the most serious problem on wetter sites in the Lake States.\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nRooting Habit\n\nYellow birch has an adaptable well-developed, extensive lateral root system. Its roots are capable of either spreading horizontally through shallow soils or penetrating to depths of more than 1.5 rn (5 ft) under favorable conditions. Roots often follow old root channels in compacted soil layers. Rooting patterns of older trees in unmanaged stands may be modified by their origin on decayed wood and stumps (fig. 3). Within- and between-tree root grafting is common in birch (42).\n\nIrregularly distributed lateral roots of sapling and pole-size trees often extend well beyond their crown perimeters (120). Most root systems have irregular circular or oval shapes. Roots of trees on slopes are usually concentrated along the contour and the uphill side of the stem. Main laterals are close to the soil surface and usually have one or two sinker roots within 1.8 m (6 ft) of the stem. These sinkers often penetrate to impervious layers (53). Replacement root growth is active from leafout (May 5) until late October in southern New Hampshire (99).\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nLife History and Behavior\n\nCyclicity\n\nPhenology\n\nThe pistillate catkins of yellow birch form in the fall, and finish development from late May to early June. The fruit ripens from late August to early September [32]. The phenology of yellow birch in northern Minnesota was reported as follows [4]:\n\nflower appearance April 2 to May 16 initial bud swell April 6 to May 1 leaf out May 3 to May 25 anthesis May 13 to May 29 seed fall (initiation) August 6 leaf fall September 26 to October 4\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nSeedling Development\n\nYellow birch seeds dispersed in the fall and winter germinate at warm temperatures in early June. Germination is epigeal. In undisturbed stands, yellow birch can only regenerate on mossy logs, decayed wood, rotten stumps, cracks in boulders, and windthrown hummocks because hardwood leaf litter is detrimental to its survival elsewhere (45). In June most seeds germinate in compacted leaf litter that birch radicals and hypocotyls cannot pierce (10). Drying of the litter during the growing season kills most germinants. The remaining seedlings later succumb to frost damage or are smothered by the next leaf fall.\n\nUnless stands have been burned or heavily disturbed by blowdowns or logging, abundant birch regeneration is normally restricted to edges of skidroads or landing areas on well-drained sites. On less-well-drained soils, sufficient moisture remains in the leaf litter to result in adequate establishment if advance regeneration of other species is removed (117).\n\nThe most important factors affecting the catch of yellow birch seedlings are an adequate seed supply, favorable weather, proper seedbed conditions, adequate light, and control of competition.\n\nRemoving advance regeneration is at least as important as preparing proper seedbeds (121). Scarification fulfills both requirements and, when coupled with opening of the canopy, can greatly increase the initial catch of birch seedlings (45). Optimum seedling survival and growth, however, occur on disturbed humus or mixed humus mineral soil seedbeds in the absence of advance regeneration (126).\n\nMechanical scarification and prescribed burning are used to prepare receptive seedbeds and eliminate advance regeneration. Scarification should be shallow to mix humus and mineral soil and to expose 50 to 75 percent of the area (46,88). Spring burning during and shortly after leafout in years with abundant male birch catkins may also control competition from advanced regeneration and provide seed for successful birch regeneration. Treatments should coincide with good seed crops because the effects of scarification are largely lost after two or three growing seasons.\n\nUnder dense forest canopies (13 and 15 percent of full sunlight) yellow birch roots grow slower than sugar maple seedlings (81). As a result, few yellow birch become established under selection cutting (43).\n\nThe optimum light level for top growth and root development of birch seedlings up to 5 years old is 45 to 50 percent of full sunlight (43). The best root-to-shoot ratios are also produced at similar light levels (86). In field studies, the greatest 2-year height growth occurred at the lowest canopy density of 0 to 14 percent, and on mixed humus and mineral soil seedbeds it occurred under canopy densities between 29 and 50 percent (123). Moderate side shade is beneficial to birch seedlings during their first 5 years (124).\n\nClearcutting small patches or strips provides suitable conditions for yellow birch seedling establishment in the Northeast where rainfall is abundant. Scarified clearcut patches of 0.04 to 0.24 ha (0.1 to 0.6 acre) produce good catches of birch regeneration. Patches are difficult to manage but can be used in uneven-aged management to increase the proportion of birch (43) when groups of mature or defective trees are harvested (85).\n\nIn the dry western part of the species range, success with strip clearcutting to regenerate birch has been too variable to generally recommend its use. In Upper Michigan success depends on a good seed crop, favorable weather, and control of advance regeneration (89). Although strips 20 and 40 in (66 and 132 ft) wide were equally well stocked with birch seedlings after 6 or 7 years in Michigan, strips 20 in (66 ft) wide are about optimum in Canada (10), and strips 15 in (50 ft) wide are recommended in the Northeast (43).\n\nClearcuttings of 2 to 4 ha (5 to 10 acres) and uniform selection cuttings are not as effective as smaller patches or the shelterwood method for establishing yellow birch stands (87,90). In the western part of its range, birch regenerates best under shelterwood cuttings (48,121). Ten well-distributed yellow birch seed trees per hectare (4/acre) provide an adequate seed supply (88). Otherwise, 0.56 kg/ha (0.5 lb/acre) of stratified (6 to 8 weeks at 5' C (41' C) birch seed can be applied about a week after site preparation in May (46) or unstratified seed can be sown before January (48).\n\nYellow birch seedling growth in the Northeast is limited by inadequate soil fertility in acid sandy subsoils and can be greatly improved by deep fertilizing with phosphorus and lime to correct phosphorus deficiency and aluminum toxicity (61). Aluminum is toxic to roots, especially in subsoils, deficient in magnesium and sulfur. Seedling roots are tolerant of aluminum concentrations or up to 80 p/m but concentration of 120 p/m or more are toxic (84).\n\nManganese toxicity in seedlings occurs above foliar concentrations of more than 1,300 p/m; concentrations of less than 60 p/m are deficient; and 440 p/m are optimum (64).\n\nOptimum nursery seedbed density is about 160 seedlings per square meter (15/ft²) (45). Normally 2-0 stock averaging 28 cm (11 in) tall with roots 23 cm (9 in) long and 5 mm (0.2 in) in stem caliper is large enough for dormant spring planting. For early starts in the greenhouse, seedlings require at least 2 months of cold storage to break dormancy (34). Containerized planting is feasible (11,50,115). In 3 months seedlings 40 to 50 cm (16 to 20 in) tall can be produced in the greenhouse using 20-hour days with supplemental cool-white fluorescent and incandescent light (17). Growth can also be accelerated by using plastic greenhouses (94).\n\nAfter 5 years, yellow birch seedlings are normally overtopped by faster-growing species and require complete release from overstory shading for best survival, growth, and quality development. Photosynthetic rates of overtopped seedlings are only 54 to 70 percent of those grown in full sunlight and their dry weights are 66 percent lower (82).\n\nBirch crop trees in Vermont and Michigan seedling stands (up to 2.5 cm or 1 in d.b.h.) have benefited from cleaning or early release (40,55). After 9 years, trees cleaned to within a 2.4 in (8 ft) radius of the bole radius in Michigan exhibited the best stem, crown, and branch characteristics. They averaged 2 cm (0.8 in) larger in d.b.h. and 0.5 rn (1.6 ft) taller than the control trees. Shoot growth of yellow birch partly depends upon current photosynthate (73). The shoot elongation period for released saplings (1.5-m or 5-ft radius) can be extended up to 30 days by making more light and moisture available to them (55).\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nSeed Production and Dissemination\n\nNormally, 40 years is considered the minimum and 70 years the optimum seed-bearing age for yellow birch (45), but heavy seed crops are also produced by 30- to 40-year-old trees in either open-grown positions or thinned stands. However, open-grown progeny test saplings with large crowns bear viable seed at 7 years and male catkins at 8 years (21). Germinable seed has also been obtained from 16-year-old trees 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) in d.b.h. and 6.7 to 7.6 rn (22 to 25 ft) tall.\n\nGood seed crops usually occur at about 2 to 3 year intervals but the frequency of good or better seed crops varies-every 1 to 4 years in northeastern Wisconsin (47), and every 2 to 3 years in Maine, and every 3 years in Ontario (10). Consecutive good or better seed crops only occurred once in the 26-year Wisconsin study; 60 percent of the intervening crops failed or were poor. Seed-crop failures are often caused by hard frost in late spring or early fall or by insects and disease. The percentage of viable seeds produced varies each year and can be very low due to a high proportion of seedcoats without embryos, probably caused by parthenocarpy (14). Seed viability is often affected by weather conditions during pollination, fertilization, and seed development. It also varies by locality, stand, and individual trees within the same stand.\n\nAlthough some seeds fall shortly after they mature in August, the first heavy seedfall in Canada and the northern United States comes with cold weather in October. Contrary to earlier reports, larger seeds are not shed first nor is their germination capacity any better than that of smaller filled seeds (17).\n\nYellow birch seeds are light, averaging 99,200/kg (45,000/lb) (8). They are dispersed by the wind and blown up to 400 m (1,320 ft) over crusted snow (10). Dispersal of adequate amounts for regeneration is at least 100 m (330 ft) from the edge of a fully stocked mature northern hardwood stand.\n\nYellow birch is a prolific seeder, producing between 2.5 and 12.4 million seeds per hectare (1 to 5 million/acre) in good seed years (45), and up to 89 million/ha (36 million/acre) in a bumper seed year (52). Seed viability is usually good in years with heavy seed crops and poor in years with light crops. Germinative capacity in good seed years is still low, however, averaging about 20 percent under natural conditions.\n\nThe next seed crop can be estimated from the abundance of the overwintering male catkins (88). Fairly reliable estimates of the fall yellow birch seed crop can also be obtained from the size of the spring-maturing red maple crop (47).\n\nYellow birch seedcoats contain a water-soluble germination inhibitor that is inactivated by light (17). Seed dormancy can be broken down artificially either by stratifying the seed in moist peat or sand at 5° C (41° F) for 4 to 8 weeks or by germinating unchilled seeds in a water medium under \"cool-white\" fluorescent light for more than 20 days. Germination test results are always higher when unchilled rather than stratified seeds are used (8). Following stratification, seeds are germinated at alternating day and night temperatures of 32° C and 15° C (90° F and 59° F) for 30 to 40 days, and alternating temperature of 30° C and 20° C (86° F and 68° F) with at least 8-hour light periods are used for unchilled seeds. Germination percentages exceeding 90 percent are common in good seed years.\n\nSeeds can be stored in tightly closed bottles at from 2 to 4° C (36 to 40° F) for 4 years without losing viability (17). Some seed lots stored well for 8 years and one lot still had 65 percent germination after 12 years (19).\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nMolecular Biology and Genetics\n\nMolecular Biology\n\nBarcode data: Betula alleghaniensisManagement considerations\n\nNumerous management guidelines for yellow birch and yellow birch-containing types [43,46,73,111], and recommendations for silvicultural treatments [68,98,113,114] are available in the literature. Shaw [104] reported on management considerations for wildlife in northern hardwoods.\n\nHarvest System and Regeneration: Yellow birch regenerates primarily by germination; very little advance regeneration is usually present [38,60]. Early twentieth century logging practices that favored shade tolerant species resulted in a decrease in yellow birch [84]. The effects of different harvesting systems and conditions on yellow birch regeneration have been studied and reviewed [70,92,109]. Harvest should coincide with good seed years [99]. Clearcutting small patches or strips provides suitable conditions for yellow birch seedling establishment in the Northeast [32,38,74,82,84]. Yellow birch reproduces well on patch cuttings of up to 0.3 acre (0.12 ha) [43]. In New Hampshire, strip cutting failed to increase the proportion of yellow birch in the stand but it did increase the percentage of yellow birch likely to become crop trees [47]. Group selection can significantly increase the proportion of yellow birch by creating openings for yellow birch regeneration [27,83]. In New Hampshire, after 38 years of group selection yellow birch comprised one-quarter to one-third of the trees in the 4- to 12-inch d.b.h. class. The pretreatment proportion was not reported; however, under single-tree selection yellow birch will usually decline to less than 20 percent, and sometimes to less than 10 percent, of stocking [27,72]. In the Great Lakes States, 20 years after group selection yellow birch had not increased in proportion to other species [34]. Shelterwood systems designed to increase the proportion of yellow birch have been investigated [46,49,64,115].\n\nSeedbed Preparation: Scarification of seedbeds improves yellow birch seedling establishment [38], although the effects may be short-lived if organic matter is scraped away rather than mixed in with the mineral soil [64]. Yellow birch can be direct seeded after harvest in the northern hardwood forest zone [45].\n\nHarvesting Considerations: Yellow birch is windfirm on deep, well-drained loam and sandy loam soils, but is subject to windthrow on shallow, poorly drained soils. It is susceptible to winter sunscald [32]. Yellow birch is sensitive to high soil temperatures and sudden exposure [43]. It is also susceptible to root, stem, and crown injury due to logging and is subject to insect attack as a consequence of injury. Top dieback and some mortality occur after heavy cuts in mature and overmature stands [32].\n\nDamaging Agents: Yellow birch is susceptible to ice and snow load damage, and young trees are vulnerable to late spring frosts. Yellow birch is susceptible to injury at 3.5 ppm sulfur dioxide but is tolerant of ozone at 0.25 ppm [32]. Hacker and Renfro [48] rated yellow birch as slightly sensitive to ozone. Top dieback sometimes occurs following heavy seed crops [32]. Heavy or repeated browsing by deer and moose kills small yellow birch. Sometimes browsing prevents regeneration [62]. In New York, growth of yellow birch was not detected on postharvest plots that were unfenced [11]. Porcupine feeding damages birch crowns, reduces wood quality, and is sometimes fatal. Red squirrel cut new germinants [32]. Heavy feeding by yellow-bellied sapsucker reduces growth, lowers wood quality, and is sometimes fatal [32].

Heavy feeding by porcupine and yellow-bellied sapsucker reduces growth, lowers wood quality, and is sometimes fatal.\n\nHeavy cuts in older stands may be followed by top dieback and mortality. Recently isolated trees, in particular, are subject to wind throw on shallow soils and susceptible to winter sunscald. All are sensitive to high soil temperatures. Harvest of yellow birch timber should coincide with good seed years, because the trees regenerate primarily by germination, and openings for regeneration should be provided.\n\nYellow birch can be grown from seed relatively easily. Artificial propagation can be done through greenwood cuttings and by grafting.\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nRelevance to Humans and Ecosystems\n\nBenefits\n\nPalatability\n\nYellow birch was listed as a highly preferred browse species in northern hardwood forests [110]. In New Hampshire, white-tailed deer browsed birch twigs (both yellow birch and paper birch) at a browse index rate of approximately 4 (i.e., four times the expected rate based on availability) [104].\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nValue for rehabilitation of disturbed sites\n\nEarly colonizers of a site denuded of vegetation by brine (used for well-injection fluid) included yellow birch.

The wood is heavy, strong, and close-grained. It is used for furniture, cabinetry, charcoal, pulp [14], interior finish, veneer, tool handles [29], boxes, woodenware, and interior doors [32].\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nCultivation\n\nThe preference is full or partial sun, moist to mesic conditions, and soil containing loam or sandy loam. This tree is slow-growing and typically lives for about 150 years (unless it is prematurely killed by insects, disease, or other causes). However, the longevity of some trees can extend to 300 years or more. Hot dry weather during the summer can impair the health of this tree.\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nUses\n\nThe wood of yellow birch is heavy, strong, close-grained, even-textured, and shows a wide color variation, from reddish brown to creamy white. It is used for furniture, cabinetry, charcoal, pulp, interior finish, veneer, tool handles, boxes, woodenware, and interior doors. The wood can be stained and takes a high polish. Yellow birch is one of the principal hardwoods used in the distillation of wood alcohol, acetate of lime, charcoal, tar, and oils.\n\nDeer consume large numbers of yellow birch seedlings in summer and prefer green leaves and woody stems in fall. Moose, white-tailed deer, and snowshoe hare also browse yellow birch. The seeds are eaten by various songbird species, and ruffed grouse feed on seeds, catkins, and buds. Red squirrel cut and store mature catkins and eat the seeds. Beaver and porcupine chew the bark.\n\nThe sap of yellow birch can be tapped for use as edible syrup. Tea is sometimes made from the twigs and/or inner bark.\n\nYellow birch sees limited use in landscape plantings, partly because it may be relatively hard to locate at local nurseries. It is a good lawn tree, providing relatively light shade, and it has showy bark and fall\n\nfoliage colors. It also is a good edge tree for naturalized areas. Although yellow birch grows best in full sun, cherry birch is better suited to hotter or drier sites.\n\nIt is a medium-sized deciduoustree reaching 20 m tall (exceptionally to 30 m) with a trunk up to 80 cm diameter. The bark is smooth, yellow-bronze, flaking in fine horizontal strips, and often with small black marks and scars. The twigs, when scraped, have a slight scent of oil of wintergreen, though not as strongly so as the related Sweet Birch. The leaves are alternate, ovate, 6-12 cm long and 4-9 cm broad, with a finely serrated margin. The flowers are wind-pollinated catkins 3-6 cm long, the male catkins pendulous, the female catkins erect. The fruit, mature in fall, is composed of numerous tiny winged seeds packed between the catkin bracts.\n\nArticle rating\nfrom 0 people\n\nNotes\n\nComments\n\nBetula alleghaniensis is a characteristic tree of the northern Appalachians and the hemlock hardwoods forest of the Great Lakes region. It was formerly widely known by the illegitimate (superfluous) name B . lutea F. Michaux.\n\nNative Americans used Betula alleghaniensis medicinally as an emetic or cathartic, to remove bile from intestines, as a blood purifier, as a wash for \"Italian itch,\" and as a diuretic (D. E. Moerman, as Betula lutea ).\n\nBetula alleghaniensis is very closely related to B . lenta , which it resembles in many features (T. L. Sharik and R. H. Ford 1984). A distinctive feature is usually its freely exfoliating bark, although in certain populations the bark remains close and dark (B. P. Dancik 1969; B. P. Dancik and B. V. Barnes 1971).\n\nBetula alleghaniensis Britton × B . papyrifera Marshall has seldom been reported, but it may actually be more common than realized in the northeastern states. In most features it is intermediate between the parents (B. V. Barnes et al. 1974)."

Some species\nsuch as Acers have a number of growth spurts through the year,\nafter each which they require pruning back; other species such\nas Junipers require almost continual maintenance pruning.\n\nWhen growing bonsai,\nit is nearly always found that the top of the tree grows faster\nthan the bottom due to apical dominance. One method of deciding\nhow and when to carry out maintenance pruning is to allow new\nbuds to extend a certain number of internodes (leaves), before\npruning them back, according to their position on the tree.\n\nStrong, vigorous\ngrowth near the top of the tree, and the outer edges of the branches\nis only allowed to extend 3 to 4 internodes before being pruned\nback to the first internode. Growth within the middle area of\nthe tree is allowed to extend slightly further before being pruned\nback to the second or third internode, allowing the shoot to retain\nmore strength. Growth on the inner and lower branches is allowed\nto develop still further extension before pruning back to 3 or\n4 internodes.\n\nThe effect of pruning\nthis way is to overcome the effects of apical growth, strengthening\nthe inner and lower growth whilst holding back the upper and outer\nbranches. This technique results in a more even spread of energy\nthroughout the tree.\n\nOne effect of pruning\nharder in the apical areas than the weak, lower areas of the tree\nis that the bonsai retains a triangular silhouette as can be seen\nin the diagram.\n\nAs each new shoot\nis pruned, 2 or more new, smaller shoots emerge in its place.\nRepeating the process of maintenance pruning throughout the year\nproduces increasing numbers of smaller shoots, which produce a\ndense 'pad' of foliage.\n\nA developing tree\nthat requires increased trunk or branch thickness can be allowed\nto extend uninhibited for a period before being pruned back. This\nwill allow the branch to thicken and to a limited extent, the\ntrunk, from the point where the branch emanates, downwards. If\nleft completely unpruned however, the tree will become coarse\nand lose its shape.\n\nScissor Trimming\n\nTrimming deciduous\ntrees with scissors is straightforward as long as time and care\nis taken. Scissors should be used to cut stems and not leaves;\nany kind of leaf that is cut will quickly brown off and look untidy.\n\nEach shoot that needs\npruning back should be held by its top and cut through the stem\nimmediately above an internode/leaf"

(And the other way around too.)\n\nOver the years, all kinds of plants have been experimented with as bonsai in different climates. Ask around before you waste your time and money on plants that won't work for you.\n\nBonsai tree types vary from zone to zone.\n\nPlants for Bonsai\n\nThere is no way to list all the many types of bonsai trees, so, I will begin with some of the most popular:\n\nJuniper\n- is perhaps the most recognized of bonsai tree types. It was made popular with the public in a movie, and became known as \"The Karate Kid\" bonsai. The plant itself often has a tree-look and can quickly give the appearance of nature in miniature.\n\nButtonwood -\nThere are many types of bonsai trees collected in the tropics.\n\nThe Conocarpus erectus, native to the Florida Keys, is one of the most popular.\n\nBougainvillea\nis one of the best types of bonsai trees to grow for flowers. It\nis also one of the easier tropicals to grow.\n\nFicus\n- or figs, as they are also known, are one of the most popular plants\nused for indoor bonsai. (There are over 100 varieties.) They are a\nfavorite for styling canopy style bonsai throughout tropical areas all over the world.\n\nFukien Tea\n- Two varieties are commonly used. Both have glossy leaves, are woody, branch easily, have small leaves and bloom periodically throughout the year. The smaller leaf variety is slow to develop a trunk, but bears tiny red fruit prolifically.\n\nChrysanthemum\nbonsai are not very popular in Western culture and there are reasons. However, some bonsai artists love them ... John Capobianco and Dale Cochoy are two of them. See their articles.\n\nThe Chinese elm\nis a favorite of growers everywhere. Beginners especially like it, because it's so easy to\ncare for. Many different styles can be created through pruning, with\nlittle effort.\n\nBald Cypress - (Taxodium distichum) bonsai, is especially popular in the southeastern areas of the United States where it is most common in the wild.\n\nJade Bonsai\n- Portulacaria afra is much easier to develop as a bonsai tree than the \"common jade\" plant Crassula argentea. It has shorter internodes and much smaller leaves.\n\nIt is especially favored by\nbeginners because It is one of the most difficult to kill.\n\nTropical Mimosa\nbonsai are created from the Leucaena glauca, easily and quickly grown from seed. (This is not the temperate Albizzia, known as the silk tree.)\n\nTamarind Bonsai trees are very sturdy tropicals. They tolerate heavy pruning,\nextensive root manipulation, wiring and even a little neglect.\n\nSea Grape Bonsai -\nare large leaf plants.

Not only an age-old tradition–Queen Liliuokalani is known to have planted royal palms on Arbor Day each year–planting trees also protects our environment by limiting the need for air conditioning.\n\nAccording to HECO Spokesperson Janet Crawford, trees provide passive cooling to homes when they block the hot sun, reducing A/C usage by 15–50 percent. Trees also help clean the air and prevent soil erosion, but on top of that, the giveaway aims to draw attention to the safety aspect of keeping mature trees away from power lines. \"Electricity can arc 10 feet to reach a pathway to the ground,\" says Crawford, which means that trees need to be planted where fruit pickers, branches, children and kites won't cross that 10-foot boundary.\n\nSince 1993, more than 20,000 trees have been distributed in Hawaii on Arbor Day. Of the 2,700 trees to be given away this year on Oahu (specifically cultivated for this event by Kaulunani Urban and Community Forestry Program, the UH Urban Garden Center and Papahana Kualoa), three new species will make their arbor debut: gardenia Aimee Yoshioka, Munroidendron racemosum (endemic to Kauai) and red sealing wax palm. Typical fruit trees such as pomegranate, mountain apple and fig, along with Tahitian gardenia, puakenikeni and many others will also be available, but arrive early to snatch up your flora before they're all gone (only one plant per family will be given while supplies last, but the UH Urban Garden Center and Waimea Valley will hold plant sales as well).\n\nWhether you're unfamiliar with proper plant care, are just starting out or want some extra tips, certified arborists can help you choose the right tree or shrub for you and your family"

If you employ some of the\nfollowing preserving techniques, you can hold on to your prized\ncollection of leaves until well after the trees are bare and\nground frozen.\n\nTake your leaf and stick it\nbetween two pieces of wax paper. Cover with an old towel,\ncloth or piece of paper and use an iron, set to warm, to seal\nthe two pieces of wax paper together. Avoid scorching the leaf\nby keeping the iron moving at all times. Allow it to cool at\nfirst and then trim around your leaf. Be sure to leave a\nnarrow margin around the leaf so the paper stays sealed.\n\nMake a solution of glycerin\nand water. Use twice as much water as you do glycerin. Pour\ninto a flat pan and completely cover your leaves with the\nwater and glycerin solution. If your leaves float, you will\nhave to weight them down. Let them set for up to six days. The\nleaves slowly absorb the solution, which makes them soft and\nflexible for many years.\n\nDry leaves in the microwave by\nlaying them between two paper towels. If it is possible,\nyou'll want to set your microwave's power setting to medium or\nlow. Now run the microwave for between 30 and 90 seconds,\ndepending on the dryness of the leaves. You'll want to keep a\nclose eye on them to prevent over heating. Note: this is one\nmethod I haven't tried, be warned.\n\nThe most common way is first\nto find a big book. Doing this may ruin the pages, so you'll\nwant to use an old book that is of little value to you. If\nyour leaves are wet to the touch, place them in a sunny window\nuntil they are dry. Putting wet leaves increases the\nodds of just getting green fuzzy moldy leaves. Place the dry leaves\nin the book with a paper towel or blotting paper in contact\nwith the front and back or the leaf. You can place many\nleaves in a book, so long as there are several pages between each set of leaves. If you put more than one leaf to a\npage, take care not to overlap them. Keep the leaves in the\nbook for about 7 days, longer for larger or moister leaves.\nYou may want to replace the paper towels on the second or\nthird day."

      "text": "The Meaning of Bonsai\n\nBonsai literally translates as \"a tree in a pot\", however simply potting a tree or bush does\nnot\nnecessarrily make it a bonsai.\nA bonsai is not chemically treated to stop it from growing larger\nnor having its growth stunted by confining the roots in the\npot, but through prudent clipping\ntrimming\nand\ntraining. A bonsai does not have to be old but does get better with age and the right\ncare. Bonsai is the portrayal of a natural tree in a miniature form.\nWhat is important is the illusion\nof age and size.\n\nA bonsai may consist of a tree, shrub, vine or multiple trees but is still refered to as a bonsai. You never\nneed to say bonsai tree because bonsai already includes the tree. Another element of bonsai\nincludes a pot which fits harmoniously with the tree to create a tree-like image. To enhance\nor create the illusion of age, specimens are usually chosen with attributes such as gnarled\nand twisted shapes, good branch ramification, exposed roots and even trunks stripped almost\ncompletely bare of their bark.\n\nClassic Bonsai Styles\n\nBonsai have been generaly classified and defined in a number of styles each owning it's own\nset of rules.\n\nFormal Upright Bonsai or Chokkan- An upright trunk tapering from base to tip.\nBranches should be either\nhorizantal or sloping downwards. Additionally\nbranches should be arranged alternating\neither side of the trunk and every\nthird branch to the rear.\n\nInformal Upright Bonsai or Moyogi- A variation of the formal upright which\nallows for either curving\nof the trunk or curvation of the trunk.\n\nSlanting Bonsai or Shakan- Another variation of the formal upright only this\ntree is normally slanting\nto one side or the other.\n\nBroom Style Bonsai or Hokidachi- This style bonsai is shaped with all\nbranches emerging from the top of a straight\ntrunk and tapering to the ends\nforming a rounded head of foliage.\n\nWindswept Bonsai or Fukinagashi- The idea in creating a windswept\nbonsai is to imitate the movement of a tree\nwhich has been exposed to high\nwinds. Every branch of a good windswept bonsai should be\nswept in the same\ndirection in a natural looking way.\n\nCascade Bonsai or Kengai- A cascade bonsai trunk must fall below the\nbase of the pot. This can capture\nthe image of a tree living high on a cliff.\n\nSemi-Cascade Bonsai or Han-Kengai- Similar to the cascade representing\na tree clinging to a cliff face. The\nrule for semi-cascade bonsaiis that the lowest\npoint of the tree must be below the rim of\nthe pot but not it's base.\n\nLiterati Bonsai or Bunjingi- With the shape of an ancient pine which has\nshed it's lower branches the focal\npoint is it's trunk which should show great age\nand character.\n\nTwisted Trunk Bonsai or Bankan- As the name implies a twisted trunk\nbonsai is any tree with an exagerated\nmain trunk such as a s-shape or free form.\nMost mass produced imported bonsai are grown in\nthe s- shaped style although\nthese are seldom accepted in classic bonsai.\n\nTwin Trunk Bonsai or Shoju- A twin trunk bonsai replicates a tree with two\ntrunks, one being smaller than\nthe other, which join together at it's base.\n\nRoot-on-Rock Bonsai or Ishitsuki- The importance of this style is that a\nrock is used in place of a pot.\nThe rock may stand in a dish or water tray. The\nroots of the tree should appear to be or\nactually be growing in a crevice or\nhollow\nof the rock. Multiple trees can be grown on a\nsingle rock as long as it\nkeeps the\nappearance of a natural landscape.\n\nRoot-Over-Rock Bonsai or Sekijoju- Imitating a tree growing in rocky\nterrain were soil has eroded,\nexposing the roots of the trees growing tightly\naround a rock. Root-Over-Rock bonsai are\ngeneraly planted in the ground for\nseveral years to allow the roots to thicken and tighten\naround the rock. The soil\nis slowly removed from the roots exposing them to sun and air for\nthe bark to\ndevelop characteristics of maturity.\n\nExposed-Root Bonsai- This bonsai style represents a tree grown on the side\nof a steep bank\nwhere soil has been washed away exposing it's roots.\n\nClump Style Bonsai or Kabudachi- Utilizing an odd number of trunks which\nshould vary in size growing on\nthe same roots. This style can be acheived\nthrough the use of shoots which arise naturally\nfrom the roots or through cutting\na trunk at the base and using the new shoots which arise\nfrom the stump.\n\nGroup Style Bonsai or Yose-ue- This bonsai style should include any\nnumber of trunks with the minimum\nbeing seven. Trunks should be of different\nsizes and arranged to give the appearance of\ndepth and perspective. No trunk\nshould be hidden by another when veied from the front. Tallest\ntrees should be\nplaced in the center, trunks on the outer edge should lean slightly outward.\nAlso no three trunks should form a straight line. This bonsai style represents a\nforest.\n\nRaft Style Bonsai or Ikadabuki- A raft style bonsai is one which has had\nall\nthe branches on on sine of\nthe tree removed then laid sideways in the ground\nso\nthe remaining branches become the new\ntrunks. By removing small strips of\nbark on the side buried in the ground, the bonsai will\nproduce new roots growng\nthe length of the original trunk. This bonsai style looks similar\nto the group style\nexcept it all grows from a single tree."

      "text": "Berkshire Events Blog\n\nFall Foliage Report - Foliage in the Berkshires\n\nMany people come to visit the Berkshires in the summer but the fall season is the absolute best to visit here. When the leaves turn from green to orange, red, brown and yellow colors is called Fall Foliage here. It has been reported as one of the warmest summers ever for Berkshire County, it has also been one of the driest which stresses out the trees and land, which may advance the time that the colors change, but have no doubt about it that we will have an extended leaf season starting around Columbus Day.\n\nAlthough it may be taking a little bit longer nature will do its part and have these beautiful leaves change in no time. Here is the chemistry behind Fall Foliage in BerkshireCounty: As summer daylight hours shorten and darkness lengthens, a hormone composed of a sugar-like substance travels down the stems of deciduous leaves to the point where they attach to the branches. There the hormone causes cells to stiffen; creating a ring that tightens around the stem, preventing the passage of water to the leaves. (That ring is visible at the end of a downed leaf stem.) Without water the chlorophyll cannot survive, so leaves stop manufacturing food and the green color that masks the yellow pigment of the leaves. In addition, in some species the hormone generates red but, contrary to the general perception, fall is primarily the time of unmasking rather than of adding color to leaves.\n\nThe entire process is so interesting; it only takes place in deciduous trees, those that drop their leaves all at once. In essence, the leaves are choked to death, yet with the golden promise that the trees themselves don't die and will sprout new leaves profusely in the spring. While cold nights assist the deciduous miracle, the timing depends primarily on day length. So cool!\n\nSo come visit the Berkshires during the fall season, it is worth it and so romantic and magical to just go for a walk and observe all that nature has to offer!"

Today, it is grown as a shade tree in urban areas, or at wet sites (ponds, creeks, drainage ditches, etc.) where it thrives and provides both erosion control and ornamental appeal.\n\nIts leaves easily flutter in the breeze, and forms are available that are cutleaf (leaves having deep sinuses that give them a much finer texture). In addition, columnar forms exist for narrow spaces.\n\nIn late winter, its emergent pendulous catkins sway in the breeze, providing early ornamental appeal. Trees found in the open may reach 60 feet tall by 25 feet wide. As a member of the Birch Family, it is related to the Birches, Hornbeams, Filberts, and Hophornbeams, in addition to other Alders.\n\nPlanting Requirements - European Black Alder is adaptable to a wide range of favorable or harsh environmental conditions. It prefers moist to wet soils of variable pH that are rich and deep, but adapts to average or poor soils that are dry in summer. Growth is especially rapid in occasionally wet to permanently wet areas, such as floodplains , streambanks, and ditches. Black Willow is a good companion tree with a much finer texture. It is a good pioneer species of cut-over sites, and will self-sow to form a colony of saplings within a few years of initial seed production. It grows in full sun to partial shade, and is found in zones 4 to 7.\n\nPotential Problems - European Black Alder, while capable of having a few minor disease and pest problems, is usually trouble-free.\n\nLeaf Identification Features\n\nEuropean Black Alder has a leaf that is atypical as compared to other Alders in that it is round in shape, rather than elliptical. In addition, some leaves have a distinct notch at the apex, which is not obvious until the leaves are fully expanded.\n\nAs one would expect from a member of the Birch Family, the glossy alternate leaves of European Black Alder easily flutter in the breezes of summer. Growth is rapid for this stately tree, which often goes from a pyramidal to flat-topped shape as it matures.\n\nOther Identification Features\n\nFormation of green male and female floral buds occurs by mid-summer on the same tree in European Black Alder (making it a monoecious species), and these structures become more obvious with the abscission of leaves in autumn.\n\nWith the warmer days of mid-winter, the male floral buds begin to elongate and are called catkins, while the female flowers often lie close by, looking like miniature knobs.\n\nThe fertilized female flowers become cone-like, green fruits by late spring, and as they grow throughout the summer, they often weight down the branchlets that support them.\n\nIn autumn, the seeds are released as the cones open, and by winter the remaining structures (called strobiles) persist on the twigs.\n\nVegetative buds of European Black Alder are more typical of all Alders, being distinctly valvate (also called duck-billed, where the twin bud scales come together like a duck's bill) and also clearly stalked on the winter twigs.\n\nThe immature bark found on the limbs of European Black Alder is dark gray, interrupted by long dark fissures.\n\nThis becomes black plates and scales with age on the trunks, exposing a lighter gray to gray-brown interior bark."

      "text": "About our trees\n\nAll our plant varieties have been chosen according to the climate here in the Rogue Valley of Southern Oregon. Almost all have been tested to thrive and produce\nfruit in this region. A few will need some protection in the event of an unusually cold winter, however most varieties will tolerate temperatures well below 0 degrees.\n\nWe offer our trees already established in containers,staked and pruned with training cuts to shape them according to the growth habit they need. Most can continue in containers or be planted in the garden at any time of the year except when the ground is actually frozen. Refer to our Planting Guide when you are ready to plant.\n\nWhat is a dwarf fruit tree ?\n\nA dwarf fruit tree is usually a proven variety of fruit tree that is grown on a dwarf or semi-dwarf\nrootstock.In other words the two trees are grafted together. The rootstock itself has been specially bred for characteristics of strong and vigorous root system, cold hardiness,disease resistance,early fruit production and especially the fact that the tree will be\nsignificantly smaller than a standard variety.\n\nThen a scion or shoot of the desired tree is grafted onto to this rootstock and the two become one.\nThe rootstock becomes the \"Brain or Command Center\" of the tree and dictates all of the above\ngenetic information to the tree in total. The fruit on the other hand will be identical to the tree that the scion or shoot was taken from.\n\nDwarf Fruit Trees are ideal for small spaces, gardens, patios, and orchards.\nMany orchards have changed over to using dwarf or semi dwarf trees for their ease of\nmanagement- no need to climb on large ladders to pick or prune. They are also achieving\nsignificantly higher yields per acre.\n\nBenefits of growing your own fruit\n\nSeveral fruits, like peaches, never ripen once picked. They are always picked early for\nease of shipping/storage and so most people never get to enjoy their true flavor. Nothing compares with the taste of fresh-picked fruit, fresh from the tree.\n\nDwarf Trees make great kids' projects. In recent times Mini-dwarf trees have been introduced\nthat only grow 4 - 6 ft.\n\nA dwarf tree can produce 50 to 100 pounds of fruit a season, depending on variety.\nIf one multiplies that by the current price per pound of market fruit we can see that a fruit tree\nis also a very worthwhile investment over the course of it's life.\nWho says that \"Money doesn't grow on Trees ! ? \""

      "text": "Sunday - February 13, 2011\n\nQUESTION:\n\nPinus strobus ( White Pine )-\nI wish to plant four of these evergreens along our property lines as a screen. Our county is selling one foot plants in a container. Our soil is clay. Are these trees suitable for our area ?\nThank you.\n\nANSWER:\n\nMr. Smarty Plants thinks you have a reasonably good choice there.\n\nPinus strobus (Eastern white pine) has a native population in North Carolina; however these natural stands appear to be primarily to the west and in the great Smokey Mountains. Depending on how clayey your soil is, you are correct to be concerned about how successful they will be. The plant record for the Eastern white pine indicates that its native habitat is upland, mesic sand or loam sites, north slopes, or rocky stream banks. The soils that they like are fertile, moist, well-drained soils, and like most pines they prefer an acidic soil. Do you have other pines living close successfully? If so, then the Eastern White Pine will likely do just fine there, especially if you give them loving care in the first two to three years as they establish themselves.\n\nIt strikes me that if the County is selling the trees, that is a fair indication that they can be planted successfully and also that you have knowledgeable people to ask about the success of growing that tree in your local area! However, if the folks selling the trees appear to be less than knowledgeable – you may want to go directly to the County Extension office. The Union County Extension has a nice website here.\n\nYou should have planting instructions that come with the trees. If not, here are the basics:\n\nDig the hole as deep as the tree is planted in its container. Make the hole wide so the roots will have plenty of room to grow. Cover the hole back with the original soil, mulch with some compost, making sure the mulch is pulled back 2 inches from the base of the tree. Water thoroughly and deeply.\n\nMore Trees Questions\n\nBugs on Arizona Cypress in Bellwood IL August 27, 2011 - I live in Illinois and have an Arizona Cypress that looks like it is dying but I notice today it has bugs inside its cone.

Apple trees have beautiful spring blossoms and there are many varieties that can grown in Northern or Southern climates. Most varieties require a second tree for cross-pollination.\n\nCherry. Cherry trees add vibrant color to the yard and attract birds that eat insects. There are tart and sweet varieties that do well in zones 4 to 8.\n\nPear. There are thousands of pear varieties, but only a few types that are sold in stores. Pear trees do best when not exposed to extreme heat or cold and, like apples, need other trees for cross-pollination.\n\nMandarin orange. Mandarin orange trees are best suited for the warm Southern climates of zones 8 to 11. Mandarins are hardier than other orange tree varieties.\n\nLemon. Lemon trees are a beautiful, fragrant addition to the yard. They do best in zones 8 to 10.\n\nPomegranate. Pomegranate trees are an attractive accent to any landscape.

Select your fruit tree based on the amount of sunlight or shade it needs.Apple trees require plenty of sunlight with good air circulation.Space the dwarf fruit trees so it don't get to overcrowded on the patio.\n\nPlanting is best done in late autumn.Protect the roots and keep them moist until they are planted. Reducing the size of the trees can be done in four ways.\n\nDwarf Cherry Tree\n\nDwarfing Rootstocks\n\nBranches of fruit trees are grafted to dwarf rootstocks to produce smaller trees.Their are several varieties of dwarfing rootstock available which restrict the tree's growth. For a backyard orchard, you can grow several smaller trees of your favorite fruit,one large tree with a few different varieties grafted on.\n\nSome dwarfing rootstocks are better suited for dry and poor soil, where other rootstocks will need high quality soil.Miniature or dwarfing root are not the same across all fruit varieties. You can produce 3 to four foot high dwarf apples, but a dwarf cherry is still a tree 18 to 20 feet tall.\n\nYour local nursery should be able to tell you what rootstock their dwarf fruit trees are grown on.Specialist nurseries will graft the varieties you want, on suitable rootstocks for your purpose. If you want a apple on a rootstock for a cordon or espalier, ask your fruit nursery if they can supply you with a particular variety and rootstock combination best suited for your soil, and the type of pruning you want to do.\n\nDwarfing Rootstocks\n\nGenetic Dwarf Fruit Trees\n\nGenetic dwarf trees are trees which are very short with fairly heavy branches.They are not regular sized trees made smaller and you may not be able to get your favorite apple or peach variety as a genetic dwarf. These are most often peaches, nectarines, almonds, apricots and apples,small enough to grow in pots. Depending where you live , they may need winter protection.\n\nGenetic Dwarf Fruit Tree\n\nControlled Pruning\n\nPruning methods produce fruit trees of a more manageable size. These trees may be on regular rootstock.Espaliers, where the tree are grown flat on a set of wires on a building or between posts, or cordons, where single straight branches are interwoven to create fence patterns are the two most common types of controlled pruning.Many miniature fruit trees can be espaliered or grown as a cordon which decorate fences or for growing flat against the protection of a wall.\n\nPruning Dwarf Fruit Tree\n\nControl Fruit Tree Growth in Pots\n\nFruit trees grown in Pots , with restricted soil and root growth, can be dwarfed in the same way a bonsai tree is dwarfed, with pruning of the roots and branches at the correct time of year. By growing the pot grown varieties on dwarfing rootstocks you can further restrict their size.\n\nMost fruit trees can be grown in large pots (10 to 15 inches),with the exception of cherries which need larger pots, up to 18 inches. Fruit in pots should be grown in fertile soil with 1/3 of the soil mix being perlite or vermiculite to keep the soil from getting waterlogged.You can use slow release fertilizer pellets, or feed them every two weeks with a high potassium liquid feeding . Fruit trees in pots should be repotted every year or two after leaf fall. When your tree has reached it's mature size, it should be root pruned every other year and replaced back in it'spot with roughly 20% new soil. Root pruning for this purpose should remove at least the outer inch of roots.\n\nhello, i have been trying to purchase dwarf fruit trees in south africa , but i have been unsuccessful. please inform me if you know of anyone selling dwarf fruit trees. your help will be highly appreciated. regards shabbir\n\nthanks DEON, i tried alot of nurseries in the durban area without success. i came across a site from america (plantogram ) , the ideal nursery for what i am looking for . they stock all types of dwarf fruit trees. i was amazed at the variety they carry . i wish we had a similar nursery in south africa . check it out for yourself and you also will be amazed. regards SHABBIR"

      "text": "It's easier to enjoy your garden if you're not enslaved by it\n\nDrought Hardy Plants\n\nWednesday, February 29, 2012\n\nWhen I discover a plant I really like I want to have more of them. But sometimes I want more then my budget can support. Fortunately, as gardeners we can save money by making our own plants.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to multiply plants is to grow new roots from the branches of shrubs and small trees. I'm not talking about taking cuttings or grafting or division. Those all have their pluses and minuses in the world of horticulture. I'm talking about an even easier technique called layering. I think it's one of the most underutilized propagation techniques in the garden today for shrubs and trees. It can work with shrubs like rhododendrons, camellias, daphnes and even small trees like juneberries and hollies.\n\nOther propagation techniques either require significant damage to the plant--such as division--or trying to start a plant without any roots—meaning cuttings--or trying to line up narrow pathways of the cambium—that's grafting.\n\nLayering gives the gardener and the new plant the best of both worlds: the new plant stays connected to the mama plant until it's ready to grow on its own. And there's no tricky work for the gardener. You can start a plant from layering in any season. Here, I'll show you how simple and reliable it is to layer a fig tree.\n\n1) First pick a few slender branches (no more than an inch or so thick) that bend easily and can touch the ground.\n\n2) Take your pocketknife and scrape away a thin layer of bark from the side of the branch that will touch the soil. Scrape away an area about 2\" long (in line with the branch) and up to a half inch wide to expose the green cambium. (Some gardeners like to bend the branch just till it cracks and that can work too.)\n\n3) For some species it may be beneficial to apply a dusting of root hormone to the cut area, but many plants will root successfully without that.\n\n4) Press the cut area onto the soil after removing any mulch or other debris.\n\n5) Hold the scraped branch in place with a stone, brick or length of stiff wire so it doesn't move. You want the scraped area of the branch to have thorough and stable contact with the soil. The darkness, the moisture and the smell of good soil will stimulate the cambium to produce new roots from the damaged area.\n\n6) Leave it alone for one or more seasons. I often start layering a fig in fall, let it root over winter and pot it up in late winter or spring. You can also layer them in early spring and probably pot them up in late summer.\n\n7) When you think it's been long enough lift the brick and brush soil away from the branch. If there are no roots, you haven't given it enough time or it's been too dry or too cold for much to happen. Put the brick back and wait another season. If the branch is holding in place and you can see roots reaching into the soil, then it's ready to grow on its own.\n\n8) Use your hand pruners or loppers to cut the new baby plant away from the mama plant. Make this cut on the mama side of the branch just an inch or so away from where you scraped the bark.\n\n9) With the rooted branch separated from the mama plant, carefully dig as deep as necessary to get the roots up out of the ground.\n\n10) Put the rooted branch in a suitably sized pot.\n\n11) Add any compost needed to fill the pot and keep the roots from drying out unless you are going to plant the new fig somewhere right away.\n\n12) If you are going to grow the new plant in a pot for a while put soil less media (I recommend 2/3 compost and 1/3 shredded pine bark) so that the potted roots will have great drainage and can get better established.\n\n13) Alternatively, you can just cut the branch and leave the new plant in the ground where it is until you are ready to move it or give it away. Here's a picture of a new fig tree that's been dug after leafing out in spring.\n\nOnce it's all said and done, you've got a new fig tree and can look forward to filling bowls with this delicate fruit in two or three years.\n\nThis beautiful and delicious variety is called Violete de Bourdeaux and is available at Monday, November 29, 2010\n\nAccording to Raleigh garden designer Tracy Traer, bulbs in piedmont North Carolina gardens often lack good drainage. Many diminish in number and stature because of rot, despite a gardener's attention.\n\nA former N.C. State horticulture professor, Traer installed and monitored campus bulb plantings during the 1980's that maintained a constant number of blooms over six years—without adding fertilizer. The difference is that these daffodils and other bulbs were planted on the ground and then covered with 6 inches of pine park much. Their roots can reach the fertile clay, but the bulbs themselves grew free from rot in the fine bark. Most ornamental bulbs originated in the deserts and mountains of central Asia—so a well-drained bark bed mimics the bulbs' native soils.\n\nTracy refrained from fertilizing in order to isolate the impact of growing in bark. She says that with annual fertilization the bulbs would have multiplied many times over. Because of their dry-land heritage, bulbs are also extremely drought-hardy. This makes them ideal for a low-maintenance landscape.\n\nPine bark is a by-product of the lumber industry. At the lumber yards they use a powerful hose to blast the bark off before milling the tree. You can buy pine bark in bulk or have area nurseries and landscapers deliver it. You can also buy it in a bag at most garden centers. A 2-cubic foot bag will cover a 2'x2' bulb bed 6 inches deep. You can also buy bulbs in bulk from Terra Ceia Farm in northeastern NC. Brent and Becky's Bulbs in southeastern VA is also a great source.\n\nWhat to do if you're buying smaller quantities and want a long season of daffodil blooms? Plant a mix of February Gold, Peeping Tom and Ice Follies.\n\nFriday, November 26, 2010\n\nSugar maples aren't only found up north. Even in the Piedmont, they're a common sight. To most eyes, they look like a red maple. The two key differences are that the leaves of the sugar maple are more deeply cut, and in the fall sugar maples turn yellow or orange while the red maples turn a clear red or an orange-red. If planted on the right site, either species grows well here.\n\nRed maples naturally grow in river bottoms, which are also called floodplains. They don't mind having their roots wet—you can find plenty of them along the banks of the Eno River or along New Hope Creek. Paradoxically, the same adaptation that allows them to tolerate flooded conditions also allows them to survive severe droughts. Here's how that works.\n\nWhen the floodplains are flooded in the winter and spring, the water displaces the air in the soil. Tree roots need air as well as water to survive. So floodplain trees, such as the red maple, slow down the roots' metabolism to avoid drowning. This same slowdown also allows them to survive drought conditions. This adaptation explains the surprisingly frequent planting of river bottom species like river birch, sycamore, willow oak and red maple on high and dry commercial sites such as parking lots.\n\nSugar maples evolved on drier slopes and ridge tops so they come by their drought tolerance the old-fashioned way. Unfortunately, their adaptability to drought doesn't translate into a tolerance for the opposite condition as with the red maple—wet, poorly drained soil will kill a sugar maple.\n\nIf Hurricane Fran did nothing else useful, it at least showed us that roots of even the biggest trees are rather shallow. Remember this when you dig your planting holes. Dig no deeper than the depth of the actual root ball. You want it to rest on solid, undisturbed soil. Save your energy for digging a hole that is at least 1-1/2 times wider than the root ball, so the new roots can move horizontally into loose soil.\n\nOnce you've planted your tree with the root ball at the same level as the surrounding soil, you need to mulch it to suppress weeds, prevent weed whacker damage and hold moisture for the roots. I use a three-inch layer of shredded hardwood bark mulch covering an area wider than the actual plant hole. I prefer shredded hardwood mulch over pine bark because the hardwood mulch decomposes to a nice topsoil and also because it does not wash away like the pine bark does. This is especially important on a slope. Hardwood mulch will hold its place on even the most vertical slope.\n\nMake sure you don't leave any mulch against the trunk—you want to hold water near the roots, not the bark. Think of the point where the mulch meets the trunk as if it were the collar of a crewneck shirt rather than a turtleneck. Mulch pushed up against the bark of a tree will hold moisture and encourage rot or it may create a home for rodents who'll eat the bark.\n\nBoth sugar maples and red maples make good shade trees or street trees. They cast a wide shadow and will easily be around for a century or so if you follow these steps and get them off to a good start.\n\nWednesday, August 04, 2010\n\nTamarisk (Tamarix spp.) is a risk if you plant it in the southwestern US. It evolved on floodplains in Spain and spreads along creeks in dry country. In higher rainfall areas it's not a threat and is in fact terrifically drought hardy and has tiny pink blooms in summer.\n\nCalled salt cedar because it pulls salts from deep in the soil and then spits it out from its leaves as a way to discourage competitors. Haven't noticed that effect in our garden. Our salt cedar has an underplanting of leadwort that looks happy and is blooming too. I cut the salt cedar back hard every other late winter or whenever it looks ragged. It's a small tree, but I treat it as a large perennial and whack it back as needed.\n\nWith winter pruning it only gets about 8'-10' high and about 3' wide. Very light and airy appearance, good contrast for low-growing, horizontal plants like the leadwort. It's also next to a gardenia and the frilly foliage and blue-green color make a nice contrast. We just give it mulch in winter and no fertilizer. And certainly no water after it's established. I think there's no risk of losing it in summer.\n\nTuesday, August 03, 2010\n\nWhen other plants in the summer garden look like they want a vacation, Formosa lily launches a fleet of bright white flowers. With fragrance.\n\nThe stalk in full sun is about 6'-7' tall. It gently seeds in around the garden so plants in shade are appropriately shorter. Sometimes 2'-3' high. Blooms through the month of August and into Sept. here in NC piedmont, zone 7. Once the 8\" long flowers pass, their drooping form is replaced by upward facing seed pods that look like a candelabra made of skinny gourds. Seeds ripen by fall and seedpods can be left to dress up the winter garden or cut and sown wherever you need something upright and drought-hardy that blooms in summer.\n\nOriginally from the island of Taiwan, their latin name is Lilium formosanum. Some varieties have pink or red color on the outside of the petals.\n\nThursday, July 15, 2010\n\nOriginally christened Mary's Gold in the 12th century, Calendula officinalis was considered a remedy for small pox, indigestion and \"evil humors of the head.\" Their bright yellow, long-lasting flowers are also a remedy for a tired-looking garden. And here a native bee both pollinates the flower and is enjoying getting it's fill of pollen. It will then make packets from the pollen to feed it's young after they hatch.\n\nAnother form of Mary's Gold?\n\nThese annual calendulas have seeded into a sunny, dry bed and a partially shaded, sometimes moist bed from one specimen we picked up at a plant sale.\n\nThe foliage has a fragrance that reminds me of collards. So it must be good for your health. And the fragrance may deter deer.\n\nOriginally from the Mediterranean basin and points east, so it's pretty drought hardy. And if it wants to keep on seeding-in and saving us from spending money buying plants--more power to it.\n\nTuesday, July 13, 2010\n\nIt's July and wild blackberry vines are rambling and scratching their way into everyone's heart and belly.\n\nThe \"blackberry\" below comes around a few months later, but I would not eat it.\n\nBecause they are the seedpods of an ornamental plant called Blackberry lily which is blooming now.\n\nThis biennial (flowers and sets seed in it's second summer and then dies) is one of Chris's favorites. She loves the summery orange color and the iris-like foliage. But it's not in the iris family--it's instead called Belamcanda chinensis.\n\nThis drought hardy plant also falls into our category of \"gentle-self-seeders.\" One mature plant in our garden will probably spawn half-a-dozen seedlings to replace it. And since the foliage is two-dimensional, they can slip in sideways between perennials without crashing the party the way sprawling blackberry brambles will.\n\nWhen the seed pods ripen and bust open in October, you can toss the seed into some fallow roadside for a little no-cost guerrilla gardening.\n\nFriday, July 09, 2010\n\nMost plants like things just-so: very wet or very dry; lotsa shade or lotsa sun. But not both. Creeping Jenny reliably swings both ways: wet or moderately dry, shade or sun.\n\nAnd it's a very low-growing ground cover that can work it's way under other perennials that go dormant in winter--like peonies--and keep the garden from looking empty in the off-season.\n\nThe variety of Creeping Jenny in the photo is called Lysimachia nummularia \"Aurea\" because of it's yellow-green color. The straight species is a light green. The coin-like leaves inspired the common name, moneywort. (\"wort\" is old English for \"plant\")\n\nNative to Europe and Turkey.\n\nCan tolerate some occasional foot traffic--possible lawn alternative if you're not playing a lot of football.\n\nThursday, July 08, 2010\n\nLots of people worry that fig trees aren't hardy here in NC. But figs thrive in southern heat. They can even produce a good crop in part shade and dry soil. And without any spraying, so we don't have to worry about using chemicals. Figs are probably the easiest fruit crop to grow organically in the south.\n\nThe only real threat is birds eating the figs, but we've convinced the birds that the neighbor's yards are safer by hanging an inflatable snake balloon in the fig tree to scare them away. We just move the snake every other day as the figs ripen, so they don't get used to it--and that matches our harvesting schedule anyway.\n\nWe have one fig tree called Violette de Bourdeaux that produces a late spring crop (the sweetest), a mid summer crop (the heaviest) and a late summer crop (the lightest). It has a rich, sweet flavor, juicy texture, dark purple-black skin and strawberry colored flesh. Bought it from Edible Landscaping Nursery in Afton Virginia. When I read in the catalog, that this was the one that all the chefs wanted, I had to have it.\n\nEdible Landscaping's mission is to find or develop fruiting plants that do well in the south and can be grown organically.\n\nSince this fig produces more than we can eat, Chris makes a fig syrup and our neighbor makes a spicy fig jam. So we save money and have fresh fruit over a long season and conserved fruit through the winter. And we give a lot away to friends. We've also eaten the figs on Chris' pizzas and have dried them in the oven (but that took over 24 hours !).\n\nHere's a photo of our pretty figs getting stewed down for fig syrup.\n\nHere's a pic of some figs quartered with a dollop of goat cheese and a dribble of balsamic vinegar that Chris reduced on the stove. We shared these with some friends and brought a big plateful to a potluck where they disappeared faster than a wheat field in a locust swarm."

      "text": "Many home gardeners have been contacting HGIC about pear and apple trees showing wilt and dieback of shoots, twigs, and small branches. It's been a tremendous spring in Maryland for the culprit - the devastating bacterial disease known as fire blight (Erwinia amylovora). This pathogen can kill flowers, fruits, branches, and whole trees. A wide range of plants are vulnerable including apple (including crabapple), pear (including European, Asian, and ornamental pear like the Bradford pear), serviceberry, cotoneaster, mountain ash, pyracantha, hawthorn, and quince.\n\nInfections start during the bloom period and are promoted by favorable weather conditions (average daily temperature around 60 degrees F. and long period of leaf wetting from dew, fog, or rain). Infected shoots typically form a \"shepherd's crook\" with leaves turning brown rapidly and remaining on the plant. The dieback is fairly rapid and noticeable.\n\nNow that we are in a period of drier weather it is a good time to prune out infected shoots and branches and continue to prune out blighted shoots as they appear. Make the pruning cut at least 5 inches below the infection symptoms. Pruners, saws, and loppers should be dipped in alcohol or a 10% bleach solution between cuts to disinfect the cutting edges.\n\n\"Ugly Stub\" Pruning Method\n\nLeave an \"ugly stub\" when pruning your tree or shrub. That is, do not prune a shoot or branch at the point where it attaches to the next limb, branch, or trunk. Leave a stub, instead. The cut ends of the ugly stubs will be colonized with the fire blight bacterium. During cold winter weather (temperature below 40 degrees F.) the ugly stubs are pruned out at the branch collar- the raised ridge where the stub attaches to the tree. This method, developed by the late Dr. Paul Steiner, plant pathologist with the University of Maryland, will help reduce the amount of inoculum available to infect the trees next spring and will help prevent the bacterium from getting into the main branches, trunk, and root system.\n\nPrevention\n\nThe key to managing fire blight is selecting resistant cultivars, pruning out infected plant parts, and spraying with liquid copper in spring, just as a little bit of green tissue shows at the ends of buds. If you spray too early it washes off prior to critical infection period. If you wait too long you may burn plant tissues with the copper."

      "text": "elKultur Advice\n\nI'm sure there's already a thread on this so moderators please feel free to merge.\nI'm having 2 big radiata pines removed this spring and will have a lot of pine chips and branches at my disposal. I'm hoping to use them to create a Hugelkultur. Is pine ok to do this with. My soil is predominantly clay and my hill faces ENE. I'm only just beginning to map out my beds and remove the blackberries. Any advice on such a system would be great.\n\nFrom my understanding of it, pine has a lot of compounds that make it not great for using in hugelkulture. The reason is because the compounds discourage seed germination, and overall, the wood takes a lot longer to break down, which means it takes longer to get things established well. For this reason, I would personally use that wood only for edging, path mulch, fence construction, etc.\n\nHOWEVER: If the pines are native to your local ecology, then I would look at the plants that naturally grow around them, and try growing those in a hugel bed with that wood. If they are used to growing in that sort of a substrate, then they should be fine. If the trees are not native to your area, or you don't see any viable guilds in the vicinity, I'd stick to what I said above. If anything, maybe you can use them as some sort of marginal erosion control on the edge of your property where you aren't intensively trying to grow things, and over time they should decompose into a fertile berm.\n\nNo explanation on that point Ludi? I was under the impression that softwood/coniferous wood was not ideal. I'd be happy to hear that it was ok, because I have lots of it around. One thing I do know is that it makes the soil very acidic, so if anything, add lime or seashells to account for that.\n\nHardwoods such as oak are the best, especially if they are rotten. But other woods can be used if you have them, especially if you can mix them with hardwoods and rotten wood. Concerns about acidity or nitrogen deficiency can be addressed by adding the appropriate materials to the pile. A diversity of woods is probably the bestAlso all your cardboard, paper, scrap non-treated wood from the shop.. all your carbon"

He can be reached at Box 41834, Eagle Rock, CA 90041, or\n\nThe California pepper tree (Schinus molle) is widespread in Southern California and Arizona, and some surrounding states. It is a large, stately tree with feathery, fern-like leaves that droop from the large limbs, giving it a very graceful appearance. It is somewhat misnamed since it is not from California – I have been told that it's originally from Brazil -- and it is not the plant where we normally get pepper (as in \"salt and pepper\").\n\nI have always liked the appearance of this tree – it has a quality that I would call \"Southern.\" You can easily imagine one of these large trees next to some old Southern estate, along side a weeping willow tree.\n\nThis is an easy-to-grow tree that tolerates drought, making it a desirable landscape tree. On the other hand, just as many gardeners dislike the fact that the limbs get so large that they occasionally drop, and that the leaves and small red seeds constantly drop.\n\nThough not botanically related to the usual peppers we use as a dinner spice, you actually can take these little seeds and use them as condiments in the same way you'd use regular peppercorns.\n\nThe California pepper tree seeds are small, like the size of a BB. There is a pink papery outer shell, and within there is a hard seed. The flavor is delicate and enjoyable, but these are much more powerful than ordinary peppers. The California pepper seeds must be ground, and then added sparingly into soups, bread, stews, and other foods. Go moderate at first until you experience how much of the pepper you can tolerate.\n\nGround fine and added to bread batter, these peppers add a delicate flavor to bread. We've had it ground fine and added to soups and stews many times, and enjoy it more than regular pepper. But be sure to grind the seeds. We recall when we first started experimenting with these seeds, Dolores would toss some whole seeds into soup. We had a dinner gathering one night, and one of our guests decided to chew on the whole seed. It left him coughing and choking for several minutes.\n\nFor best results, we've found that we should pick the pink seeds off the ground or off the tree. Then we set them in an uncovered bowl for a few weeks for them to dry and season. The pinkness will eventually fade and this is the better time to use the seeds for seasoning. You should remove all the stems before grinding, but you don't need to remove the pink outing shell of the seed.\n\nSometimes woodworkers will make beautiful bowls and cups from the wood of this tree. And since the tree gets so large and might require periodic prunings, the wood can be available even if it is not cut down.\n\nThis is a great tree to know if you happen to live in its zone. It is a fairly widespread tree, and is also easily grown. I have even seen these pink peppers in some speciality stores, either mixed with regular pepper or alone.\n\nIf you don't have any near where you live and would like to try some, one package of the seeds is $6 (price includes postage) from Survival Seeds, Box 41834, Los Angeles, CA 90041."

UGLY. STUPID AMERICAN BEHAVIOR. Shame on you if your tree was healthy and you just decided one day it had to go.\n\n koanhead\n\nUnfortunately, while maple trees can live for centuries, some maples die young. All it takes is a couple of years of drought, sometimes. Other times the tree can weather all kinds of crazy things.\nMaples are not immortal. Sometimes they get blight, sometimes they get parasites.\nI agree that removing trees without need is ugly and stupid behavior. I just want to point out it's not always so bad as you seem to paint it.\nUnfortunately I don't have maples around me where I live. I hope you do, and that you get some joy from your obvious love of these beautiful trees.\n\nIsaac Hils\n\nTo be honest, a maple is useless after 100 years. It produces little benefit to wildlife, and it's wood production is FAR reduced. Oaks are far more beneficial, but render little benefit after 120 years. I hate when people try to protect certain old-growth trees. Death and re-generation are essential.\n\nawjt\n\nYou're 100% wrong about old trees. Old trees provide canopy, habitat, wind protection to other trees and a million other things, just like smaller trees. And they die when they get outgrown. A chainsaw doesn't count. Natural death is the marker. It may be useless to YOU, but to the land, far farrrrr from useless. Your opinion is totally uninformed.\n\n dejoh\n\nMy house was built around the tree in 1951, One of the branches fell and downed our power, cable, and phone lines.\nIt turned into a freakin danger. Okay?\n\n koanhead\n\nYour house was built \"around\" the tree?\nDoes that just mean near the tree or in some sort of ring surrounding it? If it's something like the latter, could you post pictures? I love seeing buildings like that.\n\n koanhead\n\nAll old trees are not equal.\nSome standing deadwood is terribly dangerous only weeks after it starts dying- poplar trees are a good example.\nAs I've pointed out elsewhere maples in particular (since those are the first that Isaac Hills mentions) have highly varied lifespans and can rot quickly under certain conditions."

      "text": "Although native to the Far East, crape myrtles are almost indispensable in the Southern landscape. Their vibrantly colored flowers in shades of pink, purple, red and white from May to September virtually define the summer season here. The relatively small size of crape myrtle trees and long, colorful blooming season make them useful in a variety of landscapes. With proper care, crape myrtles can remain healthy and attractive for decades. Occasionally, however, problems arise that do require some attention and care.\n\nDon't bite the bark\n\nA common problem is the careless use of mowers and string trimmers around the base of these thin-barked trees. This type of equipment can easily damage the base of the trunk leading to sickly, stunted trees. To prevent this type of damage, do not allow grass to grow within a foot of the trunk. Keep the area mulched with about 4 inches of pine straw pulled back slightly from the trunk. The reason the bark is so smooth and thin becomes apparent when you see a crape myrtle shedding its outer layer of bark. Shedding the outer bark often reveals different shades and colors from tan to rusty brown, which add to the beauty of these trees. There's no need for concern; simply gather up the shed bark to keep things looking neat.\n\nA sucker's born every minute\n\nIt seems that crape myrtles are trees with aspirations to be big shrubs. Leave a tree alone and eventually most will send up lots of shoots from the base and turn into something more akin to a large shrub. To maintain a pleasing tree shape, we regularly remove these shoots – called suckers – from the base of the trunk.\n\nRemove suckers regularly as soon as they appear. They are easier to deal with and cause less damage to the tree when they are removed early. Prune them all the way back to their point of origin at the trunk or a root. Do not leave a stub, or several suckers will appear for every one you cut off. To prevent suckers from growing back so fast, treat the freshly cut spots with a product, such as Monterey Sucker Stopper or other brands, to prevent sucker regrowth.\n\nPests\n\nA few insects and diseases attack crape myrtles, but they generally don't cause significant damage. Common problems are crape myrtle aphids, powdery mildew and Cercospora leaf spot. Crape myrtle aphids are quite common, and most trees get them during summer. Only when populations are high every year is control really necessary. The aphids feed on the sap and excrete tiny droplets of a sugary liquid called honeydew. This accumulates on the leaves and branches and provides a food base for growth of a black fungus called sooty mold. Heavy infestations of aphids can lead to so much sooty mold the tree turns almost all black. You can control aphids by spraying the tree with any commercially available insecticide labeled to control aphids. A light, paraffin-based oil, such as Summit Year Round Spray Oil or Bonide All Seasons Oil, is your least-toxic option. If the trees are too large to spray, you can control the aphids by treating the base of the tree with a systemic insecticide. It is better to apply a systemic insecticide early in the season, around April or May, but you should get some late summer benefit if you apply one now. Choose a product like Bayer Advanced Tree and Shrub Insect Control with Merit. Powdery mildew and Cercospora leaf spot are occasional problems. Powdery mildew is particularly common in early summer during warm, humid weather. It appears as a white, powdery coating or spots on leaves and flower buds. Treatment is rarely needed, although heavy infections of the flower buds can cause them to abort. Cercospora leaf spot occurs more in mid- to late summer, particularly when weather is rainy. Dark spots show up on foliage, which then turns yellow or orange and drops. Again, control is not generally needed. Even if a tree loses all if its leaves to this disease, it will not kill it. If you wish, you can control both diseases with applications of chlorothalonil (Daconil and other brands).\n\nMany new crape myrtle varieties are the result of hybridizing the traditional crape myrtle, Lagerstroemia indica, with a different species, Lagerstroemia fauriei. This has provided them with increased disease resistance (especially for mildew) and also more colorful bark.\n\nBouquet buffet\n\nLack of flowers is a complaint I hear occasionally. Common reasons for lack of blooms include young trees, trees getting too much shade, trees that are sickly or low in vigor, and heavy insect or disease problems. Given good care and proper growing conditions, crape myrtle flowers are as certain as summer."

      "text": "Follow Me\n\nLearn more.... (aka the blog)\n\nHey you- with the yellow tree!\n\nDo you have a pin oak, a Quercus palustris to be exact? These are stately trees, topping out at nearly 60'. Although Pin Oaks are noble and beautiful trees, with their great triangular shape and graceful descending lower branches, they rarely remain beautiful in our clay-packed area. Now is the time of year when many pin oak (Quercus palustris) trees start to show their true colors. Unfortunately, those colors don't include dark green! Yellow or lime green are typical colors associated with pin oaks in our area. The pin oak performs poorly in most Midwestern soils- this is especially true in areas where the topsoil has been removed, which exposes the clay subsoil.\n\nA typical Kansas soil has a pH higher than the optimum range for pin oaks, which prefer a well-drained soil with a pH from 5.0 to 6.5. When the soil pH reaches levels near 7.5, iron chlorosis, a nutrient deficient symptom develops. Iron chlorosis appears as yellow leaves with green veins. Some leaves may develop angular brown spots with brown curled leaf margins. Iron is essential for production of chlorophyll. Without enough available iron, the tree fails to produce enough chlorophyll to maintain healthy green leaves. Branches and twigs may begin to die after suffering from chlorosis over a period of several years.\n\nThe problem is not however with the amount of iron available. Midwestern soils typically have plenty of iron. However, the high soil pH prevents the iron from being used by the plant. There are three methods in which iron chlorosis can be treated due to an alkaline soil situation.\n\n1. Make the soil more acidic: Wow, that sounds fun! Incorporating elemental sulfur or peat moss is NOT an easy task and must be repeated over the entire area many times a year. However, this will slowly help to decrease the soil pH making the iron in the soil more available to the tree.\n\n2. A second way to treat iron chlorosis is by applying a foliar application of iron chelate or iron sulfate. This is approach is temporary since the iron does not move beyond the leaves that have been treated. A rate of 2.5 oz. of iron sulfate in 3 gallons of water is the recommended rate. Iron chelates are water-soluble forms of iron that remain in the solution making them available to the tree. The best conditions or time to make foliar applications are during the evening or in periods of cool weather. This is not effective for large scale areas- can you picture trying to spray two 45' tall trees?!?\n\n3. Injection. This is the most effective method of treating the problem. The tree immediately takes it up into their vascular system and the problem begins to subside. How permanent is this solution? The pin oak will revert to the chlorotic state once the supply of iron is exhausted, usually 2 or 3 years after implantation.\n\nPrice: See information below. Between $100-$250 per tree. $50 for each additional tree on the property.We are happy to assess your tree, explain the process and do the injection. Let us know if you have questions!\n\nCorrection to the price: the price of the injection is based on the SIZE of the tree.\n\nMore Tree Care Tips:\n\nIf your tree is starting to have dead limbs interspersed throughout, call a reliable tree service to get those branches removed. It is likely just normal for that tree. However, if you see it becoming more of an issue every year, your tree could be in decline. It is always recommended that you remove dead limbs when you find them. Don't let them sit there- this can breed necrotic tissue (it can rot!) at the crotch where the limb joins the trunk. Just like on your body, when your tree has an open, festering patch, disease and infection can set in.\n\nLeave cuts open- don't seal them up. Mostly, when your prune out dead branches, your tree will callous over the cut area. The air helps speed the callous process.\n\nDo fertilize. Don't do it after June-Spring is the best time to fertilize. You can use tree spikes (those that you put in the ground around the tree) or granular and water it in. Read package instructions well to get the right amount and the correct application method.\n\nMULCH AROUND YOUR TREE. New trees are especially subject to being nicked by weed eaters/ string trimmers. If you mulch around the dripline of the tree, you keep machinery away from the base of your new investment! Mulch also prevents weeds from cropping up and stealing all the moisture and nurtrients from your tree. See this little drawing? Yep- it does all this.\n\nRemember that the dripline is the end of the tree canopy....Mulch in a circle just that large! Really. theyIt's spring at the Tree Farm!\n\nWhat's blooming now?\n\nThe forsythia, the pear and plum trees and the royal star magnolia (as well as the Tulip tree magnolias too!). But how does your landscape look? If it's looking a bit bare, but you can't make it out to the tree farm, never fear! Did you know we sell bulk mulch, bulk soil and compost, bulk rock, gravel and sand? And guess what- we have an online store! You can buy it at night, from the comfort of your own couch. While we still have to schedule the delivery within our existing orders, we are happy to work to deliver it whenever you need it. Take a look here!\n\nWe are having a crabapple tree sale running through the month of April. This Saturday, April 13, we are having a radio remote from the Tree Farm to show them off! Come visit us and take a look at all of our blooming trees. Our crabapple sale is 20% off of a crabapple tree- also, kids get a FREE baby tree!\n\nCrabapples are a great blooming ornamental tree for our area. While pears bloom early, then come redbuds, the next great wave of pink/purple/coral blooms are our crabapples! The best new varieties like Royal Raindrops are 20' at maturity and have a nice \"Asian\"-type shape to them. They do well underneath power lines. They are bred to withstand fireblight and other diseases of fruiting trees. Also, they were bred to be ornamentals- no messy falling fruit. They have little bronze, hard fruit (called vestigial berries) that stay on the tree.\n\nAnother personal favorite of mine is the Lollipop crabapple: white blooming, neat and tidy. It keeps a smaller ball on top- it's great for courtyards or small front lawns. I love the white bloom and the Victorian-type feel of it. I've seen it listed at both 10' and 15' at max height. I think the 10-12' range is probably most appropriateEnd of the Winter Blahs! (3-2-13)\n\n-Sharpen and clean your tools. Using wire brush and steel wool, clean the rust off any of your spades, shovels, etc. Remember to wash off the soil after every single use!!\n\n- Spread compost or organically rich material (Chicken/ cow manure, great topsoil) on your vegetable beds. Yes, it should have been put on last season. BUT it will still help your garden soil!\n\n- Establish where you will mulch and add soil this spring. Measure out the length and width of the beds (multiply this = it is the area of the bed). Then take that square footage (length x width) and multiply it by the DEPTH of soil or mulch you want to add. 3\" of mulch is NOT multiplying by 3—it is ¼ of 1 foot. So you multiply by .25 for the cubic feet. Then divide by 27 for cubic yards. This cubic yards is how much you purchase. Got it?? Same process for both soil and mulch.\n\nThink about adding Early Spring Ephemerals to your gardens:\n\nEarly spring ephmerals are those harbingers of spring that assure us that the season is, in fact, changing. Ephemeral means they don't stay around long- they bloom and usually just keep moving on. They give us hope and inspire us to garden or landscape, yet again. Even in the face of uncertain odds, bad weather and certain drought, these little plants give us hope!!\n\nThe crocuses will start to peek out, with their strappy, grass-like leaves. Expect this in about a week- really! The galanthus or snow drop pictured above left is likely to poke its little head up IN the snow (thus the name).\n\nAlready my daffodils have greened up and are pushing up. This is a prime time to fertilize- I use a bulb-specific fertilizer that is all natural not chemical. Try Bulb-Tone by Espoma; works great for garlic and all tubers as well (hello potatoes!). I follow instructions per the square footage for the correct amount.\n\nIt's important to remember that ephemerals are not enough to make a landscape or garden interesting. They are a design element and a gardener's pleasure because they are perfectly timed to make us smile and sigh and keep going. They are not shrubs or trees. They aren't permanent (I mean they are perennial) but their foliage yellows and must remain to give nutrients back to the plant for next year. Interplant them with great ground cover like lamium or pachysandra. Use them at the base of trees. Leave their foliage on for 6 weeks if you want to see them next year. Either using a professional designer or when you are DIY, remember the bulbs. You will be rewarded!\n\nStar Magnollia shrub- 4-6' H xW. Early spring bloomer will astound you with its glorious, southern, frilly white blooms. It blooms before it leafs out and has a nice shrubby/ small tree stature. Under used! Old fashioned.\n\nSNOW---\n\nTips: don't try to shake or beat the snow off of your trees or shrubs. You may do way more damage. If you have a small tree (like my blue arrow junipers that are 5' tall, conical), I can gently shake them. You don't want to uproot smaller shrubs or knick, break larger ones. The snow won't really damage a healthy tree!\n\nDoes this snow mean we are out of the drought? Sadly, no. The ratio is variable so it's hard to nail it down. But 10\" of powdery snow equals about 1\" of rain. If the snow is wetter is can be a 1:4 or 5 ratio. However, if the ground is very solid and the snow is iced over, most of the water will run off and not be absorbed. I don't think this is an issue in our case, due to the warm winter and soft ground. But we probably only will get a couple inches (maybe 3?) out of this snow."

      "text": "GREEN THUMBS UP: Colorful fruits brighten the fall landscape\n\nEvents CalendarAs native plants become more popular due to their hardiness and adaptability, many gardeners are discovering the beauty of red chokeberry (Aronia arbutifolia), which produces sensational displays of bright red fruits that persist well into the winter months since the pomes tend to be somewhat distasteful to wildlife. These suckering 6 to10-foot tall shrubs have the added attraction of lustrous green foliage throughout the growing season with dramatic red fall foliage that rivals the banned burning bush for its intense fall color.\n\nThe Viburnum family offers a wealth of hardy, attractive shrubs, many of them North American natives that feature appealing spring flowers, excellent fall foliage color, and striking fall fruits. Adaptable to a wide range of growing conditions, they are tolerant of partial shade and thrive in moisture-retentive soils. The cranberry viburnums (V. opulus and V. trilobum) exhibit white lace-cap blossoms in spring against a backdrop of maple-like leaves that glow fiery red at season's end followed by clusters of shiny red berries in autumn. The upright tea Viburnum (V. setigerum) is somewhat coarse in appearance but provides the showiest display of brilliant red fruit clusters that persist well into the winter months. Few shrubs rival the sensational fall foliage of the Winterthur viburnum whose glossy green leaves turn vibrant scarlet in autumn with fruits that transform from pink to blue and finally black as the season progresses. Our native arrow-wood viburnums (V. dentatum) that inhabit damp places produce yellow fall foliage and appealing deep blue to black berries.\n\nOrnamental crabapples (Malus spp.) are an attractive, adaptable and diversified group of small fruiting trees. Tolerant of a wide range of soils, crabapples perform best in full sun where they burst forth each spring with a glorious profusion of bloom, clothing the entire tree in pink, white or red blossoms. In late summer and autumn, fruits ripen in shades of vibrant red, yellow, or purple. Look for newer cultivars of crabapples, which provide greatly improved disease resistance. Those bearing smaller fruits are more likely to appeal to birds although the entire tree may be stripped of its flavorful berries before winter arrives.\n\nWoody plants serve as the backbone of our landscapes throughout the year and most can be successfully planted until the ground freezes. The planting of fruit-bearing trees and shrubs, in particular, will greatly enhance the fall and winter landscape. If possible, position these plants where they can be observed from inside your home so that you may enjoy their splendor and wildlife visitors throughout the chilly months to come.\n\nSuzanne Mahler is an avid gardener, photographer and lecturer who has been developing the 1.5-acre property surrounding her home in Hanover for more than 30 years.

This very dry winter has been especially hard on trees.\n\nTrees can become stressed from the dryness and in turn, become more susceptible to insects and disease.\n\nUrban Forestry recommends using the following winter watering guidelines:\n\n* Water only when air temperatures are above 40 degrees.\n* Water at mid-day so the water can soak in before freezing night time temperatures.\n* Water during extended dry periods – 1 to 2 times per month without snow cover.\n* Watering to a depth of 12-18 inches below soil surface is ideal.\n* For deciduous trees, apply water to the part of the root zone from the tree trunk to the outer edges of the tree's branches.\n* For evergreen trees, water 3-5 feet beyond the widest branches on all sides of the tree.\n\nWhile periods of drought are common on Colorado's Front Range, it is important to keep a watchful eye for anything that looks out of the ordinary. Contact your lawn care provider if you have any concerns.\n\nFor in the true nature of things, if we rightly consider, every green tree is far more glorious than if it were made of gold and silver. ~Martin Luther"

However, after sending the plant sample you subsequently supplied to the UGA Plant pathology lab, I'm not so sure.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Little says: Judging from the shape of the wound, this could be damage from egg laying activities of certain insects such as crickets or cicadas with subsequent callus developing around the wounds.\nTree crickets lay eggs in slits in the wood similar to what I see on this branch, although I do not see the row of tiny holes in the wood down the middle of the wound. Apparently, one cicada female can make numerous wounds (5 to 20/twig) up and down the twig or branch while deposited eggs (see attached images). The slits can be long. The eggs are deposited along the sides of the wound which may contribute to the later formation of callous tissue along the edges. It looks like it may be cicada damage, at least on the small branch that you sent in. Looking back at the images sent earlier, there are very extensive areas of callous on the base and larger branches of this plant. According to what I am reading, cicadas prefer the smaller twigs (up to ~0.5″ diameter).\n\nI'm not positive Elizabeth is correct but at this point, I'm open to further suggestions as to what's going on.\n\nThe pictures look similar to what I and a few other pathologists have seen in the last few years. We have tentatively identified the bacteria Pseudomonas savastanoi, as the cause of the problem. This bacteria causes galls and knots on oleander, olive and other plants."

      "text": "Almost all landscapes have plants that become diseased with one\nof the powdery mildew fungi. Although the fungi that cause powdery\nmildew differ from plant to plant, all of the powdery mildew diseases\nare similar in appearance. In most cases, prompt recognition and\ncontrol actions can prevent severe damage to plants from powdery\nmildew diseases.\n\nSymptoms:\n\nPowdery mildews, as the name implies, often appear as a superficial\nwhite or gray powdery growth of fungus over the surface of leaves,\nstems, flowers or fruit of affected plants. These patches may enlarge\nuntil they cover the entire leaf on one or both sides. Young foliage\nand shoots may be particularly susceptible. Leaf curling and twisting\nmay be noted before the fungus is evident. Severe powdery mildew\ninfection will result in yellowed leaves, dried and brown leaves\nand disfigured shoots and flowers. Although it usually is not a\nfatal disease, powdery mildew may hasten plant defoliation and fall\ndormancy and the infected plant may become extremely unsightly.\nOn roses, uncontrolled powdery mildew will prevent normal flowering\non highly susceptible cultivars.\n\nHosts:\n\nPowdery mildew fungi infect almost all ornamental plants. The most\nsusceptible woody plants include some deciduous azaleas, cherry,\na few of the flowering crabapples, dogwood, English oaks, euonymus,\nhoneysuckle, horse chestnut, lilac, privet, roses, serviceberry,\nsilver maple, sycamore, tulip tree, some viburnums, walnut, willow\nand wintercreeper. Powdery mildews are also common on certain herbaceous\nplants, such as chrysanthemums, dahlias, delphiniums, phlox, Reiger\nbegonias, snapdragons and zinnias. Remember that each species of\npowdery mildew has a very limited host range. Infection of one plant\ntype does not necessarily mean that others are threatened. For example,\nthe fungus that causes powdery mildew on lilac does not spread to\nroses and vice versa.\n\nEnvironments\nFavoring Powdery Mildews:\n\nMost powdery mildew fungi produce airborne spores and infect plants\nwhen temperatures are moderate (60 to 80 degrees F) and will not\nbe present during the hottest days of the summer. Unlike most other\nfungi that infect plants, powdery mildew fungi do not require free\nwater on the plant surface in order to germinate and infect. Some\npowdery mildew fungi, especially those on rose, apple and cherry\nare favored by high humidities. Overcrowding and shading will keep\nplants cool and promote higher humidityÜboth highly conducive to\npowdery mildew development.\n\nCultural\nControl:\n\nThe\nfollowing cultural practices should be beneficial for controlling\npowdery mildews.\n• Purchase only top-quality, disease-free plants of resistant\ncultivars and species from a reputable nursery, greenhouse or garden\ncenter.\n\n• Prune out diseased terminals of woody plants, such as rose\nand crabapple, during the normal pruning period. All dead wood should\nbe removed and destroyed (preferably by burning). Rake up and destroy\nall dead leaves that might harbor the fungus.\n\n•\nMaintain plants in a high vigor. o Plant properly in well-prepared\nand well-drained soil where the plants will obtain all-day sun (or\na minimum of 6 hours of sunlight daily).\n\n•\nSpace plants for good air circulation. DO NOT plant highly susceptible\nplants--such as phlox, rose and zinnia--in damp, shady locations.\n\n•\nDo not handle or work among the plants when the foliage is wet.\n\n•\nWater thoroughly at weekly intervals during periods of drought.\nThe soil should be to a depth of 8 to 12 inches. Avoid overhead\nwatering and sprinkling the foliage, especially in late afternoon\nor evening. Use a soaker hose or root feeder so the foliage is not\nmoistened.\n\nChemical\nControl:\n\nIn\nmany cases, powdery mildew diseases do little damage to overall\nplant health, and yearly infections can be ignored if unsightliness\nis not a major concern. Lilacs, for example, can support powdery\nmildew every year with little or no apparent effect on plant health.\nOn some plants, however, powdery mildews can result in significant\ndamage and fungicides may be necessary to achieve acceptable control.\nFor best results with fungicides, spray programs must begin as soon\nas mildews are detected. Spray on a regular schedule, spraying more\noften during cool, damp weather. Use a good spreader-sticker with\nthe fungicides. Be sure and cover both surfaces of all leaves with\nthe spray. Use only fungicides registered for powdery mildew control.\n\nAdapted\nfrom Stephen Nameth and Jim Chatfield, Ohio State University Extension,\n2000"

      "text": "Today Ventura County Cooperative Extension Farm Advisor, Ben Faber shares some of his knowledge of avocados with us.\n\nAvocados in general are very frost sensitive, however backyards tend to be warmer than open fields and homeowners can often grow trees with less concern than growers. All young trees are more susceptible to freeze damage than a tree that has a full canopy down to the ground. The canopy traps heat and keeps the tree warmer than the surrounding air.\n\nWhen trees are young they are small enough that frost cloth can be framed around the young tree. This usually provides at least 5 degrees of protection. Just a blanket can be used, as well as long as a structure is built to keep it off the tree. When trees get older and are too large to cover, homeowners have used a sting of lights in the canopy to generate heat. Make sure they are lights designed for the outdoors.\n\nThere are differences in how much cold a tree will take. 'Hass' and 'Holiday' are very sensitive, while 'Stewart' and 'Zutano' are much more cold tolerant. Here is a comparative chart of the different varieties"

      "text": "The heavy rains that have descended upon the Pacific Northwest this week are taking a toll on landscape trees. In some cases, homeowners will want to wait until the storm has passed to evaluate the damage and decide how to proceed.\n\nIn other cases, however, saturated soil can lead to root problems, causing trees to topple over.\n\nIdeally, trees should be inspected on a regular basis, especially before and after storms. Conditions that can set your tree up to be particularly vulnerable include recent construction that has taken place near your tree, as well as trees that have been severely cut back, or \"topped.\"\n\nTrees with a significant lean may or may not indicate a problem; check for exposed roots around the base of your tree, especially if it has recently started to lean. Also look for hollow or decayed areas on the tree, which can indicate structural problems, and watch for any hanging or broken branches that are still lodged in the tree.\n\nSome storm-damaged trees worth saving\nArborists usually advise homeowners and community leaders to exercise caution when dealing with a storm's aftermath. That's because there are two common mistakes people make when trying to clean up after a storm. The first is using harmful pruning techniques on trees that need only a light pruning; the second is trying to save trees that are far too damaged, and are likely to become hazardous.\n\n\"Often after a storm passes through, people become anxious to have their trees examined so they can prune or take other actions,\" says Paul Ries, an urban forester with the Oregon Department of Forestry. \"However, it's often the case that more trees become damaged as a result of improper post-storm activities, than were damaged directly by a storm. If we get increased winds after all this rain has saturated the soils, you'll start to see a larger number of uprooted trees.\"\n\nCommon mistakes\nPruning a tree incorrectly can weaken it, setting it up for big problems. Topping - the practice of removing large branches and tops of trees - creates trees that are likely to be hazardous in the future. That's because a topped tree is much more likely to break or uproot in a storm than a tree with normal branch structure.\n\nThe opposite problem – ignoring or pruning a tree that should be removed – is another post-storm mistake.\nWhat to do after a severe storm\nTaking the right action after trees have been damaged can make the difference between giving trees a good chance of survival, or losing them unnecessarily. Properly selecting a qualified arborist is key.\n\n\"Homeowners should use caution when selecting a tree service company,\" said Ries, who manages the state's urban and community forestry program. Ries recommends using an arborist whose name and company are familiar to your community − even if that means waiting longer for service.\n\n\"Be careful not to overreact or you may end up removing valuable shade trees that are still sound, and take years to replace,\" adds Ries.\n\nOther tips\n\nBeware of people or companies that show up at your door; their low prices may ultimately cost you more money in the long run.\n\nMost reputable companies have business cards, truck signs, and even uniforms that represent a professional level of service;\n\nAsk for references, and take your time selecting a reputable company.\n\nHire a Certified Arborist – someone who has passed the International Society of Arboriculture certification exam. Consult your local yellow pages or visit  for a list of Certified Arborists.\n\n\"Arborists are often in great demand for several weeks following a storm,\" adds Ries, \"so if your tree isn't an immediate and visible hazard, it may be worth waiting a while.\"\nFor more information:\n\n***\nPhoto caption: Trees like these Oregon White Oaks can typically withstand short-term submersion in water, but after their roots have experienced long-term exposure they should be carefully monitored."

      "text": "Baobab Trees\n\nBaobab Trees - Africa's Oldest Inhabitants?\n\nStanding tall on the sunburnt African plains, baobab trees tower over the landscape like great living monuments. The colossal form of these trees is matched by their usefulness, for they provide shade, shelter, water and food for a wide variety of creatures. A leafless Baobab at Matesti shows off its taut, muscle-like branches.\n\nBaobabs may be the oldest life forms on the African continent, and many of the specimens still standing today have certainly been around since the birth of Christ; others for far longer. Carbon-dating experiments in the Zambezi Valley have calculated that trees with a trunk diameter of five metres were over 1000 years of age, and similar experiments elsewhere have dated trees at over 3000 years. Girth measurements themselves are not reliable estimates of a particular tree's age, as the conditions under which it has grown - and the climatic fluctuations of the centuries - strongly affect this.\n\nNocturnal Pollination\n\nBaobab trees flower for the first time at about 20 years. In mid-summer, dozens of luminous white blossoms - the size of saucers - open at sunset and their strong musky odour attracts fruit bats and hosts of insects. Large bats seek out the sweet nectar and collect and distribute pollen as they move from flower to flower. The life of the flower is short lived and it drops to the ground within hours of being serviced. The resultant seeds are housed in a hairy pod which resembles a miniature rugby ball (inside of which is a white pulp from which 'cream of tartar' is derived). Once they fall to the ground, the pods are fed upon by baboons, monkeys, antelope and elephants, which serve to disperse the hard seeds within.\n\nAn Ecosystem Within a Tree\n\nThe sculptured branches, with their hollows, dents and bloated stems, provide shelter and home for a great variety of animals. Galagos (bushbaby), squirrels, rodents, lizards, snakes and tree frogs, as well as spiders, scorpions and insects may live out their entire life in a single tree. Holes in the trunk provide ideal nesting sites for birds such as rollers, hornbills, parrots, kestrels and spinetails. Larger cavities are frequently occupied by families of Barn Owls or Ground Hornbills. Eagles, vultures and storks frequently build their large stick nests on the outer branches, and the colonial nests of Red-billed Buffalo-weavers are more often found in Baobabs than any other tree.\n\nUses to Mankind\n\nFor centuries, the baobab tree has played an important role in the economy and culture of Africa. Practically every part of the tree is useful and in Sudan they are so highly valued that individual trees may be privately owned! The wood itself is too fibrous for structural use but the bark is shredded into strands of fibre for use as rope, baskets, nets, snares and cloth. Tonics and cosmetics are derived from the roots, and spinach and soup from the large palmate leaves. The seeds may be ground into a coffee-substitute or eaten fresh and the white pulp is used as 'cream of tartar' for baking. The hollow trunks of living trees have served as homes, storage barns, places of refuge or worship, and even as prisons or tombs. One tree at Katimo Mulilo in Namibia has suffered the rather ignominious fate of having been converted into a flush toilet, while one near Gravelotte in South Africa's Northern Province was once used as a bar where up to a dozen thirsty gold diggers would quench their thirst.\n\nThe Future\n\nBecause of its many uses and its ability to survive in semi-arid conditions, the Baobab survives in the face of man's expansion across the continent. Ironically, the tree is probably most at risk in wildlife reserves where confined populations of African Elephant may outstrip their resources and demolish and consume baobab trees in their struggle for survival.\n\n10 Comments\n\nI think that this tree is amazing and everyone ought to visit one.

      "text": "Why Fruit\nTrees Fail to Bear\n\nA fruit tree will normally begin to bear fruit after it has\nbecome old enough to blossom freely. Nevertheless, the health\nof the tree and its environment, its fruiting habits and the cultural\npractices used can influence its ability to produce fruit. Adequate\npollination is also essential to fruit yield.\n\nIf just one of these conditions is unfavorable, yields may\nbe reduced. Perhaps the tree will not bear fruit at all. The grower\ncan exercise some control over most of the factors contributing\nto fruit production.\n\nBearing Age\n\nNursery-grown fruit trees will probably be from one to two\nyears old. The length of time from planting to fruit bearing varies\nwith the type of fruit. Trees growing at a moderate rate generally\nbear fruit sooner than those grown either too quickly or too slowly.\n\nDwarf fruit trees usually begin to bear one to three years\nsooner than standard-size trees.\n\nThe age trees can be expected to bear fruit after planting\n\nVariety\n\nTime in Health\n\nHealthy trees produce good quality fruit. Weak or diseased\ntrees produce little or no fruit or fruit of poor quality. The\nfirst step in fruit production is to keep the fruit trees healthy.\n\nTwo of the main problems involved are insects and diseases.\nTypical diseases attacking the leaves and fruit on apple and pear\ntrees are scab fungi. The fungus which causes brown rot on apricot cherry, peach and plum\ntrees can also attack the blossoms.\n\nDiseases and insects can be controlled through the periodic\napplications of the proper insecticide and/or fungicide. These\nmaterials, if used properly, can be effective against most fruit\ntree pests. Contact the Cooperative Extension Center for control\nleaflets for specific fruits. When fruit trees are not sprayed\nproperly or are left untreated, disease and insects may restrict\nthe size and quality of the yield, although the tree itself usually\ncontinues to bear fruit. It is also possible to purchase varieties\nwhich are resistant to one or more of the common diseases.\n\nClimate and Weather\n\nMost hardy fruit trees need a certain\namount of cold winter weather to end their dormancy and to promote\nspring growth. When winters are too mild, spring growth is delayed,\nirregular and slow. These factors extend the period of blooming\nand, thereby, increase the possibility of frost injury.\n\nExtreme cold during winter dormancy may\nkill the fruit buds. Winter weather rarely threatens apple, pear,\nplum and sour cherry varieties. Sweet cherry trees, however, are\nrelatively sensitive to cold until they become dormant. Peach\ntrees are very vulnerable to cold weather. Their buds can be killed\nby midwinter temperatures around 10oF below zero. The\nstone fruits, cherry, peach, plum and nectarine, can lose cold\nhardiness due to extended midwinter warm periods. Damage to the\nflower buds can be extensive, especially if the warm period is\nfollowed by a very cold period.\n\nAs the fruit buds grow and open, they\nbecome more susceptible to frost injury. The exposed buds can\nusually withstand temperatures near 24oF. However, the\nopen blossoms of practically all fruit trees will be killed if\nthe temperature drops below 24oF.\n\nWhen a heavy frost is expected, covering\nthe trees will sometimes prevent bud or blossom injury, provided\ntemperatures do not fall too low and the cold weather is of short\nduration. Polyethylene sheets or plastic bags that reach to the\nground are usually effective, but cheesecloth and even old bed\nsheets may be used.\n\nDuring spring frosts, some commercial\ngrowers heat their orchards, but this method is impractical for\nmost home gardeners. An alternative method is to sprinkle the\ntrees with water. Start when the temperature falls to the low\n30s. Keep the water running until all the ice is melted. Water\nmost be dripping off the ice at all times or the plant will suffer\nfrom frost damage. After a severe frost, injured blossoms may\nappear normal, but if the pistils (center part of the blossoms)\nare killed, the tree will not bear fruit.\n\nPollination\n\nAll fruit trees need to be pollinated.\nWithout sufficient pollination, they may blossom abundantly but\nwill not bear fruit. Some species of fruit trees have perfect\nflowers. Both the anthers, which contain pollen, and the pistils,\nwhich develop into fruit, are located in the same blossom. If\nthey bear fruit as a result of pollination from their own anthers,\nthese trees are called self-fruitful.\n\nSelf-fruitful tree fruits include quinces,\nsour cherries, apricots (except Perfection and Riland), peaches\n(except the J.H. Hale and several others) and European-type plums,\nsuch as the Stanley, Green Gage and Italian prune.\n\nHowever, there are many types of fruit\nwith perfect flowers that cannot produce fruit from their own\npollen. These require pollen from another variety and are called\nself-unfruitful. Self-unfruitful types include most apple, pear,\nsweet cherry and Japanese and American plum trees. To pollinate\nadequately, two or more varieties must be planted near each other.\n\nSome species of fruit trees do not fit\nconveniently into either category. Some have pollen-producing\nmale trees and female trees which produce fruit. To grow them\nsuccessfully, it is necessary to plant at least one tree of each\ngender near each other. Fruits grown in Connecticut fitting this\ncategory are the hardy kiwi and persimmons. When selecting the\nvarieties of the self-unfruitful tree fruits, make sure the flowering\nperiods of the different varieties overlap. The following planting\npractices are recommended for the self-unfruitful plants.\n\nApple\n\nPlant at least two varieties of apple\ntrees near one another. Golden Delicious, a self-fruitful type,\nis one of the few exceptions to this rule. Poor pollen-producing\ntypes, such as Baldwin, Gravenstein, Stymen, Winesap and Rhode\nIsland Greening, need to be planted with at least two other varieties\nto ensure adequate pollination of all.\n\nPear\n\nMany varieties of pears are completely\nor partially self-unfruitful. For adequate pollination, plant\nat least two varieties together. Note: Bartlett and Seckel pears\nwill not pollinate each other and Magness cannot be used as a\npollinator.\n\nPlum\n\nSince most varieties of Japanese and\nAmerican plums are self-unfruitful, plant two or more varieties\ntogether.\n\nSweet Cherry\n\nBing, Lambert and Napoleon (Royal Ann)\ncherry trees do not pollinate one another. Plant a pollinating\nvariety, such as Black Tartarian, Republican, Van or Windsor,\nor a sour cherry, such as Montmorency, nearby.\n\nBiennial Bearing\n\nOccasionally certain fruit trees, such\nas apples, bear heavily one year and sparsely the next.\n\nThis is called biennial bearing. The\nbuds of most hardy fruit trees have been set during the previous\nsummer. Therefore, an especially heavy crop one year may prevent\nadequate bud formation for the following year.\n\nBiennial bearing is difficult to alter\nor correct. However, it is possible to induce a return to normal\nyearly fruit production by early and heavy thinning during the\nyear in which the trees are producing their large yield.\n\nAbout 30 to 40 healthy leaves are needed\nto produce good quality fruit. Within 30 days after bloom, thin\nto leave only four to seven fruit per yard along the branches.\n\nCultural Practices\n\nFruit trees need full sunlight for best\nproduction. Inadequate sunlight delays the beginning of flowering\nand may reduce the amount and size of fruit. Avoid placing fruit\ntrees where they will be shaded by buildings or by other trees.\n\nTrees will grow more vigorously and bear\nbetter if they have adequate space to develop their root systems.\nDo not plant them where roots of trees or large shrubs will compete\nfor water and plant nutrients. To reduce competition from weeds\nor grasses, cultivate, use a mulch or carefully apply a properly\nregistered herbicide.\n\nApply adequate amounts of fertilizer\nto produce strong growth. Avoid excess fertilizer which will produce\nweak, leggy growth and delay the setting of flower buds. Prune\nyoung apple trees to develop a strong framework with a central\nleader and horizontal branches. Excessive upright growth will\ndelay fruit bearing and reduce the quantity of fruit produced."

      "text": "Author Fred Brooks American Samoa Community College Land Grant Program\n\nMycelial crust of Phellinus noxius growing on a multi-stemmed tree in the rainforest. (Courtesy F. Brooks)\n\nSymptoms and signs\n\nSymptoms of brown root rot disease are similar to those caused by other root rot pathogens: slow plant growth, yellowing and wilting of leaves, defoliation, branch dieback, and plant death (Figure 2). These aboveground symptoms are caused by a root and butt rot that hinders uptake and transport of water and nutrients from the soil. Fallen trees with visible rot are another general indication of the disease (Figure 3). Although dead wood is initially discolored reddish brown, it later becomes white, dry, and crumbly (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 2\n\nFigure 3\n\nFigure 4\n\nFigure 5\n\nFigure 6\n\nFigure 7\n\nSigns of the pathogen, unlike the symptoms, are distinctive for this disease. Phellinus noxius forms a thick, dark brown to black crust of mycelium around infected roots and lower stems (Figure 5), which gives the disease its name. The leading edge of the crust is creamy white, glistens with drops of clear, brownish exudate, and is usually noticeable even in the dark understory of the rainforest (Figure 6). Patches of white mycelium are present between the bark and sapwood (Figure 7). As colonization progresses, white, soft, crumbly wood becomes laced with reddish strands of fungus hyphae that turn black with age (Figure 8). Sporocarps, or fruiting bodies, are brown to black and rough on the sterile upper surface (Figure 9), gray to gray-brown on the spore-forming lower surface (Figure 10).\n\nFigure 8\n\nFigure 9\n\nFigure 10\n\nPathogen Biology\n\nPhellinus noxius, in the class Basidiomycetes, is a facultative parasite. It obtains nutrients from dead or dying plant tissue, unlike rust or powdery mildew fungi, obligate parasites that require a living hosts for their nutrient supply. As a tropical plant pathogen its mycelium grows best at 25-30°C (77-86°F); it does not grow at temperatures below 4°C (39°F) or above 40°C (104°F). Colonies grown in the laboratory have distinctive raised brown and white plaques and occasionally produce arthrospores, asexual spores formed by division of special hyphae into one-celled segments. Many fungi produce asexual spores that allow them to move within the same plant or from plant to plant. Arthrospores of P. noxius have not been observed in nature, however, and their importance remains unknown.\n\nThe mycelium of P. noxius produces enzymes that break down the middle lamella and cell walls of the plant into simple sugars. This supplies nutrients to the mycelium and allows it to move deeper into the wood. It is sometimes called a white rot fungus (Figure 4) because it degrades lignin, a complex molecule that gives wood much of its strength and brown color. Like brown rot fungi, P. noxius can also break down colorless polysaccharides, but neither as quickly nor as efficiently. Brown rot fungi, however, cannot dissolve lignin and the wood retains its brown color. The mycelium of P. noxius also forms microhyphae and hyphae with extracellular sheaths. These structures are found where wood is being destroyed but their exact function is not yet known.\n\nSexual Reproduction\n\nBasidiospores of P. noxius contain one nucleus (monokaryotic) and are haploid. When haploid hyphae (n) of different mating types touch each other, they can fuse (plasmogamy) to form a dikaryotic mycelium with cells containing two haploid nuclei (n + n). This dikaryotic mycelium is the most common condition in nature. The hyphae can be modified—swelling, thickening, or sticking together—to produce a mycelial crust or sporocarps. The latter often start as small round patches on stems of dead trees (Figure 11). Patches may continue to grow flat against the wood (effused, Figure 12), grow out into a shelf-like conk (reflexed, Figure 13), or a combination of both (effused-reflexed, Figure 14). The upper surface of reflexed and effused-reflexed sporocarps is sterile, the lower fertile surface covered with small tubes, or pores. These pores are lined with basidia, whose two nuclei fuse (karyogamy) and undergo meiosis, producing four haploid basidiospores (Figure 15). During wet weather basidiospores are released and spread by the wind.\n\nFigure 11\n\nFigure 12\n\nFigure 13\n\nFigure 14\n\nFigure 15\n\nPhellinus noxius sporocarps are sometimes confused with those of P. lamaensis, another tropical Phellinus species. Phellinus lamaensis sporocarps have short, reddish-brown, cone-shaped cells called hymenial setae growing into their pores (Figure 16), however, and P. noxius does not (Figure 17).\n\nFigure 16\n\nFigure 17\n\nDisease Cycle and Epidemiology\n\nEpidemiology\n\nPhellinus noxius is present in native tropical forests and plantations on infected roots and stumps and in woody debris. It does not form survival structures, such as sclerotia or resting spores, but may persist in dead roots and colonized wood for many years. Centers of disease radiate outward as roots of healthy trees come in contact with roots of diseased trees. Trees of all ages are susceptible. A mycelial crust forms around infected roots, secreting wood-rotting enzymes as it moves up the roots to the stem. Crusts 0.5-1.0 cm thick usually extend 1-2 m (3-6 ft) up the stem, though crusts almost 5 m (15 ft) high have been measured (Figure 18). If the tree does not die from severe root rot, it is killed when the crust surrounds the stem and the underlying mycelium destroys the sapwood. Sporocarps occasionally develop on standing dead trees, stumps, or trees blown down following severe root decay. Infection of freshly cut stumps or wounds by windborne basidiospores has been demonstrated experimentally but is not as important to disease spread as root-to-root contact. Basidiospores may, however, be responsible for some long distance dispersal of the fungus.\n\nFigure 18\n\nDisease Management\n\nTropical forests cleared for planting must be carefully surveyed for trees and stumps with signs or symptoms of brown root rot. Partial success has been obtained by pushing diseased trees and stumps into piles with a tractor and burning them. Some infected roots and debris will still remain in the soil, however, so newly planted trees that develop symptoms should be removed, roots and all, as quickly as possible. Leaving land fallow for several years or planting annual crops with vigorous root systems to break down remaining debris may offer the best approaches but they are seldom practiced due to economic considerations.\n\nDecreasing root contact reduces spread of the fungus. This is especially important in monocultures (see lesson on Dutch elm disease), as disease usually spreads faster in single-species plantings than in mixed-species plantings. Trees should be planted close enough together for maximum yield but far enough apart to minimize root contact. Thinning to remove large diameter trees reduces disease spread by removing their extensive root systems.\n\nChemical control is not economical on a large scale and tree varieties of important crop species resistant to Phellinus noxius have not been developed. Future solutions may be found in genetic engineering or classic biological control methods.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe spread of root diseases in native rainforests is usually restrained by differences in local conditions, such as soil type, plant density and diversity, and microorganisms. Clearing forests upsets this restraint. When E. J. Corner described Fomes noxius (now Phellinus noxius) as a new species in 1932, he said it was usually found in cleared or disturbed areas; recent surveys tend to support this. Since the beginning of the 20th century, many plantations of rubber, tea, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, and mahogany established on cleared forests sites have been damaged or destroyed by P. noxius.\n\nAs growing populations in tropical countries convert agricultural land to other uses, remaining native forests are cleared for plantations, large-scale farms, and subsistence agriculture (Figure 19). Tropical soils are quickly depleted of nutrients, however, and may be lost to erosion during heavy monsoon rains. Further, the presence of fungal pathogens such as P. noxius can destroy even the most carefully managed venture. Some scientists are also concerned with loss of genetic diversity, both by the open killing of endangered species and by destruction of their habitats. An estimated 70% of the world's species live in tropical forests and these forests are being cleared at the rate of 0.5 to 2% per year (Figure 20)."

      "text": "Tri-County EMC\n\nCurrent Lines - Article\n\nConsider Planting Trees as an Energy Efficiency Investment\n\nTrees properly placed around your home or business can save you money. It's an easy concept to understand. When hanging out in the yard on a hot summer day, do you prefer the full sun or the shade from a tree? Now look at your home. What percentage of the day, especially in the late afternoon when the sun is at its hottest, is your home bathed in sunlight? If getting out of the sun makes you more comfortable, imagine what it could do for your home and your cooling bills. (76236-01)\n\nEast and west facing trees provide the greatest benefit for reducing heat gain and reducing energy use. This is magnified if your home has lots of windows that face direct sunlight. Blinds and curtains help, but keeping direct sunlight off of these windows dramatically reduces heat gain through them. Strategically planting trees that shade your home throughout the afternoon could reduce your cooling bills by 10 to 20%.\n\nTaller trees will help provide shade from mid-day sun. As the afternoon sun gets lower on the horizon, you may need lower growing trees or shrubs to block the hot rays coming at your home from a lower angle. Get a game plan together for the number and height of trees you need to create shady spots and then consult with a nursery about the varieties of trees and shrubs that will work best in our climate and your soil type. (15896-01)\n\nThe good news is that fall and early winter is a great time to plant trees. Planting trees in November allows roots to get established before the cold of winter, meaning you should have to water them less next summer.\n\nHere are a few tips to consider for planting trees and shrubs that will save energy and lower your bill:\n\n?\n\nDeciduous trees, which drop their leaves in the winter unlike evergreens, will provide shading in the summer, but will allow winter sun to reach windows, helping lower heating bills.\n\n?\n\nConsider a combination of fast and slow growing varieties. Slow growing trees may take years to help with shade, but they tend to have deeper roots and branch structures that stand up to wind and time.\n\n?\n\nShading your outdoor air-conditioning units will make them more efficient, perhaps as much as 5 to 10%. But avoid planting anything that could block airflow on the sides or top of the unit. Never under any circumstances should you plant or construct anything over the top of a central air-conditioner.\n\n?\n\nIf you are considering building a new home, work with your contractor to protect trees on your lot. The shade provided by a forty-year-old tree may be virtually impossible to replace and could give you a lifetime of shade for the yard and home."

They are some of the most popular fruit trees grown in warm winter climates. They certainly offer attractive shaped trees that produce fruits that are nourishing, are flavorful when eaten fresh, can be squeezed for juices, are used in cooking, make great snacks and even look great as garnishes. Citrus trees grow in size from small dwarfs of 3 -4 feet tall to medium-sized shade trees. They have handsome, glossy, deep green leaves and flower with pretty white blossoms that fill the air with perfume.\n\nCitrus trees are decorative and can be used in many ways in landscape design. Dwarf varieties are ideal to grow in pots. These can not only be ornamental but allow the pots to be moved to more protected quarters should cold weather threaten. Most varieties of citrus fruit trees can handle light frost, but they will not survive hard frosts or lengthy periods of cold. Winter cold snaps can damage developing fruit.\n\nGrow citrus trees near seating areas, on patios or balconies or around windows and doors. The sweet fragrance of the flowers will fill the air. Use the plants as shade trees, decorative shrubs or plant them in groups to form screens. Citrus trees can be planted in home orchards, too.\n\nIf you don't have a large piece of property for planting whatever varieties of citrus you want to grow, you will need to choose which kind of citrus tree is best your you to grow in your garden. So which is better, orange, lemon, kumquat, tangerine, grapefruit or lime? There are some things to consider when you decide on what kind of citrus tree to plant in your garden. They may help you select the best citrus tree for your landscape.\n\nFrost-free locals will allow you to grow almost any of the citrus fruits. Give them full sun, rich, well-drained soil and occasional deep watering that will penetrate to the bottom of the root system. For cooler areas you will want to choose the more hardy varieties of citrus. The most frost tolerant citrus plants are the kumquats. Most tangerine varieties are quite cold tolerant. Lemons bear colder temperatures than oranges and the least frost tolerant citrus trees are the limes and grapefruits.\n\nAlso consider your soil. Citrus prefer a slightly acid soil with plenty of organics. You can amend your soil to make them happier. Sometimes you will notice the leaves yellowing on plants that are not able to take up iron sufficiently. If adding iron to your soil doesn't help, try some iron sulfate to help acidify the soil so the iron can be absorbed.\n\nMake sure you have a space where your tree will get plenty of sun. Citrus trees will tolerate a little shade, but they need at least some direct sun, too.\n\nIf you have limited space or simply can't decide which kind of citrus you want for your garden, you might want to spend a little extra and buy a 'citrus salad' tree — a single stemmed tree with grafted branches from several different varieties. The 'citrus salad' tree will allow you to grow from three to five different types of fruit all on one tree.\n\nWhether you want a specimen tree, a potted tree, a shade tree or a well-behaved, small evergreen tree, consider planting a citrus tree. If you choose the right variety for your garden, you will get wonderful fruit — oranges, lemons, grapefruits, tangerines, limes, kumquats, etc. — and sweet, fragrant flowers for much of the year as well as a decorative tree that will enhance the look of your landscape."

These include mechanical trauma and environmental stress that can weaken the tree's resistance to infestations by insects, bacteria and fungi. In urban/suburban settings it is usually physical trauma (e.g., scraping the tree trunk with the lawnmower or striking it with the string of a weedeater) that results in bark missing from trees. Physical trauma caused by deer rubbing their antlers on trees can happen both in urban/suburban settings and in the wild. Some of the missing bark you see in the woods is probably due to deer rubbing their antlers to remove the velvet and to establish their territory and attract mates. Other animals (squirrels and other rodents) will also eat tree bark. Additionally, the extreme heat combined with drought conditions certainly have had an adverse effect on the health of all vegetation. The NOAA Little Rock website shows your county (Carroll County) in northwest Arkansas as abnormally dry in 2011, but not in extreme drought. In Texas, not only did we experience extreme heat but also extreme drought. Your temperatures were certainly high, but again not as high an average as those here in Central Texas. It is reported that 10% of the trees in Texas have died because of the extreme drought and heat.\n\nSo, in answer to your question, if your area has a high deer population, that could explain at least part of the loss of tree bark. There is no doubt, however, that the extreme heat and dry conditions have stressed the trees all over the southwest this summer causing disease and death.\n\nMore Trees Questions\n\nSuckers from Oak Tree Roots in Austin May 17, 2013 - Hi.

Bring home and plant all the trees, shrubs, perennials and cool-season vegetable starts you want because the soil is warming and ready for planting. You still need to protect warm season annuals from cold nights so unless you have a greenhouse or sunny window wait another few weeks before investing in tomato, squash or frost-sensitive bedding plants.\n\nYou can see photos and videos of my own garden as it wakes up on my blog by Googling \"Lowes Garden Grow Along\" and I would love your comments about what I've got growing. But first, here are some answer to the questions local gardeners are asking now:\n\nQ. I need a list of plants that will survive under the shade of a big, old holly tree. I have this monster pruned every year but not much wants to grow in the dry shade around the roots. The entire bed gets full of prickly, brown, ugly, holly leaves and I am sick of raking them up. Thank you for any help. K.M., Tumwater\n\nA. The answer to what to plant in this garden ghetto area is a natural. Our native sword ferns are evergreen, beautiful, inexpensive and even play winter host to the little tree frogs that help control insects in the garden. Sword ferns thrive in dry shade and the arching fronds will help hide the falling mess of old holy leaves. Fill in with low-growing lamiums, saxifrage \"London Pride\" and don't overlook the color and texture of a few large boulders to add some lighter contrast to the bed. Another idea is to let your holly grow all the way to the ground and don't plant beneath the wide skirt of foliage.\n\nQ. We have an 18-year-old \"Frost\" peach tree that has produced large, juicy peaches in the past but for the last five years the peaches are large and juicy but have little flavor. Any suggestions? R.Y., Tacoma\n\nA. Your peach tree needs more nitrogen. Over the years I suspect your soil has become depleted and a flower and vegetables plant food applied in a circle around the drip line of the tree and then covered with a compost mulch should improve the flavor of your peaches in time to make your mouth melt this summer. The \"drip line\" of a plant is the area right under the tips of the branches as they extend away from the trunk. Slow-release plant food are those made from organic products like manures, algae and greensand or those that are in little cases or pellets and break down gradually in your soil.\n\nQ. Why are there never any berries on my holly tree? L.L., Cathlamet\n\nA. Your holly could be lonely. Only female hollies have berries but holly needs some hand-holding from a male plant before she will bear fruit. To get a good crop of berries you should have two hollies, a male and a female. Take a branch of your barren holly to the nursery, then check out the male and female hollies on display. This will help you to identify if your holly is male, female or just as confused as you are about it's gender. Purchase another holly plant that looks least like your own and hope your matchmaking is fruitful. Birds love holly berries in the winter but be careful what you wish for – volunteer holly plants can start popping up all over your garden from a fruitful holly tree.\n\nIncredible Edibles: When planting fine seeds like lettuce or radish into the garden bed, add some sand to the seed packet and shake well. This will make it easier to sprinkle the seed onto the soil and see where you've planted. Don't bury small seeds too deep. Press tiny seeds gently into the soil and then just barely top with a sifting of soil"

      "text": "Green is usually good, but not always\n\nEnglish ivy, Hedera helix L, as seen here on sycamore trees along the towpath in C&O Canal National Historical Park, is considered invasive, or harmful to native ecosystems.\n(By Celeste Maiorana)\n\nCeleste Maiorana\n\n11:21 a.m. EST, January 21, 2011\n\nWinter is a good time to look at, evaluate and make a plan of action concerning your trees and shrubs and woodlands. It is also a good time to notice what is evergreen and what is not. While you might think that all that's green and growing is good, it is not always true.\n\nAs you drive and walk around your neighborhood and the countryside, please take time to notice an evergreen vine that can be seen growing thickly, sometimes overwhelmingly, up trees. This is likely to be English ivy, and once you start noticing it, you might be surprised about how commonly it can be seen growing up trees in yards and along woodland edges.\n\nIvy is often planted as a hardy ground cover in shady areas where it is difficult to grow grass or sun-loving perennials. Once established, it needs little care.\n\nIn your yard and on the ground, ivy is not usually a problem. Unfortunately, it is not easily contained and will grow vigorously along the ground until it finds something to climb. Once up in the air, it will flower profusely and dangle abundant fruits for birds to eat and sow seeds far and wide. Ivy can also be spread from pieces of cut vines that can root and grow if dropped in moist soils, and it can also survive and grow away from insufficiently managed compost piles.\n\nNot native to the United States, ivy is considered invasive, or harmful to native ecosystems in Maryland and 17 other states and Washington, D.C. It infests woodlands, forest edges, fields, hedgerows, coastal areas, salt marsh edges and other areas where some soil moisture is present. And even though it has been banned in some states, in many others, it continues to be marketed as an attractive, low maintenance, evergreen alternative to lawns.\n\nIvy impacts all levels of our forest ecosystems. As it climbs in search of increased light, it engulfs and kills branches by blocking light from reaching the host tree's leaves. Branch dieback proceeds from the lower to upper branches, often leaving the tree with just a small green \"broccoli head.\" The host tree eventually succumbs entirely from this insidious and steady weakening.\n\nIn addition, the added weight of the vines makes infested trees much more susceptible to blow-over during high rain and wind events and heavy snowfalls. Trees heavily draped with ivy can be hazardous if near roads, walkways, homes and other peopled areas. On the ground, English ivy forms dense and extensive monocultures that exclude native plants. Once established in a forest, it can, in time, create an ivy desert.\n\nIvy is just one of many commonly sold plants, which invade and damage natural ecosystems. There are always native and non-native, non-invasive alternatives to invasive species. If you have ivy in your yard, think about replacing it. Or try to keep it contained and on the ground.\n\nIf you are reluctant to cut ivy off your trees because you think that the dead ivy vines will be unsightly until they finally fall from the tree, keep this in mind: All those who love trees and forests will thank you from the bottom of their hearts each and every time they walk or drive by and see those dead ivy vines clinging to your liberated tree.\n\nCeleste Maiorana is a member of the Washington County Forest Conservancy District Board, which promotes forest conservation in Washington County.

Start with the weak, internal branches that are unlikely to bloom again, then interweave or tie up any young, new canes to fences, trellises or arbors. Remove weak, internal branches that are unlikely to bloom again.\n\nAvoid pruning oaks, especially red oaks this late in the season (oak wilt!)\n\nBegin thinning peaches and plums till the fruit are 6-8 inches apart. If you can=t stand that, thin them to 5-6 inches but THIN THEM, NOW! The fruit will be larger and you'll have fewer broken limbs.\n\nBeware of bagworms on evergreens and webworms on pecans and shade trees. Hand pick them or control them with water pressure or insecticidal soap.\n\nBeware of aphids on vegetables and vegetables and thrips on roses. Control them with water pressure, ladybugs or recommended insecticides.\n\nControl abelias, Elaeagnus, Lady Banksia roses and other woody shrubs and vines by removing erratic branches. Control spring weeds by regular mowing. You should never remove more than 25% of the leaf blade when you mow"

There may also be leaf spot and blast of young flowers and shoots. The sour sap phase of bacterial canker may not\nshow gum and cankers, but the inner bark is brown, fermented, and sour\nsmelling. Orange or red flecks and pockets of bacterial invasion under the bark occur outside canker margins.\nFrequently, trees sucker from near ground level; cankers do not extend below ground.\n\nPseudomonas syringae survives on plant surfaces, is spread by splashing rain, and is\nfavored by high moisture and low temperatures in spring. The bacterium is\ncommonly found on healthy as well as diseased plants and becomes pathogenic\nonly on susceptible or predisposed trees.\n\nThe disease is found almost exclusively in\nreplanted orchards where ring nematodes flourish or in locations where spring\nfrost is a problem. The disease is worse in low, gravelly, or sandy spots in\nthe orchard. Vigorous trees are less susceptible to bacterial canker, while\nyoung trees, 2 to 8 years old, are most affected. The disease rarely occurs in\nthe first year of planting unless the ground is not fumigated before planting\nand is uncommon in nurseries.\n\nThe key to bacterial canker management is control of ring nematodes\nand maintaining healthy, vigorous trees. Any management practice that improves\ntree vigor (e.g., lighter, more frequent irrigation with drip or\nmicrosprinklers, improved tree nutrition [especially nitrogen], etc.) will help\nreduce the incidence of this disease.\n\nIt is very important to fumigate sandy soils\nwhen apricot trees are to be planted following an old apricot, peach, almond,\nor other Prunus spp.\norchard. Rootstocks of plum parentage (e.g. Myrobalan, Marianna 2624) are\nhighly susceptible to bacterial canker. Lovell peach and Viking rootstocks are\nmore tolerant than Nemaguard or apricot rootstocks. In soils with high levels\nof ring nematodes, annual fall treatments with a nematicide are beneficial. There\nis evidence that pruning during the dormant period may make trees more\nsusceptible than pruning after trees become active in spring or pruning in\nsummer. Copper sprays applied at the beginning and end of leaf fall have been\ntried with highly variable results.\n\nManagement Decisions\nIn light,\nsandy soils and in some heavy soils, control has been achieved with preplant\nfumigation for ring nematodes. Nematodes stress trees, which predisposes them\nto bacterial canker. The benefits of preplant soil fumigation for control of\nbacterial canker usually last only a few years.\n\nCOMMENTS: Chloropicrin tends to invigorate young trees, which\ncan be advantageous in replant situations and where one Prunus orchard replaces a previous one.

This tree with flowers is covered with masses of snow-white flowers that are ever-changing as they age.\nCold-hardy Hydrangea is a reliable bloomer.\n\nPeeGee Hydrangea, trained to a large, single trunk for quick, upright growth. This plant is well-loved by generations of gardeners and for good reason: in August and September it produces huge conical trusses of double flowers--up to 18in long--that are rich creamy white and fade gradually to shades of pink and then brown.\n\nThe foliage is a dark green that shows off the flowers to good effect. On its own it makes a broad shrub to 12ft high and 10-15ft wide. Some gardeners prune it up to create a small Hydrangea Tree. It flowers on new growth and so can be pruned in spring to make a smaller plant; this also produces the largest flowers. PeeGee Hydrangea is one of the best varieties for cutting and for drying.\n\nGrowing Guide\n\nHydrangea and Hydrangea Tree\n\nLight/Watering: Most varieties thrive in full sun in the North, but in the South require afternoon shade, and H. serrata 'Blue Billow' prefers full to part shade everywhere. Moist soils that do not dry out are best; do not plant in hot, dry, exposed sites. Mulch to conserve moisture and buffer soil temperatures.\n\nFertilizer/Soil and pH: Fertilize once in spring with a formulation for acid-loving plants. Soils should be moist but well drained, and rich in organic matter. In some varieties (H. macrophylla and H. serrata), flower color is determined by the pH of the soil; at low pH (acid soils) flowers will be blue and at higher pH, flowers will be pink. Generally, a pH below 5.0 results in deep, vivid blues and as the pH rises the flowers range from blue to lavender to mauve to a vivid deep pink at pH 7.0 (neutral). The pH determines the availability of aluminum in the soil; this element is more readily available in acid soils, and this availability results in the blue flower color. Since phosphorus ties up aluminum in soils, using a fertilizer low in this nutrient will aid in attaining blue flowers. If pink flowers are desired and your soil is acid, simply add lime to raise the pH and use a balanced fertilizer. Aluminum sulfate will lower pH if blue flowers are desired.\n\nPests/Diseases: None serious for the Hydrangea Tree. Occasionally powdery mildew will infect the foliage, especially in humid areas with poor air circulation. Treat with an appropriate fungicide if the problem is serious, and be sure to rake up and destroy all fallen foliage from your Hyandrea Tree in the autumn.\n\nCompanions: Old-fashioned tawny Daylilies are a classic combination with the PeeGee or Hydrangea Tree (H. paniculata 'Grandiflora'). Astilbes and Oriental Lilies in shades of rose, pink, and white are lovely with the shrubby Hydrangeas.\n\nReflowering: Regularly deadheading the blooms of H. macrophylla Endless Summer™ and H. m. Blushing Bride™ helps encourage repeat bloom on the current year's growth. You may cut the first flowering stems of H. arborescens 'Annabelle' and hang to dry for arrangements; rebloom may then occur in August or September. Dried flowers from the Hydrangea Tree are lovely.\n\nTransplanting: Young plants may be transplanted when dormant in early spring; larger Hydranges Tree varieties are difficult to move once established, but it can be done. Prune top growth after transplanting to reduce water loss.\n\nEnd of Season Care: Rake up and destroy any fallen foliage that was infected by powdery mildew or other fungi. You may wrap H. macrophylla varieties with burlap or other protective covering to help preserve flower buds through a cold winter.\n\nEarly Spring: Prune Hydrangea arborescens 'Annabelle' back to the ground, and prune tree form Hydrangeas now, removing lower suckers and up to half of the older top growth. Prune out any deadwood from all varieties. Check soil pH and adjust up or down if needed for desired flower color of H. macrophylla and H. serrata. Feed plants with a fertilizer for acid-lovers. Complete any transplanting before leaves unfurl.\n\nMid-Spring: Mulch plants after soil has warmed to conserve moisture and buffer soil temperatures. Watch for powdery mildew and treat as needed.\n\nFall: Remove and destroy any fallen foliage that was infected by powdery mildew. If desired, wrap H. macrophylla varieties with burlap or other material to help flower buds overwinter in colder climates"

      "text": "Greasy spot is a disease that's frequently found in tropical and semitropical regions where citrus cultivars are grown. The disease is caused by Mycosphaerella citri. Symptoms appear as yellow to dark brown to black lesions occurring first on the underside of mature citrus leaves (Fig. 1). As the lesions develop on the underside of the leaves, they become darker and a corresponding chlorotic spot will appear on the upper leaf surface. These yellow (chlorotic) spots occur when infected cells fail to develop chlorophyll. Lesions are more yellowish and diffuse on lemons and grapefruit and more raised and darker on tangerines. Affected leaves fall prematurely from the tree during the fall and winter resulting in reduced tree vigor and yield. Greasy spot also infects the fruit of grapefruit trees producing rind blotch.\n\nFigure 1. Greasy spot on a leaf.\n\nThe fungus that causes the disease reproduces by spores on infected and decaying leaves which are on the soil surface. The spores (ascospores) are ejected or released into the wind in response to leaf wetting from rain, irrigation, or heavy dew. Major spore release occurs from April through July. Spores are released into the wind and dispersed within the grove or to nearby groves. Once the spores germinate on the undersurface of the leaf, they grow and penetrate the leaf stomata which are natural openings in the leaf surface which regulate gas exchange between the air and the leaf. After penetration, the fungus grows slowly for several months causing cellular swelling. The swollen tissue starts to collapse and turn brown and eventually black. Several months will pass between infection and the first appearance of visual symptoms in the fall of the year (November - January). Infected leaves usually fall from the tree in late winter (January) to early spring (February) making this time period optimum for surveying groves to determine disease pressure and to develop control programs for the next season.\n\nHigh humidity, above 90%, or high moisture favors spore germination and germ tube growth into the leaf. Infection is enhanced with long periods of leaf wetting or high temperatures which frequently occur on most nights from June to early October. Little infection will occur during the winter (December - February) due to cool temperatures and lower humidity and to low spore numbers. Leaves are susceptible to infection throughout their life when environmental conditions are favorable for disease development.\n\nFruit\n\nWhen fruit is infected, small, necrotic (dead tissue), black spots are produced on the fruit surface with the surrounding area retaining a green color longer which is called greasy spot rind blotch (Fig. 2). The rind blotch is a significant problem on grapefruit that is being produced for the fresh market.\n\nFigure 2. Greasy spot rind blotch.\n\nLeaves\n\nLeaves of grapefruit, tangelos, and lemons are the most severely affected varieties but all commercial varieties are affected to some extent. Within the orange varieties, early and mid varieties (Hamlin and Pineapple) are more susceptible than late oranges (Valencia).\n\nHistorically, affected leaves were normally cultivated into the soil in normal weed control practices thereby reducing inoculum. With the switch to chemical weed control, leaves remain on the soil surface longer allowing for greater production of inoculum. Additionally, as groves were converted to low volume irrigation from overhead irrigation, the frequency of leaf litter wetting has increased allowing for a more rapid release of spores that subsequently infect citrus leaves. Prior to the implementation of low volume irrigation, the major infection period was in June or July. With the more rapid release of spores and earlier decomposition of leaf litter, the infection period had been moved forward into May when environmental conditions are less favorable. As the leaves decay, the production of spores is reduced.\n\nManagement\n\nGreasy spot should be controlled regardless of the intended market for the fruit. The best time to assess disease severity is to observe canopy density and premature leaf drop during February and prior to the emergence of the spring flush. The previous grove history and variety will also affect severity.\n\nIn Florida, greasy spot is usually controlled with a single application of oil or oil and copper in mid-May to June or two spray applications which are timed to be applied in mid-May to June with the second application in late July. On more susceptible varieties, like grapefruit or tangelos, copper is usually required to be incorporated into the spray to achieve successful control. Petroleum oil reduces the penetration of the spores into the leaf, but does not reduce spore germination. Thus the main action of oil is to reduce greasy spot by preventing or delaying the development of symptoms, even when the pathogen is already established deeply in the leaf.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1.

As the temperatures dropped in fall the focus changed to cleaning and prepping for winter. Now, you think to yourself, it is finally winter - time to relax! Well, not quite yet. Winter is the best time of year to prune woody plants such as trees and large bushes.\n\nIn winter trees enter their dormant phase. They are \"resting\" and little to no growth takes place. During this time traumatic effects of pruning are less likely to negatively impact your trees and shrubs. Sap loss is kept to a minimum while fungus and other bacteria - who may also be in a dormant phase - are less likely to attack the open wound on a pruned branch. Without leaves on the branches you will have a better concept of overall tree shape. The lack of leaves aids in exposing all branches increasing your ability to identify dead, weak, or congested branch areas.\n\nDead branches (branches with no leaves or buds and many times fungus growth and flaking bark) are the exception to winter or dormancy period pruning. Dead branches can, and should, be removed any time of year for arbor health and public safety.\n\nThe Conservancy Volunteer program does the majority of pruning in late fall, winter, and early spring.

The branches that can reach a little sun are blooming nicely. Would they survive being transplanted farther out into the yard, facing southeast, with no shade at all? If so, when should I transplant them, and should I prune them first? Thanks\n\nANSWER:\n\nThe first thing to do is choose your time. They should be transplanted (as should all woody plants) during the period of dormancy from about November to February, in this part of Texas. First, trim them down considerably. Some references we have seen have said they can be trimmed to the ground if they have been affected by frost, and will come back. We wouldn't advise trimming them back that far, but certainly a good portion of the top can be taken off. This will relieve the strain on the roots when they are moved, making it easier for the roots to get moisture and nutrients out to the remaining branches on the shrub. Since you have time before you will be making the move, you might spend some of it preparing the hole. Yellow Bells are very tough natives, and can take lots of different soils and are drought resistant. But any plant will do better with a little soil doctoring, especially in the area of drainage. This is a desert plant, and a heavy clay soil that holds moisture around the roots is not going to help the plant at all. Try digging out your hole and mixing in some organic material such as leaf mould or compost into the soil and returning it to the ground. Then mulch over the space with a shredded hardwood mulch. When you are ready to transplant the Tecoma stans, take out as large a root ball as you can handle, damaging as few roots as possible. Get it back into your prepared hole as quickly as possible, trying not to let the roots dry out. Return the prepared soil to the hole, and, again, mulch. The mulch will help to hold in moisture, protect the roots from heat and cold and, as it decomposes, add more organic material to improve the texture of the soil. Stick a hose down into this softened earth, and let the water dribble very slowly until you can see water on the surface. This should be done about twice a week, more often if the weather is dry and hot, until the shrub appears well established and is putting on new growth shade, poor soil in Park Ridge NJ June 17, 2010 - Hello!

A windbreak protects an area up to 10 times as far out as its height -- so a series of 30-foot-tall trees can shield a 300-foot-wide area. Dense windbreaks can cut wind speed by 85 percent. Together these two effects can cut your winter heating bills by 25 percent.\n\nPlace plantings, walls, or berms near -- but not against -- your home to create dead air space. This space acts as an insulator, slowing the escape of heat from your home.\n\nPlant deciduous trees, especially on the south side of a house. They can screen 70 to 90 percent of the hot summer sun yet allow breezes through. Deciduous trees also allow welcome winter sun to filter through the branches once they're bare. Deciduous vines serve the same purpose but, since they're smaller, do so to a lesser degree.\n\nCreate open lawn areas on the south side of your home. These green, open areas create an area for snow to accumulate. The light reflected off the snow and onto your house can offer a radiant heating effect.\n\nBuild a tall fence to slow winter winds. Not only will it lower heating bills, it will provide protection for less cold-hardy plants.\n\nTest Garden Tip: Semi-open fences that allow some air movement through them are the most effective. Solid fences divert air over them with too much force and create an effect like a wind tunnel.\n\nDesign stone or concrete surfaces around your home, such as a patio.

      "text": "Mom's Elm\n\nSubmitted by Jane Brown on Tue, 06/12/2012 - 11:49am\n\nPop planted the American Elm tree in the front meadow, next to the curved edge of the corn field, so he could see it as he sat in the front porch swing. He planted it as a memorial to Mom who loved trees as much as he did. He planted it because he remembered when the street where he learned to walk in Wilmington DE and the central campus of the University of Delaware, where he went to college, were lined with the magnificent arches of the trees overhead.\n\nPop loved trees. Due to his good husbandry of the farm's 50 acres of woods, the whole farm had been designated an American Tree Farm. We had spent many hours in our childhood planting unusual trees as Pop experimented with different varieties.\n\nPop also loved a good view. He often planted trees strategically to block out ugly buildings on neighboring farms. A Deodor cedar almost hid the pretentious columns added when the Frock family put a second story on their house. An English Walnut hid the doublewide Jimmy Yale's farmhand had moved in on the edge of his farm.\n\nBut Mom's Elm was his favorite tree on the farm. Pop was one of the original members of the American Elm Society that supported research to see if a cure for the devastation of Dutch Elm Disease that wiped out the trees in the 1950s and '60s could be found. He was proud that he was keeping one alive.\n\nThe Elm he planted for Mom was a beauty, a rare healthy American Elm that loved its featured spot in the middle of the best view on our 170-acre Maryland dairy farm. It grew tall and spread its strong limbs 40-feet wide. The heifers found shade under its dark green canopy, robins and wrens raised their young high inside. One 4th of July, a cow had her calf under the tree's protective cover.\n\nPop learned all he could about how to keep the tree safe from the dreaded fungal disease. He mowed the grass underneath, and carefully trimmed the bottom branches so they wouldn't touch the ground or the grass. He cleaned fallen branches out from under and eventually put a fence up around it so the cows wouldn't make the ground too hard by their weight and constant stamping away flies.\n\nThe tree grew into its role as a sacred place. It quietly became the focal point, the first thing we looked for as we came to visit Pop from our new home in North Carolina. We loved seeing it gently change to orange-yellow in the fall, and its skeleton black and white curve on the winter horizon. Each spring we looked for the first sign of leaves to make sure it was still healthy. We sat in the porch swing with Pop and admired it.\n\nPop died last June at 94. Two years earlier he had successfully sold the developmental rights to the state of Maryland so the farm would always remain open space. He had willed his body to be used for science. My sister and I agreed that we would return to spread his ashes under the Elm this Fall.\n\nWe sold the farm to the neighboring Amish family. Two of their daughters had married brothers from another Amish family. We were pleased and we thought Pop would be happy with their plan to turn the farm back into the working dairy farm it was when we were growing up. Pop had talked often with David, the Amish father, about the importance of the trees in preventing soil erosion, providing shade and protection for wildlife. We'd told David about the sacred properties of the Elm as we signed the deeds of sale.\n\nBut this week, on the first anniversary of Pop's passing, we learned from friends who have driven by the farm, that the Elm is no longer standing. Few of the old and unusual trees are. The Amish have cut them down, piled them up and burned them. Apparently, their six-mule teams cannot as easily maneuver around big old trees in the middle of fields as modern tractors can. Big old trees, even sacred ones, are not practical when the field needs tilling in straight rows.\n\nWe will have to find another place for Pop's ashes. We hope Pop and Mom are sitting somewhere on a different porch swing looking at other trees. We hope they know how sorry we are.\n\nAs I was reading I kept thinking how there are Elm Streets in almost every town yet I can't say I've ever seen an Elm. Of course the Dutch Elm disease must have taken them all but one special one that was promised to be protected is gone now and that is a sad commentary on humanity.\n\nBlueNC is a labor of love.

      "text": "Exploring Nature in New Hampshire\n\nMore Odds and Ends\n\nWhen I take pictures for this blog I don't usually have a \"theme\" in mind or any pre conceived notion of what the post will contain. I just take pictures of things that interest me, and that I think might interest you. In this post something different happened and many of the things photographed ended up having something in common. I wonder if you can guess what that is before you get to the end.\n\nBirds like cardinals, bluebirds and robins will eat the berries (drupes) of smooth sumac, but these berries seem to be an emergency food because they can usually still be seen in spring. Smooth sumac berries are covered in small, fine hairs that make them very tart. Cleaned seeds can be ground and used as a spice in place of lemon seasoning, and Native American people used the berries to make a drink similar to lemonade. The dried wood of sumacs will fluoresce under a black light, which is an odd but reliable way to identify them.\n\nThe way to tell if you're tapping a sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is to look at the buds, which are pointed and sharp looking. The two lateral buds on either side of the terminal bud are always directly across from each other. If you have a good memory you can check the tree in the fall-sugar maple is the only native maple to be dropping seeds in late summer and fall. Above freezing daytime temperatures along with below freezing nights gets tree sap flowing. In New Hampshire this usually happens in February, but I haven't seen any sap buckets yet.\n\nSap from other maples can be used to make maple syrup but the sugar content isn't as high, so it means more boiling. Sugar maple has the longest period of sap flow before its buds break, so its sap output is greater than in other trees. The red maple buds (Acer rubrum) pictured are clearly very different than those of the sugar maple in the previous photo. Sap from red, black, and silver maples might cloud the finished syrup, but it is still perfectly edible.\n\nI was surprised to see that the leaves of this American wintergreen (Gaultheria Procumbens) had turned red. The leaves of this evergreen plant often get a purplish color in cold weather but I don't think I've ever seen them quite this red. This plant is also called teaberry and was once used to make teaberry gum. It was also used as a pain killer in the same way aspirin is by Native Americans. If you know the taste of American wintergreen you can easily identify the black birch (Betula nigra,) because its young twigs taste the same.\n\nI found a rose hip that the birds and animals missed. Rose hips are the fruit of the rose plant. Fresh hips are loaded with vitamin C and make great jams and jellies, and once dried they can be used in tea. The hips should be cut in half and cleaned well before they are dried because they contain seeds and small hairs that shouldn't be eaten.\n\nThe inside of a rose hip shows the tiny hairs that should never be eaten. Not only do these hairs cause digestive irritation and upset, but they cause also cause something that Native Americans called \"itchy bottom disease.\" The French call them \"scratch butt. \" I'm sure you get the idea.\n\nItching powder is made from the hairs in rose hips and when I was a boy you could find ads for it in the backs of comic books, right next to the sea monkeys and genuine monster kits. The ads used to encourage you to \"Amuse your friends!\" They probably should have said \"Lose your friends!\" because nobody likes having itching powder dumped down their shirt.\n\nRose hips are in the same family (Rosaceae) as crabapples and have the same tangy-sweet flavor. To be classified as a crab apple the fruit has to be less than 2 inches in diameter. Anything greater than 2 inches is considered an apple. The fruit pictured is less than half an inch in diameter and is the only fruit on my tree that the birds didn't eat. It has been hanging there like this all winter. Crabapples are a little too sour to eat raw but they make an excellent jelly. Four species of crabapple are native to North America and have been used by Native Americans for thousands of years.\n\nI stopped at the post office one day and found this amazing ice on a mud puddle there. I don't know what caused the strange patterns on the ice but I've read that the clarity of ice is determined by how much oxygen was in the water when it froze. Oxygen means bubbles and more bubbles mean more imperfections, which in turn mean whiter ice. In fact, the secret to perfectly clear ice cubes involves boiling the water before freezing it, because boiling removes the oxygen. Clarity of ice I can understand, but I don't know what would have caused all of the little \"cells\" that are in this puddle ice. I've never seen anything like them. I boosted the contrast on this shot so you could see them better.\n\nThe swelling catkins on this birch tree shout spring, in spite of the snow and cold. Birch catkins release their pollen before the leaves appear so the leaves don't interfere with pollen dispersal. Leaves limit the distance that the wind can carry the pollen, reducing the chances of successful fertilization between trees. We might be getting blasted by snow and cold, but this tree tells me that spring is coming.\n\nWere you able to guess what the accidental 'theme\" of this post was? It's the color red! I didn't realize until I put it together how much red can be found in the winter landscape. From sumac berries to crab apples to teaberry leaves to the blackberry cane shown in the above photo-they're all different shades of red. My color finding software that I use to cheat color blindness sees dark red, fire brick red, and even plum in this small section of cane. I see a nice fat bud that is another sure sign of spring!\n\nMystery creates wonder and wonder is the basis of man's desire to understand. ~Neil Armstrong\n\nI tap red maples on my place. The only other species on my land is striped maple, but those are far too small for syruping. I did buy a used bucket from my hardware store last week. I still haven't tapped the trees yet though.\n\nI never knew that you could tap any maple tree, I had always thought it was a special property of the sugar maple. It makes sense when you think about it, only I never had! We love the ground sumac on top of barbecued kebab. I've never made it myself, though, I've always bought it. The European sumac has much larger red buds.\n\nOther types of maples leaf out and become bitter earlier, so you have to watch them more closely than sugar maples.You can buy ground sumac in specialty shops here but I've never met anyone who has actually eaten it. Our staghorn sumac berries are somewhat larger than those of the smooth sumac, but are also much fuzzier."

      "text": "Main menu\n\nPost navigation\n\nA: Looking at the image of the yellow poplar, Liriodendron tulipifera, I immediately wondered if you had purchased a columnar cultivar of this tree. Checking the Manual of Woody Landscape Plants, by Michael Dirr, I noticed a yellow poplar cultivar named 'Fastigiatum' that was developed at the Arnold Arboretum near Boston. \"Narrow, with upright lateral branches that almost parallel the central leader…grows 50 to 60' high by 15 to 20' (25') wide; a handsome, useful form; larger plants become fat at the base and lose some of the fastigiated character; put into commerce by Monrovia Nursery; has found a home in commerce.\" If this indeed a 'Fastigiatum' cultivar of the yellow poplar no amount of pruning with alter the shape & form of the tree's canopy. Dirr does mention the tree will broaden with time, but I expect the wait will be a long one. Please consider getting another opinion from a local arborist to see if they agree with my assessment. One possible solution is to have an arborist with a tree spade move this columnar yellow poplar to a new location, so that the common form of the tree can be planted on this site to provide full shade.\n\nQ: My second question is about three maples I planted in the fall of 2008. I took the usual care to score the root ball, plant in a large hole, and not plant them too deep, but I'm convinced that in two years, none of them has grown a single inch. They get leaves, but that's it. My only guess is that the roots can't grow out into the compacted clay, but I can't be sure. What can I do to get them growing, and should I do it this fall or wait until spring?\n\nA: Keep in mind that balled & burlapped and potted trees have lost up to 85% of their roots systems. Some studies show it can take up to 5 years for these trees to recover roots lost during the shock of transplanting. I'm pleased to see that you are aware of the whole planting depth issue. In addition to planting depth issue, I like to inspect tree root systems on site at the nursery to check depth within the ball or pot. I'm also checking to make sure there are no stem girdling roots at this time. Take a moment to read through this web site to better understand the issue.\n\nAs for your maples, I would dramatically enhance the mulch zone around the trees to enhance their growth. In my opinion, fertilization isn't the solution to this problem. The mulch will enhance the site conditions and reduce competition.\n\nOne Comment\n\nI have a Red Maple tree with a large hole near the base of the trunk. I'm afraid it will rot out the trunk and I will lose the tree. Can it be filled with anything to protect it? What about the old method of \"Painting\" with tree wound paint?\nThank you for your help."

      "text": "Repairing Storm Damaged Trees\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhen storms strike, along with damage to property such as houses, power lines, and commercial buildings, they may cause damage to trees in the urban forest. There are six main types of storm damage to trees: 1) blow-over, 2) stem failure, 3) crown twist, 4) root failure, 5) branch failure, and 6) lightning. Each type is the result of a complex and interactive mix of tree problems and climate.\n\nDamage is often relatively minor with only the smallest braches of the tree being injured. Usually damages of this type result in little or no permanent damage to the tree. All that is required is clean up of the broken twigs and branches and perhaps some light pruning to restore a pleasing shape.\n\nSevere damage consisting of large broken branches, split crotches and removal of bark, and splitting or splintering of the trunk can also occur. Strong winds, lightning and heavy ice storms are the most probable causes. When a tree is severely damaged, the first question that must be answered is: \"Is the condition of the tree such to make keeping it worthwhile?\" Take the time and effort to save a tree only if a substantial portion of the tree remains intact and if, when repairs are made, the tree will still be attractive and of value to the property owner.\n\nTreating the tree\n\nAssuming the decision has been made to repair the tree, the next question is: \"Am I capable of repairing the damage myself or should I seek professional help?\" Unless experienced in the use of such equipment and comfortable working off the ground, it may be best to have the work performed by a competent professional. Once it has been determined that a tree can be salvaged there are certain procedures that one should follow.\n\nAssess the damage. Some branches may be broken and hanging in the tree, others may be partially attached, and in some cases, entire forks may be split.\n\nPlan which branches must be removed and where the removal cut should be made.\n\nRemove all damaged branches at the nearest lateral branch, bud, or main stem and not in the middle of a branch.\n\nBranch Removal\n\nBranches smaller than 3-inches in diameter can be removed using pruning shears or a pole-pruner. Sharp, properly aligned shears or pruners will make a clean cut, not crush or tear bark tissue and reduce cleanup time. Use a sharp saw to remove larger branches. If a power saw is used, a safety rope and harness are essential. The most efficient and least damaging way to remove large branches without causing further damage to the tree is the 3-cut procedure. The first cut is the undercut. From the underside, saw approximately 12 to 18 inches from the main stem or branch to which the damage limb is attached. Cut into the branch about 1 to 1½ inches deep and withdraw the saw blade before it begins to bind. For the second cut, or over cut, saw approximately 2 to 3 inches beyond the undercut and continue until the branch is removed. The final or flush cut is made to remove the remaining stub. Saw in the natural depression flush with the trunk or branches. Careless pruning can result in death of the entire branch or in excessive sprouting and the eventual development of more problems later on, since these sprouts are generally short lived and weakly attached.\n\nTorn Bark\n\nIn some instances the tearing of bark on large limbs or the main trunk occurs. This is especially common when trees have been struck by lightning. Carefully trim away all loose bark back to the area where it is solidly attached. Do not cut too deeply into the wood of the tree. This cutting of the bark is referred to as a bark tracing. If possible, all bark wounds should be cut into an elliptical shape, being careful to keep the trace as narrow as possible. This may be difficult on large areas. However, trimming the bark in this manner will encourage rapid healing with minimal wood decay.\n\nSplit Forks\n\nSome forks and main branches that are split apart or partially broken may be repaired without removing one or both branches. This type of work is usually beyond the capability of most homeowners unless they have experienced assistance. If the break is nearly even, it is possible to draw the split portions back together and secure them with a large diameter steel bolt and threaded screw rod placed through the split section. The proper procedure for repair begins with drawing the split together using a small block and tackle or winch. Place this 6 to 8 feet or more above the split to obtain maximum leverage. Drill holes through both halves of the split in which the bolt or rod is inserted. With long split areas, 2 or more bolts may be necessary. In addition to the bolts, it often helps to install a steel cable between the two main braches of the split fork several feet above the split. Use lag screws to attach the cable to each branch. Do not wrap the cable around the branch or it may eventually girdle it. This cable system helps hold the crotch together, thus reducing the chance of further breakage.\n\nWound Treatments\n\nAfter pruning is complete, all wounds larger than 1½ to 2 inches in diameter can be coated with wound dressing or pruning paint. Recent research has shown that dressings and paints probably do not increase the rate of healing. However, they may prevent drying out and provide some cosmetic effect. Several commercial materials are available or a couple of coats of orange shellac suffice. Areas of torn bark where tracings have been made can also be treated in this manner.\n\nUprooted trees\n\nTrees may be uprooted as a result of severe storms. If the tree is large, it cannot be saved and therefore must be removed. For some smaller trees it may be possible to straighten the tree and brace it using guy wires or cables. Some type of power lift or equipment is usually necessary to pull the tree upright. Do not attempt this procedure unless 1/3 to 1/2 of the roots are still in the soil and the remaining exposed roots are relatively compact and undisturbed.\n\nBefore the tree is pulled upright, remove some soil from beneath the root mass so the roots will be placed below the existing soil grade level. Once the tree is back in the upright position, fill in soil as needed. Water the tree to help firm the soil and remove air pockets. Attach 2 or 3 guy lines to the trunk as is often done for newly transplanted trees, at a point approximately two-thirds of the height of the tree and to anchors placed some 12 to 15 feet from the base of the tree to hold the tree in place.\n\nWaste Disposal\n\nMaterials from fallen or salvaged trees can be used in several ways. The larger branches can be cut and used for firewood. Add smaller branches and twigs to the compost pile or cut up for kindling. Branches can also be converted into chips for use as compost, mulch or other landscaping purposes if chipping equipment is available to local residents."

There are many of them due to the drought.\nThank you.\n\nANSWER:\n\nUnfortunately, your Juniperus ashei (Ashe juniper) are most likely dead. Deciduous trees can react to stress by losing their leaves earlier than usual and then re-leaf in the spring or even before spring if the situation causing the stress is alleviated. For instance, this summer during the scorching temperatures and no rain the Juglans nigra (Black walnut) in my yard and the Carya illinoinensis (Pecan) in my neighbor's yard both had most of their leaves turn yellow and fall, but after the 2-inch rain in September they produced new green leaves. Brown evergreens, however, are probably dead evergreens. However, you can test them by bending the smaller branches. If the branches are flexible and full of sap, they're still alive. If they're brittle and dry, they're dead and won't come back. Some of the \"brown\" junipers that are still alive will put out new growth in the spring, but it will be from the tips of branches. If the browned junipers do survive, they're likely to be unattractive for quite some time. That might be reason enough to remove them.\n\nMore Diseases and Disorders Questions"

      "text": "Summertime is coming to an end and autumn is not far behind. The first thing that comes to mind when thinking of the fall is the picture of leaves changing to beautiful, bright colors and falling from trees throughout the Ford House property. However, autumn is not only a time for leaves to fall. It can also be the best time of the year to plant a new tree.\n\nEven though the branches and leaves are dormant during the winter, a tree's root system continues to grow and develop in the slightly warmer soil. By planting a tree in the fall, you allow the root system of your tree to properly develop so that it is able to better support the tree once spring arrives.\n\nTo plant a tree on your property this fall, follow these steps:\n\nDig a wide, shallow hole about three times the diameter of the tree's root ball and shallow enough so that the area of the trunk where the root flairs out is still visible\n\nFill your hole with water to check for proper drainage, if the hole drains in 24 to 48 hours, the soil should be capable of sustaining a tree\n\nRemove any root containers from the tree, as well as any tangled roots\n\nPlace the tree in the hole at the proper height\n\nStraighten the tree and fill the hole about one third full\n\nPlace two to four inches of mulch at the base of the tree for insulation but not against the trunk\n\nStake the tree for support if it will be exposed to high wind or other stresses\n\nOnce your new tree is planted, water thoroughly but not saturated. Keep watch to ensure there are no \"air pockets\" in the root zone. If there is an air pocket, the puddle water will \"whoosh\" away like a flushing toilet. Tamp the soil into the air pocket and, once again, add water. Continue watering your new tree deeply at its base so that it is able to establish its roots before winter. By planting in the fall and caring for your tree, it will be well developed and ready to grow when the warm weather returns."

      "text": "Sapling Planting Instructions\n\nDig! Dig a small hole about 6 inches wide and no deeper than the depth of the root ball. Keep the top of the root ball even with the ground and make sure the tree is placed on firm soil to prevent sinking. Keep the root collar clear of soil and mulch to prevent disease and root rot.\n\nBackfill! Fill the hole with the original soil and no additives. For additional nutrients, add compost on top of the ground before you mulch. Use your hand to firm the soil until the hole is filled. Leftover soil should be placed in a ring that is about 1 foot from the tree.\n\nWater! Saplings need ~ 1/2 gallon of water, three times a week. Leave a hose on trickle for about 1 minute three times a week. Water year round for two years.\n\nNo Stakes! Saplings don't need stakes or ties to grow straight. Young trees grow stronger when they are able to sway with the wind.\n\nDIAL BEFORE YOU DIG\nCall 1-800-344-8377 at least 72 hours prior to planting your tree to allow time for the utilities to be marked. Plant the tree at least 5 feet away from underground utilities, sidewalks or driveways.\n\nWhy Plant Trees in this Drought? Central Texas is facing the most severe drought since 1895 and the hottest year ever! Saplings Days trees are native trees chosen for their drought and heat tolerance. The 1 1/2 gallons a week it takes to water these trees can be captured by intercepting a bit of shower water or veggie washing water. These trees will provide a net gain for the water cycle, helping to recharge groundwater when it rains, and slow and clean runoff. Their shade will help avoid energy consumption, thereby reducing the amount of water needed for energy production."

To see more of his photos, CLICK HERE.\n\nWith a succession of three winter storms lashing Northern California today, it seems appropriate to blog about winter color, though as soon as the storms pass, there'll still be a few weeks more of fall color to report.\n\nEach winter, one of California's most distinctive and colorful shows of foliage is seen at the San Francisco Botanical Garden where nearly 100 rare and historic magnolias erupt in a fragrant riot of vibrant pink and white flowers.\n\nThis floral spectacle is worth planning a trip to San Francisco to see. Some of the ancient trees reach 80 feet in height and peak from mid-January through March. Visitors to the Garden can take advantage of free Magnolia Walk maps, docent-led tours, special signage and more to celebrate and learn about these magnificent trees.\n\nSan Francisco Botanical Garden is home to the most significant magnolia collection for conservation purposes outside China, where the majority of species originated. Its current collection includes 51 species and 33 cultivars, including many prized examples from Asia.\n\nThis unique and long-standing collection began in 1939 with Eric Walther, who planted the very first magnolia in the Garden and continued to introduce species and cultivars throughout his tenure as the first Garden Director. One of the most famous species he planted was the cup and saucer magnolia or Magnolia campbellii, the first of its kind to bloom in the United States in 1940, attracting huge crowds of excited and curious visitors who stood in long lines to see the magnificent large pink blossoms of this lovely magnolia that still stands in the Garden today.\n\nThe show is best, mid-January to March. The garden is open daily from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. in Jan., 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in Feb. and early March, and from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. from the second Sunday in March through Apr. Admission is free to San Francisco residents with proof of residence and $7 general, $5 seniors and students (12 – 17) with ID, $2 children (5-11) and free to kids 4 and under. Family passes (2 adults and one or more kids) get in for a flat rate of $15.\n\nWithout doubt, many others contributed reports, as well. And, for those who I overlooked or did not know, please know that I am indebted to each of you for your efforts, talents, attentiveness and generosity in providing others reports on what you witnessed. This list is incomplete without including my wife, Joan, who has humored my recording color percentages, species and elevations as we would travel hither and yon, and – more importantly – point out particularly beautiful color on our travels across California. Every person should have so dear and understanding a friend, companion and lover.\n\nSpecial thanks are also expressed to the many reporters and media who carried our reports and gave attention to what we have shown about California's fall color. And, of course to the many tens of thousands of people who have followed and contributed to this site, and our Facebook and Twitter pages. You are, after all, the reason we do this.\n\nOur first \"fall color report\" was published on September 12 and our first peak was reported on September 16, a week before the Autumnal Equinox. Fall color is often reported in California right up to the Winter Equinox and beyond. We consider that to be proof of our claim that California truly has the longest and most varied season of autumn color in North America. Indeed, California quite possibly holds the world record. As one of the few Mediterranean climate regions on Earth, California is able to grow a variety of colorful foliage that provides a spectacle unmatched anywhere. That, combined with California's varied terrain and elevations makes our fall color the most varied and long-lasting for leaf peepers, photographers and nature lovers.\n\nDoubting Thomases need only click through any year on the archive, at left, to see the progression of color across The Golden State. The change of color this past season was particularly magnificent. It began earlier than in previous years and was long-lasting. As of today, the show is still progressing, with beautiful color to be seen in the state's urban forests (San Francisco, the San Francisco Peninsula, South Bay and East Bay, its vineyards, the Gold Country, Central Coast and Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties). And, it hasn't ended; the show will continue well into December.\n\nCalifornia Fall Color will continue to report color, as it receives reports. Though, as of today we stop sending weekly updates and photographs to California meteorologists, travel and outdoor writers, until next autumn.\n\nCalifornia sycamore, platanus racemosa, a native tree common in California's foothills and along the Central Coast, has been the subject of artist paintbrushes, through the years, for their multiple and scabrous cream to grey trunks and gracefully twisted branches laden with deeply lobed leaves which vary in color from chartreuse to orange-red. In early autumn the sycamore are the first to decorate woodland floors with their spent, dusty-brown leaves. In winter, stemless seedballs, carried on stalks, provide interest.\n\nThis week, the Santa Ynez Valley News reports the sycamore, along with golden cottonwoods (Californios called them Los Alamos), exotic orange-red liquidambars, burgundy and bronze vineyards and crimson poison oak are dressing the Central Coast in time for Thanksgiving Day dinner.\n\n50 – 75% – Central Coast - Riparian areas along the Central Coast have been nearing peak for the past two weeks and will provide lovely color through the Thanksgiving Day weekend and beyond.\n\nTravel U.S. 101 between Salinas and Ventura along the El Camino Real. An anonymous color spotter reports, \"I did the whole 101 drive from Monterey County to Ventura County yesterday. Vineyards all the way down, have a blend of different shades of fall colors. Brilliant colors like I've never seen! … and Paso Robles, Templeton, Atascadero are saturated with bright yellows, reds, oranges. The fall this year in these areas are better than I've seen in years. A must see!\" Go Now!\n\nAcross California, this weekend, fall color glowed between spurts of rainfall. The cloud cover intensified the color, which was particularly glorious among the urban forests of the Central Valley and Sierra foothills.\n\nJon Klusmire sends this snapshot of a tree whose orange and red leaves have survived recent storms and winds that stripped other nearby trees.\n\nIt stands beside the Eastern California Museum in Independence. Splashes of color like this remain to be seen across the Eastern Sierra during one of the most beautiful and long-lasting autumns we've recorded.\n\nCalifornia Fall Color ends its daily reporting on Thanksgiving Day, though postings will continue as color is reported across California.\n\n50 – 75% – Redding"

      "text": "General Information:\nThis is the tree that is most often used for the\nubiquitous \"mall bonsai\". In spite of this bad press, it\ndoes in fact make a fine bonsai if it is properly\ntrained and cared for (unlike the average \"mall\nbonsai\"). This juniper has a low, spreading habit that\nmakes it ideal for cascade and semi-cascade styles.\nSpecimens grown in a nursery or specifically for bonsai\ncan be used for many styles, but probably not for formal\nupright. In nature it grows as a small ground-cover\nshrub.\nThe foliage is bright green.\n\nLighting: Full sun.\n\nTemperature:Tolerates\na wide range of temperatures, including freezing,\nhowever, roots must be protcted from excessive heat or\ncold.\n\nWatering: Spray the\nfoliage with water daily during the growing season.\nWater when the soil is moderately dry (to a depth of 1/2\nto 1 inch) but do not let the soil dry out completely.\n\nFeeding: Simon and\nSchuster's recommends feeding junipers from early spring\nto autumn ever 20-30 days using a slow-acting organic\nfertilizer. If you prefer to use chemical fertilizers,\napply a half-strength solution every other week of a\nreasonably balanced fertilizer, such as Peter's\n20-20-20. You may wish to alternate with\nan acidic fertilizer such as Miracid. You should not\nfertilize during the hottest part of the summer\n(July-mid August in the northern hemisphere), or if the\ntree is weak or has recently (2-4 weeks) been repotted.\n\nPruning and wiring:To\ndevelop the foliage, pinch out the tender new shoots\nusing your fingers. Do not use scissors, as the cut\nneedles will turn brown. Pinching must be done\ncontinuously during the growing season. Prune\nundesirable branches (especially those growing straight\ndown from their parent branch) when repotting or during\nthe growing\nseason. Wiring is best done in autumn or early winter,\nso that the branches can become accustomed to their new\nposition while the tree is dormant. Wiring done at other\ntimes must be watched carefully for signs of wire\ncutting into the bark, and must be removed immediately\nif this happens. If necessary, the tree can be re-wired\nafter removing the old wire.\n\nPropagation:Cuttings\nrooted under mist, layering.\n\nRepotting:Reduce the\nroots gradually, removing no more than one third of the\nroots at each repotting. Repot young trees (up to 10\nyears) every other year. Repot older trees every 3-4\nyears. Repotting is best done in spring. Junipers can\nalso be repotted in autumn if necessary, since they\nenter a period of renewed root growth at that time.\nExtensive root pruning in autumn is probably not a good\nidea, however. Simon and Schuster's recommends 60% soil,\n10% peat, and 30% coarse sand. Rémy Samson recommends 1\npart loam, 1 part leaf mold, and 1 part coarse sand.\nPeter Chan recommends 1 part loam, 1 part peat, and 3\nparts coarse sand. The tree should be protected from\nwind and direct sun for a month or two after repotting.\n\nPests and diseases:\nJunipers are a favorite victim of red spider mites. If\nthe tree appears weak, with yellowing foliage, it may\nhave spider mites. To check for spider mites, hold a\nsheet of white paper under a branch and gently shake the\nfoliage. If the paper comes away with many small dots\nthat move, it has spider mites. To combat spider mites,\nspray with insecticidal soap or a nicotine solution\n(which can be made by soaking tobacco in water\novernight)."

      "text": "Walnut tree characteristics\n\nWalnut is the common name given to twenty species of deciduous trees in the genus Juglans, of which six species are native to the United States. The black walnut, Juglans nigra, which is native to Virginia, grows from Maine west to southern Michigan and south to Texas and Georgia.\n\nBlack walnut is the tallest of the walnuts, with the potential to reach 100 feet. The compound leaves of walnuts are spaced alternately along the branches. Each leaf is divided into an odd number -- usually from 7 to 23 -- of small yellowish green leaflets. Walnuts are monoecious, with male flowers borne in long, unbranched, drooping catkins and female flowers borne singly or in short spikes. The walnut fruit is a nut, borne singly or in pairs, and enclosed in a solid, non-splitting green husk. The edible, oil-rich nut kernal is enclosed in a thick, hard, ridged, black shell. Black walnut heartwood is heavy, hard, strong, and durable, with a chocolate-brown color prized by furniture manufacturers and many other industries.\n\nWalnut Tree\n\nWalnut leaf with fruit\n\nUnderstanding allelopathy\n\nAllelopathy is a complex phenomenon which Pliny the Elder, a Roman natural science author, first wrote about in 77 A.D. In his writings he noted the toxic effects of black walnut on neighboring plants in the landscape.\n\nAllelopathy involves a plant's secretion of biochemical materials into the environment to inhibit germination or growth of surrounding vegetation. Allelopathy enhances tree survival and reproduction. Some plants that produce allelochemicals can be used in production as cover crops to control weeds. Researchers are presently attempting to breed crops and landscape plants that are allelopathic to weeds.\n\nAllelochemicals are metabolic by-products of certain plants that, when introduced into the environment, cause growth inhibition by affecting physiological processes such as respiration, cell division, and water and nutrient uptake. Symptoms of \"allelopathic effects\" include leaf wilting and yellowing, or death of part or all of a plant.\n\nBlack walnut and allelopathy\n\nThough grown primarily for its wood and nuts, black walnuts are often found growing on landscape sites where they serve primarily as shade trees. When certain other landscape plants are planted near or under this shade tree they tend to yellow, wilt, and die. This decline occurs because the walnut tree produces a non-toxic, colorless, chemical called hydrojuglone. Hydrojuglone is found in leaves, stems, fruit hulls, inner bark and roots. When exposed to air or soil compounds, hydrojuglone is oxidized into the allelochemical juglone, which is highly toxic.\n\nSeveral related trees such as English walnut, hickories and pecan also produce juglone, but in smaller amounts compared to black walnut. Juglone is one of many plant-produced chemicals that can harm other plants in a process known as allelopathy. (Additional common landscape trees with allelopathic properties: sugar maple, tree-of-heaven, hackberries, southern waxmyrtle, American sycamore, cottonwood, black cherry, red oak, black locust, sassafrass, and American elm.)\n\nJuglone in the soil\n\nJuglone is exuded from all parts of the walnut tree. Juglone can affect other plants either through root contact, leakage or decay in the soil, falling and decaying leaves, or when rain leaches and drips juglone from leaves and branches onto plants below. Plants located beneath the canopy of walnut trees are most at risk because juglone from the roots and fallen leaves accumulates there.\n\nAlthough juglone has low water solubility and does not move far in the soil, small amounts may be injurious to sensitive plants. Plant roots can encounter juglone when they grow within 0.5 - 0.25 inches from a walnut root. Walnut roots can extend in the soil well beyond the crown or drip line of the tree, affecting susceptible plants far from the black walnut.\n\nThe accumulation and depletion of toxins in the soil is affected by factors such as soil type, drainage, aeration, temperature and microbial action. Soil microorganisms ingest allelochemicals as energy sources, and metabolic decomposition can render the chemicals non-toxic to plants. When soils are well drained and aerated, a healthy population of aerobic microorganisms can accelerate this process.\n\nWet, poorly aerated soil, very common in many urban areas, discourages microbial growth. Plants sensitive to the walnut tree's toxic effect may be at a higher risk when planted in heavy urban soils that lack organic matter. Toxins adhere to organic matter rather than being absorbed by plants, and organic matter also encourages a healthy soil microbial population.\n\nMycorrhizal fungi are commonly associated with forest tree roots and are considered necessary for normal uptake functions. Allelochemicals can disrupt the uptake process by damaging the root hairs or by inhibiting mycorrhizal populations in the soil. These different soil factors all have an effect on the accumulation or depletion of juglone produced by the black walnut tree.\n\nJuglone production from walnut tree\n\nReducing allelopathic effects\n\n* Compost plant debris to degrade any toxins present in the compost pile, and to detoxify the compost. If composting is impractical, do not use any part of the walnut tree as compost or mulch for other plants.\n\nTolerant grasses\n\nTall fescue and Kentucky bluegrass grow well near black walnut except during drought conditions when soil moisture is low. When moisture is adequate these grasses may grow better under walnut trees than in other parts of the lawn, possibly because the soil may be more basic. Soil under black walnuts tends to be alkaline, with the pH often 0 .7 points higher than beyond the roots, thus influencing the growth of many different plants.\n\nRietveld, W. J. 1983.

They either want recommendations for ground covers or they're thinking of adding soil or mulch. Not all tree roots will protrude above the surface, but those that do are coming up for a reason - they need oxygen. So covering the roots is seldom a wise thing to do. Either the tree suffers or your patience will, as the roots will continue to try and come up for air.

      "text": "Disease & Pest Control\n\nGraf Tree Care specializes in the diagnostics and treatment of tree and shrub diseases and insect problems. Fixing tree problems is difficult, so we believe in a preventative approach to insect and disease control. In many cases, our first encounter with a tree is when it is in a diseased state or when it is already in poor health. Trees are living things and they are difficult to \"fix\". Our approach is to evaluate our client's trees and anticipate what problems we commonly see that the tree may eventually have. Preventative treatments are always much easier, effective, and cost less. There are many fungal pathogens that harm our trees and the soils in which they live in. These pathogens negatively affect a trees ability to thrive and survive in our urban landscape. For instance, foliar fungus like Apple Scab, Hawthorne Rust, and Diploia Tip Blight damage the tree's leaf or needle. This hinders the trees ability to produce food for its self. A full developed leaf or needle is necessary for maximum efficiency in the photosynthetic process, which is how the tree produces sugars, carbohydrates, and starches that move back down to the root system for storage and future use. Not only do these foliar fungal diseases take their toll on tree's health but they also create poor aesthetics, making the trees appear brown or sometimes defoliated completely in extreme cases. These diseases are easily controlled with a series of three fungicide sprays done in a timely fashion in the spring just as the buds are breaking and the leaves and needles are emerging. Our clients have been known to see a noticeable difference in one season in tree health and appearance.\n\nThere are other fungal diseases that are not so easy to control. These are internal fungus, or fungus that reside and clog up the tree's vascular tissue. A trees vascular system is made up of xylem and phloem cells. The xylem is responsible for the uptake of water going up to the leaf and the phloem carries sugars and starches back down to the roots. This is the tree's transport system. When fungal spores invade the xylem the trees water uptake is partially restricted or even completely cut off. The tree then thirsts to death. Common internal fungal diseases include Dutch Elm Disease, Oak Wilt, Verticillium Wilt and Canker Cytosper. These disease are fatal and not possible to treat in a curative fashion. Treatments for these diseases need to take place first as preventative treatments.\n\nInsect problems are also controlled with timely sprays upon emergence for curative treatments or ground applications of insecticides early for a more preventative approach. Insects we commonly treat for are: Zimmerman Pine Moth, Japanese Beetle, Honey Locust Plant Bug, Leaf Miner, and of course, the Emerald Ash Borer.\n\nWe also back up all insect and fungal applications with root feeding to keep the trees in best possible health to help the trees defend against these problems naturally.\n\nBranching Out Newsletter\n\nSign up for our FREE newsletters now!\n\nPHC Alerts\n\nThere has never been a better time for root feeding for your trees. Last year's drought certainly took its toll on our green friends. Nutrient uptake from the soil is directly related to soil moisture, because water is the vehicle that moves nutrients up the tree to the leaf where photosynthesis takes place.\n\nExtreme heat and extended drought can also destroy natural beneficial organisms in the soil. Considering all this, this spring would be a great time for deep root feeding to keep your trees in best possible health. Read more…"

      "text": "Be a Good Neighbor, Step Up and Step Down the Block to Water and Save Trees and Plants\n\nLISLE, IL (July 12, 2012) –The harshest Midwest drought in a quarter century is causing the \"worst drought symptoms I have observed in my professional career,\" according to Kris Bachtell, Vice President of Collections and Facilities for The Morton Arboretum. He urges area residents to be good neighbors and step out to help water trees and plants throughout the neighborhood that are showing stress.\n\n\"Plants and trees are so stressed that they not might make it through the drought without some help,\" says Bachtell. That's why Chicago-area residents are reporting leaves browning and dropping off trees months ahead, because leaves are where the trees lose most of their water, Bachtell says. The symptoms of the drought include: wilted leaves, leaves with a gray-ish cast, scorched leaves, yellowing leaves (particularly interior ones), and dropping leaves. To stave off continued damage, Bachtell recommends area residents take these steps to help avoid damage from this record-breaking drought:\n\nGo on neighborhood patrol. Step out of your own footprint and water the trees on your parkway.\n\nHead down the street with water. Take a five gallon bucket of water down the street and water something that needs to be watered.\n\nWater weekly. Gardeners should continue to water plants weekly. Large, established trees should be watered every two to three weeks in dry periods.\n\nCheck new plants frequently. Newly-planted trees, shrubs, and perennials are still establishing their root systems and should be checked more frequently. Water into the root ball area and surrounding area deeply. This will encourage new roots to grow deeper into the soil. Plants should receive up to one inch of water weekly.\n\nWater container plants more frequently. Container plants can dry out and wilt fairly easily; they should be watered frequently. If plants are in full sun, they likely require more water than containers in shade, which can retain water more easily.\n\nTo check the soil's moisture, either use a soil probe or place your finger in the soil. If it is dry and hard, watering is appropriate. If there is some moisture, continue to monitor the soil's moisture level.\n\nThe Arboretum recommends watering within the drip line of a tree, from the trunk out to the end of the branches, to reach the roots most effectively. The objective is to keep roots moist but not wet. Avoid frequent light watering. Let a hose run slowly at the drip line of the tree, moving it around occasionally. If using a sprinkler system, place a container nearby and let it fill one to two inches.\n\n\"Gator Bags\"–plastic, water-filled vessels that surrounds a tree trunk–provide a slow drip to the root system and are a good way to keep your younger tree well watered.\n\nRemember to keep two to four inches layer of organic mulch around a tree to moderate soil temperature and retain moisture. Do not let it touch the trunk or stems. |\nThis e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it\n| 630-725-2103"

      "text": "Types of trees\n\nBench graft:: Starts out as a rootstock, with the rootstock taken out of the layer bed in November and bench grafted with scion wood between January and April. Bench grafts are delivered for planting after the last spring frost. Bench-graft trunks will be about 14 to 16 inches tall, with the top four inches being the scion wood. Rootstock choice must be made before they are dug, and the scion variety must be determined before the bench grafts are made. Bench grafts give growers more time to decide the scion/rootstock combination, but are the most sensitive to environmental and ­horticultural practices in the orchard.\n\nSleeping eye:: Starts out as a rootstock planted in the nursery a year ahead of the delivery date. The rootstock is budded with scion wood around August, grows the rest of the season, and is cut to the scion bud and dug up for delivery the next spring. Delivered dormant, it can be planted like a bare-rooted tree. Trunk will be about five to six inches long, with the variety at the top and an extensive root system. Rootstock decisions must be made a year prior, with scion decisions made several months after the rootstock decision.\n\nStandard,: finished tree: Follows the same path of a sleeping eye—rootstock planted in spring, budded in August, cut back—then allowed to grow for one more year before digging up the following November for dormant delivery in the spring. Low branches are usually removed to allow for good branch placement; trunk diameter is half an inch or larger, with extensive root system and multiple feathers or branches. Needs to be ordered two years in advance of delivery.\n\nKnipboom tree:: Begins as a bench graft grown in the nursery the first year. The next spring, trees are cut back to desired height and the central leader established, and then dug that fall for delivery in late winter-early spring. Growth is better than with a standard tree because of a strong root system, thicker caliper trunk, and increased branching. Needs to be ordered two years in advance of delivery.\n\nPotted trees: Popular with grape and nut growers, potted pome and stone fruit trees are grown and budded in the greenhouse. Decisions about rootstock and scion wood must be made only about four to five months before delivery in the spring, but transportation costs of shipping dirt are expensive, and the sensitive green tissue must be planted late in the spring after the last frost. Another concern is the root system that is crammed into a five- or six-inch pot"

Fortunately this most often is in the heat of summer and not in spring, other wise it could open the tree up to oak wilt or decline.

The cicada roughs up the bark while laying its eggs that hatch into a small larvae that then drops to the ground and burrows in to feed on roots and other plant parts but will do little more to damage the tree.

      "text": "Pruning fruit trees\n\nProducing bushels of high-quality fruit and developing a sturdy tree that can support the crop are the twin goals of pruning and training fruit trees. If you end up with an attractive landscape specimen too, that's a bonus! Although you use the same basic pruning techniques on all fruit trees, each kind of fruit tree has unique timing and methods for reaching your goals. For an introduction to basic pruning techniques and tools, flip to Chapter 19.\n\nYou need to prune fruit trees regularly for several reasons:\n\nTo remove dead, damaged, and diseased wood: Do this before any other pruning and whenever necessary.\n\nTo control tree and shrub size: Keep fruit down where you can harvest and care for it without a ladder.\n\nTo increase exposure to sunlight: Fruit that's exposed to direct sunlight tastes better than fruit shaded by leaves and branches.\n\nTo increase the quality and quantity of fruit: Branches trained to 60-degree angles where they meet the trunk develop the most flower buds. Spacing the limbs up and down and around the trunk provides the best conditions for the fruit to mature.\n\nProfessional fruit growers use several pruning and training methods, depending on the type of fruit they grow (see Figure 16-2):\n\nCentral leader: Used mainly with apple, European pear and plum trees, large nut trees, and dwarf cultivars, this method yields trees with single, upright trunks, called central leaders. The main limbs should be spaced about 8 inches apart and extend in all directions around the trunk so that no limb is directly above another. To maximize sunlight penetration, prune the limbs so that those at the top of the tree are shorter than branches under them.\n\nModified central leader: In this system, trees are trained to a single, upright central leader, with limbs evenly spaced until they reach a desired height — usually, 6 to 10 feet. At that point, you prune out the leader and maintain the tree at that height. All fruit trees can be trained to this form.\n\nOpen center (also called vase shape): Peaches, nectarines, sour cherries, apricots, Asian pears, and Japanese plums produce easy-to-reach, high-quality fruit when the trees are pruned to this form. In this style, you select four or five well-placed main branches and then prune out the central leader. This method limits the height of the tree and creates a spreading crown.\n\nNote: These styles apply mainly to temperate-climate fruit; tropical fruits, such as citrus, are trained differently.\n\nFigure 16-2:\n\nFrom left to right: Central leader, modified central leader, and open center.\n\nFigure 16-2:\n\nFrom left to right: Central leader, modified central leader, and open center.\n\nChoose young fruit trees with good structure to start with and shape them as they grow. Here's how to get your trees off to a good start:\n\nAt planting time: Remove damaged and dead limbs, those less than 25 inches from the ground, and any with narrow crotch angles of less than 45 degrees. Leave branches with crotch angles between 45 and 80 degrees. If the tree has two shoots competing to be the leader, choose one and remove the other.\n\nFirst winter: In late winter, select three to four limbs to keep as main branches. They should be about 8 inches apart vertically, be well spaced around the trunk, and have approximately 60-degree angles at the trunk. Prune off all other limbs. Prune the remaining limbs back by one third of their length to encourage side branching. Prune the central leader to 24 to 30 inches above the uppermost limb for a central-leader-style tree. If you're pruning for an open center or vase shape, remove the central leader just above the top branch.\n\nSecond summer: In midsummer, remove water sprouts, which grow upright from the branches, and suckers, which grow up from the base of the tree. In central-leader trees, choose the strongest, most upright leader; then remove the competing ones. Using the criteria mentioned for the first dormant season, choose the next tier of limbs, beginning about 15 to 18 inches above the top branch of the lower tier, and remove undesirable limbs. In open-center trees, remove competing, crowded, and upright shoots.\n\nSecond winter: Remove undesirable limbs, competing leaders, water sprouts, and suckers, and prune the new growth of side branches back by one third. Use notched sticks called spreaders to spread the remaining limbs to 60-degree angles where they meet the trunk. Leave the spreaders in place until mid- to late summer. In open-center trees, prune new shoots by one third to outward-facing buds — buds that face away from the trunk — to encourage branching. Thin out crowded shoots by removing the weakest ones. See the \"Where to find fruits and nuts\" sidebar for sources of spreaders; many nurseries offer them.\n\nContinuing care: Continue to follow the directions for the second season year after year. To develop a modified central-leader tree, remove the central leader just above the uppermost branch you want to keep. Do this job in the summer to inhibit vigorous sprouting."

      "text": "Turning to Ash For varied berries and airy leaves, look to the mountain\n\nSorbus hupehensis has pearly, pink-tinted orbs of fruit that show up well in summer and glow brilliantly against the tree's bright-red autumn foliage. Birds, however, go for taste rather than visuals; if you want to attract them to your garden, be sure to plant the red- or orange-berried mountain ash that birds all seem to prefer over the pale-berried kinds.\n\nWith their ferny foliage and clusters of berries, mountain ash are so familiar they aren't as appreciated or widely grown in gardens as they deserve to be. There's no need to be content with that old combination of green leaves and red berries, though, for many of the species and newer cultivars have showy, blue-tinted foliage and variously colored fall fruit.\n\nWhat I especially admire about mountain ash, besides how easy they are to grow and how much the birds love their berries, is what a light and airy presence they have in the garden. Conifers and even some of the broad-leafed evergreens create a dark hole, lending a heavy presence to the garden on wet, dreary days. The finely cut leaves of mountain ash catch the breeze and softly filter all available light rather than block it.\n\nThe genus Sorbus has accumulated quite a few colorful common names over the years, including witchwood, rowan and quickbeam. The name \"mountain ash\" came about because it grows at loftier elevations in the Scottish highlands than any other tree. In ancient times it was called witchwood because it was believed to repel evil. Today druggists distill sorbitol from its berries, and we grow it for ornamental value.\n\nNow In Bloom Dogwoods are usually grown for their pink or creamy flowers in early summer, but many also have outstanding fall foliage as well as colorful little balls of fruit that birds love. Cornus controversa 'June Snow' (above) turns vivid red in October, and has made the 2003 list of Great Plant Picks. Cornus kousa is one of the loveliest of the dogwoods, with pale bracts trimmed in red, pink-tinted fruits and a blaze of bronze-crimson leaves in autumn.\n\nThe beauty of a mountain ash can astound even as jaded a tree man as Washington Park Arboretum collections manager Randall Hitchin. He still remembers one encounter with a specimen at Van Dusen Botanical Garden in Vancouver, B.C. On a frosty December morning, Hitchin came upon Sorbus 'Joseph Rock,' a magnificent gilded arc of bare branches coated in butter-yellow berries. A month or so earlier, Hitchin would have seen the unique combination of amber berries arrayed against rich, mahogany-colored autumn foliage. But he was plenty impressed by even the berries the birds left behind, and this guy sees many a mountain ash. Part of Hitchin's job is to keep track of the nearly 150 trees in the Arboretum's Sorbus collection, one of the largest in North America.\n\nSorbus trees have such a vast geographic range that they must be adaptable. They grow from western Europe to the Himalayas and Japan, and as far south as Arizona on our continent. We have several Northwest-native mountain ashes, which grow into shrubs topping out from 3 to 10 feet high. Both Sorbus sitchensis and S. scopulina grow into bird-enticing thickets, or can be mixed into borders with rhododendrons and azaleas. They have white flowers in springtime, golden-to-red autumn foliage, and bunches of large, orange-red fruit. Along with other, more highly bred mountain ashes, they prefer sun, but are also shade tolerant, and provide nectar in springtime for butterflies and hummingbirds. Profusions of berry clusters persist into winter, and are especially beloved by robins; waxwings, orioles and finches also find them tasty.\n\nI combed through my books in search of mountain-ash faults, and found that they can sucker (although my Sorbus hupehensis, in the ground nearly 10 years, has never been so ill-mannered). They also are fairly short-lived (for a tree), and because their fruit can be messy underfoot, it's best to plant them away from sidewalks and pathways. Some have a problem with fire blight, but many kinds are resistant to it.\n\nHow to choose one? Hitchin recommends S. hupehensis 'Pink Pagoda,' a cultivar developed at the University of British Columbia, with blue-tinted foliage and berries that turn a rosy pink as they ripen. He also admires S. commixta 'Embley,' which has especially showy orange-to-purple fall color and abundant clusters of crimson berries. As is often the case, the British admire our native plants more than we do; Graham Stuart Thomas advises the western mountain ash, S. scopulina, for smaller gardens, as well as S. esserteauiana 'Flava,' which has bright yellow berries and stays a reasonable size for urban gardens. For the truly tiny garden, there's always Sorbus reducta, which grows only 2 feet high with pink fruit and bronze-red fall color.\n\nValerie Easton is a Seattle free-lance writer and contributing editor for Horticulture magazine.

      "text": "Tips for Trimming a Rhododendron\n\nBy Danny Wong\n, last updated April 19, 2011\n\nA rhododendron can grow to an unwieldy and unsightly size, so to make sure that it's being properly maintained, you will want to trim it every year. Trimming a rhododendron isn't too difficult a task, but it will be important to note the following things before trimming your rhododendron.\n\nFor clean trimming that takes little effort and doesn't damage your rhododendron, be sure to use sharp shears. You will also want to make sure they are sterile before and after use because you may have to cut off dead and diseased parts of your rhododendron and you don't want to spread anything from one part of the plant to other parts.\n\nTrim to Avoid Overgrowing its Space\n\nYour rhododendron can grow to an incredibly large size if you let it, but you will want to trim it so that it isn't this big, ugly monster, and you will also want to trim your rhododendron so that when it grows again, next year, it won't be so large but will be a tolerable size for when you are ready to trim it again.\n\nClear Branches for Sun and Air Circulation\n\nThe branches of your rhododendron will likely grow near each other, creating dense areas of branches, which prevent proper air flow and shade your plant from the sun. Clear away some of these branches so that there is more open space between existing branches allowing for sun to shine in and air to properly circulate which helps the rhododendron's health and growth.\n\nTrim Right After the Winter\n\nThe best time to trim your rhododendron is after the winter, when the freezing temperatures and bad weather have passed and when your plant isn't in the growing stages yet. At this time, you can start trimming to prepare for spring and summer growth and give your plant enough time to grow new and matured branches that will be able to handle the rough winter next time."

Done right, it can strengthen and rejuvenate a plant, encourage production of fruit, even increase the value of a home. A little knowledge of pruning, however, can be a dangerous thing, ending all too often in deformity or destruction of a beloved plant.\n\nNow a professional nurseryman Lewis Hill has updated his classic pruning guide, giving everyone from orchard owner to indoor plant enthusiast straightforward instructions on the art and craft of pruning trees, shrubs, bushes, hedges, vines, flowers, garden plants, house plants, and bonsai.\n\nHis basic premise remains the same — pruning should be done for the right reason, in the right way, and at the right time. A little blue spruce, for example, might be pruned one way if it will serve as an outdoor Christmas tree by the front steps and another if it will grow in a row to screen out neighbors. Drawing on years of experience, Hill shows how to match method to purpose.\n\nThe book features:\n\nMore than 100 clear, easy-to-follow illustrations\n\nAn overview of pruning methods\n\nA chapter for each tree category — ornamental, fruit, shade, evergreen, and nut"

For example, the goals for our edible landscape\nare: 1) provide privacy screen from closely surrounding neighbors, 2) provide\nus with a steady stream of fruit that we like and actually eat, in quantities\nthat are neither too much nor too little, 3) don't pose a fire hazard (we live\nin a very high fire danger area), 4) make good microclimates; shade areas we\nwant cool, reflect sun and block wind from areas we want hot, 5) look beautiful\nin a jungly sort of way, 6) are able to withstand months-long periods without\nattention when our attention is elsewhere, 7) use less than 300 gallons a day\nof water in the summer. Goals we don't have but other people might: demonstrate\neverything that can grow here, grow food which is valuable for sale or trade.\nNow, take this list and cross off any fruit which doesn't meet your goals, for\nexample, fruits you won't eat (some fruits are great in theory but end up on\nthe ground in reality); I measure edible landscape success in terms of \"fruit\nwhich ends up in the belly\").\n\nThen, cross off anything that won't thrive at your site because it is too cold,\nnot cold enough, too shady, etc.\n\nNow take a site plan for your landscape and mark every possible place a fruit\ntree could go, along with the specifications it should have for that spot. For\nexample, there might be a front hedge which should be six feet high and evergreen\nfor privacy, but not taller because there is a view above it, except the last\ntwenty feet should be 15 feet high to block the view from the neighbor's bedroom\nwindow. Next to the house on the south side is a place for 30 foot plus tall\ndeciduous trees. Behind it, space for a large evergreen, and so on.\n\nNow match up the fruit trees on your want list with the slots on your site\nplan. If there are trees which obviously won't fit anywhere, you can cross them\noff the want list.\n\nThis is a good point to check on availability. Many a perfect edible landscape\nplan is thrown into total disarray by the unavailability of several key trees\nwhen it comes time to plant. Deciduous trees can be acquired mail order in the\nUS, which greatly extends the range of possibilities. Often, finding the ideal\nsubtropicals entails some serious hunting."

There are varieties that have big, bold color and some are evergreens. There is even a tiny bonsai variety for those who like an Oriental look.\"\n\nBefore adding any of the varieties to a landscape, be sure to also know the plant's mature height.\n\n\"You've got to marry the right plant with the right place,\" Woodrum said.\n\n\"If it's used in the wrong place, it will outgrow its location, and that's a big problem,\" explained Horticulturist Jane Waldrop, of Martinez. \"Choose a variety that will grow into that space.\"\n\nThis area naturally provides the ideal growing conditions for junipers.\n\n\"Junipers are a pretty tough plant,\" Woodrum said. \"They can take the heat and still thrive.\"\n\nJust don't forsake watering all together.\n\n\"If they get too dry, they'll get mites on them,\" Woodrum said.\n\nThe results of improperly pruning a juniper is another task that makes some gardeners want to pull their hair out, and likewise the foliage on the plant to fall out.\n\n\"Junipers can't be over-pruned,\" Woodworth said. \"If they are, they'll get bald spots on them and generally don't grow back.\"\n\n\"Prune them correctly or not all,\" Waldrop said.\n\nJunipers come in a wide range of colors and \"they're good for any yard,\" Woodworth said.\n\n\"Junipers should really be carefully coordinated with other plants,\" Woodrum said. \"It's really easy to pair it with other plants to make color flow throughout a landscape.\n\n\"One really good combination is a blue juniper with a loropetalum, Woodworth shared. \"It's an absolutely beautiful combination and adds a nice variety to a garden.\"\n\nAs a shrub, \"junipers grow very easily,\" Woodworth said. \"They grow singularly or en masse and are very low maintenance.\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid of them,\" Waldrop advises. \"Just know how to care for them.\""

      "text": "What makes leaves turn color?\n\nLook for consistent summer moisture, followed by warm days and cool nights.\n\nDuring one of Door County's best color years, these maple leaves along an inland road were spotted in mid-October.\n\nEvery year, it happens like magic: In September, the uniform green of the hardwood forests starts morphing into a rolling\nwave of reds, russets, golds and orange.\n\nOften, the colors are glowing, as if lit from within, but sometimes they're dull and faded. Some years, the maple color is\nspotty, turning here and there over several weeks, and there's no real peak.\n\nIn a bad year, there's barely any color at all, just mousy yellows on leaves that drop in the first stiff wind.\n\nWhy? And what kind of conditions produce the best foliage color?\n\nHere's a particularly cogent explanation from Susan Benson, former director of education at the Cable Natural History Museum in the northwest Wisconsin town of Cable, one of the best\nplaces to see fall color. In her Nature Watch newsletter, she wrote:\n\n\"Here are the fall-color basics. Three types of pigments are involved in autumn color. The first is chlorophyll, which gives\nleaves their basic green color. Chlorophyll is necessary for photosynthesis, the chemical reaction in which plants\nuse the energy of sunlight to make sugars.\n\n\"The second pigment group, called carotenoids, produces yellow, orange, and brown colors. The last essential\npigment, known as anthocyanin, produces red, purple and crimson colors.\n\n\"Both chlorophyll and carotenoids are present in leaves throughout the growing season. Most anthocyanins are produced only in\nautumn, in response to bright light and excess plant sugars within leaf cells.\n\n\"As the nights grow longer, chlorophyll production slows to a halt. Its green color fades from the leaves; the caroteniods\nand anthocyanins are then unmasked to show their colors.\n\n\"The vibrancy of the colors is related to weather conditions that occur before and during the time when the chlorophyll in\nthe leaves is dwindling. A series of warm, sunny days and cool, crisp but not freezing nights seems to\nbring about the most spectacular color displays.\n\n\"During these warm days, a lot of sugars are produced. The cool nights and the gradual closing of veins leading from the leaf\nprevent these sugars from moving out. Lots of sugar and lots of light spur the production of the brilliant anthocyanin\npigments.\n\n\"The timing of the color change also varies by species. For example, oaks show their colors long after other species have\nalready dropped their leaves.\n\n\"The differences in timing among species seems to be genetic, for a particular species at the same latitude will show the\nsame coloration in high elevations at about the same time as it does in warmer lowlands.\n\n\"Here is the unknown wild card. The amount of moisture in the soils also affects autumn colors. A late spring, or\nsevere summer drought can delay the onset of fall color by a few weeks. They can also lower the intensity.\"\n\nFor more about looking for the best fall color in the Upper Midwest, see Pursuing the hues.\n\nLast updated on September 13, 2011\n\nSign up for our free weekly newsletter\n\nGet our weekly stories, tips and updates delivered a day early — directly to your Inbox.

Alder will grow on most soils but prefers wet soils. It thrives in damp areas, beside lakes and rivers where its strong fibrous roots protect the river banks thereby reducing erosion. Given a rich damp soil alder will grow rapidly and is a productive timber tree. A unique feature of alder is its root nodes which can fix nitrogen thus enabling it to survive on infertile soils.\n\nTraditionally the wood was used for the manufacture of clogs and this industry thrived in Co Wexford up to the early part of the 20th Century. During the Bronze Age alder was uses for warriors' shields. Its timber is resistant to decay when continuously submerged in water and it is recorded that much of the city of Venice rests on alder piles. The timber was also used to make sluice gates and other structures along streams, rivers and canals. However, when exposed alder decays rapidly and is useless as fencing posts. Strangely, alder logs are not recorded as the supporting timbers of our own crannogs.\n\nThe timber of alder is dark brown; it is called 'Irish mahogany' and is prized for wood turning. In folklore alder is classified as an unlucky tree and is to be avoided while on a journey! The ancient Irish did not like felling the alder tree as the wood was white when freshly cut, but then turning dark red, like blood. Alder features in many placenames eg Fearnóg; Ferns in Co Wexford; Glenfarne, Co Leitrim; Farney, Co Monaghan and Killavarnogue – the church of the alders - a graveyard at Cahirciveen, Co Kerry. The tallest tree is 12 metres"

The foliage is so deeply and narrowly lobed leaves that some leaves resemble a turkey foot. Leaves are deciduous, but the brightly colored fall foliage stays on the tree well into winter.\n\nThe common name refers to the shape of the 3-lobed leaves suggesting a turkeys foot. The Latin species name, meaning smooth, describes the nearly hairless leaves. Spreads by underground runners, especially after frequent fires. This species is similar to Q. falcata in leaf shape and can be distinguished by the tapered leaf base and axillary tufts, whereas the southern red oak leaves have a u-shaped base and pubescence covering the entire lower leaf surface."

With the unusually cold winter of 2009-2010 we had temperatures to rival a zone 8a normal year. Not a single tip on any of the branches of my two trees were damaged. Now that spring has arrived they are beginning to fully leaf out. This hibiscus can successfully and easily be grown into a beautiful tree. Until hurricane Ike took it out I had one tree that was 20' tall with a trunk 10 inches in diameter. The limbs will become long and pendulous but with proper pruning can be trained to grow more upright. Grown in full sun it is a relatively fast grower. The blooms of hamabo tend to face slightly downward. When grown as a tree it makes a spectacular sight when viewing a few hundred blooms from below the branches. Hamabo will bloom throughout the summer but it's first flush of blooms are the most breathtaking. The tree is a solid mass of yellow.

      "text": "Trees too deep in the ground, an all too common problem, have two basic problems. When the trunk flare is under ground, it stays moist and doesn't breathe properly as bark is supposed to do. Soil too high on the trunk also often hides circling and girdling roots which choke the tree and drastically slow down growth. Many trees are snapping off at the ground surface because of this problem. Trees grown in containers are highly subject to this damaging condition. To make matters worse, mulch is often piled up on trunks.\n\nIf you do the soil removal yourself, use hand tools and gloved hands being extremely careful not to damage the wet bark tissue. Water can be used but only with a soft flowing stream. Strong water blasts can severely damage the soft bark on the base of the trees. The best route is to hire an arborist that uses the Air Spade. It is a fancy sandblasting type tool that blows air (no sand) at a high velocity and removes the soil without damaging even the smallest roots.Arborists that don't use this tool or the Air Knife should be passed on when hiring a tree care company. Once exposed, the root flare area should be left exposed to the air. The tree trunk and root flare eventually will grow and expand to fill the depression around the base of the tree. Putting anything into the depression will cause the area to become a problem again.That includes stones, bark, compost or anything else. All I would put in the depression is a very thin layer of shredded mulch and that can be skipped. Deep holes that may create a dangerous situation need to be covered with a grate."

Growing them is truly an art form in and of itself.\n\nThe word means a tree in a container or tray. The art of Bonsai involves carefully and shaping trees so that they remain small and grow from the tray.\n\nBecause they are growing in a tray rather than outdoors, they need extra special care to remain small and to nurture.\n\nExtremes of anything will inhibit its growth. The type of soil and temperature need to be monitored closely. A slight deviation either way may endanger the tree and may be counter productive.\n\nIf you over water the plant it will essentially drown and form fungi and the roots will rot. If you under water the tree, the roots will shrivel up and die.\n\nThe development of the tree involves a complete system that works together to help the tree develop or not. If one variable is off it could kill the tree.\n\nThere are a variety of styles which would denote the shape of the tree and how it will grow. A formal upright tree looks like a mini tree. It is the easiest to nurture and develop because there is very little experimentation needed to develop it. The lower two branches need to pruned so that they come forward slightly to provide balance. The trees easiest to work with for this style are Junipers and Spruce trees.\n\nThe style is very similar to the formal upright except the top curves to the left. The object is to have the tree look like it is moving. The best trees for this style are the Maple and Crab Apple tree.\n\nThe slanting Bonsai tree has a very obvious slant to either side. The lowest branch should be growing out on the opposite side of the slant to provide balance. They are known as leaners; similar to trees that may sway or grow because of wind or gravity to grow in a slanted position.\n\nThe cascade Bosai tree has an interesting look. The tree begins to grow upwards and then drops down below the container. This tree is a bit more challenging to grow because trees tend to grow up and not down, which is unnatural. It looks best planted off center.\n\nA semi cascade Bonsai tree looks like a tree that started growing up straight and then cascades down. The cascade and the branches should lean slightly to the front, as this represents the front f the tree. The recommended trees for this style are the weeping willow and junipers.\n\nOther styles are the literati and windswept. It is best to decide before you begin the process of planting the tree. If you change your mind, you will need to uproot it which could potentially damage the tree and cause it to die.\n\nBonsai Recommended Products\n\nBonsai News and Information\n\nBonsai Culture Headlines\n\nA look at the centuries old art form of bonsai\n\nIt is an art form that dates back more than a thousand years with its origins in China.Utah's Japan Festival mixes traditional, modern culture\n\nUtah's Japan Festival mixes traditional, modern culture by Lisa Schencker The Salt Lake Tribune Published Apr 27, 2013 03:30PM MDT Marion Hori was just a baby when her family was sent to an internment camp for Americans of Japanese descent in Arkansas.

      "text": "Poison-ivy (Toxidendron radicans) is a woody perennial shrub or vine that spreads by underground runners and by seeds. It grows in all types of soil and under all conditions of sun and shade.\n\nPoison-ivy can be distinguished from other plants by its leaves which are always divided into three leaflets. It is these which are referred to in the old warning, \"Leaves of three, let it be.\"\n\nThese leaves, each consisting of three leaflets, alternate on the stem. Each leaflet is oval-shaped, pointed at the tip, and tapered at the base. The middle leaflet has a longer leaf stem than the two side ones. Leaflets may be slightly lobed or coarsely toothed. When some leaflets are lobed, people may call these plants \"poison-oak,\" but true poison-oak does not grow in Minnesota. There are only variations of poison-ivy.\n\nThe leaves' surfaces may be smooth or hairy, glossy or dull. They can vary in color from yellowish-green and green to reddish-green. Poison-ivy fruits, which develop in fall, are small white berries with sunken ribs.\n\nPoison-ivy is best controlled with an herbicide containing triclopyr, a woody brush-killer. It should be applied directly to the leaves of the poison-ivy, not soaked into the ground. When used according to directions, this herbicide should not injure established grasses, only broad-leafed plants.\n\nApply the herbicide when poison-ivy is growing actively. Temperatures should be in the 60° to 85°F range. Avoid windy days when droplets might drift onto the foliage of nearby trees, shrubbery or garden plants.\n\nYou may have to spray more than once since poison-ivy is a tough plant to kill. Wait two weeks or more between applications, and repeat only if weather permits. Don't apply herbicide after poison-ivy foliage begins to show fall color. Wait till new leaves are fully expanded the following spring.\n\nSome resprouting might occur several months later. Watch the area for at least a year and repeat the treatment as needed. As with any garden chemical, read and follow label directions carefully each and every time you use it.\n\nBe very careful cutting down poison-ivy; all parts of the plant are poisonous. Note, too, that even the dead plants are poisonous. Never burn them! Smoke and ash can carry toxins to the skin causing a rash. Inhaling the smoke can be worse.\n\nPoison-ivy may seem difficult to eliminate from your property, but you can do it with consistent, careful and conscientious effort."

Trim roots with a spade and promptly remove root suckers if colonial spread is undesired. Best red stem color occurs on young stems. Although pruning is not required, many gardeners choose to remove 20-25% of the oldest stems in early spring of each year to stimulate growth of new stems which will display the best red color. As an alternative to annual pruning, some gardeners prune all stems close to the ground in early spring every 2-3 years to renew. Any loss of flowers through spring pruning is not terribly significant since the small flowers of this dogwood are rather ordinary.\n\nNoteworthy Characteristics\n\nThis redtwig dogwood cultivar is a rapid-growing, multi-stemmed, deciduous shrub which grows to a maximum size of 4-5' tall with a rounded, spreading (stoloniferous) habit. Denser and more compact than the species due in large part to its shorter internodes. The outstanding ornamental feature of this plant is its bright red winter stems which are particularly showy against a snowy backdrop. Tiny white flowers appear in flat-topped clusters (to 2.5\" diameter) in late spring, with sparse, intermittent, additional flowering sometimes continuing into summer. Flowers give way to clusters of whitish (sometimes with a bluish tinge) drupes in late summer. Fruit is quite attractive to birds and is generally considered to have as much if not more ornamental interest than the flowers. Ovate to lanceolate, dark green leaves (2-4\" long) turn an attractive reddish purple in autumn.\n\nProblems\n\nGarden Uses\n\nEffective in naturalistic plantings in moist soils where plants are allowed to spread and form thickets. Also effective as property line screens. Plants perform very well in wet locations along streams or ponds where spreading roots help combat soil erosion. Also effective in shrub borders where plants can be combined with yellowtwig dogwoods (e.g., Cornus sericea 'Flaviramea') for an interesting bicolor winter stem display."

The common or European\nbeech (Fagus sylvatica) is one of our most important native species\nin the UK; the Japanese beech (Fagus crenata) is very closely\nrelated. If grown as solitary specimen trees, both species mature\ninto tall stately trees with a spherical crown and branches that\nreach down to the ground. The bark is grey in the European beech\nand silvery in the Japanese species; but remains smooth even on\nvery old specimens of both species.\n\nTiny monoecious flowers of both sex appear with the leaves in\nSpring and are pollinated by the wind. In Autumn they form nuts\nwhich are commonly referred to as beechmast. Leaves are arranged\nalternatively; the European species has ovate, wavy-edged leaves\nto 10cm which are pale green in Spring appearing as late as May\nin the UK, turning glossy green in Summer and then to yellow to\norange-brown in Autumn. The browned foliage commonly remains on\nthe tree throughout the winter protecting the following years\nleaf-buds, sometimes not dropping until the following Spring.\nThe Japanese beech, Fagus crenata has these same characteristics\nbut its leaves are slightly smaller.\n\nThough it is Fagus sylvatica and Fagus crenata that are the two\nFagus species seen as bonsai; there is good potential for other\nFagus species to make quality bonsai. It should be noted that\nexcept for Fagus sylvatica, Beech require long, warm summers to\nthrive and in parts of Northern Europe the relatively short summers\ncan be disadvantageous to vigorous growth.\n\nBeech species and Hornbeams (Carpinus species) are often confused\nas they have many similarities particularly in their leaf appearance;\nthe simplest way to differentiate them is to inspect the trunk;\nBeech have an entirely smooth bark whilst Hornbeams develop silvery\nveins on the surface of their bark.\n\nBONSAI CULTIVATION NOTES\n\nPOSITION Beech will grow\nhappily in semi-shade or full sun; they do however require a position\nsheltered from the strong midday sun of the summer and from strong\nwinds, both of which can cause leaves to scorch and brown. In\nconditions where there is strong sunlight or strong wind, Beech\nrequire more generous quantities of water especially if planted\nin a shallow pot. Frost protection is required when temperatures\nreach -5°C or less. FEEDING For refined trees it is better to withhold fertilising\nfor 3-4 weeks after leaves appear in Spring to keep the vigorous\nSpring growth finer with shorter internodes; after this initial\nstrong growth, feed fortnightly until late Summer. For trees where\ntrunk or primary branch development is still taking place feed\nas soon as leaves start to unfurl. REPOTTING Every two years in Spring as the buds extend, use\nbasic soil mix. Older specimens can be repotted as and when necessary. PRUNING The main growth spurt for beech is in the Spring;\nto improve ramification of branches it is important to pinch out\nthe growth tip after the first or second leaf emerges, this will\ngreatly reduce the internodal length. Allowing the shoot to extend\nwill result in coarse growth with long internodes (though this\nshould be allowed if trying to thicken trunks or primary branches\nin young trees). After Spring growth has fully extended, prune\nback to a bud that is facing the way you wish future growth to\nhead. Hard pruning can be carried out in late-winter or mid-summer.\nRemoval of large branches can be carried out in midsummer to accelerate\nwound healing.\n\nWiring needs to be carried out with great care as the bark marks\nvery easily and wire marks can take an extremely long time to\nfully disappear from the smooth bark surface. Branches suddenly\nthicken after spring growth and wire can cut into the bark in\na matter of days. Try to make use of guy wires to move branches\ninto shape if at all possible.\nPROPAGATION Sow seed outside in Autumn or after winter stratification\nin Spring. Air-layer in late-Spring after spring growth has hardened.\nPESTS AND DISEASES Aphids, bark scale and powdery mildew.\nSTYLING Beech suit all formal and informal upright forms in\nmedium to extra large sizes. Beech are slow-growing and creating\na large-trunked bonsai is a slow process. For this reason, beech\nare commonly seen in group plantings as trees with relatively\nthin trunks can be used to good effect"

If you were to look at the real trees, here are some things you would notice. Use these distinguishing characteristics when you shop for artificial Christmas trees, to make sure that yours looks like the real thing:\n\nFir\n\nFir trees have individual flat needles attached to the stem. The needles grow in a spiral on the tip and lay flat, and this kind of display gives fir trees their full look. The shape of a fir tree is bushy and full, which doesn't leave much room for ornaments and is perfect if you like a less-decorated tree.\n\nSpruce\n\nLike fir trees, spruces have single needles connected to the stems. However, spruce tree needles are sharp and square-shaped. On a real tree, spruce needles easily break apart if you bend them. As a whole, spruce trees sport the traditional full Christmas tree shape, thanks to their upturned branches. Their strong branches can hold heavier ornaments, so load them up with your biggest ornaments with confidence!\n\nPine\n\nUnlike the fir and spruce trees, a pine tree has needles that grow in bundles — you can see three to five needles bunched together on a pine tree branch. Pine trees have fewer branches, so they tend to look sparse with their upturned branches. However, this leaves lots of room to hang ornaments at the back and middle of the branches, allowing you to hang all of your favorite ornaments.\n\nWith the pointers in mind, you can easily find the perfect Christmas tree!\n\nThis entry was posted\non Thursday, November 24th, 2011 at 2:16 pm and is filed under Christmas trees, Helpful Hints.\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\nBoth comments and pings are currently closed."

Manager Trish Fry posted a picture on Jan. 20 of a branch bearing yellow blooms. Last year she spotted this species blooming in late February.\n\n\"These are early by any standard,\" she wrote.\n\nWitch Hazel blooms are unusual, appearing like tiny party streamers, sporting yellow, gold, orange or red flowers. Most cultivars have a delightful spicy fragrance that is if you're willing to bare your nose in the winter climate to sample. These small trees (from 3-8 metres tall) are hardy from Nova Scotia west to Ontario, Canada and south to Florida, and Texas in the United States.\n\nAs the warmer weather arrives, a small, horned, capsule-shaped fruit grows at the base of the flowers, eventually splitting to eject two to four shiny black seeds in the autumn. That's when the typically dark green foliage turns golden with hints of purple and red.\n\nWitch Hazel extract has been used medicinally by American Indians who obtained it by steaming the twigs. It was also stocked in pharmacies of old. It's recommended as an astringent, with the bark and leaves derivative used in aftershave lotions, and for treating bruises and insect bites.\n\nTrouble with hemorrhoids? Witch Hazel is the active ingredient in many ointments for these, helping to shrink and contract blood vessels back to normal size.\n\nNew mothers are sometimes administered Witch Hazel to treat postnatal tearing of the perineum. It is also used in treating acne. Psoriasis and eczema sufferers use Witch Hazel and it can be found as an ingredient in eye drops. Some people use it for spot and blemish control, others to shrink bags beneath the eyes and for varicose vein relief.\n\nI found a humorous explanation for Witch Hazel's name on the Planet Botanic website:\n\n\"Peculiar plants are often associated with magic and practitioners of magic, and this is the case with witch hazel. The witch part of the name comes from merry old England.\n\n\"The plant looks somewhat similar to the hazel tree native to that country, a tree used by local witches in divining and making spells. Apparently, when English colonists arrived in the New World and saw the healing plant, one of them screamed, 'Hey, isn't that the hazel the witches back home use?' The name stuck, and we still use it"

I live in CT.\n\nGRAYCAT926 from Bolton, CT\n\nAnswer:\n\nGRAYCAT926,\n\nWillow cuttings root easily because the tissues contain a natural root-promoting hormone. They can be started any time of the year in pots, or outside in late winter or early spring.\n\nTo start a tree from a cutting, select a healthy branch that is approximately 1/2 inch to 1 inch in diameter, and about 10-15 inches long. If planting outside in the spring, pound the branch into moist soil with a rubber mallet, leaving two or three leaf nodes exposed above ground. The site should receive at least a small amount of shade during the day to allow the roots to develop properly. Roots will start to form within a few weeks, and by fall the cutting can be carefully transplanted to a permanent site-ideally as far away as possible from foundations, water pipes and sewer lines.\n\nTo root a cutting indoors, simply stick the branch in a small pot of moist soil and transplant it outside as soon as the danger of frost has passed."

      "text": "rate this answer\n\nTuesday - July 07, 2009\n\nQUESTION:\n\nI live in central Illinois and have a Jack in the Pulpit in a pot, in a shady location, under an oak tree and the soil seems to be moist. The leaves are turning yellow at the edges. Help, please. Thank you.\n\nANSWER:\n\nThere are three members of the Arisaema genus native to Illinois that have \"Jack in the Pulpit\" as their common name:\n\nThey are obviously very closely related, and it really doesn't matter which one, or another not native to Illinois, you are growing, they pretty well share the same growing needs. From Paghat's Garden, here is a website on the species and sub-species listed above, with pictures.\n\nEvery resource on these plants that we consulted said that the plants need an acidic soil, which you would ordinarily find on a forest floor, due to the constantly falling leaves of deciduous trees around them. We learned also that these plants go dormant in the summer, with mature plants producing red berries visible in mid to late summer.\n\nWe have a couple of theories on why your plant's leaf edges are yellowing. The first is concerning the soil in the pot where the Arisaema is growing. When leaves begin to yellow on a plant, we usually suspect chlorosis, which means the plant is not getting trace elements from the soil that it needs. A plant needing an acid soil would have great difficulty in accessing those elements, especially iron, in an alkaline soil. If you are using a commercial potting soil, it might very well be that the plant would be better off in the ground itself, which is probably more suited to an acid-loving plant. Our second theory has to do with the dormancy of the plant in summer. It could possibly be that the dormancy is beginning in that plant, and the yellowing of the leaves is a natural part of that process.\n\nWe would suggest that you just keep an eye on the plant, and if you feel the pH of the soil in the pot is questionable, transplant into the native soil at the appropriate time.\n\nMore Herbs/Forbs Questions"

      "text": "Spindle treelike fairy lights aglow\n\nMonday, July 16, 2012\n\nBy Dick Warner\n\nTHE spindle is one of my favourite native trees, though I admit that when it grows in the wild it's often more of a shrub than a tree.\n\nIt's principal glory is those extraordinary four-chambered orange/pink fruits in autumn when, on a sunny day, the tree looks as if it has been decorated with fairy lights. Historically, though, its hard, white timber was also highly prized.\n\nThe fruits, by the way, are poisonous to humans and livestock, though not to birds, which love them and are the principal means of seed distribution for the species.\n\nIt's not a common tree and is restricted in the wild to areas with very alkaline soils. I've found it in low woodlands and old hedgerows in east Galway, north west Clare and on esker ridges in the midlands. But it's also an ideal garden tree, particularly if it's pruned to prevent it becoming too shrubby. Because it seldom exceeds six metres in height it suits even quite small gardens. My local tree nursery has bare-root saplings available and I have ordered some to plant this autumn.\n\nThe name, of course, refers to the fact that the tough timber was used to make spindles. However it appears it wasn't the only wood used for this purpose. Archaeologists investigating Lagore crannóg near Dunshaughlin in Co Meath excavated ten spindles. They were made of yew, hazel, an unidentified Prunus species, aspen and ash — there wasn't a single spindle-wood spindle.\n\nAn older name for the species is pegwood. The Rev Charles Johns reported that in the 1800s spindle wood pegs were used by shoe-makers in Dublin.\n\nIt was also used to make skewers and tooth-picks and some parts of musical instruments, including violin bows and the keys of virginals. And it is the timber used for the fore-pillar of at least one historical Irish harp —- Donnchadh Mac Tadgh's harp made for Sir John Fitzgerald of Cloyne. The neck of the harp was yew. The sound box has not survived, but these were normally made of willow.\n\nBut I'm not planting spindle trees for any of these utilitarian reasons. I can't quite put my finger on why I like them so much but my enthusiasm seems to be shared by Dr Oliver Rackham, who is the leading tree guru of the English-speaking world. He describes a discovery on one of his visits to Ireland: \"On an island in a boggy lough in Co Offaly is an extraordinary wood of great, ancient oaks, hung with ancient ivies (one ivy trunk is thicker than a fat man); it has the largest hazel and the largest spindle tree I have ever seen . . . I hesitate to claim it as a wildwood, although it is full of fallen giants; but it tells us what the derries may have been like.\"\n\nIf you know where wild spindle is growing and you prefer to propagate it yourself, rather than buying from a nursery or garden centre you should gather the fruits in the autumn, rub them gently together to remove the outer orange coat and sow immediately into containers of compost, covering them with a thin layer of coarse sand. Leave the containers in a shaded place outdoors over winter.\n\nYou can take cuttings in September and October. Insert them into a peat-sand mixture and leave them to root in a cold frame or in a pot with a clear plastic bag over it. By the following spring most of the cuttings can be potted on or planted out.\n\nYou should end up with elegant little trees that will be a focal point in early autumn when the fruits appear."

Martha may knit plant cozies but most plants don't have it as easy as we do.\n\nTremendous variability exists within and between plant species in their tolerance to cold. However we can do a lot in plant selection, site selection and plant maintenance.\n\nA few basic tips to get plants through the winter:\n\nSelect plants that are reliably cold hardy here.\n\nSelect plants that will tolerate and even thrive in the planting location.\n\nKeep plants healthy during the growing season with proper maintenance such as watering during drought periods.\n\nEvergreens in particular should enter winter well watered. Adding a three-inch layer of mulch can conserve soil moisture. All species of trees and shrubs entering winter without adequate soil and tissue moisture or with low food reserves become more susceptible to low temperature injury. In addition, problems such as improper pruning or fertilizing, or defoliation during the growing season (insects, disease) may increase susceptibility to low temperature injury.\n\nSometimes it isn't really the cold temperatures that cause problems, but the rapid fluctuations between warmth and cold and how dormant the plants are when the fluctuations occur. Also some plants hate our winter winds.\n\nEvergreens and broadleaf evergreens such as holly, boxwood or rhododendrons are especially prone to winter burn from winter winds. Evergreens continue to lose water through their leaves even in cold weather. Winter winds can cause desiccation injury to plants, causing above ground plant parts to dry out because water cannot be replaced from frozen soil. Windy conditions, sun and warm days can speed the process.\n\nSymptoms of excessive water loss may be browning of the leaf margins or rhododendrons may show leaf rolling. Stem death may occur but may go unnoticed until spring. On needle evergreens, desiccation injury shows up as yellowing or browning of needles during winter or early spring (some varieties naturally do this but quickly recover in spring).\n\nProper site selection of broadleaf evergreens is particularly important. Pick a site where they are protected from north and west winter winds and late afternoon sun such as the east side of a building.\n\nThere are ways to reduce desiccation injury of evergreens. Plants existing in exposed areas or along a south or west foundation may be loosely wrapped in late fall with burlap or canvas materials to slow desiccation. Pine boughs stuck in the ground around the plant will also help to slow winter winds. Commercially available anti-desiccant products such as Wilt Pruf® can be sprayed on evergreens and broadleaved evergreens to reduce the amount of water lost through leaves.\n\nSuccessful boxwood plantings follow all the tips I just mentioned. Boxwoods make beautiful small hedges with their slow growing dense foliage. Their green leaves in winter provide a wonderful eye vacation from our usual winter grays and browns.\n\nBoxwood need well drained soil. Since they are surface rooters they appreciate mulching with wood mulch or leaf mold to keep the root zone cool and moist in summer and protect from drying in winter. They need protection from wind and late afternoon sun.\n\nThere are many cultivars of boxwood. Look for ones that are cold hardy and will maintain good green color in winter. A couple that have performed well are 'Winter Gem' and 'Wintergreen.' 'Chicagoland Green' also known as 'Glencoe' reportedly maintains better green coloration under harsh conditions of winter than the others mentioned."

The deciduous Florida Maple reaches 50 to 60 feet in height but is most often seen at 20 to 30 feet. Displaying muted yellow or orange fall leaf color, Florida Maple is ideal for use as a specimen, park or street tree, or for use in woodland areas. The round to oval growth habit makes it an ideal shade or street tree. The edges of the leaves turn under slightly giving them a distinct appearance. The trunk on older specimens resembles that on the Northern Sugar Maple, which is an attractive gray with longitudinal ribs.\n\nUse and Management\n\nGrowing in full sun or partial shade, Florida Maple will tolerate a wide variety of soil types but is not salt-tolerant. Established trees look better when given some irrigation during dry weather. While leaves will eventually fall, many remain in the central portion of the canopy for much of the winter giving the tree a somewhat unkempt appearance. The limbs of Maple are strong and not susceptible to wind damage. Roots are often shallow and reach the surface at an early age, even in sandy soil.

It is similar in leaf appearance to White Oak, but does not have its spreading majesty with age or its reddish foliage color in autumn. Under landscape conditions in urban environments, it may reach 50 feet tall and 50 feet wide.\n\nIt is being increasingly used as genetic stock to generate hybrids with other members of the White Oak group, for use as landscape shade trees. As a member of the White Oak group and the Beech Family, it is related to the Beeches, Chestnuts, and other Oaks.\n\nPlanting Requirements - English Oak, in spite of being an imported species of Oak, adapts well to the tough conditions of the eastern and midwestern United States. It prefers moist, well-drained, moderately rich soils of variable pH, but adapts very well to moderately dry soils of poor quality. It thrives in full sun to partial sun (but is shade tolerant in youth), and grows in zones 4 to 8.\n\nPotential Problems - English Oak (as well as Swamp White Oak) is notorious for developing powdery mildew on its foliage by mid- to late summer (this is the common white fungus found within the leaves of many Lilacs and Roses at the same time of season, strictly a cosmetic disease that has no long-term impact on the health of the tree whatsoever). Other than this cosmetic white blemish on its dark green foliage, English Oak is usually disease- and pest-free, although it may on occasion be subject to the standard army of pests and pathogens that afflict the Oaks.\n\nLeaf Identification Features\n\nEnglish Oak has leaves that are alternate, slightly obovate, with lobes that vary in terms of their size and corresponding sinus depth (left). Leaf shape is variable and most easily confused with White Oak. As compared to White Oak, the leaves of English Oak are smaller, never have sinuses to near the midrib, have shorter petioles, and leaf bases that are sometimes auriculate (hanging like ear lobes alongside the short petiole).\n\nAlong with Swamp White Oak, this species is the most likely to develop powdery mildew on its leaves by late summer. It is a member of the White Oak group, even though it is native to Europe. Trees often retain a good degree of their dead foliage throughout the winter.\n\nOther Identification Features\n\nMost Oaks that are grown at tree nurseries are planted from seeds, and exhibit natural variation that is not present with the cultivars of other types of trees, which are clones that are grafted or budded onto seedling rootstock. However, English Oak has an upright form called 'Fastigiata' which normally comes \"true from seed\" and remains broadly columnar throughout its life.\n\nEnglish Oak is monoecious, having catkins in mid-spring that fertilize female flowers on the same or nearby trees, producing long acorns that only take a single season to mature, like other members of the White Oak group. English Oak (along with Swamp Chestnut Oak, Chestnut Oak, and Swamp White Oak) is known for the long penduncles that attach to its acorns, which ripen in early to mid-autumn.\n\nThe terminal buds of English Oak are rather large. Its mature bark becomes moderately ridged and furrowed, and retains the light gray to medium gray color that is characteristic of the White Oak group.\n\nThe growth habit of English Oak is upright, densely oval, and symmetrical through middle age, then becoming more spreading with advanced maturity."

The TV signal travels in a straight line from the transmitter to the aerial and does not bend well around large objects such as trees. You may notice a change in signal strength and quality between spring and autumn, as the trees gain or lose their leaves. The signal may fluctuate in wet or windy weather. In the summer, when trees are in full leaf, they can act as a barrier to the signal, resulting in a 'snowy' or grainy picture on analogue TV. Trees can also affect the signal and cause 'ghosting'. On digital TV the picture may break up or freeze.\n\nYou should make sure that your aerial is aligned correctly to the direction of the signal from the transmitter, and it may need to be installed so that it is above the level of the trees. An aerial installer will be able to advise. You can go to the CAI (Confederation of Aerial Industries) or Registered Digital Installers sites to find a registered installer in your area.\n\nYou could also consider switching to a different digital TV service.

They have pale yellow flesh with a signature Greengage flavour. Opal plums arereally early cropping plum trees and in a good year you can look forward to the first fruit being ready at the end of July. Because they are so early, Opal plums mature quite fast and so do better in the South of England; they also reward being planted in a south facing spot - trained against a south facing wall is ideal.\n\nOpal's History and Parentage\n\nSweden may not seem like an obvious place for fruit trees to be studied and bred. In fact, the climate in the south is perfect for breeding hardy plants that will succeed in Northern Europe and Opal is just one of the creations of the Horticultural Research Stations in Alnarp and Balsgard, near Sweden's southern tip. It was crossed in the 1920's from two classic plum trees, Early Favourite and Oullins Gage, which are robust English and very tasty French cultivars respectively.\n\nPlum Tree Pollination guide for Opal Prunus domestica\n\nYour Opal plum tree is self-fertile, which means that although a pollination partner such as Marjories Seedling can improve the quality of the harvest, Opal is quite happy to bear a heavy crop all by itself. It is also reassuringly regular in the size of harvest each year.\n\nPlum trees are natives of a warmer climate and need some special consideration to encourage strong growth, resistance to disease and bumper crops. Plums are only pruned in summer, to reduce the risk of silver leaf disease.\n\nPlease note that our bushes are on St Julien A rootstocks while our maidens are on Pixy rootstocks which we believe is preferable"

Does looking out your windows after the holidays give you the blahs? Many gardeners neglect thinking about winter interest simply because their perception of the garden in winter is that it is dead. This notion is far from the truth; in fact, your garden in the winter is merely sleeping…or as I like to think of it, giving me a rest.\n\nYour landscape should bring enjoyment year round and now is the perfect time to take inventory of your winter landscaping to be sure you have some winter interest in your garden for years to come. That beautiful winter landscape is not as complicated as you may think. You are really looking at just a few things to make your winter landscape as attractive in the snow as it is in the summer.\n\nFocus on bark and structure. In spring, summer, and fall we are drawn to ornamental trees and shrubs with flowers and leaf color to complement our landscaping.\n\nDeciduous trees and shrubs lose their foliage in wintertime leaving nothing but bare branches and trunks; but that can be a good thing. Many ornamental trees and shrubs have very interesting structure and/or bark--these traits are often overlooked when making a selection. Why? Well spring is the time when most of us visit nurseries and winter is the furthest thing from our minds. Yet it is the interesting structure and bark that will add to your winter landscaping. It is a rare tree or shrub that possesses every trait, but an interesting year-round landscape will contain a good mixture of these trees and shrubs. Choices are endless, but some good examples are: • Acer griseum, paperbark maple • Cercis Canadensis, Eastern Redbud • Betula nigra, river birch. • Lagerstroemia indica, crape myrtle • Cotoneaster apiculatus, cranberry cotoneaster • Hydrangea quercifolia, oakleaf hydrangea • Prunus subhirtella pendula, weeping cherry • Hamamelis mollis, witchhazel\n\nRemember the evergreens. Evergreen trees and shrubs are an important component of any planting plan because they provide structure and weight to your landscape all year long, especially in the winter when your beds would otherwise be empty or \"just sticks.\" Often overlooked in the summer, evergreen trees and shrubs actually deliver a nice splash of color during the winter when we primarily see a landscape of browns and grays. Evergreens are not just green; they're available in yellows, blues, and all colors in between…choices are endless but may include: • Pinus strobus 'Pendula' • Picea pungens 'Montgomery' • Juniperus squamata 'Blue Star' • Picea pungens f. glauca • Chamaecyparis obtusa\n\nAdd some hardscape. Winter is a good time to assess your landscape, figuring out where it's missing focal points. The solution to enhancing your winter landscaping might not be a plant at all. A trellis, fence, bench, an arbor, and even a garden sculpture are easy hardscapes that can really add interest.\n\nYes, there are four-season perennials. Some perennials have evergreen foliage--autumn fern, lavender, hellebore, snowdrops, rattlesnake plantain, even dianthus with its beautiful low-creeping foliage--making them great for winter landscaping. In the summer, ornamental grasses add sweeping background to your other plants in your garden. In the winter, these same grasses can take center stage. Their cream colored stalks and frothy seed heads will remind an onlooker of fountains rising up into the air of the winter interest garden.\n\nI love hydrangeas in the winter landscape. While some people choose to cut back a dormant hydrangea, I keep most of mine intact, flowers and all. The faded flowers of a hydrangea look like oversize snowflakes, especially when covered with a sparkling frost.\n\nDress up your summertime containers. Hanging pots, hardy containers, and window boxes can be adorned with winter sprigs and twigs or any other interesting plant material you may find. Adding a colorful birdhouse can brighten any planter. Winter may not be the most colorful time of year, but embrace it for the beauty it does have to offer you. Strategic use of a few pieces of hardscape and plants that provide a burst of color or interesting texture can make your landscape really pop and stand out from the rest. A few splashes of interest can be a reminder that spring is just around the corner, and that may be just what you need to help you endure winter."

We lost our tree to a storm and are looking for a viable replacement.\n\nANSWER:\n\nWell, if the tree that you lost wasn't causing problems with its roots, you might consider planting a tree of the same kind.\n\nMr. Smarty Plants isn't sure what you mean by non-invasive roots systems. People frequently ask about \"taproot\" trees thinking that the root grows straight down and will not interfere with side walks, driveways, or foundations. Some trees begin with a taproot, but as the root system matures, it spread out in all directions in search of water and nutrients, and to provide a base of support to stabilize the tree. A tree that reaches a height of 20 feet can have a canopy at least that wide, and will have roots that spread out three to four times the width of the canopy. I am including links to Colorado State University Extension and Iowa State University Extension that help explain this concept further.\n\nAs for the tree recommendations, I am going to introduce you to our Native Plant Database that will help you select trees for your situation. The Database contains 7,161 plants that are searchable by scientific name or common New Jersey. This will bring up a list of 112 commercially available native plant species suitable for planned landscapes in New Jersey. These aren't all trees, so you need to go to the \"Narrow Your Search\" box on the right of the screen and make the following selections: select New Jersey under State, Tree under General Appearance, and Perennial under Lifespan. Check Part Shade under Light Requirement, and Moist under Soil Moisture (or the conditions that apply). Click on the Submit Narrow Your Search button and you will get a list of 27 native species from which to chose. Clicking the Scientific name of each plant will bring up its NPIN page that gives the characteristics of the plant, its growth requirements, and in most cases, photos. As you look through the list, try to match the plants to your your growing location. You can get different lists by changing the Light requirement and Soil moisture selections.\n\nFor help closer to home, you might contact the folks at the Bergen County office of Cooperative ExtensionReplacement for black walnut near septic tank March 10, 2009 - We have a black walnut tree growing on the sunny side of our house which provides wonderful shade in the summer but it is such a dirty tree.

      "text": "It may seem the opposite of good advice in a drought, but the Texas Forest Service says this is a very good time to plant new trees. Big old trees gulp hundreds of gallons of precious water every week, the foresters explain, while small young ones sip much less, and are ready to take off once the drought breaks. The TFS makes thousands of seedlings like these available to Texans from its West Texas Nursery, already adapted to Texas weather and selected to be hardy in this region.\n\nPeople come to the Hill Country for the trees, and one tree can add more than $10,000 to the value of a piece of property.\n\nThe continuing drought, though, has them all in jeopardy.\n\nThe bad news is some won't survive, no matter what you do for them. The good news is most of the large, valuable trees will make it through...and you can improve their chances.\n\nRobert Edmonson, an arborist with the Texas Forest Service, told an audience at the First United Methodist Church in Johnson City there are more big trees in the Hill Country now than there were a century ago.\n\n\"Our big trees, the ones we worry about most, have been through droughts before and survived, so most of them are even more likely to survive this one, even if it gets worse before it breaks,\" he said.\n\nThe best chances go to upland trees, which are used to less water, and deciduous types, which lose their leaves in winter and already know how to conserve what water they have by dropping leaves. Some trees will even drop their big leaves and grow smaller ones, which lose less moisture through evaporation.\n\n\"In addition, trees in clay soils, rather than sand, have an advantage because clay holds water better. Those with a water supply — whether it's an aquifer or your hose — will do better. Age is an advantage, too, because old trees have been through this before,\" Edmonson explained.\n\nHow much to water a tree? A lot for mature trees, he said.\n\nEdmonson said a mature tree wants about a half gallon of water a week for every square foot of ground shaded by the canopy.\n\nHe also said almost all of a tree's roots are in the top three feet of soil, with the feeder roots in the top half of that, but they extend out from the trunk as much as twice the distance from the trunk to the drip line, much farther than most people realize.\n\nHe recommends concentrating water for mature trees near the drip line — the edge of the tree's canopy of leaves.\n\nFor young trees and new plantings, \"you should know where their roots are, because you planted them. If you put a tree with a two-foot root ball in the ground last year, water within two feet of the trunk, because that's where the roots are.\"\n\nEdmonson also recommends finding ways to keep water in the ground where you put it.\n\n\"Build a low berm around the tree, just beyond its drip line, and fill the space under the canopy with mulch. Berm keeps the water from running off, while mulch keeps it from evaporating. Just don't mulch right up to the trunk, which can promote disease.\"\n\nSo the key question is, if my oak drops its leaves, is it dead?\n\n\"Maybe, maybe not,\" Edmonson told the anxious group.\n\n\"Remember deciduous trees, like pecans and live oaks, drop their leaves this time of year anyway, so it may be natural. Evergreens that turn brown are in trouble.\n\n\"Don't be too quick to give up on a tree, though. It may be dropping leaves as a defensive measure, and may come back green again in the spring if it gets water. Give it at least a year, maybe two, before you get out the chainsaw.\"\n\nReaders are solely responsible for the content of the comments they post here.

      "text": "The Homeowners Column\n\nIdentifying Insect Galls on Trees\n\nJune 17, 2000\n\nAs you are wandering around your yard you may notice bumps on the leaves or odd round things on the twigs of maples, oaks, hackberries and cherries (to name a few plants). The bumps actually have great names such as maple bladder gall, roly-poly gall on oak, succulent oak gall and hackberry nipple gall. Some of the bumps like the ones on maples are bright red and pretty in a weird sort of way.\n\nGalls are growths on leaves, stems and twigs of many different plants. Galls can be created by insects, mites, bacteria, fungi and nematodes. The ones most often brought into our office are caused by insects and mites. There are at least 1,441 species of insects and mites that cause galls in North America.\n\nGalls are actually created by the plants themselves in response to feeding or egg-laying by certain species of insects and mites. As gall-making insects feed or lay eggs, they create mechanical damage. The damage and/or the insect saliva initiates the production of plant growth hormones. These hormones produce abnormal cell growth that results in the development of the galls. For gall formation to occur the feeding or egg laying must happen while the leaves or plant part is growing rapidly, usually in early spring.\n\nThe gall-making insects and mites are very specific to the kinds of plants they attack and to the types of galls they produce. The majority of gall-making insects are wasps. Hearing the name wasp may send people running for cover. However, most wasps do not sting people. It is just a few bad guys giving the rest of the wasp world a bad reputation.\n\nThe common maple bladder gall is a bladder or pouch-like growth on the leaves of maples caused by a eriophyid mite. The galls form on the tops of leaves and change in color from yellow-green to a beautiful red and eventually to black as the season progresses.\n\nOaks can have numerous types of galls. Out of the over 800 species of gall making wasps in North America, 731 of them attack oaks. Oak deformities are of various sizes, shapes, and colors on leaves, twigs, flowers, acorns and buds. Galls are so commonly found on oaks that many people think the galls are typical parts of the plants. Some early botanical drawings actually show galls as part of the normal plant.\n\nThe good news about galls is the majority do little or no damage to trees. The trees are just well accessorized. Generally there is enough unaffected foliage for the trees to remain vigorous.\n\nChemical control of most galls is difficult to impossible. Timing of any sprays is difficult since sprays must be initiated before gall formation begins. Late spraying may kill the gall maker, but the gall will continue to grow. The gall maker may initiate the gall, but the gall is produced by the plant.\n\nBe sure to join us for the University of Illinois Extension Master Gardener Garden Walk on Sunday, June 18 from 10am-5pm.

      "text": "Orchard\n\nThe Fair Oaks Horticulture Center orchard was established in 1998 to demonstrate planting and pruning techniques for fruit trees that are appropriate for small urban yards. The orchard displays many ways to maximize the number of fruit varieties that can be planted in a small space for a long harvest period.\n\nThe original trees in this orchard were planted in 1998, although many have been removed and replaced. These changes have been a learning experience for both the Master Gardeners and the public! Replacement trees have provided an opportunity to demonstrate the planting and training of young trees, and to taste new varieties.\n\nCodling moth management Read what Master Gardeners have learned about codling moth management for apples, pears and Asian pears at the FOHC orchard.\n\nPeach leaf curl prevention Different products were applied to peach and nectarine trees in the demonstration orchard to see how well they prevent peach leaf curl. See the results of the 2012 trial.\n\nSpotted Wing Drosophila control A tree cover constructed to control Spotted Wing Drosophila on cherries was tested at the FOHC.\n\nPlanting ideas from the Fair Oaks Horticulture Center orchard\n\nThe orchard shows many different ways to plant and maintain fruit trees to maximize fruit production. Visit the orchard during a workshop, on an open garden day, or for Harvest Day and see for yourself how you can successfully grow and enjoy a wide variety of delicious fruit right from your own trees.\n\nFruit bushes\n\nMost of the trees in the front and central area of the orchard are kept below seven feet in height - these are called \"fruit bushes\". The key to fruit bush training is summer pruning - pruning in early May and again after harvest. The benefits of keeping trees small:\n\n-Minimizes the need to climb ladders -Keeps fruit reachable from the ground -Allows space for a wider variety of fruit, and a longer harvest season\n\nEach tree has half the space to grow in that a single tree would have.\n\n3-in-a-hole\n\nEach tree takes up one third the space of a single tree. The planting mound was created to improve drainage over an area of hardpan.\n\nNote that many of the tree trunks and exposed limbs are painted white to prevent sunburn. The paint is a mixture of 50% white (or light colored) interior latex paint and 50% water.\n\n4-in-a-hole\n\nEach tree takes up one fourth the space of a single tree.\n\nFruit bush hedgerow - 5 feet apart\n\nOriginally, eight trees were planted two feet apart in a hedgerow. We found this planting much too close and removed the entire row. We planted three new pluot trees five feet apart. We installed a raised bed to allow for better drainage. From our experience, trees planted in a hedgerow need to be planted at least five to six feet apart.\n\nEspaliered trees\n\nEspaliers are useful where you have a narrow space, such as along a fence or house. Shoots can be trained along wires or spread out in a fan shape, with fruiting spurs carefully selected and maintained. Apples, pears, and citrus have traditionally been espaliered. Our orchard includes espaliered apples, pears, Asian pears, and a dwarf pomegranate.\n\nGenetic dwarf citrus\n\nWith little pruning, genetic dwarf citrus trees will grow no more than 8-10 feet tall and wide – this is about half the size of a standard sized citrus tree. With some additional pruning, these dwarfs can be kept smaller.\n\nGenetic dwarf peaches and nectarines\n\nThis is a row of three mature genetic dwarf peaches and nectarines, yet they are only about 5 feet tall. The fruit from these trees is very tasty!\n\nPerpendicular \"V\" peaches and nectarines\n\nIn this row of peach and nectarine trees each tree has only two main scaffold branches forming a \"V\" perpendicular to the row, and trees are planted only 5-6 feet apart. Our trees are allowed to grow up to 8-10 feet, and DO require the use of a ladder. See more about perpendicular V training here.\n\nMulti-grafted tree\n\nThis special cherry tree has six cherry varieties grafted onto a Lapins cherry tree. Most cherry varieties need a second cherry tree to cross pollinate, but not here. A tree like this is a good reason to learn bud grafting, or buy a multi-variety grafted tree!\n\nArborsculpture\n\nIt takes an artistic eye, but a tree can be trained to special shapes - this is an Asian pear espaliered arborsculpture.

      "text": "Not all leaves turn vivid colors in the fall. Only a few of our many species of deciduous trees—notably maple, aspen, oak, and gum—produce stellar performances for our annual autumn spectacular in North America.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to fall color, but the main agent is light, or actually the lack of it. The amount of daylight relates to the timing of the autumnal equinox. See when fall begins[2].\n\nThis \"abscission layer\" eventually causes the leaf to drop off in the breeze. As the corky cells multiply, they seal off the vessels that supply the leaf with nutrients and water and also block the exit vessels, trapping simple sugars in the leaves. The combination of reduced light, lack of nutrients, and no water add up to the death of the pigment chlorophyll, the \"green\" in leaves.\n\nOnce the green is gone, two other pigments show their bright faces. These pigments, carotene (yellow) and anthocyanin (red), exist in the leaf all summer but are masked by the chlorophyll. (The browns in autumn leaves are the result of tannin, a chemical that exists in many leaves, especially oaks.)\n\nSugar trapped in autumn leaves by the abscission layer is largely responsible for the vivid color. Some additional anthocyanins are also manufactured by sunlight acting on the trapped sugar. This is why the foliage is so sparkling after several bright fall days and more pastel during rainy spells. In general, a dry fall produces the most-vibrant color.\n\nDoes your area experience fall foliage? Surprisingly, some level of autumn foliage changes in many regions on North America. However, it is the northern tier of states, especially New England, that hold the jackpot for leaf peepers. A combination of the right climate and light conditions and an abundance of the tree varieties that hoard colorful pigments come together there.\n\nWhile tradition has it that Columbus Day weekend is when the color peaks in New England, the mythical maximum occurs in northern Maine in mid- to late September and \"travels\" south, reaching the Connecticut shore by late October."

What kind of light and soil do they like? How tall do they grow? —Peg Banks, Plano, TX\n\nItalian stone pines, sometimes called parasol pines, become large, picturesque trees with 5- to 7-inch needles in bundles of two. Their seeds are edible. In fact, most pignolias (the \"pine nuts\" we use in cooking) come from these trees. Unfortunately, they're only suited to Zones 9 and higher.\n\nI hope you're planning to move your pines from their pots to your landscape. Since they're relatively slow growing, you might be able to keep them in large containers for a few years. But eventually, these trees may grow up to 80 feet tall. Choose a location with lots of sun. Originating in the Mediterranean, these pines grow best in fairly poor, dry soil. Water to get them established, but don't overdo it."

And, most importantly, what are the chances I will harm the parent plant if I remove all three of its suckers?\nThanks so much.\n\nANSWER:\n\nCornus sericea (redosier dogwood), also known as red-twig dogwood, is a native of Maryland, though it does not like to grow much further south. This is a lovely shrub with delicate cream-white flowers in spring, followed by umbrella clusters of white berries, pleasant fall color, and bright red stems after the leaves have fallen. It can also be aggressive, which means you are unlikely to harm the mother plant by removing the shoots. It propagates so easily, in fact, that you could probably cut a stem and stick it in the ground to root if the growing conditions were favorable.\n\nFrom our webpage on this plant: \"Propagate by seed or cuttings. Hardwood cuttings do not require treatment. Collected sprouts are easily established.\"\n\nPropagation from cuttings or shoots is usually done as the plant is in dormancy. If you choose to propagate by root sprouts, look for ones that have good roots established already. If the sprouts are not well-rooted, pruning about 1/2 of the top of the sprout is helpful to reduce stress on the plant during establishment. You will want to protect the tops of your newly replanted sprouts during the winter with mulch or some other protective material. A safer technique is to use a long, sharp spade (sometimes called a sharpshooter spade) to sever the sprouts from the mother plants, but leave the sprouts in place until spring. It is best to make the cut as close to the mother plant as possible without damaging its bark. \"Within six inches or so\" is a good rule of thumb. When the soil warms, dig and transplant as you wish. The advantage of this technique is that the roots of the sprouts are little disturbed during the severing process and the new plants will grow a better root system during the cold months and get a faster start in the spring.\n\nFrom North Carolina State University, we found this article on Plant Propagation by Stem Cuttings. They give excellent instructions for several ways to propagate woody plants, but since we already know that sprouts (or suckers) are very easy to propagate in this plant, you can look at their instructions for softwood cuttings, in which they say that shoots are suitable for making softwood cuttings when they can be snapped easily when bent and when they still have a gradation of leaf size (oldest leaves are mature while newest leaves are still small).

      "text": "put down some roots this year? In most regions, fall is the time to plant a tree. Why should you consider planting a tree? Well, besides being beautiful and providing shade, trees positively alter the environment in which we live by moderating climate, improving air quality, conserving water, and harboring wildlife. All in all, they are a great addition to your home, and getting them in the ground now gives them a chance to root and begin to grow before the ground freezes. But before you start digging holes, here are some things from a home inspector perspective to consider when planting trees around your home:\n\nSelecting a tree. Every tree is different and has different needs in order to thrive. You'll want to research a tree that will do well in your area and, perhaps most importantly, you'll want to know and plan for the tree's unique requirement for space. We can't just plant them anywhere, and we need to account for their adult size when deciding what tree is right for our property.\n\nToo close to home. Tree roots can cause varying degrees of structural damage to your home depending on the proximity to the dwelling and the type of tree. Ficus trees, for example, have very aggressive root systems and even a small tree planted close to a structure will cause foundation and plumbing damage due to root intrusion. Trees like Oaks and Maples have massive root systems but actually may cause less damage because the roots generally will go around obstructions rather than through them.\n\nAggressive Roots and Your Plumbing. Unfortunately, aggressive root systems can bore through older, brittle plumbing components like cast iron and clay that are under the structure. Large roots can also crush plumbing components. Repairs for this type of damage can be costly.\n\nWalkways or driveways. Root systems that heave walkways and driveways not only cause concrete and asphalt damage, but also create a \"trip hazard\" due to uneven surfaces.\n\nMoisture & Termites: Trees are organic \"cellulose-based\" organisms. Termites eat cellulose for sustenance. Whenever you plant anything close to the structure it is important to consider the possibility that you may be planting a food source for termites. Because termites are migratory, if they attack a tree near the structure it is likely that they will continue on and look for another food source which may, unfortunately, be your house.\n\nTrees & Gutters: Keep in mind that trees with limbs that overhang roofs can be a source of contributing water damage to your home. So again think about placement of the tree and account for it's adult size. It may be a while before your tree gets large enough to create any problems, but debris from overhanging trees that accumulates on roofing material will cause pre-mature deterioration. In addition, if an overhanging tree limbs break and contact the roof or other parts of the structure, severe damage can occur.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nLearn More: How to Plant a Tree Want to know more about how to plant a tree?

      "text": "Learning about Trees: Roots, Trunks, Branches & Leaves\n\nArbor Day was established on April 10, 1872, by J. Sterling Morton, Secretary of Agriculture under President Grover Cleveland. He was also at one time the governor of Nebraska, and it was there that he created Arbor Day to encourage the planting of and care for trees. On that first Arbor Day, around one million trees were planted. Morton loved trees and wanted others to feel the same way. Through his roles in government, he taught others about good forestry techniques and helped establish national forest reservations.\n\nToday, Arbor Day is a global holiday, and its date of celebration varies in countries throughout the world. In the U.S., Arbor Day falls on the last Friday in April, not long after Earth Day. In Nebraska, Arbor Day is a civic holiday. No matter where you are, the custom is to plant a tree on this day. Why not take it further? Use Arbor Day as a starting point for creating a fun unit on trees. You can incorporate science, math, history, art, literature, and more into lessons revolving around our planet's largest plants.\n\nNo matter what age your children are, any good unit on trees should begin with a lesson on the subject itself. Take the information and make it appropriate for any age level. With older or gifted students, you can encourage them to expand this information, to ask probing questions, and to research even more about trees.\n\nTrees are classified as woody, perennial plants. This means that it produces wood as its structural tissue, or its support, and that it lives year after year, even if it goes dormant in the winter. To be truly a tree, a woody, perennial plant must reach a certain size, which is debatable. Generally, woody plants like shrubberies that do not grow three to six meters tall and have a trunk that is about six inches in diameter are not trees. Another characteristic of trees is that they have a central trunk from which branches emerge.\n\nMost trees are classified into two types: flowering and conifer. Flowering trees, also known as angiosperms, reproduce by making flowers that turn into fruits. The fruits contain the seeds for the next generation of trees. Conifers, which we often think of as pine trees and other evergreens, are a type of plant called gymnosperm. Gymnosperms produce seeds that are not enclosed in a fruit. They are exposed and often develop on cones.\n\nTree parts include the roots, trunk, branches, leaves, and twigs. The roots take in water and nutrients from the soil. Leaves take in carbon dioxide and light for the process of photosynthesis, which produces the tree's food. The trunks, branches, and twigs are for support and transport. Fluids are pulled up the trunk by a specialized tissue in the wood called xylem. Xylem is made up of cells that are no longer living. Living cells make up another type of tissue called phloem, which is responsible for transporting sap, a fluid with nutrients, to parts of the tree in which photosynthesis does not occur. In other words, it helps feed the tree.\n\nTrees are important for several reasons. They play a critical role in their ecosystems by anchoring soil and preventing erosion with their roots. They also provide shelter for many other members of the ecosystem. Insects, birds, and small mammals live in trees and take shelter in the foliage. Other animals often feed from trees as well. Trees even provide shelter for other plants. Many grow on their branches, especially air plants or bromeliads. By undergoing photosynthesis to make their own food, trees are a major source of oxygen in our atmosphere. They also take in and absorb excess carbon dioxide. Besides providing food and shelter, the wood of trees has long been an important energy source for us humans.\n\nArmed with some basic information about trees, you can come up with some fun lessons for your kids. Take inspiration and ideas from below.\n\nElementary\n\nScience. For your youngsters, start with the most basic facts about trees, like the different parts. Take the discussion outdoors so they can see, touch, here, and smell the trees as they learn about them.\n\nMath. Use trees when counting and learning about numbers. It helps to have objects to turn the abstract concept of numbers into something concrete. When you get into bigger numbers, use leaves, acorns, or other small tree parts.\n\nArt. Make bark and leaf rubbings. Take large pieces of paper outside, preferably inexpensive newsprint. Tape the paper to a tree and rub it with the side of a crayon. You will create the bark pattern on the paper. Make a rubbing for every type of tree you have nearby. Collect leaves from each of the trees as well. Stick the leaves to a flat surface, like a table top, with a piece of tape curled to the back of the leaf. Don't put the tape over the top of your leaf or it will show up on the rubbing. Rub the paper with crayon to make impressions of all the leaves you have collected. Display the rubbings throughout the house so your kids can learn to identify the different tree types.\n\nLiterature. Read The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein. Read it aloud for the youngest ones, or better yet, have an older child read it aloud. Discuss the theme of the book and how it makes you feel.\n\nMiddle School\n\nScience. Delve a little deeper into the information about trees with your middle school-aged kids. You can talk about the types of trees and their internal workings. Send them off to research more details about xylem and phloem and how they transport fluids and nutrients through the tree.\n\nWriting and history. Create a frontier journal. Have your kids pretend to be a frontier explorer, like Lewis and Clark. They should imagine what it was like to explore the west and discover new species of trees. They will need to use their knowledge about trees and species as well as some creativity and writing skills to create this fictional account.\n\nArt and culture. Get a bonsai tree (they are not very expensive). Research and learn about the Japanese tradition and art of cultivating these miniature trees. Then have your kids try their hands at it. It takes patience, skill, and knowledge.\n\nHigh School\n\nScience. With your teenagers, you can really get into the details about how trees work. Include the chemistry of trees, like the process of photosynthesis, details about the cells and their components, and even the physics of how fluids move in trees. This is a great topic for individual study. There are plenty of books that your teens can find to learn more about trees.\n\nArt and taxonomy. Challenge your older kids to go outdoors and draw detailed pictures of different types of trees. They should draw the tree itself, as well as the leaf and flower, cone, or seed that it produces. They can then look up the taxonomic name for the trees they draw and label the pictures creating scientific works of art.\n\nEnvironment and society. Trees are a big part of many environmental issues in the news today. Get your teens involved in current affairs by researching environmental problems and concerns and how trees are related. For instance, deforestation in rain forests or logging in the U.S. are two subjects they could research.\n\nGenealogy. Creating a family tree is a great project for a high school-aged child. Have your teen learn about what genealogy is and then create a history for your family. He or she can find information by interviewing you and your spouse and their grandparents. They can also use the local library for more resources.\n\nFor the Whole Family\n\nTogether as a family, contribute to the tradition of Arbor Day by planting trees. Plant one tree for each member of the family. Before you do so, discuss together what kind of trees you will plant and why. Maybe you will add fruit trees to your garden or pine trees for creating a natural barrier. Talk about the importance of each type of tree and which ones suit your local environment the best and are most useful to your family and your lifestyle.\n\nOff The Grid Gear\n\nToday, you're in more danger than ever before of becoming a victim of a crime. Step outside your home and count two houses to your left. Now count two houses to your right. Between"

      "text": "Eastern White Cedar (The name \"cedar\" is a misnomer-true cedars are native to Africa and Asia) is an evergreen native to the northeastern part of North America roughly bounded in the north by a line drawn from the southern tip of Hudson Bay west to the Ontario/Manitoba border and east to Nova Scotia. In the south, it occurs along the southern shores of the Great Lakes and most of the New England states. The leaves are yellowish-green and scale-like. The fibrous bark is reddish brown and peels off in narrow strips. Both wood and foliage are highly aromatic. The wood of eastern white cedar is long lasting, making the species an ideal subject for driftwood style bonsai.\n\nWhen growing in the open, cedars are straight-trunked with a slightly conical, columnar crown that extends to the ground. The foliage is dense, and the tree has an almost pruned appearance. The root system is shallow and wide-spreading, making the trees adapt easily to life in a bonsai pot (figures 1 and 2).\n\nFigure 2: White cedar rootball side view\n\nIn areas where they are subjected to abuse by wildlife and the elements, cedars attain the trunk shapes that make them ideal bonsai subjects. Because of poor soil conditions and periods of extended drought during the growing seasons, cedars growing under those conditions are naturally dwarfed, and can frequently be found with shari and jin in place, although requiring some refinement. Cedars are suitable for all bonsai styles with the possible exception of literati. It is their rugged appearance and usually well tapered trunk that make them unsuitable for this style.\n\nFoliage If cedars have a drawback, it must be their foliage. It is similar to the foliage of Hinoki cypress but not as tight. On the other hand, it is not as curly. Fronds will grow every which way, and the view of regular cedar foliage can be daunting for the cedar novice (figure 3). However, with judicious pruning and pinching (figures 4 and 5), it can be forced to behave and form foliage pads not unlike those of junipers.\n\nFigure 3: Typical folige on unpruned white cedar\n\nFigure 4: Typical folige frond before pinching\n\nFigure 5: Cedar frond after pinching\n\nCedars grow throughout the growing season without a period of rest if conditions are appropriate, which they should be if they are being grown as bonsai. They therefore need to be pruned and pinched frequently. If you time your pruning sessions to coincide with the appearance of Haley's Comet, your cedars will not look good. Each of my trees is subjected to at least two scissors pruning sessions per growing season in addition to being pinched whenever something sticks up, down, or out. Unless this pruning is carried out religiously, cedars will develop elongated shoots with long internodes.\n\nWhile I have seen cedars bud back on 3OO-year-old trunks in the bush, I have never had that happen on the trees I grow as bonsai. There must be special ingredients in the air \"up north.\" Anyway, they do bud back on younger twigs, and also on areas of the trunk where branches are already growing (figure 6)-a somewhat redundant feature.\n\nFigure 6: Back-budding on older wood\n\nAs with other trees, cedars shed old foliage in fall. Sometime in September, part of the foliage- usually in the interior of the tree- will turn rusty brown and slowly fall off (figures 7 and 8). If you're not sure whether your tree is shedding or dying, pulling at the brown foliage is a reliable test, because the foliage about to be shed comes off easily, while the foliage about to die requires a lot of force to remove. From my own observation, I believe that this natural shedding can be reduced by timing one of the heavy pruning sessions to occur around the middle of August.\n\nFertilizing Cedars like lots of fertilizer, and I feed mine weekly with a full strength 30-10-10 chemical fertilizer beginning about the end of May and ending the middle of August, with another couple of applications in late September and early October. I alternate between different products, including Miracid. Such fertilizing gives the trees dark green foliage and lots of growth, which, of course, is mostly pruned off, but does contribute to the denseness of the foliage pads. I start with the fertilizing regimen in the year following collecting.\n\nPests Cedars are relatively free of pests. The only ones I have ever encountered are scale and leaf miner, both controlled by spraying with a svstemic insecticide. A cedar suffering from a leaf miner infestation is not a pretty sight (figures 9, 10, and 11), and ever since ilmost my whole collection of cedars was attacked by these insects in 1994, I give them two precautionary applications of a systemic insecticide-one in early May and another about two or three weeks later. Figure 9: Leaf miner damage\n\nI spent much of the spring of 1995 plucking all the dead foliage off the trees, but I am happy to report that they all survived.\n\nWinter care As you would expect from a tree that is native to this region of the American continent, cedars are very winter hardy. If you have marveled at the pictures of growers in some parts of Japan leaving bonsai on their benches all year round, marvel no more, because that is what I have been doing with some of my cedars. Why not all? Well, better safe than sorry, so while it is true that I have left cedars sitting on the bench all winter long, I do use some judgment, mainly relating to the size of the root ball. But putting the trees on the ground in a shady spot is quite adequate to ensure their survival in the Toronto area.\n\nCedar foliage, like that of some junipers, changes colour in winter, becoming grayish-green with maroon undertones. This can be startling to those not familiar with the tree's habits, but checking the underside of the foliage should still reveal a healthy light green shade and signal that all is well. The winter colour disappears within a few days in spring.\n\nWiring Cedars are very particular when it comes to wiring the young fronds. There is no problem wiring branches, other than that old ones are very stiff and somewhat brittle, but because they dislike having foliage wired into a different position, I do this type of shaping exclusively by pruning and regrowing.\n\nAs I hope the accompanying pictures show, eastern white cedars make good bonsai. Because of their foliage and trunk characteristics, they are best suited for larger trees- good specimens smaller than 12-15\" are difficult to find and even more difficult to make into convincing bonsai. If you live in an area where cedars are native, it is well worth looking for spots where they are naturally dwarfed-usually associated with poor soils-and get permission to dig up a few. When you do, keep them in the shade for about a month afterwards and spray the foliage frequently (four or five times a day, if you can) with water through a fogging nozzle. In the second year, start fertilizing heavily and do some initial pruning as required."

It is often difficult to tell when real changes will take place. You have to be alert and sensitive to change.

Their expressiveness comes from where they are in terms of the soil they are growing in, the wind they bear and the amount of light they get and when they get it.

There is no short cut. It is hard work. The camera takes the photograph but you decide what to take. The camera is not anywhere as important as the eye of the photographer.\n\nQ: How did the trees of the Garden fare during Hurricane Sandy?\n\nA: The storm was quite bad for the Garden.

Now to get rid of the suckers that are still coming up. They are the plant's last-ditch struggle to survive, which is every organism's primary purpose. Those \"little trees\" coming off the roots are, in effect, branches the roots are putting out to get some leaves growing to manufacture food for the roots through photosynthesis. The roots are a storage area for nutrients and will continue to try to stay alive. Of course, you want to nip off those suckiers as soon as they stick their heads up. Eventually, if you got them all, the roots would starve, but this could take a while.\n\nSo, take the battle to the root. Get a bottle of wide-spectrum herbicide and some disposable foam paintbrushes. Dig down to where you can get at the main root. Cut off a slice of that root, exposing a fresh surface. Quickly, within five minutes, before the tree can begin to heal itself, paint the raw surface with the herbicide. This should go down into the circulatory system of the root and begin to kill it. This will also take a while, depending on how much root there is. If you are really determined, you could dig down and locate some more roots going out from the main stump and treat them the same way. Be very careful with the herbicide, avoid spilling it on the ground and contaminating the soil, and don't use spray. A spray could easily stray onto another, more valuable plant, and cause more damage than you intended. Hopefully, this will stop the development of the suckers and permit you to begin planting in the fall. We would also suggest that you remove as much of the root from the ground as possible, and then work some compost into the bed before starting to put in new plants.\n\nMore Propagation QuestionsPlanting wildflower seeds in a drought in Grimes Co.

      "text": "arden Guru: Options for disposal of Christmas tree\n\nFriday, December 28, 2012\n\nStorm Lake Pilot Tribune\n\nWhen Christmas is over, the egg nog gone, relatives departed and decorations are getting packed away, it also is time to get rid of the real Christmas tree. Horticulturists with Iowa State University Extension and Outreach have advice on disposing of trees and options for poinsettias after the holidays. To have additional yard and garden questions answered contact the Iowa State University Hortline at hortline@iastate.edu or 515-294-3108.\n\nWhat are some good ways to dispose of a Christmas tree after the holidays?\n\nAfter the holidays, there are several ways to dispose of or recycle your tree. (Before recycling your Christmas tree, remove all ornaments, lights and tinsel.)\n\nPlace the tree in the yard or garden for use by birds and other wildlife. The branches provide shelter from strong winds and cold. Supply food by hanging fruit slices, seed cakes, suet bags or strings of cranberries or raisins on the tree's branches. You also can smear peanut butter and seeds in pine cones and hang them in the tree.\n\nPrune off the tree's branches and place the boughs over perennials as winter mulch. Chip the tree and use the chipped material as mulch around trees, shrubs or in perennial flower beds.\n\nIf you can't use the tree yourself, contact your Solid Waste Agency or sanitation service. Most communities have some type of Christmas tree disposal program. Some have central collection points, others collect trees at curbside. Collected trees may be chipped into mulch and made available to local residents or used in city parks. Others may be chipped and composted.\n\nConservation groups may be another option. Some hunting and fishing groups collect trees and use them to provide habitat for wildlife.\n\nDon't burn your Christmas tree in a fireplace or wood stove. Dry, evergreen branches literally explode when burned and could cause a house fire. Also, burning the tree may contribute to the buildup of creosote and lead to a flue fire.\n\nWhat should I do with my poinsettia after the holidays?\n\nIf given good care in the home, a poinsettia should remain attractive for two to three months. Toss the poinsettia when you grow tired of it or it becomes unattractive.\n\nFor those home gardeners who enjoy a challenge, it is possible to get the poinsettia to bloom again next season. Cut the stems back to within 4 to 6 inches of the soil in March. The poinsettia also may be repotted at this time. When new growth appears, place the poinsettia in a sunny window. Continue to water the plant when the soil surface becomes dry to the touch. Fertilize every two weeks with a dilute fertilizer solution.\n\nIn late May, move the poinsettia outdoors. Harden or acclimate the plant to the outdoors by placing it in a shady, protected area for two or three days, then gradually expose it to longer periods of direct sun. The poinsettia should be properly hardened in seven to 10 days. Once hardened, dig a hole in an area that receives six to eight hours of sunlight and set the pot into the ground. To obtain a compact, bushy plant, pinch or cut off the shoot tips once or twice from late June to mid-August. Continue to water and fertilize the plant outdoors.\n\nThe poinsettia should be brought indoors in mid-September. Place the plant in a bright, sunny window. The poinsettia is a short-day plant. Short-day plants grow vegetatively during the long days of summer and produce flowers when days become shorter in fall. To get the poinsettia to flower for Christmas, the plant must receive complete darkness from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. daily from early October until the bracts develop good color, usually early December. Protect the plant from light by placing it in a closet or by covering with a box. During the remainder of the day, the poinsettia should be in a sunny window."

      "text": "Contents\n\nIt is a deciduoustree, growing to 20–30 m (66–98 ft) tall with a trunk up to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in diameter, and a broad, rounded crown. The bark is grey-brown and shallowly grooved; unlike many other maples, mature trees do not tend to develop a shaggy bark. The shoots are green at first, soon becoming pale brown; the winter buds are shiny red-brown.\n\nThe leaves are opposite, palmately lobed with five lobes, 7–14 cm (2.8–5.5 in) long and 8–20 cm (3.1–7.9 in) (rarely 25 cm (9.8 in)) across; the lobes each bear one to three side teeth, and an otherwise smooth margin. The leaf petiole is 8–20 cm (3.1–7.9 in) long, and secretes a milky juice when broken. The autumn colour is usually yellow, occasionally orange-red.\n\nThe flowers are in corymbs of 15–30 together, yellow to yellow-green with five sepals and five petals 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) long; flowering occurs in early spring before the new leaves emerge. The fruit is a double samara with two winged seeds; the seeds are disc-shaped, strongly flattened, 10–15 mm (0.39–0.59 in) across and 3 mm (0.12 in) thick. The wings are 3–5 cm (1.2–2.0 in) long, widely spread, approaching a 180° angle. It typically produces a large quantity of viable seeds.\n\nIt is not particularly a long-lived tree, with a maximum age of around 250 years.[4][5][6][7]\n\nThe Norway maple is a member (and is the type species) of the section Platanoidea Pax, characterised by flattened, disc-shaped seeds and the shoots and leaves containing milky sap. Other related species in this section include Acer campestre (field maple), Acer cappadocicum (Cappadocian maple), Acer lobelii (Lobel's maple), and Acer truncatum (Shandong maple). From the field Maple, the Norway maple is distinguished by its larger leaves with pointed, not blunt, lobes, and from the other species by the presence of one or more teeth on all of the lobes.[4][5]\n\nIt is also frequently confused with the more distantly related Acer saccharum (sugar maple). The sugar maple is easy to identify by clear sap in the petiole (Norway maple has white sap). The tips of the points on Norway maple leaves reduce to a fine \"hair\", while the tips of the points on sugar maple leaves are, on close inspection, rounded. On mature trees, sugar maple bark is more shaggy, while Norway maple bark has small, often criss-crossing grooves. While the shape and angle of leaf lobes vary somewhat within all maple species, the leaf lobes of Norway maple tend to have a more triangular shape, in contrast to the more squarish lobes often seen on sugar maples. The seeds of sugar maple are globose, while Norway maple seeds are flattened. The sugar maple usually has a brighter orange autumn color, where the Norway maple is usually yellow, although some of the red-leaved cultivars appear more orange.\n\nThe tree tends to leaf out earlier than most maples and holds its leaves somewhat longer in autumn. Seeds begin forming in mid-spring and ripen over the course of the summer months, finally dropping in the fall. Unlike some other maples that wait for the soil to warm up, A. platanoides seeds require only three months of exposure to sub-40°F temperatures and will sprout in early spring. The heavy seed crop and high germination rate contributes to its invasiveness in North America.[4][5]\n\nThe wood is hard, yellowish-white to pale reddish, with the heartwood not distinct; it is used for furniture and turnery.[8]\n\nNorway maple has been widely placed into cultivation in other areas, including western Europe northwest of its native range. It grows north of the Arctic Circle at Tromsø, Norway. In North America, it is grown as a street and shade tree as far north as Anchorage, Alaska.[9] It is favored due to its tall trunk and tolerance of poor, compacted soils and urban pollution, conditions that native maples cannot grow in. Because of Norway Maple's invasive nature, it has been recommended that American Sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) be used instead as a pollution-tolerant native tree.\n\nIt has become a popular species for bonsai in Europe and is used for medium to large bonsai sizes and a multitude of styles.[10]\n\nMany cultivars have been selected for distinctive leaf shapes or colourations, such as the dark purple of 'Crimson King' and 'Schwedleri', the variegated leaves of 'Drummondii', the light green of 'Emerald Queen', and the deeply divided, feathery leaves of 'Dissectum' and 'Lorbergii'. The purple-foliage cultivars have orange to red autumn colour. 'Columnare' is selected for its narrow upright growth.[5][11]\n\nThe roots of Norway maples grow very close to the ground surface, starving other plants of moisture. For example, lawn grass (and even weeds) will usually not grow well beneath a Norway maple, but English Ivy, with its minimal rooting needs, may thrive. In addition, the dense canopy of Norway maples can inhibit understory growth.[14] Some have suggested Norway maples may also release chemicals to discourage undergrowth,[15] although this is controversial.[14]\n\nA. platanoides has been shown to inhibit the growth of native saplings as a canopy tree or as a sapling.[14] The Norway maple also suffers less herbivory than the sugar maple, allowing it to gain a competitive advantage against the latter species.[16]\n\nThe Norway maple is one of three species Meijer Garden Centers no longer sell; Meijer made this decision due to the tree's invasive nature.[21] Despite these steps, the species is still available and widely used for urban plantings in many areas."

      "text": "Most people who love nature don't restrict their outings to days when it's sunny and over 60 degrees: We'd never get outside in Ohio. On a winter hike through your favorite forest, you may see many trees and shrubs that are unfamiliar.\n\nHow can you learn to identify these plants in winter? Answer the following questions, and test your knowledge of winter identification.\n\nQ: This huge tree, which often grows along streams, has attractive brown mottled bark. Patches of the bark often slough off the trunk and large branches to reveal the bright white bark beneath. Name this tree.\n\nA: The native American sycamore is the only massive tree you will see with this kind of bark. Sycamore's cousin, the London plane tree, has mottled bark with green hues and yellow bark underneath instead of white.\n\nBark characteristics are helpful in identifying many trees in winter. Black cherry has dark bark that's flaky like potato chips, white oak has striped, shaggy bark, and of course shagbark hickory peels from the trunk in long, narrow strips. And who could forget the smooth, gray bark of beech, compared by some to the skin of an elephant?\n\nQ: Of course, not every tree is easy to identify from bark alone. As you stop to observe a twig close up, you notice that the leaf scars (marks on the twigs where the leaves used to be attached) are arranged opposite one another. What kind of tree might this be?\n\nA: Most trees have alternate leaf arrangement, which means the leaves are not attached to the twigs directly opposite from one another. When the leaves are attached in an opposite arrangement, the choices are relatively few. Keep in mind the phrase \"Mad Cap Horse,\" which stands for Maple, Ash, Dogwood, CAPrifoliaceae (plants in the honeysuckle family, including viburnum) and HORSE chestnut (and buckeye). All of these plants have opposite leaf arrangement.\n\nQ: Another plant you notice at the edge of a marshy area has neither opposite nor alternate leaf arrangement. Instead, the leaf scars are whorled around the branch, similar to opposite arrangement but with three scars around the twig instead of two. What plant is this?\n\nA: Very few woody plants have whorled leaf arrangement. The two we are likely to see in Ohio are catalpa and buttonbush. Buttonbush is a native shrub, common in wetland areas.\n\nQ: On your walk, you notice that twig color often stands out. Some twigs are yellow, some bright green and some deep red. What are some trees and shrubs with colorful twigs?\n\nA: One of my favorite trees, sassafras, has bright green twigs on newer growth. Some willow twigs are yellow, shrub dogwoods are often grown for their red or yellow twigs, and the newer growth on red maple can sometimes be strikingly red. Distinctive twig color is more the exception than the norm, but in a few plants this characteristic can aid in identification.\n\nQ: Two of the plants you see as you walk along have a bluish cast, but upon closer observation, you note that this blue color on twigs seems to rub off. What's going on?\n\nA: This waxy, blue coating, called \"bloom,\" is common on boxelder, brambles and flowering dogwood.\n\nQ: One twig you examine has a strong odor when scratched. What are some trees and shrubs with distinctive odors?\n\nA: Some plants can be identified by their pleasing spicy odor, such as sassafras, spicebush (Lindera benzoin), and sweetshrub (Calycanthus floridus). Sweet birch smells like wintergreen, due to the oil in the twigs and small branches. Tulip tree and cucumber tree, both in the magnolia family, have fragrant twigs. Other less pleasing-to-smell trees include the pungent black cherry and the acrid tree-of-heaven.\n\nQ: Some twigs have small, freckled dots on the bark. What are these dots, and how can they help identify the plant?\n\nA: These dots, called lenticels, serve as pores for gas exchange on twigs. Black cherry and European buckthorn are two plants with numerous small, white lenticels. Other plants, like buttonbush, have large, slit-like lenticels.\n\nQ: Buds are a common means of identifying trees and shrubs in winter. Name two trees with distinctive buds.\n\nA: The first tree that comes to mind is the saucer magnolia, which has large, fuzzy bud scales (scales are the bud coverings). The buds of this tree are so fuzzy, in fact, that some people confuse this tree with pussy willow. (The fuzzy part of pussy willow is not a bud but a flower.)\n\nOther trees with distinctive buds include the sticky buds of horse chestnut, the duck-bill-like buds of tulip tree, the clustered buds of oaks, and the blood red buds of basswood.\n\nQ: Which leaf scar seems to be smiling at you?\n\nA: If you look closely at a tree's leaf scar, you'll notice a consistent pattern within that leaf scar among plants of the same species. The vascular bundles are the tree's conductive tissue, transporting water and sugars during the growing season. These bundles continue from the twigs into the leaves; when leaves drop in autumn, the vascular bundles leave a pattern in the leaf scar known as the \"bundle scar.\" On a butternut, these bundle scars look like two eyes and a smile. Willows have three bundle scars on each leaf scar. Becoming familiar with these patterns can aid in winter tree identification.\n\nQ: What are some other tree characteristics that can help identify a plant in winter?\n\nA: The presence of cones, catkins and thorns may lead you to a larch, filbert or honey locust. Of course acorns will lead you to oaks (which are difficult to specifically identify without the acorns), and pods may lead you to redbud or Kentucky coffee-tree. Plant keys will often ask for information on the twig's center, or pith, such as its color or texture.\n\nQ: Name four references to help with winter identification of trees and shrubs.\n\nA: These books are always on my reference desk in winter. The easiest and least expensive book is a short key to winter trees called Winter Tree Finder, by May Theilgaard Watts and Tom Watts. Fruit Key and Twig Key to Trees and Shrubs by William Harlow is also very reasonably priced (around $6) and very thorough.\n\nFor more detailed identification information on more than 1,000 species, consult Winter Botany, by William Trelease. Woody Plants of Ohio by E. Lucy Braun is an excellent overall reference that can be used for winter or summer identification.\n\nDenise Ellsworth directs the honeybee and native pollinator education program for the Ohio State University.

      "text": "The Basics\n\nTo the untrained eye, a Mexican sycamore looks just like its close relative, the American sycamore. The easiest way to distinguish them is by looking at the foliage. American sycamores are wider at the base of the leaf and generally will have a lobe at the base of the leaf that the Mexican species lacks. Another thing to look at to distinguish them is the tree's age. Since Mexican sycamores have been popular for only 10 years or so, it is unlikely you will find any old, large specimens.\n\nMexican sycamores are fast growing and drought hardy. Maximum height should be around 50′in our area. And, I'd guess they'll have a life span of about 60 years. Mexican sycamores are resistant to bacterial leaf scorch, one of the more prominent and damaging diseases to the American sycamore. As a whole, the Mexican sycamore is pretty insect and disease resistant across the board. I would expect Mexican sycamores to be vulnerable to the cottonwood borer beetle just as the American counter-part is. This bug usually gets into older specimens so we'll just have to wait and see.\n\nThere has been suspicion that the Mexican sycamore would not be cold hardy in the Austin area since the weather doesn't get very cold in its natural distribution area. Last winter (2009-2010) was one the coldest winters we've had in a long time. We didn't have extreme lows or ice build up, but we did have a large number of days below 35 degrees. All of the Mexican sycamores I've seen are still looking great. We'll still have to see how they hold up to our irregular ice storms. But, I'm guessing they're going to prove to be plenty cold hardy.\n\nNatural Distribution\n\nThe Mexican sycamore is found naturally from Guatemala in the southern tip of Mexico up through to the north regions of Mexico. These trees are found in mixed forest galleries, usually along streams and creeks. But, they are known to be hardy in most environments.\n\nA Little History\n\nThere are believed to be two basic sub-genera of sycamore trees. One that spreads from eastern US south into Mexico and another that is found in the pacific northwest and europe. Some genetic researchers in Europe believe that Platanus mexicana (the Mexican sycamore) is the closest descendant to ancestral sycamore precursors. The believe the very first Platanus trees were in Mexico and that all Platanus trees across the globe have some Mexican sycamore in them.\n\nThe Mexican sycamore is one the trees on my most watched list. I'm growing to really appreciate them. Hopefully, the coming 20 years will show us that this is a great tree for our landscapes. For now we can only speculate.\n\nSome time back in the mid 1990′s I was attending the TAN show in Houston, TX and visited Lynn Lowery and acquired a small Mexican Sycamore from him. I live in NW Mississippi, zone 7 , 21 miles S.E of Memphis TN, close to Holly Springs, MS. The tree is now more than 50ft tall with a trunk caliper of 12″or so. It survived a late April, 25 degrees long evening cold 4-5 years ago after leaf foliage emerged, with some die back but recovered nicely. There are some years when lace bugs are present but not enough to discolor the leaves to make them totally russett bland , as the fluffly under coating whatever this is called, that appears on the under part of the foliage may be a deterrer? It grows quickly and I enjoy it, as the bark has started to peel and is attractive during the Winter. Seems like the height out paces the trunk caliper, comparded to other trees here, but this may because of the amount of moisture it receives, as we can have 45-50 + inches of rain during the year and it is planted in a spot 15 feet up slope from all the rain seepage from the surrounding low area, and good deep soil. Fun to have here out of it's( unknown) range. American sycamore is native and grows in every spot it likes here.\n\nthe mexican sycamore in our backyard is in it's 3rd year and about 18ft tall. Last year the new growth came back only along the main trunk. The top 5ft died off. There is a powdery black mold-looking substance on the trunk of the dead portion of the tree. the new growth has just started and some of the sprouting leaves are turning brown and wilting. We had a late freeze after the new growth had formed which was normal looking until that time. Any advice?\n\nI just wanted to add that this species survived -10F and -8F lows in my part of Albuquerque, NM in 2011. This is is the last of my plants to leaf out, handles the arid conditions of our desert well and goes dormant prior to our first snows. A great choice for all of us in the SW.\n\nWe just got a Mexican sycamore for the front yard. Now I'm a little concerned there won't be enough room for the roots. I'm told the rule of thumb is that the roots can extend at least as wide as the longest branch and now I'm reading that with this tree that can be 50 feet. Our yard is pretty small. In the spot it was supposed to go, it would have 9 feet on 3 sides and plenty of room on the 4th side. Will that not be enough room? What is the consequence–a buckled driveway? The alternative that might give it some more room is moving a redbud that's been there 2 years, but I don't want to risk killing that, and that would also put the sycamore fairly close to our neighbors'young oak tree. Any thoughts?\n\nDespite regular watering, the leaves on the Mexican Sycamore I planted this winter are starting to turn brown, and some are dropping. The Monterrey Oaks and Texas Red Oak planted at the same time are doing well. Is there anything I can do other than continuing to water and hope for the best?"

Removing all the bark (which does look rather healthy) makes the tree far more susceptible to other infections.\n\nImage removing all of your skin because you had shingles on a portion of your skin.

The lemon tree is thought to have originated in India and has been cultivated in the United States for several hundred years. Lemon trees can reach 20 to 30 feet in height and are easy to grow, even in poor quality soil.\n\nStep 1\n\nApply mycorrhizal fungi once a year. This fungi helps prevent root rot. It is present in the root system of trees in the wild, but is usually not found in trees planted in suburban soils.\n\nStep 2\n\nWater your lemon tree often. The soil around the tree should not be flooded, but should stay moist. A good rule of thumb is to water the tree at least once a week, or any time that the soil begins to dry out.\n\nStep 3\n\nFertilize the lemon tree in the spring, once new leaf growth begins. Use a high-quality fertilizer specially designed for fruit trees. Lemon trees require micronutrients such as magnesium, copper and zinc. These nutrients are not found in typical lawn fertilizers.\n\nStep 4\n\nSpray your lemon tree with liquid copper fungicide in the early summer months. This fungicide will protect your tree from several infections, such as melanose, greasy spot and citrus canker.\n\nStep 5\n\nPlace iron supplement tablets in the soil around your tree if it shows signs of iron deficiency. Lemon trees often become iron deficient and the most common sign of this problem is the color of new leaves. They will appear yellow or light green.\n\nStep 6\n\nProtect your lemon tree from the cold weather. For the first four years, protect the tree by banking soil up to a height of 15 inches around the trunk. The soil provides insulation. You can also use tree wrap. Apply protection in the fall before the first freeze. Tree blankets can be used on older trees that are still fairly small. For large trees, sprinkle the tree with water right before the freeze. The ice that forms will actually protect the tree.\n\nTips and Warnings\n\nOrganic mulch is not recommended for use with lemon trees since it can introduce root rot.\n\nThings You'll Need\n\nLemon tree\n\nShovel\n\nHose\n\nFertilizer\n\nMycorrhizal fungi\n\nIron supplement tablets\n\nTree wrap or tree blanket\n\nReferences\n\nTree Help: Lemon Trees\n\nKeywords:\nlemon tree, fruit, fertilizer\n\nAbout this Author\n\nCate Rushton has been a freelance writer since 1999, specializing in wildlife and outdoor activities.

      "text": "People often want a\ntree to be smaller because it has grown too big. \"Too big for what?\"\nwe generally ask. The usual response\nis that the tree has become dangerous and could blow over and fall on\nthe house. After performing a risk assessment we can\ndetermine if the tree is safe.\n\nYou may still insist that the tree be reduced in\nsize. The most professional response we can make is that this is an\nunnecessary task not endorsed by Beechwood Tree Care Ltd. Reducing canopy\nsize stresses the tree because of the cuts required.\nUnlike a thinning cut, a drop-crotching cut does not cut back to a natural\nboundary, this means that decay can spread quickly inside\ncut branches, for this reason it is best not to perform crown reduction\nif at all possible.\n\nIn many instances, canopies cannot be properly reduced in size to the\nextent desired and certain species such as Beech do not\nlend themselves to crown reduction, without special techniques such as\npollarding.\n\nOver pruning of the trees to create the desired effect, with heading and\ndrop crotch cuts, can initiate decay in the trunk or branches\nand stimulate rapid epicormac growth that fills in the canopy as it quickly\ngrows to it's original size.\n\nIt is very difficult to use crown reduction to permanently maintain a\ntree at a smaller size without causing the tree to decline.\nConsider pollarding to reduce and maintain the height if the tree is young.\nHowever tree removal and replacement with a smaller\nmaturing plant may be the choice that minimizes the input of resources.\n\nWhen a customer wishes to reduce the height, crown reducing is much preferred\nto topping. Crown reduction should not be used to\nreduce the chances of the tree blowing over in a storm. Thinning is the\npreferred method to minimize storm damage of an otherwise\nstructurally sound tree. Crown reduction can be considered when the root\nsystem of a large maturing tree has substantial decay\nmaking it potentially hazardous or on a tree with a high rating. We would\nsuggest considering pollarding or planting a smaller\nmaturing tree for the site.\nHow is crown reduction achieved?\nThe objective is to make cuts so that the foliage is left intact on the\nouter edge of the new, smaller canopy ideally, pruning cuts\nshould not be evident when you stand back from the tree after pruning.\nTopping, shearing, tipping, and rounding over are not\nappropriate techniques for reducing the size of the tree because they\ncompromise the tree's structure and can cause decay.\n\nWe would recommend when removing more than 30% of the foliage, that you\nconsider dividing the job into 2 sessions, around\n12 months apart to minimize sprouting and starch removal from the tree.\n\nTo reduce the size of a tree with drop-crotch cuts, we shorten the branches\nthat extend beyond surrounding branches.\nThis maintains the approximate original shape of the tree. The tree is\nsimply made smaller. The longest portion of the main\nbranches will be cut back to an existing,\nsmaller lateral branch that is large enough to assume the role of the\nbranch.\nThis is normally 1/3 to 1/2 the diameter of the removed branch. Excessive\nsprouting accompanied by die back or decay often occurs\nif you cut back to a branch that is too small. It\nis unreasonable to expect more than about a 15-20 percent reduction in\nsize of\ncanopy from a properly executed crown reduction. This is a time consuming\ntechnique and is more an art than a science.\nOur professional arborists are proficient at this technique and can take\nan ordinary tree and create a unique specimen.\nIt requires substantial talent to perform this operation; of course this\nis a temporary measure because the tree will quickly revert to its natural size. Crown reduction is\nquoted as percentage of leaf space not volume or height."

      "text": "I have a 10-year-old brown turkey fig tree. For the last four years, I have been bothered by leaves showing brown spots, including on the stems. The spots get larger, starting just before harvest time.\n\nI have been told by experts that the culprit might be a red rust, but not a soul in Placer or Sacramento knows for sure. I even sent samples to both counties.\n\nI went to the nursery and bought a product for treatment of red rust and a few other conditions. The product used was copper based; it hasn't helped.\n\nEach year, I mix about 10 gallons using the aforementioned product. I pour this on the ground in a 4-foot radius of the tree.\n\nI also spray the dormant tree about three times per year. I also pull back all groundcover around the tree. But still I see spots. Help!\n\n– Tom Walker, Roseville\n\nAccording to UC master gardener Carol Hunter, figs are a rewarding, easy-to-grow tree with few insect and disease issues. One possibility for your mystery sports is fig rust (Physopella fici), which produces light- orange spots only on the foliage. Those leaves eventually drop from the tree.\n\nAnother possible condition is fig mosaic, which is a virus. On leaves, mosaic spots are distinctly yellow, contrasting with normal green color of the foliage. The margins of the yellow spots blend gradually from a light-yellow color into the dark green of healthy tissue.\n\nThese spots may be uniformly scattered over the surface of the leaves or may appear as irregular patches of light green, diffused widely throughout the leaf blade.\n\nLater in the season, a rust-colored band develops along the border of the mosaic spots. This condition can be spread by cuttings and a mite.\n\nThe  website includes extensive information on figs, including cultural tips, and pests and disorders, along with photos.\n\nThe exact condition you describe with \"brown\" spots on fig leaves cannot be identified. Brown foliage may also be caused by improper watering (not enough) or overfertilizing, but those brown areas appear mostly on the leaf margins – not just spots.\n\nWe would be interested in knowing the name of the product that has been applied to the tree. That may have an effect, too.\n\nTo get a more precise diagnosis, bring samples of spot-free foliage, as well as foliage with spots and stems, to the Sacramento County UC Cooperative Extension office for an evaluation. The office is at 4145 Branch Center Road, Sacramento.\n\nHours are 9 a.m. to noon and 1 to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday"

      "text": "What to Plant for Arbor Day\n\nArbor Day has been a national holiday since the late 1800s. It all started in Nebraska by J. Sterling Morton when on the first Arbor Day more than one million trees were planted.\n\nWith the great diversity of trees and shrubs, it can be frustrating to figure out what to plant. For example, there are more than 200 species of oak, 200 species of elm, and 100 species of maple across the globe. So what should you plant?\n\nHow about native trees and shrubs? They are an excellent choice for Arbor Day. Native plants are easier to care for, are more hardy and disease resistant, and benefit wildlife. Listed below are a few native shrubs that are good for landscaping.\n\nChokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa) is a good cold hardy shrub. It produces a cluster of white flowers in the spring. The fruit is not only good for birds, but is also edible. Some say the juice adds a nice flavor in jelly. The leaves turn a nice red color in the fall.\n\nServiceberry (Amelanchier arborea) is a popular native for landscaping. The edible fruits also attract some unique and colorful birds like cardinals, waxwings, and orioles. The flower is a beautiful white.\n\nArrow Wood (Viburnum dentatum) procures its name from the Native Americans who would use the young stems to make arrows. The shrub is also considered medicinal. The flowers are white. It produces blue berries and yellow leaves for a good mix of color in the fall.\n\nFlowering Dogwood (Cornus florida ) is very popular for landscaping, but don't forget the other dogwoods. Red-osier (C. sericea) and silky dogwood (C. amomum) have red twigs that add color in the heart of winter. Over 30 species of birds are attracted to the fruits.\n\nWinterberry (Ilex verticillata) is one of the few hollies that grow this far north. The red berries attract over 40 species of birds. The berries however, are inedible to humans. Winterberry is dioecious, meaning that there are separate male and female shrubs. Male shrubs will not fruit. This is a good shrub to plant if deer and rabbit are a problem because these animals prefer to eat other plants.\n\nMost of these shrubs produce white flowers, while the redbud produces purple flowers. Shop around. Many nurseries have native shrubs and trees. It's best to double check the scientific names to make sure the species is really native. As an example, there are many species with the name burning bush, but only Euonymus atropurpureus is native to this area.\n\nGoing native is a good way to landscape and benefit our environment at the same time. Arbor Day is a good day to start"

      "text": "rate this answer\n\nSaturday - July 30, 2011\n\nQUESTION:\n\nis it OK to plant annuals (i.e. salvias, impatiens or dusty millers) around the base of a young oak tree (2-3 years old)?\n\nANSWER:\n\nSure, it's okay, but you need to remember that the health of your oak tree is your first consideration, as it is much more valuable than annual plants. First of all, don't do your planting too close to the trunk of the tree-a couple feet out in all directions would be about right. We assume you are planning to put in bedding plants; be careful digging them in because you don't want to destroy any tree roots. You might want to mulch the plants to help hold moisture in and, as it decomposes, it will add organic matter to the soil. Do not get the mulch up against the tree trunk, this will encourage insects and fungi.\n\nWe gave you the good news, here is the bad news. Oaks are not happy to have competition in their territory. Your annuals will probably be all right for a while, because oaks develop this dislike for competition as they get older and larger. Just about everyone knows you can't plant anything under a black walnut tree, because the tree emits juglones, which are substances that damage other plants around the tree. Oak trees don't do juglones, but they are capable of allelopathy, and the substance they emit can be in the soil, the roots, the bark or the fallen leaves. If the plants you put in refuse to prosper, we would recommend planting somewhere else. If you continue to fight the tree's animosity for competition, you will just be wasting resources, and could even damage the tree in the process.\n\nAnd, of course, as the tree grows larger, you need to consider the shade. Very few blooming plants will bloom well in shade.

      "text": "Lifestyles Photo Galleries\n\nQ. I have a question about grape vines. For the second year now my grape leaves have developed some sort of disease. By mid summer the leaves develop brown spots which eventually cover the entire leaf. Then it dries up and falls off. I have sprayed with a copper solution as well as with oil-based solutions. I have also removed all the diseased leaves which then generates new healthy growth. Nothing has worked. I have planted new vines across the yard, and this year I saw some brown spots on these plants as well. Is this a common ailment or is there a possible deficiency in the soil? You expertise would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA. There are many common foliar diseases of grapes, and I suspect that your plants have one or more of them. The only way to be sure exactly which disease your plants are battling is to send a tissue sample in to the folks at the Penn State Extension Service. You can contact them at 412-473-2540 to find out how to take and send a tissue sample.\n\nBut, regardless of exactly which disease is to blame for the defoliation of your grapes, there are several things you can do to stave off an onslaught during next year's growing season. First off, be sure your plants are properly pruned. In March, remove existing vines all the way back to their second growth node and dispose of them properly. Do not let them lie in the vineyard as they can serve as vectors to the disease organisms.\n\nSecondly, be on the lookout very early in the season for signs of fungal issues. Wet spring weather promotes these issues, and when these conditions are present, there's a good chance that fungal diseases will become problematic. Getting on a regular organic spay program early in the season is key to keeping fungal issues at bay. Though copper products are often recommended for this, I prefer using a biological fungicide based on Bacillus subtilis. One common brand is Serenade. It is available as a wetable powder and as a liquid and it works to kill a large number of common fungal organisms on fruits, vegetables and vine crops. The rate and frequency of application depends on the targeted fungal organism, but all are listed on the product's label.\n\nA few items to keep in mind:\n\n• Properly spaced plants are less prone to these issues as good air circulation allows the foliage to dry more quickly. Keep that in mind when siting any new plants.\n\n• Some grape varieties are more prone to certain diseases than others. Be sure to plant resistant varieties whenever possible. The extension service can provide a list of suggested varieties.\n\n• A summer pruning, timed when the fruits are about a quarter-inch across, also increases air circulation. To do this, remove any vines covering the developing fruit clusters, as well as those shooting up and away from the plant"

You are welcome to bring your hand saw, or chain saw if you wish.\n\nQ: How long does it take a tree to grow?\n\nA: The time varies depending on species and conditions. A good rule of thumb is that most species used as Christmas trees grow nearly a foot a year once they've established themselves as seedlings. So, most 6-7 foot trees are roughly 8-10 years old or so from seed. You can always find the age of your tree by counting the rings of the stump. Each ring is one year of growth.\n\nQ: What's the best kind of Christmas tree?\n\nA: This is another popular question, and our favorite answer is: whatever kind of tree you remember from when you were a little kid coming out to see what Santa left under it! A more serious answer depends on the kind of criteria you want to use to define 'best'. Since different criteria can lead to somewhat different answers, we've split those up into separate questions below.\n\nQ: What kind of tree holds its needles the best?\n\nA: A number of factors will ultimately interact to determine just how long your tree will 'hold' its needles. Species is a big part, but how long a tree was cut before being brought home, how warm and dry the room is in which the tree is kept, whether the tree gets a 'fresh cut' before going into the stand, whether the water level is allowed to drop below the bottom of the tree, and even things like the weather in the months prior to being cut, soil nutrition, and health of the tree can have an impact. As far as the species is concerned, however, true firs (Fraser/Canaan, Concolor, Grand, Noble, etc.) are known for their needle retention. Many of these species remain relatively fresh for up to four weeks after coming inside, and some even hold needles well without dropping after the tree begins to dry out. Douglas-fir, pines, and blue spruce are typically reliable for around three weeks. Norway spruce tend to have a somewhat shorter needle retention period, with 2-3 weeks being standard. Be sure to download and read our Tree Care Tips to get the best life out of your fresh Christmas tree!\n\nQ: What kind of tree smells the best?\n\nA: This question is another with a bit of a \"that depends\" kind of answer. There is, of course, a variety of scents across the range of species. Spruces tend to have a slightly more pungent scent, while Douglas-fir and Concolor fir have a scent that is almost citrusy. In general the most aromatic trees tend to be true firs (Balsam, Fraser/Canaan, Concolor, Grand, Noble), although there can be a great degree of variability from tree to tree even within any given species. One great irony is that some of the conditions that seem to enhance the smell of a tree are the same ones that decrease its needle retention: a warm, dry room, which causes the needles to transpire more rapidly, drying them out but also releasing more of the scent oils into the air. Some of the true fir species have resin 'blisters' along the bark of the trunk which, when popped with a thumbnail, can release a burst of scent. If the smell of the tree is critical, it might be worth picking up a natural fir-oil scent spray to occasionally give your tree a boost if its own natural scent seems to run short. One easy method to help decide what scent you like best is to pull a few needles off of the tree, then break them in half.\n\nQ: What kind of tree is best to hold heavy ornaments?\n\nA: The short answer to this question is: blue spruce!! Of course, the tradeoff is needles that are equally stiff and therefore can be painful (which may be good to keep pets away from the tree!). Spruces in general tend to have sturdier branches for holding ornaments. Several of the true firs run a close second: Fraser/Canaan fir, Balsam fir, Nordmann, and Noble fir can be good for all but the heaviest of ornaments. On the other extreme, Douglas-fir, pines, and Grand fir tend to have softer branches that will sag under the weight of heavier ornaments.\n\nQ: How do I know if my pre-cut tree is fresh?\n\nA: There are several possible tests to gauge the freshness of a pre-cut tree. It is important to recognize that how long a tree has been cut is not the only determining factor in how 'fresh' and healthy a cut tree may be. Certainly a tree that has been cut for many weeks and shipped thousands of miles would have undergone much more stress than a tree cut within a week or two and kept out in the cold and rain. The simplest way to get a rough sense of a tree's 'freshness' is to take a branch tip and bend it over on itself. If the branch bends without snapping, it is a good sign that the tree is fresh. (Of course, keep in mind that spruces in particular tend to have stiffer, woodier branches that could break even on a live tree in the field. But even in these cases, the break would not feel brittle.) In a similar fashion, reaching partway up a branch, and lightly gripping the branch and pulling out toward the tip can give a sense of whether the needles are brittle and dry. While a few loose needles could still come off even on a fresh tree, most needles should bend under the hand and spring back. A final rough test can come from lifting the tree. If a tree feels unnaturally light for its size, then it may be that much of the water has already been transpired out of the tree. This is not a failsafe test, because the diameter of the trunk can make a dry tree feel heavier (in the case of a thick trunk) or a fresh tree feel lighter (in the case of a narrow trunk). But the weight can be a rough guide.\n\nIf a tree has brown needles or is dropping needles in the tree's interior, that does not necessarily mean a tree is not fresh or is unhealthy. The further one goes from the tip of the branches, the more years the needles have been on the tree. And since those interior needles are shaded from sunlight by the more exterior needles, they no longer serve their purpose as effectively. Some species (white pines, e.g.) shed these older, interior needles regularly. Others might drop these needles in a harsher summer, even if the rest of the tree is entirely healthy. If a tree has interior needle shedding that is an issue, putting the tree on a shaker (available at our retail lot) is usually effective in removing most of the these needles so they won't fall out on your floor.\n\nQ: Does your farm have BIG trees?\n\nA: In our fields, the largest trees available for U-Cutting in 2012 are approximately 8-10 feet tall. There may be a hand full of larger trees, primarily at the Dey Road U-Cut lot. Trees that reach the upper end of that range tend to have been cut out the field before they get any larger. A revision of our pricing structure into size tiers, combined with having increased planting over the past several years will hopefully lead to more large trees in the fields in future years. But for the time being we seem to have something of a limit to how large our trees grow before they are cut.\n\nIn our fresh-cut retail lot, however, we have ordered Fraser Fir's that should be up to about 14 feet in height. These trees are brought in from a farm we work directly with in North Carolina with whom we have had a relationship with for 5 years to ensure that the trees are cut as late as possible for maximum freshness. Increased demand for the very large trees in recent years has made their availability more limited, and the prices rise, particularly for the tallest of trees. We do our best to secure our tall trees from farms where we can both be sure of the quality and freshness, and also offer the most reasonable prices. For exceptionally tall trees, we would need to make special orders in the late summer. We do accept early reservations on such trees, with a 50% deposit to guarantee the tree.\n\nAdditionally we will be hosting a Candy Cane hunt on Saturday Dec. 1 at 11am at the Cranbury Neck Road U-Cut.\n\nAnd finally, we will have free hot chocolate and coffee at our retail lot.\n\nQ. Every year when I get home my tree is too big for my house. How do I pick the right size tree?\n\nA. We suggest measuring the location in your home where your Christmas tree will be located, both width, and height of the ceilings. Trees always look smaller in the field than they really are. We also suggest bringing a tape measure to the field to ensure your tree is the size that you want/need.\n\nQ. How do I get to your farm?\n\nA. From Exit 8A of the NJ Turnpike- Bear right out of the tolls toward Rte. 535. At traffic light, turn left onto Rte. 535 S. Follow to third traffic light, and turn right onto Rte. 614 (Dey Rd.) West. Straight on 614 W 1.9 miles to U-Cut field or 3 miles to retail lot.\n\nFrom Rte. 1- Take Scudders Mill Rd. to the 5th traffic light. Turn left onto Dey Rd. The retail lot is just past the next light (about 3 miles) on the right. The U-Cut lot is another mile past the retail lot on the right."

      "text": "Buildings 2004-06-02\n\nSummary:\n\nGuidelines for planting trees and shrubs within limited common elements.\n\nBackground:\n\nI. One of the community's responsibilities is to define any restrictions on what individual households can do with their limited common elements or LCEs (our front and back yards), and then households are free to do as they please with their LCEs within that framework. The community has already defined the fence policy. The purpose of this policy is to address issues related to planting trees and shrubs.\n\nIII. Trees and shrubs also can cause controversy among neighbors who have differing priorities with regard to shade, landscape views, flower gardens, and other factors.\n\nIV. Digging holes for trees or shrubs can cause damage to in-ground infrastructure (e.g. - underground gas, electric and water lines). Tree and shrub roots can likewise impinge upon in-ground infrastructure over the long term. Branches can rub against the sides and roofs of buildings, causing damage or allowing easy access for wildlife into attic spaces.\n\nV. Our LCEs are small. For Buildings I-III and V-Xii, front LCEs extend out 12 feet (measured from the front door) and rear LCEs extend out 20 feet (measured from the back door). For the A units in Building IV, this situation is reversed (12 feet in back, 20 feet in front). Exact measurements can be verified on the Great Oak Master Plan. Any tree or shrub planted within an LCE will therefore always be within 10 to 20 feet of a building.\n\nProposal:\n\n(1) Households are free to plant trees and shrubs within their LCEs that have an expected maximum growth height of 20 feet high or less - without seeking approval from grounds committee - provided they follow the procedure outlined in (7) below.\n\n(2) All trees should be planted at least 10 feet away from the foundation of any building. Depending on expected size and growth form, shrubs should be planted at least 3-5 feet from the foundation of any building.\n\n(3) A household wishing to plant a tree or shrub in a Common Element (e.g. - in front of their unit but beyond the 12 foot LCE limit or elsewhere in a Common Element) must make a written proposal to the Grounds committee. In most cases, there should not be a problem with planting in the common land between a front LCE and the central asphalt walkway (where applicable - a few households do not have more than 12 feet in front). However, Grounds does need to evaluate each proposed location, especially to look at snow piling issues in the winter, underground utilities, potential root damage to concrete or asphalt, et cetera.\n\n(4) A household wishing to plant a tree or shrub within their LCE that is expected to grow greater than 20 feet high, must make a written proposal to the Grounds committee. Grounds will work with that household to figure out if the proposed plant is feasible in the desired location.\n\n(5) In keeping with community values and our existing landscape plans, Grounds recommends the selection of native tree and shrub species for the Great Oak landscape. The Natural Areas Preservation division of the City of Ann Arbor Parks and Recreation Department maintains a list of plants native to southeastern Michigan at:\n\n\n(6) Individual households are expected to prune their trees and shrubs (to keep branches from rubbing against buildings, to avoid introducing carpenter ants or other vermin into buildings, to prevent the accumulation of dead wood, etc). It is also expected that individual households will water and otherwise care for the trees and shrubs they plant. The community, however, ultimately is responsible for maintenance of our landscape. Therefore, Grounds reserves the right to notify households of any recommendations or plans to prune trees and shrubs, and to carry out pruning or other care of trees and shrubs if necessary.\n\n(7) Every household wishing to plant a tree or shrub should follow these steps:\n\n(a) Gather information about the expected final size, and any other properties, of the tree or shrub species in question.\n\n(b) Talk about your plans with your neighbors. Even a small tree or shrub may have some effect on a neighbor's yard - view, sun, etc. If you are not able to reach agreement with your neighbors about the tree, the Great Oak Conflict Resolution team is available to provide assistance.\n\n(c) Check the safety of the desired location. Depending on the size of the tree or shrub to be planted and how the hole is to be dug, it may be necessary to call Miss Dig (the Grounds committee recommends that planting holes be dug by hand). It is the household's responsibility to evaluate this aspect and take any needed action to make sure, to the degree possible, that the tree or shrub will not do damage to underground infrastructure during planting or after. NOTE: The community should soon have an \"as built\" diagram from the township, which is supposed to show the actual locations of all underground utilities.\n\n(d) Plant!\n\nPROS\n- Creates a process so households can plant trees and shrubs in their LCEs if they want to without any further process with grounds committee\n- May prevent the bad feelings that have happened at other cohousing communities when there was no agreement in place about dialogue with neighbors before trees were planted\n- May prevent utility accidents\n- May prevent some long term building damage\n\nCONS\n- Takes time to talk with neighbors\n- A particular type or location of a tree or shrub a household wanted might not always be approved by Grounds or be amenable to neighbors\n- Does not stipulate any big-picture oversight of what's being planted and where"

      "text": "Mulberry – April 2012\n\nMulberry (Morus)\n\nThis tree folk's fingers and lips are purple from researching the featured tree of the month. Mulberries are ripening right now and boy are they delicious. Mulberries are deciduous trees or tall shrubs with a lovely round crown. The leaves are broad oval or heart-shaped often with serrated margins and can be lobed or not. Two species of mulberry occur in central Texas: Morus microphylla, aka Mountain mulberry or Texas mulberry, and Morus rubra (Red mulberry). But to be quite honest, unless your looking at a really big shade tree (rubra has a short trunk and grows to 64 feet while microphylla stays a more diminutive size and is often multi-trunked) it is pretty difficult to distinguish between the two unless you're a botanist or a mulberry farmer. If you plant a mulberry on your property you'll want to choose a site away from buildings and walkways as the fruit are very messy and the roots shallow, which can cause problems with underground utilities. Mulberries are very popular with birds, children, and other wildlife. Some of my fondest memories are of scrambling up the lower branches of a large mulberry planted in an empty lot to gorge on the sweet purple fruits. Mulberry preserves are one of life's great pleasures. To harvest a nice crop lay a large sheet underneath the tree and send a young scamp up to bounce on the branches above or give it a good whack with a broom handle. The ripe fruit easily falls from the tree. Berries that are still red and tart are my favorite for eating out of hand."

It is suitable for growing a loose hedge or tall screen, but most people find that Willows are too vigorous & their shoots don't have enough side branches to make a \"proper\" hedge. If you need a normal hedge in wet soil, we recommend using dogwood plants.\n\nHistory & uses of Salix viminalis The Osier has been used widely for basket making from Europe to Asia. It is hard to tell where it originates from, because people were taking it with them as they moved around even before Roman times. It is sometimes called basket weaving willow because it is so useful for making wicker items. Osier willow has matted, fibrous roots, so it is often planted along riverbanks to help reduce soil erosion.\n\nGrowing Common Osier Willow plants: Common Osier Willow will grow well in most fertile, damp conditions as long as they aren't very acidic or very alkaline.

Throughout the seasons, evergreens lose moisture with the winter\nmonths being the most serious: the soils are frozen and the moisture is locked up. Often evergreens\nsuffer damage if they are planted too close to the onset of winter. The root systems need to be\nestablished for the evergreen to survive winter.\n\nWe recommend the use of anti-desiccant sprays as one method to help the evergreen survive the winter\nmonths.\n\nWhitney Cranshaw, Colorado State University, Bugwood.org\n\nAphid insects: This insect is often called a honey-dew. They secrete a sticky sap like liquid that will coat\nsidewalks, cars and patio furniture. The appearance of the insect is as a small, pearl shaped, soft bodied\nbug with two cornicles(the cornicles are wax secreting). When plants are infested with aphids the leaves\nwill yellow and often fall off the stems. The aphid collects in large numbers on the underside of leaves.\nOften a black sooty mold will develop on the stems of the plants. The plants affected include a wide\nvariety of plants native to the central Maryland area.\n\nUnited States National Collection of Scale Insects Photographs Archive, USDA Agricultural Research Service, Bugwood.org\n\nScale insects: Unfortunately there are many varieties of scale insects. Scale is generally found on\nhardwoods and conifers. Some varieties are easily detected while others require expert identification. If\nyou notice a sooty mold or ants on the tree (in large numbers), there is a possibility of an infection. Early\nleaf drop, dieback of newly formed terminals, leaves turning yellow or red or abnormal growth at the\npoint of the attack by the scale insect are clear signs. Heavy infestations will kill the tree.\n\nTerry Price,\nGeorgia Forestry Commission, \n\nAnthracnose: Dogwood trees in our area are highly susceptible to this disease. The first sign of\nanthracnose is spotting of the foliage in late spring and summer. Left unchecked, the dogwood will\ndevelop cankers on the branches. The cankers will girdle the tree and kill the dogwood. Most often this\ndisease is found nearby to heavily wooded areas.\n\nWhitney Cranshaw,\nColorado State University, Bugwood.org\n\nMites: The mites are not insects; they are spiders. They have eight legs and will usually be found on\nthe underside of the leaves. Mites attach themselves by means of sucking mouth parts. Often mites\nare found on small evergreens They tend to thrive when it is hot and dry. Once the mites are in large\nnumbers the damage can be seen easily as defoliation will occur quickly. Mites are one of more serious\nspiders, again they are not insects.\n\nLace bugs: Where and what you plant does make a difference. Lace bugs prefer azalea, rhododendron\nand Andromeda. They like their host plants to be in full sun if at all possible. Damage to azalea\nrhododendron is noticeably less when the plants are in more shade areas. A mature lace bug will be\nabout 3-4mm in length and will have wings that look lacey. The topsides of infected leaves will appear to have silver to yellow stippling while the underside of the leaf will black to brownish spots (looking\nsomething like a varnish). Lace bugs most be found early, there are not natural enemies to control the\npopulation.\n\nSteven Katovich,\nUSDA Forest Service, Bugwood.org\n\nTent caterpillars: A very interesting insect with a voracious appetite for the leaves of ornamentals. WE\nsee the 'tents' in early spring, especially along our highways. There can be thousands of the caterpillars\nin one clump. The caterpillars are bluish with a black head and a white strip down the center of the\nback. Defoliation will be the result. The defoliation will result in a weakened tree and will make the tree\nsusceptible to wood boring insects. The moths that result are chocolate brown with narrow white bands\non the wings. A heavily damaged will have lost most its leaves by mid-may. Without leaves the tree is\nunable to produce food and will die.\n\nKeith Weller, USDA Agricultural Research Service, Bugwood.org\n\nBorer insects: As a rule, borers only attack weakened trees (i.e.: a tree with heavy defoliation from tent\ncaterpillars) Trees in decline tend to produce chemicals that will attract the borer. In this case the best\ndefense is a healthy tree. A tree properly maintained, fertilized and pruned when appropriate, has a\nlesser chance of any borers invading.\n\nChris Evans, River to River CWMA, Bugwood.org\n\nHemlock Woolly adelgid: Hemlock's, left untreated, will die if there is an infection of the woolly\nadelgid. When a hemlock, generally a mature tree, has this insect there will a tell tale sign: the branches\nwill have what looks like an invasion of small cottony balls pasted to the underside of the twigs. This\ndisease is easily controlled: be on the lookout and call for professional help if you see \"cotton ball\" on\nthe Hemlock.\n\nWeevils: Near the top of the worst insect list sits the weevil! Weevils have an elongated head and have\na protruding curved snout that has the mouth parts and antenna. The weevil is nocturnal and cause\ndamage in two major ways: damage to leaves that looks like notches (caused by mature weevils) and\ndamage at or below the surface. At or below the surface the younger weevils, curved white legless grubs\nwill girdle the roots. Once the roots of a plant have been girdled the plant will die because the plant will\nnot be able to transport water.

      "text": "rate this answer\n\nFriday - January 02, 2009\n\nQUESTION:\n\nWhen and how should I transplant a 12' Texas persimmon? How much root ball do I need to get?\n\nANSWER:\n\nA mature Diospyros texana (Texas persimmon) ranges in size from 12 to 36' tall, which means you already have a pretty mature plant. The Texas persimmon is evergreen in USDA Hardiness Zones above Zone 8, so in Angleton, which is Zone 9, the tree should still have foliage on it. Nevertheless, at this time of year, it is at least somewhat dormant, so right now would be a good time to transplant it.\n\nFirst, prepare the hole you are going to transplant into. Do not dig up the tree until you have completed the preparation of the hole; you don't want the roots to dry out. The persimmon likes full sun, but can tolerate a little light shade. It is drought resistant, but needs very good drainage in the soil. We recommend choosing a good spot and digging a hole bigger than you think you will need. Mix some compost or other organic material with the native dirt. This will help to make nutrients available to the roots and keep them from standing in water, as the amended dirt will have better drainage.\n\nThe persimmon is rhizomatous, which means it has horizontal roots from which shoots grow up and roots grow down. Although our Native Plant Database names seeds as the propagation method, these rhizomes or roots also spread the tree, sometimes forming thickets. This About.com:Landscape article on Transplanting Trees and Shrubs gives good instructions for deciding on rootball size, cutting through roots that are beyond what you can manage, and transportation to the prepared hole. Because of its semi-dormancy and the rhizomes that make up its root system, it should be able to withstand this without too much damage. Once you have returned the amended soil to the hole and your tree is either supporting itself or staked upright, stick a hose in the soil and let water drip in slowly until water stands on the surface. If there is regular rainfall, you shouldn't have to repeat this more than once a week or so.\n\nIf the tree begins to show signs of stress, like wilting or loss of leaves, trim off about 1/4 to 1/3 of the foliage to compensate for the root loss below the ground. Make sure it is getting plenty of moisture. It can take up to 12 months for a tree to fully recover from transplanting, so be patient.\n\nFrom the Image GalleryEvergreen trees for Long Island, NY September 20, 2007 - I live on across from the water on the north shore of Long Island.

      "text": "Gardener, Spare That Tree (From Salt Damage)\n\nAnyone who walks to the bus stop or drives a car in the winter knows about the white rock-salt residue that coats boots and fenders. Rock salt is more than an eyesore and a potential corrosive, however; it is also dangerous to animals and potentially deadly to trees.\n\nThe salt, which is sprinkled on sidewalks, stairs and roads to melt ice and snow, can make dogs sick when they lick it off their feet, says to Dr. Gordon Robinson, director of the Henry Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital of the A.S.P.C.A in Manhattan. ''It's not poisonous,'' he said, ''but it can make them nauseous and they might vomit.''\n\nDr. Robinson says dogs are more at risk than cats because they tend to walk the same salted paths and streets that people use. He recommends washing a dog's paws if there is dried salt on them.\n\nLiterature from Bide-a-Wee, an animal association, suggests rubbing petroleum jelly on an animal's paws before a winter walk to protect its feet. The association advises owners to put the salve between the animal's toes and to consider having excess hair, which traps salt, trimmed.\n\nRock salt is even more dangerous to trees, shrubs and other plants than it is to animals. The major problem, horticulturists say, is chemical drought, which occurs when the salt filters down through the soil to the tree roots and dehydrates them.\n\n''When roots dry out, they're dead, and they don't grow back,'' said Barbara Eber-Schmid, who is the executive director of the New York City Tree Consortium, a private organization.''\n\nRock salt comes in the form of either sodium chloride or calcium chloride. The former is simple table salt and is the more dangerous of the two. Either can stunt growth or cause twig death or leaf scorch, which occurs when trees or shrubs absorb the chloride ions in the salt, which in turn accumulate in the leaves and turn them brown or black.\n\nMs. Eber-Schmid said rock-salt damage may not be evident until spring. She said each kind of tree has a different reaction to rock salt. ''One-time usage is too much for some trees, such as the pin oak,'' she said, ''and evergreens can suffer leaf scorch if salt is accidentally sprinkled on their branches.''\n\nThe Tree Consortium, whose aim is to educate New Yorkers about the value and care of street trees, has a few suggestions for preventing rock-salt dehydration. The first and simplest is to use urea pellets (a fertilizer made from cow urine), sand or cat litter instead of salt.\n\nEdmond Moulin, director of horticulture at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, suggested using sand, which the garden uses on its paths, or cat litter instead of anything with chemicals. He said sand provides good traction without damaging trees and plants. ''Use plain coarse construction sand,'' he said, ''not beach sand, which has salt in it.''\n\nResidents should clear plowed snow from the bases of trees because there is probably rock salt in it. They might also build protective barriers like tree pits or raised beds.\n\nMs. Eber-Schmid said watering is the only remedy if a tree or shrub has been exposed to rock salt. ''Try to water around trees any time it's above freezing outside to leach off the salt, to dissolve it,'' she said.\n\nBut she noted that it may be too late to save some trees damaged by chemical drought if there is a general drought. ''People are going to lose trees if they use salt in the winter and find that in the spring and summer they may not be able to water as much because of local prohibitions,'' she said."

Trees that have many trunks or branches that grow erect and close together to form a uniform, narrow crown are referred to as fastigiate trees. The two names are often inter-changed; however, fastigiate trees are usually created in nursery selection, while columnar trees can be mutations in nature from normal forms that occur naturally.\n\nColumnar or fastigiate trees make ideal candidates for landscape areas where space is restricted, such as parkways strips, the area between a street and sidewalk or driveway. Columnar trees often are recommended in parking lots, sidewalk planters or pits, smaller home landscapes, or near a corner of buildings or deck with a confined planting space where a conventional tree with wide-spreading branches would not be appropriate.\n\nThere are many trees with a columnar habit available.

A place where the male structures are vast in comparison to the petite & flushed female variety. But first, do you recognise this flower?\n\nClick on image for a larger view …\n\nYes, its a female Hazel (Corylus avellana) flower and that's the region I'm talking about the spring hedgerow.\n\nThe male flowers, that we often call catkins or lamb's tails are borne on the same tree as the females and are left to hang in the breeze, thereby distributing pollen on the wind.\n\nClick on image for a larger view …\n\nIt is normally February when the catkins open, they first formed back in October or November last year. The male catkins are typically 5cm long, possibly up to 10cm; yet the female flower is tiny with the crimson stamen measuring only 2 – 3 mm. Pollen, carried on the wind, lands on the sticky stamen & fertilises the flower. Note: Hazel is not self pollinating, pollen from a different Hazel tree must fall on the stamen for pollination to take place\n\nNut clusters will now form at the site of the female flower, ripening in autumn. These nuts are a valuable feed source for many creatures (ourselves included); indeed the hazel relies upon this fact so that animals like squirrels will collect, horde, & loose nuts. This disperses the Hazel's seed & helps to guarantee a new generation of Hazel trees.\n\nHazels are a member of the Betulaceae or Birch family. As well as producing edible nuts they have been used in various woodcrafts for many centuries. Wattle hurdles, Hazel walking sticks and Sheppard's crooks are a few of the uses. The nut shells have recently been discovered to contain useful anti-cancer drug components. Environmentally Hazels are known to be important members of British woodland, they support many lichens & fungi, their leaves are good food for deer and the nuts I've already mentioned.\n\nShare this:"

      "text": "nuts. Fagaceous leaves are often...\n\n.\n\nNatural rangeagus orientalis, the Oriental Beech, is a deciduous tree in the beech family Fagaceae. The natural range extends from southeast Bulgaria's Strandja mountain through northwest Turkey east to the Caucasus and Alborz Mountains of Iran. It is restricted to mountain forests, at 500-2,100 m altitude...\n\nforests, at 600-1,800 m altitude. Although often regarded as native in southern England, recent evidence suggests that it did not arrive in England until about 4000 BC, or 2,000 years afterfor food. The beech is classified as a native in the south of England and as a non-native in the north where it is often removed from 'native' woods. Localised pollen records have been recorded in the North of England from the Iron Age by Sir Harry Godwin. Changing climatic conditions may put beech populations in southern England under increased stress and while it may not be possible to maintain the current levels of beech in some sites it is thought that conditions for beech in north-west England will remain favourable or even improve. It is often planted in Britain capable of reaching heights of up to 49 m (160 ft) tall and 3 m (10 ft) trunk diameter, though more typically 25–35 m (80–115 ft) tall and up to 1.5 m (5 ft) trunk diameter. A 10-year-old sapling will stand about 4 m (13 ft) tall. It has a typical lifespan of 150 to 200 years, though sometimes up to 300 years.

It is the product of the ripened ovule of gymnosperm and angiosperm plants which occurs after fertilization and some growth within the mother plant15–20 mm long and 7–10 mm wide at the base; there are two nuts in each cupule, maturing in the autumn 5–6 months after pollination. Flower and seed production is particularly abundant in years following a hot, sunny and dry summer, though rarely for two years in a row. The nuts are an important food for Slightly toxic to humans if eaten in large quantities due to they contain, the nuts were nonetheless pressed to obtain an oil in 19th century England that was used for cooking and in lamps. They were also ground to make flour, which could be eaten after were leached out by soaking.\n\nHabitat\n\nClimate and temperatures vary, though humidity needs to be constant. Little is required of the soil so long as it is well drained. Though not demanding of its soil type, the European Beech has several significant requirements: a humid atmosphere (precipitation well distributed throughout the year and frequent fogs) and well drained soil (it can not handle excessive stagnant water). It prefers moderately fertile ground, calcified or lightly acidic, therefore it is found more often on the side of a hill than at the bottom of a clayey basin. It tolerates rigorous winter cold, but is sensitive to spring frost. InA beech forest is very dark and few species of plant are able to survive there, where the sun barely reaches the ground. Young beeches prefer some shade and may grow poorly in full sunlight. In a clear-cut forest a European Beech will germinate and then die of excessive dryness. Under with sparse leaf cover it will quickly surpass them in height and, due to the beech's dense foliage, the oaks will die from lack of sunlight. Foresters may assure the oaks' survival by cutting young beeches with a billhook 10 cm off the ground, which can produce magnificent.\n\nThe root system is shallow, even superficial, with large roots spreading out in all directions. European Beech forms ectomycorrhizas with a range of fungi including members of the genera Amanita\n\nAmanitaBoletus is a genus of mushroom, comprising over 100 species. The genus Boletus was originally broadly defined and described by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821, essentially containing all fungi with pores...\n\nCantharellus is a genus of popular edible mushrooms, commonly known as chanterelles . They are mycorrhizal fungi, meaning they form symbiotic associations with plants, making them very difficult to cultivate...\n\nHebeloma is a genus of fungi.

The genus, collectively known commonly as milk-caps, are characterized by the fact that they exude a milky fluid if cut or damaged...\n\n; these fungi are important in enhancing uptake of water and nutrients from the soil.\n\nIn the woodlands of southern Britain, beech is dominant over oak and elm south of a line from about north Suffolk across to Cardigan. Oak are the dominant forest trees north of this line. One of the most beautiful European Beech forests called Sonian Forest\n\nSonian Forest\n\nThe Sonian Forest is a forest that lies across the south-eastern part of Brussels, Belgium.The forest lies in the Flemish municipalities of Sint-Genesius-Rode, Hoeilaart, Overijse and Tervuren, in Uccle, Watermael-Boitsfort, Auderghem and Woluwe-Saint-Pierre in the Brussels-Capital Region and Beech is a dominant tree species in France and constitutes about 10% of French forests.\n\nPhenology\n\nSpring leaf budding by the European Beech is triggered by a combination of day length and temperature. Bud break each year is from the middle of April to the beginning of May, often with remarkable precision (within a few days). It is more precise in the north of its range than the south, and at 600 m than at sea level\n\nSea level\n\nMean sea level is a measure of the average height of the ocean's surface ; used as a standard in reckoning land elevation...\n\n.\n\nThe European Beech invests significantly in summer and autumn for the following spring. Conditions in summer, particularly good rainfall, determine the number of leaves included in the buds. In autumn, the tree builds the reserves that will sustain it into spring. Given good conditions, a bud can produce a shoot with up to ten or more leaves. The terminal bud emits a hormonal substance in the spring that halts the development of additional buds. This tendency, though very strong at the beginning of their existence, becomes weaker in older trees.\n\nIt is only after the budding that root growth of the year begins. The first roots to appear are very thin (with a diameter of less than 0.5 mm). Later, after a wave of above ground growth, thicker roots grow in a steady fashion.\n\nUses\n\nA park is a protected area, in its natural or semi-natural state, or planted, and set aside for human recreation and enjoyment, or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats. It may consist of rocks, soil, water, flora and fauna is frequently kept clipped to make attractive hedges. Since the early nineteenth century there have been a large number of ornamental European Beech made by horticultural selection, often repeatedly; they include:\n\nCopper Beech or Purple Beech (Fagus sylvatica Purpurea Group) - leaves purple, in many selections turning deep spinach green by mid-summer. In the United States Charles Sprague Sargent noted the earliest appearance in a nurseryman's catalogue in 1820, but in 1859 \"the finest Copper Beech in America... more than fifty feet high\" was noted in the grounds of Thomas Ash, Esq., Throgs Neck, New York; it must have been more than forty years old at the time.of the European Beech is used in the manufacture of numerous objects and implements. Its fine and short grain makes it an easy wood to work with, easy to soak, dye (except its heartwood), varnish and glue. Steaming makes the wood even easier to machine. It has an excellent finish and is resistant to compression and splitting. Milling is sometimes difficult due to cracking and it is stiff when flexed. The density of the wood is 720 kg per cubic meter. It is particularly well suited for minor carpentry, particularly furniture. From chairs to parquetry (flooring) and staircases, the European Beech can do almost anything other than heavy structural support, so long as it is not left outdoors. Its hardness make it ideal for making woodenA workbench is sturdy table at which manual work is done. They range from simple flat surfaces to very complex designs that may be considered tools in themselves. Workbenches vary in size from tiny jewelers benches to the huge benches used by staircase makers...\n\ntops. The wood of the European Beech rots easily if it is not protected by a tar based on a distillate of its own bark (as used in railway sleepers). It is better for paper pulp than many other broadleaved trees though is only sometimes used for this. The code for its use in Europe is FASY (like FAgus SYlvatica). Common beech is also considered one of the best fire woods for fireplaces.\n\nPrimary Product AM 01, a smoke flavouring, is produced from Fagus sylvatica L.\n\nThe fruit of beeches are edible and have a nutty flavour. However it is not recommended to eat too many because they contain low concentrations of Trimethylamine\n\nTrimethylamine, which is slightly toxic. Roasting both improves flavour and reduces the amount of Trimethylamine.\n\nPathogens\n\nBiscogniauxia nummularia is a plant pathogen in the Xylariaceae family, known as the Beech Tarcrust. The Latin 'nummus' meaning a coin, applied as the encrustations are often rounded and coin-like.-Views of the Beech Tarcrust:...\n\nis an Ascomycete primary pathogen of beech trees, causing strip-canker and wood rot. It can be found at all times of year and is not edible."

They are not prone to drying like other trees. They need basic pruning and to be repotted once they out grow their original pot.\n\nIn the forest, pine trees can grow well over 50 feet. They tend to be naturally straight and they are well suited as Bonsai trees. They are recommended for the formal upright Bonsai. The straight grows straight up from the base of the tree.\n\nMany people believe that Bonsai trees are dwarf varieties of natural trees. However, they are not. They are trained to be dwarfed by pruning and shaping but, they have the same traits as full grown trees.\n\nThe needles of the white pine are a very pretty blue that have a tendency to group together from a bud. The branches grow in a circular formation that resembles tiers when looking down.\n\nNew growth will make the tree look brighter and healthy. The needles will begin lengthening and will be brighter. You may want to prune or cut back the new growth as needed.\n\nIf you are considering repotting the tree you may want to wait until the fall. The summer heat may take a toll on the tree and it may die from the shock of a new environment.\n\nMake sure the tree is able to drain any excess water. Pines will die if they are over watered. It is best to use a mixture of soil, peat and sand in combination to build the foundation for the tree to grow.\n\nIf you do need to repot plan on cutting off less than a 1/3 rd of the root or the tree may become unstable. If you are repotting this is the time to trim the roots.\n\nIn the summer, it is not unusual to lose needles, the summer may dry the tree somewhat and consequently needles will dry up and fall.\n\nHowever, if the tree has large round circles of a dark growth this may mean that the tree has a disease. This may be cause for concern. If not, then you need not be concerned.\n\nYou may notice some bugs and other pests. If so, spray diluted dishwashing soap onto the tree to get rid of them. Make sure you spray clear water the next day to rinse off the needles.\n\nIt is best to water the tree every other day, and to make sure there is adequate drainage. The tree is likely to grow in the fall. You should feed the tree every three to five weeks depending on its appearance and how fast it is growing.\n\nBonsai Recommended Products\n\nBonsai News and Information\n\nBonsai Australia NewsSmall SUV key to Renault's big growth"

You can give your Milwaukee house the same relief by planting the right trees in the right places. Trees can be used to shade your house and reduce your cooling costs. You can block up to 90% of solar radiation with a mature shade tree properly placed around your home.\n\nStudies done by the U.S. Department of Energy predicted the proper placement of even just three shade trees could save an average household $100-$250 a year in energy costs. Shading your roof and windows from solar heat with deciduous trees can decrease the amount of air conditioner use necessary to keep you comfortable throughout hot Wisconsin summers.\n\nPicking the Right Trees in Milwaukee\n\nDeciduous or shade trees can be used as natural air conditioners and save energy by shading houses and paved areas. Even smaller deciduous and shade trees and shrubs can serve as protection and insulation from the hot sun in the Wisconsin summer, and the cold winds in the Wisconsin winter (saving you heating costs as well).\n\nThe proper placement of your trees in Milwaukee is important to get the most energy saving out of them. It's best to place your Milwaukee trees on the south and west sides of your Milwaukee home or building. The sun's rays are the most intense on these sides. Plant deciduous trees with higher, wider crowns on the south side of your home to receive the maximum amount of roof shading. Use shorter crowned trees on the west side to protect your home from the lower afternoon sun angles.\n\nSlow growing trees are the better option as they tend to live longer, and have stronger branches and deeper roots making them less likely to be damaged or fall during windstorms. Slow growing trees also are less affected by drought conditions in Wisconsin then fast growing trees tend to be.\n\nSmaller Milwaukee trees, shrubs, and plants can also help with your energy saving. Using these, you can shade the ground and pavement around your Milwaukee home, reducing the heat radiation and cooling the air before it reaches your windows and walls. You can use a row of shrubs or a larger bush to shade your patio or driveway for some relief from the summer heat as well.\n\nPlanting the right Milwaukee trees and proper tree maintenance can also raise the value of your property. Studies have proven you can raise your home premium by up to 5% with good landscaping, and healthy trees with proper Milwaukee tree maintenance.\n\nProfessional Tree Care Specialists\n\nThe best way to ensure your successful energy saving with trees is to have a professional Milwaukee arborist work with you and properly assess your Milwaukee landscape to determine the best trees and placement. Buckley Tree Service, your local Milwaukee arborist, will assist you in choosing the proper trees, proper location for planting your trees, and any Milwaukee tree care services you may need throughout the life of your energy saving tree.

      "text": "With the early spring and warm weather in the area, many people are getting a head start on yard work. But those with oak trees should avoid trimming them to keep a deadly disease from spreading.\n\nOak wilt, fatal to the trees, is a concern earlier than normal this year due to the unseasonably warm weather. Typically the season to avoid oak tree trimming starts in April.\n\n\"But because of our early spring, I would not trim an oak tree right now,\" said Tom Bakke with Red Wing public works.\n\nBakke likened the oak wilt disease to an infection, and the fungus that causes it to a foreign body in the tree.\n\n\"Its reaction to this is to completely shut off its capillary system,\" he said. \"It's basically starving itself to death from nutrients and water.\"\n\nRed oaks are especially susceptible, though other varieties can be affected as well, Bakke said.\n\n\"White oaks have a better system,\" he said. \"A white oak might actually live through it, while a red oak doesn't have a prayer.\"\n\nThe disease typically starts at the top of the tree and works its way down. It is evident in signs such as the leaves turning brown at the tips, wilting and falling off.\n\nThere are two main ways the disease spreads. Certain beetles that feed on the tree sap can carry fungus spores from tree to tree as they start to awake and travel.\n\nThe other and more common way is underground. Oak tree roots tend to grow into one another and fuse, or graft, together. The disease can then move among trees through these \"root grafts.\"\n\n\"This is why this is such a devastating disease in the forest areas, because it can wipe out all the red oaks,\" he said.\n\nAvoid trimming trees to bring out the sap that attracts beetles.\n\nAnything that opens the tree, from sawing branches to attaching a birdfeeder, can present a danger.\n\nThe beetles can infect the tree upon contact, Bakke said.\n\nHe suggested waiting at least until fall to trim trees, but said winter is best for any pruning, and not just for oaks.\n\nIf branches break off, such as during a storm, paint the open area with latex-based paint to seal it off, Bakke suggested.\n\nOnce a tree gets the oak wilt disease, there isn't much to be done, he said. But to prevent the disease from moving on to other victims, people can break up the root grafts around the infected tree and farther out.\n\nUsing a spade or trencher deep underground to break up the roots will help stop the spread, Bakke said. Even if it is successful, do it again every few years to keep the roots from rejoining others, he added.\n\nOak wilt is present throughout Minnesota, including this area, Bakke said. Wisconsin officials also have warned the disease is a problem there as well.\n\nThe disease has been around for a while, Bakke said, so a lot of information is available. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and University of Minnesota, among others, have resources on oak wilt."

      "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nIs espalier a recent gardening development?\n\nA fig tree growing in one plane can be seen painted on the wall of an Egyptian tomb. This may be the oldest evidence of espalier according to Alan Edmunds, author of Espalier Fruit Trees: Their History and Culture (n.d.) Historians note that fruit trees in the 16th century were trained in France to grow next to walls to take advantage of the extra warmth of the wall. The French word \"espalier\" can be traced back to the Italian \"spalliera,\" referring to a support for the shoulder or back, likely referencing the shoulder-height trellis upon which the plants were trained.\n\nWhich president of the US included espalier in their kitchen garden?\n\nEspalier came to the United Kingdom in the 17th century as a method to grow temperate fruits in a colder climate. By the mid-18th century, espaliers were a cardinal feature of European formal gardens, as seen at Versailles and Fontainebleau. The colonists brought the method to America. Espaliered plants were maintained at George Washington's estate, Mt. Vernon, as they still are now. The plant-shaping method called espalier has gone in and out of fashion for gardeners ever since.\n\nWhat is espalier?\n\nEspalier is a plant-shaping method to grow woody plants in one plane on a permanent framework, often in an artistic design. Woody plants are those that grow year after year above ground and have bark. In temperate climates, the espaliered plant is often fruit bearing, such as trees of apple, pear, plum, or cherry. But there are also Gingko espaliers, Magnolias in elegant forms, and evergreens in an espaliered trellis design.\n\nWhere can espaliers be grown?\n\nEspaliers can grow in any climate. Firethorn espaliers can be seen in the New Mexico desert climate as well as cherry espalier fans at the Chicago Botanic Garden. Virtually anywhere perennial plants can grow, so can espalier.\n\nEspaliers can be grown in large estates such as Versailles in France. Espaliers are seen at public gardens like Filoli in California. Small urban gardens show off espalier very well. Apartment and condominium dwellers grow espalier in containers on a permanent trellis; figs are a popular option.\n\nWho can grow espaliers?\n\nFrom novices to horticulture experts, anyone who likes a challenge can grow espalier. As long as a person has the humility to be a learner, the potential to be an espaliest is there.\n\nWhy bother with espalier?\n\nModern gardeners, especially urban and suburban gardeners, love the espalier plant-shaping method because it offers these gardening benefits:\n\nWhen growing your own fruit, you can get the most fruit possible from trees planted in small spaces.\n\nIn city gardening, even on rooftops, espaliers use every inch of space available.\n\nEspalier alleviates gardener boredom—it's challenging and rewarding.\n\nEspalier can extend the growing season by weeks by being in a protected location.\n\nFruit can be harvested several years sooner than is usual for fruit trees.\n\nEspalier is efficient—it casts little or no shade on surrounding plants.\n\nEspalier is beautiful—it softens the appearance of walls and can be a focal point of garden designs and views while it displays the finer details of plants: stems, bark texture and color, leaf shapes, flower, and fruit.\n\nThere is a year-round design effect.\n\nA quick, living fence can be established of espaliers as a privacy screen or as a backdrop for other plants.\n\nWhat are the special challenges of espalier?\n\nEach plant has an innate habit of growth: usual height, circumference, branch architecture to name a few attributes. Appreciating how a plant wants to grow and guiding it into a predetermined shape in one plane is the first challenge. But the larger issue is keeping the espalier branch design within its designed parameters as well as enjoying flower and fruit displays. Knowing when not to prune is as crucial as the reverse."

Much of the weight if the tree is water, so, just like a vase of roses, water is what it wants. A cut tree trunk will seal over within 6-12 hours or so, but with a \"fresh cut\" it will soak up water. Following the tips below will maintain that just-cut look, feel, and fragrance.\n\nIf you purchased your tree at a choose & cut farm, put it in water as soon as you get it home (your stand or a bucket). If you bought it from a retail store or tree lot, and did not get a fresh cut at the time of purchase, you should make a \"fresh cut\", then put the tree in water.\n\nTo make a fresh cut, just saw about one-half inch off the bottom of the trunk. Do not make an angled cut, or remove bark above the water line. The tree needs its outer bark layer to adequately drink water. Drilling a hole in the bottom of the trunk does not help it drink.\n\nUse a tree stand that is the appropriate size for your tree. There are many styles available, but things to look for are:\n\nhow much water does it hold?\n\nhow big is the opening for the trunk?\n\nhow stable does it seem to be?\n\nThese things become more important the larger your tree choice.(see Tall Tree Tips)\n\nAll Christmas tree varieties have a quantity of old, dry needles within the older branches of the tree. The bulk of these will fall off readily, and can be removed easily before you put the tree in its stand. Simply repeatedly drop the tree trunk on an outdoor surface until most of the needles have fallen. This will simplify cleanup during your holiday season. Fraser Firs needles rarely become dry enough to fall off throughout even a month of indoor display.\n\nIf you are not quite ready to set up your tree yet, you can store it for several days in a cool location, out of direct sunlight in a bucket that is kept full of water.\n\nLocation: avoid setting up your tree near heaters, any source of heat or flame, or in direct sunlight. Lower your room temperature during the holiday season. These precautions will slow the tree's drying process, and require less water.\n\nCurious children or pets can cause trouble. Keep these things in mind:\n\nSharp-needled species, such as many spruce varieties, discourage tender fingers or climbing cats\n\nuse unbreakable decorations within hand or paw reach - keep your precious ornaments up high\n\nsecure light and extension cords out of reach of small hands or tiny teeth\n\nWater, water, water... check the tree stand daily to be sure the water level is above the bottom of the trunk. Preservatives or other additives are not needed if your tree was given a fresh cut.\n\nLights: Older models of tree lights give off the most heat, and will dry out surrounding needles sooner than the more modern miniature lights. But for a great compormise, try the new LED tree lights! They come in 2 or 3 sizes, have a birght color display, and remain cool to the touch. They also claim to use 1/30th the amount of energy as miniature lights, saving you money as well. Whatever your choice, inspect light strings for damage, take care not to overload your eletrical outlets, and keep cords out of harm's way. Always unplug or turn off your decorative lights before leaving the house or going to bed.\n\nSigns of dryness:\n\nneedles fall off easily when you run your hand along a branch\n\na branch will snap like a dry twig\n\nLimbs will be droopy (esp in pines)\n\nHint: choosing a Fraser Fir will ensure the longest display time for your holiday decorating.

City trees are blooming and leafing out in parks and tree beds alike, bringing much-needed bursts of color to our landscape.\n\nNow is a great time to offer your trees a bit of tender loving care. There are several things you can do to help your tree out, especially in this unnaturally dry and warm spring we are experiencing.\n\nYoung street trees (those which have lived less than 5 years in a tree bed) are in the most danger of suffering from lack of water. Keeping the soil moist will ensure that tree roots grow downward and establish themselves in the tree beds.\n\nTo prepare the soil for watering, remove any remaining mulch which may have collected animal waste and other pollution throughout the winter. Remove any trash as well. Take a cultivator or other small gardening tool and loosen up the soil throughout the bed, being careful to watch for roots that may be just under the soil. Loosening the soil is an essential step to making sure the water stays in the tree bed and doesn't drain off into the sewer system.\n\nAdding compost to the tree bed will help the soil retain moisture and provide air space for tree roots to grow. Work no more than an inch or two of compost in first 2 inches of soil. Either vermicompost (from and indoor composting bin) or compost from an outdoor bin or garden store are great additions to a tree bed. If mulch is available, add 1-3 inches of mulch over the loosened soil, maintaining a space of 6 inches around the trunk of the tree free of mulch. The mulch will help retain water in the bed as well and prevent it from evaporating on warm, dry days.\n\nNow, the tree is ready to be watered! Young trees need 15-20 gallons of water a week, all at once. Slowly pour the water into the tree bed (or use a hose on a low-flow setting) until the bed is saturated. Pouring the water in the \"moat\" area near the trunk created by the mulch is one way to capture water in the tree bed. Let the water absorb into the soil before adding more to keep water from running off onto the street and sidewalk.\n\nExample of a tree bed moat\n\nSpring is also a great time to shape up your trees, literally. For decades, TreesNY has been training New Yorkers to safely (and legally) prune NYC street trees. Pruning helps keep trees healthy, safe, and beautiful. The Citizen Pruner course in Queens starts in May and takes place in Long Island City. To find out more and register, please visit treesny.org. If you have trees that need pruning on your block, you can also call TreesNY to alert Citizen Pruners in your neighborhood. If trees in your neighborhood are posing a danger, please submit a pruning request through 311.\n\nThe QBG Blogger could write a post with details about this new and very exciting program, but we'll defer to the expert — the program's coordinator, Maureen Regan. Check out the interview on New York 1 News, and be sure to stop by this Saturday's Open House from 10am to 2pm.\n\nSpring is in full bloom at QBG! This is the perfect time to enjoy all the beauty of the season, and there's no better place than right here!\n\nThe list of flowers in bloom is enormous but some highlights include crabapple and cherry trees, tulips, grape hyacinth, daffodils, magnolias, dogwoods and eastern redbuds.\n\nOur bees are…well, busy bees!

The disease has been found in landscapes, street plantings, and small woodlots throughout the eastern U.S. and as far west as Texas.\n\nAccording to Gould, BLS affects as many as 35 percent of susceptible street and landscape oaks in some central New Jersey communities. Current loss of value plus replacement costs for older trees affected by this disease is estimated at $8,000 per tree. Landowners and tree care professionals in these locations must plan for the loss of property values and high costs of replacement as shade trees in landscapes, wood lots, and golf courses affected by BLS decline and must be removed.\n\nBLS is caused by a bacterial pathogen, Xylella fastidiosa, which has a wide host range that includes common landscape ornamentals and weeds. X. fastidiosa is spread by insects, mainly sharpshooters.\n\nSymptoms of BLS are very similar to those caused by environmental stresses. Because of this, the disease is often overlooked or misdiagnosed. On oak trees, BLS symptoms include scorching in late summer or early fall on leaves of all ages at about the same time. On sycamores and elms, symptoms progress from older to younger leaves. Affected leaves may curl and drop prematurely, and as the disease progresses, branches die and the tree declines. Elms may be killed outright by the disease. Other affected species eventually decline to the point where the dead branches pose a safety risk and the tree must be removed.\n\nAccording to Gould, current management options of BLS in urban trees include:\n\nMaintain plant vigor. The development of BLS is enhanced by other diseases, insects, and environmental stresses such as drought. BLS may also predispose infected plants to other disease and insect problems.\n\nPractice sanitation. Branches that have died due to BLS should be routinely removed. Infected trees that are in a severe state of decline should also be removed.\n\nUse tolerant plants. In areas where BLS occurs, avoid planting highly susceptible trees, and design new tree plantings with a diverse complement of tree species.\n\nAPS is a non-profit, professional scientific organization. The research of the organization's 5,000 worldwide members advances the understanding of the science of plant pathology and its application to plant health.\n\nRelated Topics\n\nRelated Stories"

As the temperatures dropped in fall the focus changed to cleaning and prepping for winter. Now, you think to yourself, it is finally winter - time to relax! Well, not quite yet. Winter is the best time of year to prune woody plants such as trees and large bushes.\n\nIn winter trees enter their dormant phase. They are \"resting\" and little to no growth takes place. During this time traumatic effects of pruning are less likely to negatively impact your trees and shrubs. Sap loss is kept to a minimum while fungus and other bacteria - who may also be in a dormant phase - are less likely to attack the open wound on a pruned branch. Without leaves on the branches you will have a better concept of overall tree shape. The lack of leaves aids in exposing all branches increasing your ability to identify dead, weak, or congested branch areas.\n\nDead branches (branches with no leaves or buds and many times fungus growth and flaking bark) are the exception to winter or dormancy period pruning. Dead branches can, and should, be removed any time of year for arbor health and public safety.\n\nThe Conservancy Volunteer program does the majority of pruning in late fall, winter, and early spring.

The branches that can reach a little sun are blooming nicely. Would they survive being transplanted farther out into the yard, facing southeast, with no shade at all? If so, when should I transplant them, and should I prune them first? Thanks\n\nANSWER:\n\nThe first thing to do is choose your time. They should be transplanted (as should all woody plants) during the period of dormancy from about November to February, in this part of Texas. First, trim them down considerably. Some references we have seen have said they can be trimmed to the ground if they have been affected by frost, and will come back. We wouldn't advise trimming them back that far, but certainly a good portion of the top can be taken off. This will relieve the strain on the roots when they are moved, making it easier for the roots to get moisture and nutrients out to the remaining branches on the shrub. Since you have time before you will be making the move, you might spend some of it preparing the hole. Yellow Bells are very tough natives, and can take lots of different soils and are drought resistant. But any plant will do better with a little soil doctoring, especially in the area of drainage. This is a desert plant, and a heavy clay soil that holds moisture around the roots is not going to help the plant at all. Try digging out your hole and mixing in some organic material such as leaf mould or compost into the soil and returning it to the ground. Then mulch over the space with a shredded hardwood mulch. When you are ready to transplant the Tecoma stans, take out as large a root ball as you can handle, damaging as few roots as possible. Get it back into your prepared hole as quickly as possible, trying not to let the roots dry out. Return the prepared soil to the hole, and, again, mulch. The mulch will help to hold in moisture, protect the roots from heat and cold and, as it decomposes, add more organic material to improve the texture of the soil. Stick a hose down into this softened earth, and let the water dribble very slowly until you can see water on the surface.

A windbreak protects an area up to 10 times as far out as its height -- so a series of 30-foot-tall trees can shield a 300-foot-wide area. Dense windbreaks can cut wind speed by 85 percent. Together these two effects can cut your winter heating bills by 25 percent.\n\nPlace plantings, walls, or berms near -- but not against -- your home to create dead air space. This space acts as an insulator, slowing the escape of heat from your home.\n\nPlant deciduous trees, especially on the south side of a house. They can screen 70 to 90 percent of the hot summer sun yet allow breezes through. Deciduous trees also allow welcome winter sun to filter through the branches once they're bare. Deciduous vines serve the same purpose but, since they're smaller, do so to a lesser degree.\n\nCreate open lawn areas on the south side of your home. These green, open areas create an area for snow to accumulate. The light reflected off the snow and onto your house can offer a radiant heating effect.\n\nBuild a tall fence to slow winter winds. Not only will it lower heating bills, it will provide protection for less cold-hardy plants.\n\nTest Garden Tip: Semi-open fences that allow some air movement through them are the most effective. Solid fences divert air over them with too much force and create an effect like a wind tunnel.\n\nDesign stone or concrete surfaces around your home, such as a patio.

The Flowers are Catkins, produced in spring. The Fruit is a nut called an Acorn, borne in a cup-like structure known as a Cupule; each acorn contains one seed (rarely two or three) and takes 6–18 months to mature, depending on species. The Live oaks are distinguished for being Evergreen, but are not actually a distinct group and instead are dispersed across the genus.\n\nUses\n\nOak wood has a density of about 0.75 g/cm³, great strength and hardness, and is very resistant to insect and fungal attack because of its high Tannin content. It also has very attractive grain markings, particularly when Quartersawn. Wide, quarter-sawn boards of oak have been prized since the Middle Ages for use in interior paneling of prestigious buildings such as the debating chamber of the House of Commons in London, England, and in the construction of fine furniture. Oak wood, from Quercus robur and Quercus petraea, was used in Europe for the construction of Ships, especially naval men of war, until the 19th century, and was the principal timber used in the construction of European timber-framed buildings. Today oak Wood is still commonly used for Furniture making and flooring, timber frame buildings, and for veneer production. Barrels in which red Wines, Sherry, and spirits such as Brandy, Scotch whisky and Bourbon whiskey are aged are made from European and American oak. The use of oak in wine can add many different dimensions to wine based on the type and style of the oak. Oak barrels, which may be charred before use, contribute to the colour, taste, and aroma of the contents, imparting a desirable oaky Vanillin flavour to these drinks. The great dilemma for wine producers is to choose between French and American oakwoods. French oaks (Quercus robur, Q. petraea) give the wine greater refinement and are chosen for best wines since they increase the price compared to those aged in American oak wood. American oak contributes greater texture and resistance to ageing, but produces more violent wine bouquets. Oak wood chips are used for smoking fish, meat, Cheeses and other foods.\n\nJapanese oak is used in the making of professional drums from manufacturer Yamaha Drums. The higher density of oak gives the drum a brighter and louder tone compared to traditional drum materials such as Maple and Birch. The bark of Quercus suber, or Cork oak, is used to produce Wine stoppers (corks). This species grows in the Mediterranean Sea region, with Portugal, Spain, Algeria and Morocco producing most of the world's supply. Of the North American oaks, the Northern red oak Quercus rubra is the most prized of the red oak group for lumber, all of which is marketed as red oak regardless of the species of origin. It is not good for outdoor use due to its open capillaries. One can blow air through an end grain piece 10 inches long to make bubbles come out in a glass of water. These openings give fungus easy access when the finish deteriorates. The standard for the lumber of the white oak group – all of which is marketed as white oak – is the White Oak Quercus alba. White Oak is often used to make Wine barrels. The wood of the Deciduous Pedunculate Oak Quercus robur and Sessile Oak Quercus petraea accounts for most of the European oak production, but evergreen species, such as Holm oak Quercus ilex, and Cork oak Quercus suber also produce valuable timber. The Bark of the White Oak is dried and used in medical preparations. Oak bark is also rich in Tannin, and is used by tanners for Tanning Leather. In Korea, oak bark (Goolpy) is used for traditional roof construction. Acorns are used for making flour or roasted for acorn coffee. Oak Galls were used for centuries as the main ingredient in manuscript ink, harvested at a specific time of year.\n\nBiodiversity and ecology\n\nOaks are keystone species in a wide range of habitats from Mediterranean semi-desert to subt\n\nbt Many species of oaks are under threat of extinction in the wild, largely due to land use changes, livestock grazing and unsustainable harvesting. For example, over the past 200 years, large areas of oak forest in the highlands of Mexico, Central America and the northern Andes have been cleared for coffee plantations and cattle ranching. There is a continuing threat to these forests from exploitation for timber, fuelwood and charcoal . In the USA, entire oak ecosystems have declined due to a combination of factors still imperfectly known, but thought to include fire suppression, increased consumption of acorns by growing mammal populations, herbivory of seedlings, and introduced pests . In a recent survey, 78 wild oak species have been identified as being in danger of extinction, from a global total of over 500 species <ref>Oldfield, S. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Eastwood, A. (2007) The Red List of Oaks Flora &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Fauna International (FFI) and Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) ISBN: 9781 903703 25 0</ref>. The proportion under threat may be much higher in reality, as there is insufficient information about over 300 species, making it is near impossible to form any judgement of their status.\n\nDiseases and pests\n\nSudden Oak Death (Phytophthora ramorum) is a Water mould that can kill oaks within just a few weeks. Oak Wilt, caused by the fungus Ceratocystis fagacearum (a fungus closely related to Dutch Elm Disease), is also a lethal disease of some oaks, particularly the red oaks (the white oaks can be infected but generally live longer). Other dangers include wood-boring Beetles, as well as root Rot in older trees which may not be apparent on the outside, often being discovered only when the trees come down in a strong Gale. Oak apples are Galls on oaks made by the Gall wasp. The female kermes scale causes galls to grow on Kermes oak. Oaks are used as food plants by the Larvae of Lepidoptera (Butterfly and Moth) species such as the Gypsy Moth, Lymantria dispar, which can defoliate oak and other broadleaved tree species in North America.\n\nA considerable number of Galls are found on oak leaves, buds, flowers, roots, etc. Examples are Oak artichoke gall, Oak Marble gall, Oak apple gall, Knopper gall, and Spangle gall. A number of species of fungus cause Powdery mildew on oak species. In Europe the species Erysiphe alphitoides is the most common cause. A new and as yet little understood disease of mature oaks, Acute oak decline, has been reported in parts of the UK since 2009. Additionally, the Oak Processionary Moth (Thaumetopoea processionea) has become a serious threat in the UK since 2006. It defoliates the trees, and is hazardous to human health.\n\nToxicity\n\nThe leaves and acorns of the oak tree are poisonous to Cattle, Horses, Sheep, and Goats in large amounts due to the toxin Tannic acid, and cause kidney damage and Gastroenteritis. Additionally, once livestock have a taste for the leaves and acorns, they may seek them out. Symptoms of poisoning include lack of appetite, depression, constipation, diarrhea (which may contain blood), blood in urine, and colic. The exception to livestock and oak toxicity is the Domestic pig, which may be fed entirely on acorns in the right conditions, and has traditionally been pastured in oak woodlands (such as the Spanish Dehesa and the English system of Pannage) for hundreds of years. Acorns are also edible to humans in processed form, after leaching of the tanins. They are a staple part of the forage consumed by wildlife, including squirrels and jays."

The symptoms progress until the\ninfected shoots die and dry in a curled position often called a\n\"shepherd's crook\". When shoot, branch, or trunk tissue of infected\ntrees is dissected, the vascular ring and often much of the heartwood will\ndisplay dark discoloration.\nFoliar symptoms usually appear only on young trees (2nd to 4th leaf). Older\ntrees do not normally present symptoms of Verticillium wilt.\n\nThe causal fungus, Verticillium dahliae, survives from season to season in soil, debris of\nprevious, susceptible crops, and probably in the roots and lower trunk of\ninfected trees. Often the fungus can be isolated from living portions of\ninfected tissue year around in the Central Valley. Tree yields can be reduced\nby Verticillium even when foliar\nsymptoms are not readily apparent. Specific rootstock/scion varieties may vary\nin susceptibility and are not well known.\n\nOrchards can be adversely affected by the disease even when low\npathogen numbers in soil (2–3 propagules per gram) are present.\nVerticillium is very common when orchards are planted in soil formerly planted\nto susceptible row crops such as cotton, tomatoes, melons, etc. Avoid\ninterplanting young orchards with these susceptible crop plants.\n\nInoculum levels can be reduced by flooding in summer, solarizing\nthe soil, growing several seasons of grass rotational crops (especially rye or\nsudangrass), or a combination of these treatments. When replanting in an area\nwhere susceptible perennials were previously grown, try to remove as many roots\nof the previous crop as possible. Fumigating with chloropicrin* before planting\nwill reduce inoculum.\n\nSoil\nSolarization Preplant. Beginning in\nlate spring, cover the moistened soil with clear, UV-inhibited plastic\nsheeting.

      "text": "How to Care for Orange Trees\n\nOrange trees love warm weather. Under proper care, they can grow to a size of fifty feet, and yield delicious, juicy fruit. Here are some tips on how to maintain your own orange trees.\n\nChoose a tree that will grow well in your area: There are numerous varieties of orange trees that will do better or worse, depending on the climate they are grown in. Select a variety that will thrive in your home environment.\n\nOrange trees need high sunlight: Rule number one is to plant in an area where the tree will receive maximum light, unhindered by shade.\n\nDo not plant in soil that retains water: Orange trees will not do well with an overabundance of water. Plant in well-aerated non-alkaline soil.\n\nMulching will help growth: Mulching is a good idea as it provides good nutrients for the trees and helps water move through the soil. Place mulch around the base of the tree.\n\nOrange trees should not be pruned: While pruning can be a good thing in cultivating other types of fruit trees, pruning orange trees will only impede their natural development.\n\nConsider the nitrogen content of your fertilizer: Should you choose to fertilize your trees, be aware of the amount of nitrogen. A tree generally needs 1.5 pounds, and should only be fertilized 4-5 times over the course of its growth period.\n\nIn sudden temperature drops, protect the trees: Orange trees will die if the temperature drops too low. Thus if a sudden drop occurs, cover the base of the tree in plastic. Under sustained temperature drops, if possible, consider moving the tree indoors.\n\nJudge harvest time by the size and taste of the fruit: Oranges are not ready to be harvested until they are sufficiently mature and all trace of green coloring is gone. Taste them to be sure of proper sweetness."

It is important to not damage surrounding plantings or buildings.\nStump Grinding removes the stump and root of the trees to a depth of about 15 inches (37cm) by the use of a powerful machine with a high speed cutting wheel with tungsten carbide teeth. This allows for the planting of lawn or beds in that location.\nFruit Tree Pruning and training encourages higher quality and yield of fruit.\nPollarding removes all branches from the tree trunk.\nHedges of any height can be pruned as required, and should be maintained regularly, especially when adjoining neighbouring gardens. Unfortunately some varieties of hedging are allowed to become out of control and do not respond well to cutting back.\nDebris, clippings, branches, and timber can all be cleared where required. Likewise, upon request chippings may be used as groundcover, timber cut up as firewood, and small debris retained to encourage wildlife."

It is possible to receive a bird's nest from an undead tree. However, this nest will always be empty.\n\nWhen a player walks past an undead tree, the tree may attack them, inflicting a maximum of 32 life points. Players cannot retaliate against these trees, so it is best to simply run away. However, one can activate the Protect from Melee to completely block their attacks. This isn't necessary, though, as their attacks are fairly weak and the damage can easily be offset by cheap food such as trout.\n\nThe Witch in the Black Knights' Fortress says the trees' behaviours are due to the magical properties of the soil they grow in. The soil is also known for making the manor's cabbages tastier."

      "text": "Climatic and Soil Requirements. Pili thrives best in areas where rainfall\nis almost evenly distributed throughout the year and in sandy\nloam soil rich in organic matter and in volcanic soils. Being\na hardy tree, however it can also grow in marginal lands. It\ncan grow in steep hillsides and even under coconuts.\n\nPropagation. There are\ntwo ways of propagating pili seedlings, sexually or asexually\nsuch as marcotting, grafting and budding. Pili is generally propagated\nby seeds. It is a dilecious tree, meaning that the male and female\nflowers are not present in the same tree. The female productive\ntrees are only known at fruit-bearing age and the seeds from\nthe bearing trees will not necessarily be totally female.\n\nSeed propagation is being discouraged for the following reasons:\n\nBeing a dioecious specie, 50%\nof the resulting trees would turn out to be male\n\nThe long juvenile period of\nthe seedling trees and high degree of variability in many horticultural\ncharacters among seedling trees;\n\nPili seeds take an average\nof 57 days to germinate, about 70 days after sowing the seedling\nhas a pair of mature leaves\n\nAsexual propagation on the\nother hand is preferred because it ensures uniformity and true-to-type\ncharacters of the selection. It is early maturing 2-4 years.\nThis method also assures uniform plant structure to facilitate\ncultural management operations. It also enables planting of more\nproductive trees per hectare. Cleft grafting and inarching are\nrecommended for propagating pili asexually. Success ranges from\n50-85% depending o the physiological state of mother trees and\npropagators skill. Grafting operation is usually done in November\nto February Cleft grafting technique is now proven successful,\nrelatively easy and is gaining popularity for large-scale commercial\npropagation.\n\nPlanting. Plant seedlings\nwhen the diameter has attained the size of a pencil. Plant at\nleast two seedlings 30 to 40 cm apart per hill. Some male trees\nare needed as sources of pollen for pollination. Grafted plants/seedlings\nare planted in the field as soon as the first flush are matured.\nHardening of seedlings require at least three-to-six month period\nprior to planting.\n\nFertilizer Application.\nMost of the trees in Bicol are allowed to grow untended. Agriculturists,\nhowever, say that if the trees are given proper care and adequate\nfertilizer, faster growth and higher yields will be realized.\nApply about 100 to 15o grams of nitrogen fertilizer per hill\nat least twice a year after ring weeding within the first three\nyears after planting, and apply complete fertilizer (14-14-14)\nfrom the fourth year onward.\n\nPest and Diseases.\nThe most common pests are the twig borers (Niphonclea albata\nNews) and (Niphonoclea capito Pasc.) and gray mealy bugs (Ferrisia\nvirgata CK 11.). \"Tiyangaw\" a rice pest, was also observed.\nBorers hatch inside a stem eat anf grow there as caterpillars.\nThe presence of borers is indicated by the sudden wilting of\nplant tops. Pest attack can be controlled by spraying with insecticide.\nOccurrence of pest attack and diseases is negligible so as to\ncause concern.\n\nHarvesting. Harvesting\nis usually done during the months of May to October. The maturity\nindex for pili nut is the full purplish black pulp of the whole\nnut. Pili fruits in cluster do not mature at the same time. Therefore,\nharvest only the ripened fruits. Harvesting matured fruits is\ndone by priming or picking only the ripe fruits. A long pole,\na cutter or knife and a basket may be used.\n\nHarvested fruits are placed\nin baskets or sacks. If the pulp of the fruit is intended to\nbe sold for food purposes, harvesting is done late in the afternoon\nor early in the morning and placed in a well aerated container\nto prevent softening of the pulp.\n\nTo facilitate the gathering\nor collection and for high recovery of fallen fruits, the following\nstrategy can be done.\n\n1. Clean the area corresponding to the canopy of the tree\n2. Spread a straw mat or net around the tree"

      "text": "Cut Branches for Forcing. Your garden won't bloom in February (except perhaps witch hazel and Cornus mas) but you can enjoy spring blooms now by cutting branches to force. Choose from those plants that bloom early-forsythia, crabapple, quince and plums are all good candidates. Go out to cut midday, when sap has risen, not early in the morning as you would to cut flowers. Look for swollen buds on the branches. Now look at the tree or shrub as a whole and remember that as your cut you are also pruning. Take the cut branch inside and recut on an angle, place it in warm water as high up the branch as possible. After a few hours, cut the stem on an angle again and place in a vase of cool water. Blooms will last longest if kept in a cool room (under 65 degrees) and out of direct sunlight.\n\nSoftwood trees such as pines that have been bent over by the snow will right themselves with warmer weather.\n\nWinter Pruning and Clean-up. The storms we are all tired of have not only blanketed our area, but have also damaged more than a few trees and shrubs. While our perennials are protected from the cold by their blanket of snow, our woody plants need help. Begin your clean-up pruning as soon as you can safely work outdoors. Keep in mind that clean cuts heal faster, and with less chance of damage from disease or insects, than ragged tears.\n\nTrees and shrubs bent over from the weight of snow and ice should not be assumed to be permanently damaged. Many trees that are currently bent to the ground may surprise you with their ability to straighten when the weather warms and the sap rises within them. While the snow may not be deep in areas along the coast or on the Cape, in other places it has completely buried small, and not so small, shrubs. Do not try to dig the plant out. The chance of doing more damage with a shovel than is done by the snow is too great.\n\nHouseplants = Show Plants. With Blooms! at the Boston Flower & Garden Show only a little over a month away, start preparing your best houseplants to be entered in the amateur horticulture division. No pre-entry is required for most plants, but you need to get busy now. Read the Amateur Horticulture rules completely so you know what is required.\n\nBegin grooming your plants by carefully cutting any dead or damaged leaves as close to a healthy main stem or the soil level as possible. Old flower stems should be removed. Gently clean leaves with a wet cloth to remove any water or fertilizer spots. Leaf shine and other such products cannot be used on flower show entries. Your pot should be cleaned of dirt and salt stains. And remember that the container is there to hold the plant, not be an attraction or distraction from it. Continue caring for your plant, increasing your attention to grooming as March 14 approaches. No plant with any signs of disease or insects should ever be taken to a flower show.\n\nOn entry day, pack your plant carefully in a cardboard box, cushioned to protect it from sliding about as your drive to the show. Make certain your vehicle is warm before you put the plant inside and keep it covered until you are inside the Seaport World Trade Center. Entry day is March 14 from noon to 8 p.m. There's a convenient loop road that will take you around the building to a drop-off area that ensures your plants are never exposed to the elements.\n\nStaging for Blooms awaits a fresh coat of paint in a Mass Hort greenhouse\n\nIn Billerica, volunteers are sorting through pedestals, looking for the exact heights and shapes needed for floral and amateur horticulture competitions. In Norwood, prized plants are getting an early dose of food to spur leaf and flower growth for a window display. In Cohasset, designs are being sketched for a floral design competition and in Harvard, a photograph of a garden path is being mounted.\n\nAnd, if they're smart, across the region, people are looking in their Massachusetts Horticultural Society membership cards and saying, \"I think it's time to renew.\"\n\nMass Hort is about a lot more than tickets to the Boston Flower & Garden Show, but in the middle of The Winter That Would Not End, the promise of a day in March when the trees and shrubs are in full bloom and flowers are everywhere is a powerful lure to renew your membership. The rules are simple: if you haven't renewed as of March 4th, you won't receive tickets.\n\nMass Hort's part of the show, Blooms!, involves hundreds of volunteers with most of the work coming before the show's March 16 opening. And there is still ample time to participate. For example:\n\nNow is the time to start getting your houseplants into condition to enter the amateur horticulture competition. Last year's show demonstrated that placing your favorite specimens into the show is fast and easy. The Seaport World Trade Center is readily accessible by car and mass transit; knowledgeable volunteers do the rest.\n\nThere is still a pressing need for volunteers for Blooms! Can you help load or unload trucks? Can you help assemble exhibits? Move trees? Would you like to serve as a docent during the show? Mass Hort's volunteer coordinator, Vivien Bouffard, would love to hear from you. Contact her at\nThis e-mail address is being protected from spam bots, you need JavaScript enabled to view it\n\nMass Hort's Big Red Chair drew throngs to have their picture taken.\n\nMost of all, though, now is the time to make certain that you're on the membership rolls in time to receive your show tickets. Individual members receive one ticket, family memberships receive two (and the opportunity to purchase additional tickets at a discounted price); sustaining members receive four.\n\nYour membership will entitle you to a wealth of benefits throughout the year. Most of all, though, remaining a Mass Hort member gives you the knowledge that you're supporting an organization that is dedicated to educating people about gardening and horticulture, and creating the finest gardens in New England.\n\nSo, renew now.

And, what if you recreated not just one garden, but five? It would be, in short, an amazing sight.\n\nIt's also a sight you will see this year at the Massachusetts Horticultural Society's Blooms! amateur exhibit area, at the Boston Flower & Garden Show, beginning March 16 at the Seaport World Trade Center. Long a staple of the New England Spring Flower Show, the mini-gardens will make their appearance as part of the Amateur Horticulture division hosted by Mass Hort. They'll be located immediately adjacent to Mass Hort's garden. Just look for the big green chair.\n\nWarren Leach's and Debi Hogan's Chinese Scholar Garden\n\nSpearheading the effort to bring the mini-gardens to Blooms! are Debi Hogan and Warren Leach of Tranquil Lake Nursery in Rehoboth, Massachusetts. Warren and Debi provided a series of award winning miniature gardens for the New England Spring Flower Show. One, a recreation of a Chinese scholar garden, still ranks as one of the most memorable gardens to appear at that show.\n\n\"It's a combination of horticulture and artistry coupled with intricate design,\" says Debi. \"All three components have to work together to create a garden.\"\n\nWhile the same might be said of creating a full-size garden, scaling down a vista to one-twelfth its size also requires a considerable amount of wizardry. Many tree specimens have bonsai versions that can provide structure for a garden, but what about shrubs and small plants? For example, a rhododendron in a garden might be two feet high and three feet wide. Where do you find rhododendron two inches high and three inches wide? The answer: Andromeda polifolia 'Blue Ice', a miniature bog rosemary that is a dead ringer for a rhododendron.\n\nNeed a replica of an azalea? Try Erica carnea, a miniature heath. A climbing rose? There's a pichi plant out there called Fabiana imbricata 'Violaceae'. \"When you design miniature gardens as a hobby, you seek out such specimens and hoard them,\" Warren says. \"You never know when they're going to come in handy.\"\n\nFred Perry working on a\nFletcher Steele landscape\n\nGloria Freitas-Steidinger's\nNew England Mountain Landscape\n\nMary Holbrow's\nGarden in the Woods\n\nWith mini-gardens, there's even one more trick to fool the eye. A standard garden created for a flower show is designed to be seen from any angle. Mini-gardens are viewed through a window just shy of two feet wide and a little over a foot high. To create an added sense of perspective for the viewer, designer shift the scale of the garden from front to rear. Near the viewing port, the scale is one inch to one foot. The scale gradually shrinks toward the back of the garden. \"It makes a garden seem much deeper,\" Debi said. \"It adds to the sense of wonder.\"\n\nThe gardens are designed over a period of months. Entrants find stones of just the right size to accent their gardens, and pamper and force plants just as is done for traditional flower show gardens. Fresh plant material predominates in miniature gardens but some dried material is also permitted. The garden vignettes will be assembled at the show on Monday before the Wednesday opening.\n\n\"It's a pleasure watching people view the gardens,\" Debi says. \"Regardless of age, people press their faces up against the window, look for a very long time, then come away smiling. Those smiles make the effort all worthwhile.\"\n\nHave you picked out your Valentine's Day gift?\n\nValentine's Day is only a few days away. Have you picked a gift for your special someone? The most popular choices are flowers and chocolates. We won't be able to help you with the chocolates, but Mass Hort has a special gift membership offer that will provide the flowers!\n\nIf you order before February 10th, we'll send your loved one two items that will guarantee a smile - a $25 gift certificate to White Flower Farm and a ticket to the upcoming Boston Flower & Garden Show!\n\nThe White Flower Farm $25 gift certificate is perfect for people with a passion for plants and flowers. For over 60 years, White Flower Farm has been a premier source for plants, shrubs, bulbs, and gardening supplies in the New England area. Their beautiful catalog has a spectacular selection to choose from and all items may be ordered online or by phone.\n\nSecondly, you'll be sending your Valentine to the 2011 Boston Garden and Flower Show. This beloved Boston tradition will be held at the Seaport World Trade Center March 16th through March 20th. Beautiful garden exhibits, exquisite floral arrangements and stimulating lectures will all be part of the show.\n\nThere are many more benefits, too, including magazine subscriptions to Garden Design and Organic Gardening, 10% discounts at local garden centers and nurseries, and reciprocating garden privileges with gardens and arboreta through the United States.\n\nSPECIAL OFFER\n\nIt's a terrific gift. And, if the recipient has never been a Mass Hort member before, it's an even more attractively priced one. If you are a member and introduce someone new to the Society, we'll take $15 from the price of an individual or a family membership. That makes the gift of an individual membership just $35; a family membership just $70.\n\nPersonalize your order\n\nUse our order form to personalize your gift membership. We will then print your special message on the membership letter to your Valentine.\n\nYou may also order this gift membership by phone: 617-933-4963\n\nComing Soon to a Garden Near You\n\nThere may be three feet of snow on the ground, but in the Mass Hort greenhouse, spring is well underway.\n\nSeedlings growing in the Mass Hort greenhouses.\n\nHundreds of trays of seedlings are basking in an 85 degree, 100 percent humidity environment by day that cools to a comfortable 60 degrees at night. Fans keep the moist air gently moving. The seedlings are coddled by Master Gardeners and ruthlessly checked for bugs and weedy invaders.\n\nThere are primroses that will grace gardens in May and penstemon that will provide color this summer. Digitalis (foxglove) seedlings destined for the trial gardens are already several inches high. But it's the vegetables that are getting all of the attention this week.\n\nAs part of its garden exhibit at the Boston Flower & Garden Show next month, Mass Hort will show how to design and plant a vegetable garden. Visitors will see that garden in its late-May glory, which means an entire garden's worth of vegetables need to be in the same state as a home gardener would be in mid-April… minus the possibility of frost.\n\nThere are trays of a new red romaine lettuce called 'Outredgeous' that are just an inch or so high right now. Over the next two weeks, gardens curator and horticulturalist David Fiske will gingerly pry apart the seedlings into smaller clusters of lettuce. He and his staff of volunteers repeat the process with both 'Outredgeous' and other vegetables until they have created a wide row of the plant.\n\nWhy a garden at a flower show? It's a first peek at a program you'll be hearing much more about over the next several months. It's called 'garden to table' and it's about eating healthy. That health starts with fresh vegetables and Mass Hort wants to show you that a vegetable garden isn't something restricted to homeowners with acres of lands to devote to their efforts. Vegetables can come in a pot or a window sill; they can fit in compact spaces and still keep a family in food all summer.\n\nThe exhibit will show how to keep a garden free of interlopers and how a little ingenuity can let a gardener get a jump on the season.\n\nBut it all starts with seeds, and right now, those seedlings are well on their way to becoming something beautiful.\n\nBook Review: Gardening for a Lifetime\n\nby Betty Sanders\n\nSyndey Eddison's \"Gardening for a Lifetime\" conveys her love\nof her subject.\n\nWhen I saw that Sydney Eddison had written a book titled, \"Gardening for a Lifetime\", I immediately put it at the top of my Christmas list. She didn't disappoint. If you first encountered Ms. Eddison when she wrote \"Gardens to Go\" or you finally understood working with color in the garden after reading \"The Gardener's Palette\", you know she has the ability to convey her love of gardens and gardening along with the information you need.\n\nHer latest book is subtitled \"How to Garden Wiser as You Grow Older\". But if you are a young gardener with more desire than time or energy to garden, you will find your answers here. The conclusions she comes to and the solutions she recommends should not be saved for the 'older gardener'. They should be snatched up and relished by everyone who finds that family and work and even other hobbies means that the garden you want is not always the garden you can have. In my garden, I have slowly been coming to many of the same solutions - perennials beds give way to shrubs, for example - they both bloom, they both add beauty to my landscape, but the latter needs significantly less time to maintain.\n\nAccept change, she advocates, whether it be reducing the size of your garden or the way you garden. Many years ago, the rule was that a good garden required double digging, a back-breaking process of removing and replacing soil in order to add more organic material. Today soil scientists tell you that the process destroys the soils structure and disrupts the microscopic bacteria and fungi that make soil healthy. Double digging is out; top dressing with compost is in.\n\nHer other recommendations may at first seem to verge on heresy. Accept imperfections: nature isn't perfect; you shouldn't strive to be either. The American lawn is too much work for too little reward. Rethink why you want or need lawn. Embrace container gardens - they are easier to maintain and can offer you a chance to have a new garden each year. Relish shade and the reduced requirements for maintenance that can come with it.\n\nSydney Eddison has lectured written and gardened for many years. Now she is distilling what she has learned to help you do the same by making choices to turn gardening from a series of chores back to a source of joy.\n\nThe Huddled Masses\n\nby Neal Sanders\nLeaflet Contributor\n\nThey are camped out around my home, at least 80 refugees, far from their subtropical origins, gathered by windows and leaning toward a feeble sun for sustenance. They huddle together to preserve precious water in a house where the humidity is in single digits.\n\nWhat we do to our houseplants. We take growing things whose ancestors never experienced a frost and transport them to environments where, for six months of the year, all that separates them from death by frozen capillaries is a pane of glass. And all this for…. What?\n\nWhy do we have houseplants? I typed that question into Google, ordinarily a bastion of reason and well-marshaled information. The first response was a query right back at me: 'How can I get rid of gnats?' Not ready for a Socratic dialog so early in the morning, I declined to provide an answer. Five pages of scrolling later, I had not found any erudite answers from horticulturally-inclined sociologists, although I uncovered an online survey indicating that our 80+ population of plants puts us dangerously outside the bell curve (the average number is five).\n\nAnd so, I am left to come up with my own answers. The first one is obvious: they're green and they sometimes flower. It's February in New England. There is more than two feet of snow on the ground. Who wouldn't want to have something nearby that reminded us that winter is not a permanent condition?\n\nHuddled masses of plants\n\nAnother answer is that houseplants are undemanding. Water them once a week. Check them for insects (including, yes, gnats). Re-pot them once a year. Compared to a pet, they're self-sufficient. My aunt kept a snake plant (Sansevieria trifasciata) in a darkened hallway that, to the best of my knowledge, was never watered, only dusted occasionally. It lived for decades.\n\nPlants can surprise you. My wife received a lipstick plant (Aeschynanthus 'Rigel\") as part of a plant challenge. She nurtured it for three months but, once the challenge was over, put it in a plant rack where it was promptly forgotten about. This winter, it has started flowering. Not spectacularly and not prolifically. But every week another bright red bloom appears.\n\nPlants also respond to pampering. I cannot walk by a display of orchids without pouting like a six-year-old that \"I want one\". And so our home is filled with dendrobium and phalaenopsis specimens. They bloom for several months, then the flowers wilt and the stems turn brown. The plants go onto a lower rack away from the prime sun locations. Then, one day something magical happens: a new stem forms and, over the course of a month, bud nodes appear. The orchid gets tender, loving care: swabbed with alcohol to rid it of pests and placed in a location with perfect, filtered light. A few weeks later, the flowers begin to open.\n\nNeomarica blooms last a single day.\n\nFinally, plants get to become family. Last month I wrote about a cyclamen that has been around so long it is practically a family retainer. Our various bougainvillea have been in residence for so many years that I can predict their flowering cycles to within a few days. As this is written, the buds are starting to swell on our walking iris (neomarica), a plant that freeloads around the house for 50 weeks each year before earning its keep in a spectacular succession of blooms, each lasting just a single day.\n\nNeal Sanders is a frequent contributor to the Leaflet.

      "text": "Sunday - September 14, 2008\n\nQUESTION:\n\nWhen is the right time to prune my several mature cedar elm trees? I'm in San Antonio, and they have never been trimmed in the 55 years we have lived in this home. I have several that are at least 70 ft tall and they need cleaning up. I wouldn't want to harm them, though.\n\nANSWER:\n\nUlmus crassifolia (cedar elm) is a native North American deciduous tree which reach 50 to 90 feet in height with a spread of 40 to 60 feet. It would be a low maintenance shade and street tree except for its thin drooping branches which are somewhat susceptible to breakage at the crotches of major limbs. Some of this could be avoided by maintaining a regular pruning and training program in the early years after transplanting. For more information, see this USDA Forest Service website on Cedar Elm.Your elms have already had a pretty good life span, at 55+ years, and are at a height to be expected at their age. They have a fairly long life span, perhaps 150 to 300 years. So, at first glance, we could say your elms have been doing just fine, and need no trimming, etc.\n\nHowever, the main drawback to the elm is Dutch elm disease. Dutch elm disease was first discovered in Ohio in 1930. Spores of the disease are carried on the bodies of elm bark beetles and are deposited in tree wounds. The beetles, perhaps introduced accidentally from Asia, attacked trees that had not had a chance to develop a resistance to the disease over time. It is caused by a fungus transmitted by two species of bark beetles.\n\nAvoid pruning from April to August. The elm bark beetle is attracted to freshly cut elm and is most active during this period. Prune dead or dying branches from Fall to late Winter. We would urge you to engage a licensed arborist, for several reasons. They will be aware of the potential problems for the elm tree, and know when is the appropriate time for pruning. Also, they will have the equipment and expertise for dealing with such a large tree. Please don't climb up your trees with a chain saw. You will possibly damage a whole lot more than the tree.\n\nMore Pruning Questions\n\nExisting live oak taking over in Monahans TX March 22, 2011 - I have just purchased a home with a huge Live Oak tree in the front yard.

      "text": "We understand how\nimportant trees can be to homeowners and to communities. After all,\nwe're proud of our city as well.\n\nWhile we care for our\ngreen communities, the electric companies have an obligation to provide\nsafe, reliable electrical service. Their ability to do that is affected\nby the growth of trees that could pose a danger to the power lines and\nthe people they serve. That's why it is necessary for us to trim trees\nthat are too close to power lines.\n\nFor Your Safety… It\nprevents Electrocutions:\n\nWhen a\ntree or a large branch falls onto a power line, as sometimes happens\nduring storms, it can bring down the power line. If anyone touches a\ndowned power line that is still energized, the result can be serious\ninjury, even death.\n\nIn addition, because trees\nare full of sap, they are good conductors of electricity. Children can\nbe electrocuted if they touch a tree limb that is too close to a power\nline.\n\nIt Prevents\nFires:\n\nWhen a tree branch\ncontacts a power line, it can cause a fire.\n\nIt Prevents Power Outages:\n\nFallen trees can interrupt\npower to many customers. In some cases a tree can tear down the entire\nline and break the poles that hold the line in place. As well, a tree or\neven a branch that is merely in contact with the power line can cause a\npower outage.\n\nTree Trimming Techniques\n\nOur Tree Trimmers are\nProfessionals\n\nEach tree trimmer working\nfor Payne County Tree Service is an experienced, trained professional.\nTree trimming is carried out in the immediate vicinity of energized high\nvoltage power lines and only by qualified personnel.\n\nNever attempt to Prune\nTrees Yourself\n\nTrimming trees around\npower lines should only be attempted by trained professionals. Serious\ninjuries and even fatalities have occurred when untrained individuals\nattempt to do this work themselves.\n\nHow Much Will be cut from\nmy Trees?\n\nWhen pruning operations\nare performed, our trimming experts make every attempt to trim\nsufficient clearance so that the tree will remain safe until we return\non our next routine maintenance cycle. Our trimmers are trained in\nproper pruning techniques and do their best to redirect growth away from\nthe power lines while attempting to protect the health of the tree.\n\nTrees with trunks in close\nproximity to power lines require much heavier pruning than trees which\nare located a greater distance from the line. Sometimes large growing\ntrees close to power lines have to be pruned so severely that it becomes\nnecessary to take the tree down.\n\nKids and Electrical Safety\n\nElectrical\nsafety is a high priority. Nowhere is this more important than when it\ncomes to kids. Children do not always know, or remember, what can be\ndangerous, so it is up to the rest of us to watch out for their safety.\n\nThe number one safety rule\nfor anyone to remember is \"Don't come into contact with a power line or\nlet anything come into contact with it such as a tree limb, kite string\nor model airplane.\" Contact with a power line can be deadly!\n\nDon't build a tree house\nin trees near power lines, and be careful not to allow kids to climb\ntrees growing near power lines. Teach them to tell an adult if their\nkite becomes tangled in a power line or if they discover damaged or\ndowned lines in the area. Never attempt to touch an object tangled in a\npower line. Always call the power company for assistance.\n\nHow can you help\n\nSometimes\nour crews must make the difficult choice to severely prune or even\nremove a tree. All too often, the tree may have needed less pruning or\nwould not have had to be removed if it had only been planted a meter\nfurther away.\n\nWith proper planning, you\ncan have a variety of beautiful trees without having to worry about them\nconflicting with power lines in the future. When planting trees remember\nthe following:\n\n1. Visualize the tree at\nits full size height and width when preparing to plant.\n\n2. Avoid planting trees\nnear a power line.\n\n3. Plant large growing\ntrees in an area where they will maintain a safe distance from the\npower line when fully grown and be sure to allow for wind sway.\n\nAvoid planting trees near\nunderground power lines. If there are underground power lines on your\nproperty, be sure to call the power company before digging."

      "text": "Introduction\n\nFrangipani is well-known for its intensely fragrant, lovely, spiral-shaped, reddish blooms which appear at branch tips June through November. The tree itself is rather unusual in appearance; the 12 to 20-inch-long, coarse, deciduous leaves cluster only at the tips of the rough, blunt, sausage-like, thick, grey-green branches. Branches are upright and rather crowded on the trunk forming a vase or umbrella shape with age. They are rather soft and brittle and can break but are usually sturdy unless they are mechanically hit or disturbed. The crown loses its leaves for a short time during the winter displaying the coarse-textured, stubby branches. A milky sap is exuded from the branches when they are bruised or punctured.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nMiddle-aged Plumeria rubra: Frangipani\n\n[Click thumbnail to enlarge.]\n\nGeneral Information\n\nScientific name: Plumeria rubra\n\nPronunciation: ploo-MEER-ee-uh ROO-bruh\n\nCommon name(s): Frangipani\n\nFamily: Apocynaceae\n\nUSDA hardiness zones: 10B through 11 (Fig. 2)\n\nOrigin: not native to North America.Flower\n\nFruit\n\nFruit characteristics: does not attract wildlife; not showy; fruit/leaves not a litter problem\n\nTrunk and Branches\n\nTrunk/bark/branches: branches droop; not showy; can be trained to one trunk; thorns\n\nPruning requirement: needed for strong structure\n\nBreakage: susceptible to breakage\n\nCurrent year twig color: brown, green\n\nCurrent year twig thickness: very thick\n\nWood specific gravity: unknown\n\nCulture\n\nLight requirement: full sun, partial sun or partial shade\n\nSoil tolerances: clay; sand; loam; alkaline; acidic; well-drained\n\nDrought tolerance: high\n\nAerosol salt tolerance: high\n\nOther\n\nRoots: not a problem\n\nWinter interest: yes\n\nOutstanding tree: yes\n\nOzone sensitivity: unknown\n\nVerticillium wilt susceptibility: unknown\n\nPest resistance: resistant to pests/diseases\n\nFigure 3.\n\nFoliage\n\n[Click thumbnail to enlarge.]\n\nFigure 4.\n\nFlower\n\n[Click thumbnail to enlarge.]\n\nUse and Management\n\nFrangipani is very susceptible to freezing temperatures and should be adequately protected or planted only in areas which do not freeze in the winter. Plants will grow quickly in full sun on a variety of well-drained soils and is fairly drought and salt tolerant. Reaching a height of 20 to 25 feet with an equal spread, Frangipani works well as a freestanding specimen, a patio tree, or as part of a shrubbery border. It displays well in a front yard as an attention-grabber by the entrance. It can be grown with a single trunk or branched low to the ground into a multi-trunked specimen. Single-trunk specimens could be planted as median or street trees on 15 to 20-foot-centers.\n\nWhile Plumeria rubra produces red-toned flowers, other species offer a variety of colors. Plumeria alba has white flowers. Plumeria obtusa has white blooms centered in yellow and is variable in form and color. There are other species and cultivars.\n\nPropagation is by cuttings. Large hardwood cuttings should be allowed to dry several days while leafy tip cuttings should be planted immediately. Plants flower at an early age.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1.\n\nThis document is ENH650"

And there are leaf\ntrees that don't shed.\n\nI've taken one more liberty, in that I've lumped douglas\nfir into the other firs. Many of the readily visible\nfeatures are similar, and there's only the one I can grow here.\n\nFirs and spruces have classic Christmas tree shapes.\nIn an open space they\nremain more or less a cone all their life. Branching is\ndense. They basically\nblock out most of that cone shape. Shade underneath is\ndark to the point that\nvery little will grow unless lower branches are pruned away.\n\nPines and larches are more open. There is more twig, less\nneedle. The shade\nunderneath is open enough to support a lawn with a bit of\nhelp. Both groups\ntend to shed lower branches as they get older. Both are\nsymmetrical in youth\nbut get a bit more irregular as they get older.\n\nLodgepole Pine in our front yard.\n\nPines\n\nPines are characterized by an open structure. Needles stay\non for 3 to 6\nyears. Meanwhile the twigs get longer. The effect is a\nbouquet of bottle\nbrushes. Most pines are open enough that other plants can\ngrow in their shade.\nHowever the decomposing needles tend to make the soil\nacidic. If you\nwant a lawn underneath, apply a light dose of lime or\nbonemeal every year or\nso. Most pines prefer a well drained soil.\n\nMost pines are an loose cone when young. As they get older,\nthey get a little sloppy. (I can relate to that...) Some just get a bit\nrounder, with branches that aren't as straight. Others go all over\nthe place, and develop lots of character. Specific characteristics\nare noted by species.\n\nPines tend to drop their lower branches as they mature. In\nthe larger pines this lends them an air of majesty.\n\nWhite Spruce -- probably between twenty and thirty years old.\n\nSpruces\n\nSpruces have short needles, and the branches subdivide more\nclosely together\nthan the pines. The net effect is that a spruce is more\nsolid looking. You\ndon't see the bare twigs where previous needles have fallen.\n\nSpruce needles are stiff with very sharp tips.\nThink of them as the porcupine of the conifer world.\n\nThe underside of a large spruce is dim. Even if you prune\nthe lower branches\naway, very little will grow under a spruce. This is partly\ndue to the dim\nlight, partly due to the very dry conditions. Spruce tend\nto be water pigs. Their shape directs rain and snow away from the trunk.\n\nSpruce are tolerant of heavy soils.\n\nYoung Concolor Fir in my front yard.\n\nFirs\n\nFirs are noted for having soft needles. The true firs have\nneedles that are\nflat, and come on on either side of the twig. Some firs\nneedles that curl\nupward, giving the illusion that the needles are spread\naround the twig.\n\nDouglas fir shares the true fir's soft needles, but is\nactually a completely\ndifferent genus. It's needles circle the twig. Needles\ntend to be finer\nthan the true firs.\n\nFirs are just barely hardy here on the prairies. The only\nfir that is native\nhere, Balsam Fir, can be found only where it is protected\nand gets extra\nmoisture. I've found it on north running ravines draining\ninto the\nNorth Saskatchewan River.\n\nThey are beautiful trees, but require some extra protection\nand extra water.\n\nSiberian Larch in the pot yard.\n\nLarches\n\nLarches are unique. Nobody seems to be ambivalent about them.\nThey either love them or hate them.\nFor half the year they look like a dead Christmas Tree.\nThen they go through the routine of bud break, leafing (needling?) out,\nand in fall turning color, and shedding.\n\nMost of the conifers show relatively little change through\nthe year. Oh, some\nhave pale green buds. Others have interesting cones, but\nthe larch goes through\na whole range of changes much as leaf trees do."

      "text": "For thousands of years, man has practiced the art of tree and plant shaping. There are many methods for actively influencing a tree's growth, such as bonsai, topiary, espalier, pleaching, and grafting. Some of these methods may be used together to grow a living structure.\n\nBonsai\n\nBonsai is the art of the miniature landscape. The cultivation of plants in containers dates back to ancient Egypt, around 4000 B.C., where pictorial records show plants being grown in containers cut into rock. \"Bonsai,\" translated as \"tray planting\" in Japanese, is believed to have taken hold as an art form sometime between the 3rd century B.C. and the 8th century A.D in China, where it is known as \"Penjing.\" Bonsai was introduced to Japan around the beginning of the 13th century. Using a wide variety of techniques, such as leaf trimming, pruning, grafting, and defoliation, the bonsai artist is able to create miniature landscapes in a myriad of traditional styles.\n\nExample of multiple bonsai plants designed to resemble a forest. Image borrowed from \n\nTopiary\n\nTopiary is the art of sculpture, using living plant material – trees and shrubs, mostly – as the medium. Ancient writings show that the art of topiary has been practiced for over 2,000 years and dates to the Romans. The best plants for topiary are evergreen, with small, dense leaves, such as box, myrtle, or yew.\n\nTraditional topiaries have foliage trimmed into geometric shapes such as spheres, cubes, cones, pyramids, and obelisks. There was a decline in the popularity of the art throughout the 18th century, and when the topiary as an art form was revived in the 19th century, more sculptural forms appeared.\n\nEspalier\n\nEspalier is a horticultural technique of pruning and grafting used together to train trees to create two-dimensional forms with the branches. This technique was originally developed during the Middle Ages as a way to grow fruit trees within castle walls, without taking up space needed for other activities, and to add decoration to the walls.\n\nBecause these trees absorb as much sunlight as untrained trees, espaliers are ideal where there are issues of limited space. Espaliers are able to grow well in cooler climates which would otherwise prevent the same species from growing successfully in a non-espaliered form. Olives, figs, apples, and pears take particularly well to an espaliered form. There are many different traditional shapes for an espalier, such as horizontal, palmettes (also called fans), cordons, and Belgian fences, among others.\n\nHere are some sketches of traditional espalier patterns (images borrowed from \n\nHorizontal Cordon\n\nFan\n\nTriple-U\n\nBelgian Fence\n\nCandelabra\n\nPleaching\n\nPleaching is the art of training trees into a raised hedge, often in a two-dimensional, flat plane representation. This technique involves the weaving together of branches, in which the branches are wounded and bound together at the site of the join.\n\nEventually, the trees will grow together through inosculation, a naturally occurring phenomenon similar to grafting. From the late medieval times through the early 18th century, pleached allées of trees were very popular in European gardens. Trees with smooth bark, such as linden or sycamore trees were most commonly chosen for pleaching.\n\nGrafting\n\nGrafting is a horticultural technique of asexual propagation, in which the tissues of one plant are fused with those of another plant. The technique dates back 4,000 years to ancient China and Mesopotamia. Grafting is used on all different types of plants, with a variety of intentions – repair of damaged plants, hybridization, perpetuating clones, and optimizing pollination and cross-pollination, among others. There are many different approaches to grafting a plant, such as inlay grafting, budding, and stub grafting.\n\nAxel Erlandson was an American farmer, who utilized the technique of grafting to shape trees. He opened his Tree Circus in California in the spring of1947. Here are some of his creations:\n\nUsing Tree Shaping Techniques to Grow a Building\n\nFerdinand Ludwig, Oliver Storz, and Hannes Schwertfeger – three young German architects at the University of Stuttgart's Institute of Basics in Modern Architectural Design – have been experimenting with the concept of growing a building from willow trees, a process they call \"building botany.\" They have experimented with building smaller structures built from trees, and they have investigated the elasticity of these trees and how well they grow around steel pipe.\n\nThe architects start by building a conventional support structure out of steel, resembling a scaffold. Young willow trees, which are thin and are still flexible at a year old, are woven throughout the scaffolding. The minimum height for these trees at the beginning of the project is ten meters, or thirty-three feet. The trees are bent into the desired shape around the steel structure and are fastened into place. As the trees grow and become stronger, they will assume the load-bearing function of the scaffolding, and the steel frame members will be removed, upon inspection by a structural engineer. They expect the desired strength to be achieved over a few years' time.\n\nBecause the growth of the trees is restricted, the roots of the willow trees grow sideways into containers of soil. As the willows mature to a certain point, their roots are cut off, which will encourage the trees to grow into a single organism.\n\nThe structure of this living organism presents a different set of challenges. Metal fasteners used to secure the trees to the steel frame can obstruct the flow of sap. If this obstruction were allowed to persist, the trees would be strangled. Ludwig, Storz, and Schwertfeger have devised a system of \"sap bypasses\" of branches, in order to keep the botanical structure alive. They also must prune and otherwise maintain the structure in order to keep it from growing into unruly shrubbery.\n\nThe end goal of this endeavor is that when the willow trees achieve their full strength, the structure will be able to support an eight-meter, or twenty-six-foot, tall tower in South Germany. Once the living organism is able to assume the load-bearing function of the tower, floors and roofs may be added."

      "text": "This is the Trident Maple we repotted. It has been growing in pure turface.\n\nAs the your bonsai begin to break dormancy, the energy moves from the roots to the buds, and the buds begin to swell. Once the energy has been allocated you can cut the roots without removing the energy from the tree in the process. Yesterday we repotted a Trident Maple (Acer buergeranum).\n\nNotice how the bud at the tip of the branch is larger and further open than the rest. The tree is allocating more energy to this one!\n\nTrees do not allocate energy equally among all buds. The way that the energy is distributed depends on the amount of light that branches receive and the tree's natural growth habit. Bonsai are just trees, and this holds true for them as well! Buds that have been allocated more energy break sooner, swell larger, and will put out longer growth. You can use this knowledge to your advantage when training your tree.\n\nThe rootball of this bonsai. Notice how the roots have wrapped themselves in the shape of the pot. It's definitely due to be repotted!\n\nThe white fleshy roots are the ones that take up water, nutrients, and CO2.\n\nTo start we cut the wires that were anchoring the tree into the pot, and carefully pulled the rootball out of the pot so that we could assess the health of the tree. The tree had been growing in pure turface and put out many new white, fleshy roots. These types of roots are designed to pull nutrients from the substrate into the tree. The more of these types of roots that you have, the more water, CO2, and nutrients the tree can absorb. This particular Trident Maple had many roots, to the point where they were wrapping around the pot. Maples usually grow their new roots after the leaves are out, so it was not clear whether the roots had formed over the winter or in the prior year.\n\nThe mesh is anchored in place over the drainage holes, allowing water to drain while keeping the medium in the pot.\n\nAnchors are created from wire, which hold the mesh in place over the drainage holes.\n\nWe started by preparing the pot. Bonsai pots have large drainage holes in the bottom, much larger than the size of the particles. This is to provide ample drainage so that the tree does not have \"wet feet\". We need to keep the pot's ability to drain, while keeping the substrate from falling out the bottom of the pot. Here we are using black plastic mesh, cut down to a size slightly larger than the drainage holes.\n\nThe mesh needs to be slightly larger than the drainage holes so that the potting medium stays in the pot.\n\nThe finished anchor. Two are created, one for each drainage hole.\n\nAfter the anchor wire gets threaded through the mesh, it is placed in the pot.\n\nTo anchor the mesh, both ends of the wire are flattened against the bottom of the bonsai pot.\n\nTo keep the mesh in place we create a set of wire loops that get threaded through the mesh, and locked in place by bending the wire. Between the wire and the weight of the soil, it's enough to keep the holes locked in place.\n\nA course mix of lava and peanut shells is used. It will be porous and give the plant plenty of water and CO2.\n\nAll plants need a mixture of water, nutrients, and CO2. All three are taken up by the roots, but unless the water is moving (therefore oxygenated), the tree cannot absorb both its water and CO2 at the same time. Bonsai need a flush of water, followed by a flush of air. Too much time without water and the roots dry out and die. Too much time without air and the roots suffocate. It's a balance, and one that is easier maintained by using larger particles which are porous. We will be potting this Trident Maple into lava rock mixed with a little bit of peanut shells.\n\nWe use a root hook to loosen up the roots. The root hook is held very loosely and we're careful not to tear the roots.\n\nWe then started \"combing\" out the roots using a root hook. While we use the word \"combing\", the hook is held very loosely between two fingers. The idea is to loosen the roots gradually, not to rip them off of the tree. A two-pronged rake can make the job go twice as fast, but remember to pull carefully, not rip!\n\nA bonsai's roots can grow quite long! However, its energy is up in the buds so we can trim them back.\n\nWe use a sharp pair of shears to create a clean cut.\n\nWe try to take off 1/3 to 1/2 of the roots. Too little and the tree will be pot-bound too soon. Too much and the tree will not be able to support itself with resources.\n\nCombing roots is tiring! A double-prong hook does the job twice as fast.\n\nWhen a bonsai's roots wrap around the perimeter of the pot, they can be quite long! We want to remove enough of the roots so that new ones have room to grow, but not so much that the tree cannot support itself nutritionally. The rule of thumb is to only remove 1/3 to 1/2 of the tree's roots. We cut them with a pair of sharp bonsai shears. A sharp, clean cut will encourage the roots to branch out where they were cut.\n\nWe test the depth to make sure that the plant is not sitting too low or too high in the pot.\n\nThe tree is tested for planting debth. We want the soil line to approximately the same as it was before.\n\nWe wire a bonsai into the pot to make sure it doesn't shift in the wind or when being moved, which would damage the fleshy roots.\n\nThe wire needs to be long enough so that it can be wrapped over the top of the root ball and have both ends twisted together.\n\nThe depth is good so we run a length of wire through the mesh, from one drainage hole, across the outside bottom of the pot, and back up and out of the other drainage hole. This wire will anchor the bonsai in its pot, particularly important while the new roots are growing.\n\nWe fill the pot with our substrate. Too much is purposely added as it will settle into the pot once we use a chopstick.\n\nWe use a chopstick to settle the soil around the roots. The chopstick is inserted into the medium and rotated.\n\nWe place a small amount of the substrate on the bottom of the pot. This is where most of the water will be held naturally in the pot, and you don't want the area to dry too fast or too slow. The bonsai is placed in the pot, the anchor wire is run up through the rootball, and we fill the rest of the pot with our potting medium. A chopstick is used to settle the particles down around the roots. This is done to reduce the size of the airpockets, and increase contact of the roots with the substrate.\n\nThe wire is run beneath the nebari of this tree for aesthetics.\n\nA quarter-twist will lock our anchor wire tightly in place. This does not hurt the tree or interfere with its growth!\n\nWe then run the anchor wire across the top of the rootball and twist the two ends together. In this case, we run the wire beneath the nebari as to hide it. A final quarter-twist of the anchor wire underneath the pot pulls the anchor wire nice and tight.\n\nMycorrhiza are fungi that help other plants grow. They will often form naturally in a bonsai pot, but this just helps the process.\n\nWe only need a small amount of the Mycorrhiza to be effective.\n\nA small amount is sprinkled on the surface of the potting medium of the bonsai.\n\nA little bit of Mycorrhizal innoculant is added to the surface of the substrate. Mycorrhiza are a beneficial fungi that form a symbiotic relationship with other plants, including bonsai. These fungi allow the tree to absorb water and nutrients more efficiently and can commonly be seen among the roots of bonsai, especially pines!\n\nNow that the tree is repotted, we need to water it right away. Roots do not like being too dry for too long!\n\nThe finished job. This bonsai should be good for another two years before it has to be repotted again.\n\nFinally we water the tree well but with a fine spray as to not wash the Mycorrhiza away. This Trident Maple should be good for about two years in its new lava rock!\n\n]]> 2013 Workshop – Brush Cherry\n 03 Jan 2013 02:54:05 +0000admin is all about the details. It's the smallest details in a tree that give the most reward. Eugenia Myrtifolia (aka Brush Cherry) is full of little details that make a big impact. Take its small white powder-puff flowers, and follow them up with magenta cherries. If that isn't enough, there's the fiery red new growth against its shiny green leaves, perfectly sized for bonsai. Yes, Brush Cherry are quite a species for bonsai.\n\nBrush Cherry are one of the finest tropical bonsai you could ask for. They're maintainable at just about any size, from a few inches to a few feet. They will readily back-bud, produce heavy lower braches and trunk, have white flowers, and finally magenta fruit. This workshop will be held in our heated greenhouse, no need to worry about the cold! We'll provide you with all materials (plant, wire soil, pot) and tools can be used for free. We'll provide everything you need plus lecture/demo and instructional help!\n\n]]> Myrtifolia – Brush Cherry\n 17 Dec 2012 01:14:42 +0000admin their rough bark, naturally small leaves, and eagerness to back-bud, the Brush Cherry makes a great plant for bonsai. If these features are not enough to attract you, they also have a white flower and magenta fruit! They are a common landscape plant in Florida where they are sheared into formal, clean, shapes.\n\nBrush Cherry get a small magenta fruit following their white flowers.\n\nBrush Cherry have fruit about the size of a penny making them a perfect scale for bonsai.\n\nNatural Habitat\n\nThe Brush Cherry is a canopy-growing rainforest tree native to Australia. Their botanical name, Eugenia Myrtifolia reflects the fact that their leaves closely resemble those of Myrtle. In nature it is a tall growing, bushy tree. They have small shiny green leaves, white bowl-shaped powder-puff flowers, followed by a magenta cherry, which is commonly eaten in Australia.\n\nBrush Cherry As Bonsai\n\nHardiness\n\nAs a tropical tree they will not tolerate cold temperatures. Although, in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy our tropical greenhouse was without heat and did reach down around 40 degrees for a few nights, they survived undamaged while some other tropicals did display cold damage. Nevertheless, the trees will do better in warmer temperatures. They will do better outdoors in the summer months but will need to be brought indoors in the winter. As evergreens they will need bright light even in the winter months so make sure you have a bright window available.\n\nWater Requirements\n\nThe brush cherry has average water needs, but do not allow the soil to remain dry between watering! They will lose branches if left too dry for too long, and may or may not back-bud from that point. We have helped people whos trees had completely lost their leaves and many branches had died. By leaving the tree in the greenhouse on the heater it was able to be revived after several months without leaves, but there had been branch die-back. So best is to not let them dry out, but avoid sitting-water as well.\n\nFertilizer Requirements\n\nNo special requirements for these trees, just consistency. Any balanced fertilizer you have will work, as with any other bonsai.\n\nTransplanting / Repotting\n\nAs a tropical bonsai, the brush cherry should be transplanted when they are about to actively grow. This is usually in the early summer months. They do not form swelling buds like other plants to indicate new leaves forming, rather putting out tiny new leaves already open, ofen on new wood. Their roots can get quite long in a pot and can be cut back quite drastically under such scenarios, but should not be cut back by more than 1/2 under most conditions to play it safe.\n\nPruning and Styling\n\nThis Brush Cherry bonsai has been pruned aggressively and is already back-budding.\n\nBrush Cherry can be pruned aggressively and will back-bud on old wood quite readily.\n\nThis Brush Cherry has started back-budding on a trunk that's easily 20 years old.\n\nThey have a rough, crackled texture for their bark, which develops on their branches and roots alike.\n\nThe Brush Cherry develop a crackled bark on the roots, trunk, and branches.\n\nAs bonsai, the Brush Cherry will develop thick lower branches easily if allowed to grow, helped a lot by their tendency to back-bud. The Brush Cherry can be wired, but be careful bending branches as they have a tendency to snap if taken too far too soon once the new growth has hardened off. Although not as brittle as the glass-like branches of Japanese Maple, we have broken enough over the years to learn this lesson!\n\nBrush Cherry can take on many forms as bonsai. We have used them from informal uprights to cascades and windswepts. Their small leaves make them ideal for just about any size tree. Some of ours are over two feet tall, and others under half a foot.\n\nBoth the leaves and fruit of the Brush Cherry are perfectly sized for bonasi.\n\nAlthough they have a rich green color year-round, Brush Cherry also get a bright red new growth which can be ornamental and can be covered in white flowers in the summer.\n\nBrush cherry have a fiery red new growth which contrasts nicely with their rich green leaves.\n\nThis Brush Cherry bonsai is covered in white flowers.\n\nLight Requirements\n\nAs a tropical canopy tree, Brush Cherry prefer bright light. However, it's better to keep them humid as they are not well adapted to arid conditions such as a heavily heated room in mid-winter. This becomes less necessary as long as the roots are kept watered, as we have had sprouted Brush Cherry with their roots directly in the ground last months in the summer without watering. These plants had tapped directly into the underground water flow and were able to tolerate hot dry air as a result.\n\nPropagation\n\nAlthough they will grow from seed, we propogate Eugenia Myrtifolia from cuttings.\n\nBrush Cherry can be propagated by seed (there have been several growing directly from the stone floor in our greenhouse over the years) and do not require cold stratification to germinate. The method that we prefer is cuttings. A small amount of rooting hormone can help, as will misting of the cuttings to prevent drying out.\n\nPests For Brush Cherry\n\nYou can see the white aphid on the stem of this Brush Cherry bonsai.\n\nBrush Cherry can be affected by aphids, although not a favorite host of these insects. Scale can be a more frequent problem, and should be watched for in the winter months. Both can be easily controlled by spraying with Camelia Oil. We have never come across any diseases affecting these plants.\n\nSometimes when we import trees they have a rough time in transportation. With one batch of Ficus Retusa (Tiger Bark Ficus) we got about a month ago, the trees had been bare-rooted and de-foliated. In those situations all you can do is pot them up and wait to see what happens! We potted the tree in a mix of lava rock and fir bark. After about a month in the tree has leafed out quite nicely and is putting out new growth.\n\nIt was also a chance to see which branches had died. Once the tree is actively growing, if a branch has not leafed out then it's probably dead. A good final test is to try to break the branch. If it SNAPS and is dried out, it's dead. If it bends/breaks but doesn't snap, then it may be alive. Another test is to make a small scratch on the bark. If it's green underneath and not dried out, then the branch is probably alive.\n\nIf the branch is still alive, for (most) any tropical or deciduous tree you can cut it back to try to trigger new growth to break. If it's an evergreen conifer you're probably going to have to grow a new branch or wait for the tree to decide on its own.\n\nIn the case of ficus, they grow new branches very quickly and readily, even from old wood, as you can see from this video. The longest branches will have the most energy and become dominant. If that is not what you want, trim them back a bit to reduce their vigor!\n\n]]> The Hurricane & Preparing For Winter\n 26 Nov 2012 04:13:51 +0000admin that Hurricane Sandy has passed I wanted to let everyone know that Allshapes Bonsai is back open. Although we did lose one greenhouse in the back of the property, it could have been much worse, and the trees have been moved into the remaining greenhouses, so you may see some old juniper pre-bonsai that you haven't before! The wood slats that pin the plastic to the greenhouses had been popped off by the force of the winds and has since been replaced. We also lost power for almost two weeks. That isn't such a big deal for the hardy trees, which are all put away for the winter. However it did give some close calls for the tropicals. Luckily we were able to use a generator, and used it for the tropical bonsai each night. Major damage, despite temperatures down below 40 at one point, was prevented. One Brazilian Rain Tree and some of the Schefellera did sustain a bit of cold damage to the leaves but they will recover just fine.\n\nNow that Thanksgiving has passed it's time to get all of your bonsai into their winter storage locations if you haven't done so already! And if you have any questions about how to overwinter your trees, stop on in, we'll be here!\n\nWe are now taking reservations for studying bonsai with internationally known bonsai artist Graham Potter here at the nursery.\n\nGraham Potter is a highly acclaimed bonsai artist from the United Kingdom known for his skill in bonsai design and carving and he will be holding classes at the nursery October 21-23 2011. This is an all-day event from 9:00am to 5:00pm. The cost of attendance is $133 per-day and you can attend one or multiple days.\n\nHere's what you can expect: A critique of guest trees. Carving techniques for bonsai using power tools. The creation of deadwood using hand tools. The cultivation/styling and refinement of bonsai. Collecting, preparing and development of raw material. This is a bring-your-own-trees workshop and supplies can be purchased at the nursery. Space is limited to 6-8 people per-workshop, first-come-first-serve so call the nursery to reserve a spot.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to really improve your skills and to learn, don't miss out!\n\nAzalea are very popular in landscapes, although they do tend to be a favourite food among deer. The Japanese have a fondness of Azalea in their gardens, often hybridizing them and carefully manicuring the plants' growth to very exacting standards. They also make an excellent plant for bonsai due to their small leaves, attractive flowers, smooth bark, and ease of care.\n\nNatural Habitat\n\nAzalea are a broad-leaf evergreen found in deciduous forests of the north-east. They enjoy the early spring sun before the leaves of their canopy counterparts open. Once the canopy above is in full-leaf the azalea are shrouded in shade where they receive relief from the summer sun. The constant supply of oak leaves gives the Azalea an acidic mulch, keeping a rich loam that maintains even moisture.\n\nGrowth Habit\n\nTrunks\n\nAzalea are naturally a multi-trunked shrub to around 5 feet. Their Rhododendron cousins tend to grow much taller. Developing a single trunk of significant size takes a lot of time and a bit of luck.\n\nThe plants do back-bud readily on old wood and have a propensity to sucker from the base. The best way to develop a trunk is to keep pruning back the suckers to avoid multi-trunking and to allow as much top-growth on the single trunk as possible.\n\nBark\n\nThe bark of young wood is brown and flaky strips. As the plant matures, the bark becomes smooth, similar to that of a European Beech.\n\nThey do not heal-over particularly well and will leave attractive dimples where branches have been cut, giving the impression of age and adding character.\n\nDeadwood\n\nAzalea deadwood can be very attractive, particularly on trunks. While not as traditional as on Junipers, the effect can work quite well in bonsai.\n\nDead branches do not tend to look as attractive as trunks, giving the appearance of neglect rather than age.\n\nFlowers\n\n2011-06-04_13-33-33_378_0\n\nThe real draw of Azaleas are the flowers, and it is no different in bonsai cultivation. The flowers of Azaleas come in variations of every color of the rainbow except green and blue. Some have flowers with multiple colours in the same flower, or different solid-colored flowers on the same plant. Flowers can be single of double blossoms. The shapes and sizes also vary. The one thing that all azaleas seem to have in common is when they do flower, they get completely covered.\n\nLeaves\n\nThe leaves of azaleas are evergreen, about 1/4 inch oblong.\n\nThe leaf variations between species are slight, generally some being a bit rounder than others or a bit shinier. The leaves are a good size for bonsai purposes and will not increase or decrease in size with variations in care. The leaves may exhibit a red hue in autumn depending on the species, but the real show are the spring flowers.\n\nCaring For Azalea Bonsai\n\nLight\n\nAzalea are an under-growth, broad-leaf evergreen. As such, they are adapted to more shade than some other trees will tolerate. An azalea will tell you it's happy in its location based on the rich, shiny green color of its leaves.\n\nToo much sun (or too little fertilizer) and the leaves will start to fade into a yellow-green colour.\n\nWatering\n\nAzalea naturally grow in a rich, loamy soil of the forest floors. They are used to the acidic conditions created by oak leaves, and the consistent moisture ensured through a supply of leaf-litter. In bonsai culture, keep the soil evenly moist; avoid extremes of dry or wet.\n\nPruning\n\nAzaleas have a habit of thin, leggy shoots and a propensity to sucker at the base. Pruning of the foliage can be done at any time. Long shoots can be cut back to develop pads on branches. Shoots which are long and out of place should be cut so they conform to surrounding growth on the same branch (or pad). After flowering, seed heads should be removed to promote stronger new growth.\n\nFeeding\n\nFertilizing is good for promoting good plant health and colour. Use a general purpose (20-20-20) at ½ the manufacturers rate and feed every 2 or 3 weeks apart while the tree is actively growing. During the winter feeding is not necessary for the tree should be going dormant. Resume feeding when buds first appear in the spring. An acidic fertilizer may be beneficial but is not required.\n\nOver-Winter Care\n\nAzaleas are hardy to temperature zone 5. However your tree is in a container which now needs to be sheltered from extreme cold over the winter. Trees should be left outside to grow, this is where they do best. As the weather begins to change, leave trees outside till approximately Thanksgiving. At this time consider placing bonsai inside a garage or shed to over winter. The trees will be dormant and will not need light. Water the tree well and keep in a location in which it will not be forgotten. It's important not to let it dry out over the winter period. The tree should be moved back outside when the harsh weather breaks. Generally around March/April.\n\nPropagation\n\nAzaleas will readily produce roots on any branch that receives the consistent moisture of soil. Grafting is not done as there are no root stocks hardier than another. Plants can be easily air layered and cuttings can be taken, often just by sticking a branch in the ground in Spring or Fall without rooting hormone! Unless trying to create a new strain, Azaleas are rarely propagated by seed.\n\n]]> Inspiration From Youtube\n 25 Aug 2011 01:21:32 +0000admin are a few videos from Youtube with some amazing trees.

This current heatwave is brutal. Roots were not adapted to be exposed to 115 degree temperatures. A few feet below the surface the earth stays a comfortable, stable temperature year-round. So here are a few ways to keep your trees cool and growing:\n\nGive Your Bonsai A Bath\n\nDuring this extreme heat (well above 100) you can place your trees in a dishpan of water during the day, pot and all. Hours of being under-water will not be enough to drown roots, just take them out to allow the soil to flush with oxygen. The water will take much longer to heat up than the soil itself. Just don't leave them in the water for days at a time.\n\nPlace Your Trees In The Shade\n\nThis will help the most. Even here at the nursery, the plants in full-sun this summer (pre-heatwave) have been showing signs of stress. While plants are adapted to the sun, there can be too much of a good thing. Outdoor shade, while visually not much different than indoor lighting, offers way more light than our little windows let in. The plants given shade/filtered light will often be greener and healthier than their counterparts in full-sun for the summer.\n\nWater The Foliage\n\nThere is an old myth that watering the leaves of a plant will cook them by concentrating the light like a magnifying glass in the sun. This is couldn't be more far removed from the truth. Watering the leaves of your bonsai will provide a buffer between them and the sun. The heat must first evaporate the water sitting on-top of the leaves before it can take the water out of the leaves, buying the tree some time to take water from the soil back up. This is especially important for trees that have been allowed to dry too much between watering as it reduces their stress.\n\nPlease keep in mind that watering the foliage in cool temperatures may cause fungal problems for certain species. In this extremely hot, dry air that is not much of a concern.\n\nDon't Forget To Water!!!\n\nI cannot stress this enough, it is the most important point of all. Do not forget to water your bonsai in the summer. There is no faster way to kill your trees. Junipers and pines will not give warning by wilting in advance. If you have already forgotten to water, follow the previous three steps and hope for the best. There is not much else you can do.\n\nResist The Temptation To Bring Your Bonsai Inside\n\nDue to the angle of the summer sun and the constant use of air conditioning, bringing bonsai indoors that have been growing outdoors will not be the best thing for them. Air-conditioned air, while cooler, is extremely dry. Dry air with low light is stressful for plants, and it is the worst thing you can do for hardy trees. Follow the previous four steps instead."

      "text": "Fall In Love With Unique Trees Displaying Fall Color\n\nBotanical Beauties Are Bountiful\n\nLISLE, IL (October 26, 2007) – Zelkova is not your long lost aunt, and pawpaw is not a town in Michigan. These are two of the less-frequently-seen trees with unusual characteristics that dot the stunning landscapes at The Morton Arboretum, where fall color has arrived in a big way, and trees are now trying to outdo each other with their showy, leafy fashions.\n\n\"Some trees were about two weeks late in turning, but they were worth waiting for,\" says Ed Hedborn, Arboretum botanist and \"Color Scout.\" Hedborn notes that, with trees from more than 40 countries around the world, something is always turning fall color at the Arboretum. Guests should make repeat visits to enjoy the entire show.\n\nSugar maples – sporting yellows, oranges and reds – typically are the big attention-getters, but also turning now are lindens, ironwoods, black cherries, hickories and more. Here now are some of the lesser-known tree species that visitors can enjoy at the Arboretum – and learn about.\n\nPawpaw: These trees, some of which have turned yellow for fall, may seem really out of place. They're the northernmost member of a tropical family. Their fruits will look like greenish-blue potatoes. When ripe, the fruits can taste like banana custard, although we do not recommend anyone eat these, as some people can have an allergic reaction.\n\nCorktree: Not a tree people would see frequently in parks or forest preserves. Nice, thick bark, hence the name \"cork\" tree, and the leaves are producing yellow fall color.\n\nSumacs: Varieties in small and large shrubs, and small trees. These were among the first to turn fall color, with many still displaying brilliant reds.\n\nHickories: Now sporting a beautiful yellow color. These trees are not so common anymore. Early settlers recognized the hickory wood strength, and used these trees to make tool handles, smoke meat, and more.\n\nBeech: Chewing gum, anyone? This is the tree that brings us beech nuts. It's a main food source for turkeys, and used to feed the now-extinct passenger pigeons. Leaves are turning yellow and brown, and look gold from a distance.\n\nJapanese Zelkova: Related to elms, but these do not get Dutch elm disease. They have interesting sawtooth-shaped leaves that turn purple in the fall. These trees are about to change color.\n\nOaks: Can get many colors from them. Bur oak leaves turn yellow in fall, pin oaks become scarlet red, red oaks turn red, and the Asiatic oaks will become a coppery-brown. Oaks are starting to turn.\n\nDawn-redwood: A \"living fossil,\" this tree wasn't even know to be a living plant until 1948, when a researcher discovered it in the tree's native range in China. Dawn-redwood's fossil record may go back as long as 120 million years. These are about to display a reddish-bronze fall color.\n\nGinkgo: A botanical oddity for sure. Another \"living fossil,\" ginkgos are believed to have been in the landscape 200 million years ago. Ginkgos are noted for their fan-shaped leaves and are already developing beautiful yellow fall color.\n\nAsian maples: Plenty of varieties not often seen in parks or forest preserves – these are from Russia, China and elsewhere in Asia. The paperbark maple draws its name from the unique and beautiful bark, featuring a paper-like look with a cinnamon-red color, and leaves turn red in fall.\n\nBald-cypress: Not a fish, of course, but it is often found growing in swampy areas. You almost cannot drown a bald cypress. Unlike other trees that must have drained soil to survive, this tree \"breathes\" through \"knees,\" which can get up to four to six feet high. Also, unlike most \"conifers,\" this tree is deciduous. Like trees that lose their leaves seasonally, the bald-cypress does not stay green all year long. Fall color starting now is a rich, coppery, reddish-brown.\n\nFreeman Maple: A cross between a silver maple and a red maple. This tree gets its adaptability to \"bad,\" compacted soil from the silver maple, and the lovely form and reddish fall color from the red maple. In the fall, each leaf shows green, yellow, red and purple hues, but the overall look is purple.\n\nNative grasses: In the Schulenberg Prairie, lovely Indian grass, big blue stem and little blue stem are among the showy grasses on display, sometimes six to eight feet tall. Silvery \"hairs\" on seeds at the grass tips often produce \"sparkling highlights\" when the sun hits them in just the right way"

But make sure you map out two escape routes for when the tree falls.\n\nStep 3: First Cut\nSaw the tree. First make an undercut, a 90-degree, pie-shaped piece, in the base of the tree in the direction where you want the tree to fall. Just don't cut all the way through the tree.\n\nStep 4: Take the Fall\nMake a back cut on the other side of the tree, which should be two inches over the hinge, or the intersection of the undercut—and watch the tree fall.\n\nStep 5: Branch Off\nOnce the tree is down, remove branches from the bottom up to the top. Remove only the branches that are on the opposite side of you.\n\nStep 6: Stump the Yard"

      "text": "Boughing to a Tree's Winter Needs\n\nThe Morton Arboretum Recommends Post-Snowfall Tree Care\n\nLISLE, IL (February 1, 2008) – Trees and other plants might have that \"winter wonderland\" look after Mother Nature walloped us with a heavy snowfall. But their branches need special attention in this weather. Follow The Morton Arboretum guidelines for snow-related tree care, to minimize the potential damage to your landscape.\n\n\"People should take a broom and lightly tap their tree branches, just to release some of the heavy snow, enabling the branches to bounce back up into place,\" says Doris Taylor, who manages the Arboretum Plant Clinic.\n\nPay particular attention to multi-stemmed evergreens, such as arborvitae and junipers. They are especially susceptible to damage as the snow's weight may cause the branches to open too broadly and split the plant. Or, there may be damage you cannot see.\n\n\"The weight of the snow can cause internal damage to a branch – a crack might develop inside the wood. This branch no longer has the strength to pop back up into place when the snow is gone. You might have to stake that limb to support it until the plant develops new wood to strengthen the branch. In rare cases, this kind of damage could be fatal,\" Taylor says.\n\nSnow can crack large branches, leaving them hanging and in danger of falling, potentially injuring people or damaging property. These should be removed. If they are too large or too far up for the homeowner to handle, call a certified arborist to remove the branch.\n\n\"Homeowners should not get on a ladder to prune, or work around electrical wires,\" Taylor says. But if they can stand safely on the ground and prune away smaller broken limbs now, this is a good idea.\n\nWith smaller shrubs, such as boxwood, simply brush the snow away with your hand.\n\nTo protect against future damage to trees, take a cloth, bunge cord, or another soft material, and tie the branches together, to support them against the weight of snow. Remember to untie the branches in spring.\n\nSalt is harmful to trees. In soil, salt can impede the roots' ability to take-up water. Salt can also burn leaves. Trees in parkways or near the street might get a heavy dose of salt when plows come through, or when homeowners shovel sidewalks. Try to shovel the snow first, before applying any de-icer. Also, to minimize the salt content in soil, try using kitty litter, pea gravel or sand instead of salt.\n\nIn a few days, when we expect to hit warmer temperatures, look for \"frost heaving.\" With a lack of snow cover, the moisture in soil causes the soil to push outward, in some cases lifting the whole plant, which can expose the roots to the elements. Homeowners should check for this, and if roots are exposed, they should be lightly pushed back into the ground. Or, homeowners should put a couple of inches of mulch to protect those exposed roots, and in the spring, replant if necessary"

      "text": "The trees have been selected in their individual areas because they grew not too far away from other trees, but not too densely with others either. They have been selected because they have the ideal (full foliage) south side, which gets the most exposure to sunlight. Most branches are like a wave, growing down and then upwards to achieve more space. (See Fig. 1) Some lower branches near the base of the tree have split up into two, and sometimes three, different sub-branches, like Y's. This is not done in upper branches, probably because of the weight that is required to support this. Some branches also crossed and overlapped each other, but this did not affect the branch length or angle of the trees. There are more branches in the middle and near the top of the tree, since that is the area with the most sunlight, than at the bottom of the tree. This allows for the optimal efficiency in solar energy collection. It has been noticed in the photographs that some of the lower branches are slightly under 90°, and the upper branches near the tops of each tree are over 100°. Branches at the bottom are also usually longer than they are at the top, for stability.\n\nIn some of the older trees that are taller in height with longer branches, the centre of the tree is bare, because those needles have senesced due to old age and excessive shade from other needles on the outside. To make it so that the tree will not have to support useless needles, some of the older trees shed the inner needles so there is less weight to support, and less areas to photosynthesize to, conserving energy. The average length of a branch that is bare without needles was 30.6 inches across 20 trees. (See Fig. 2)\n\nThe trees all have a good exposure to sunlight, and grow in an environment that is grassy and flat. There were often other trees of the same species growing nearby with branch angles that were quite variable, some growing at an upward angle, others drooping in a downward angle. Some areas even contain deciduous trees. The trees chosen, and their neighbours, are all usually around the same height growing in one area, since they all started growing at approximately the same time, based on the number of vertical branch whorls. There is usually a reasonable amount of fertile soil in the areas, with some more moist than others. Nonetheless, there is not a significant difference in moisture to affect the growth of the trees. Another factor that has remained constant is that the trees are all in areas where they would all experience similar amounts of annual sunlight, snowfall and other growth-determining factors. Some areas have little plants growing at the base of the tree, but there is not a dense amount to affect the health of the tree. (See Fig. 3)\n\nWhen it comes to branch angles, most of the range is from 80° to 120°, which is near the angle that is necessary to be perpendicular to the sun (90°). Most of the modal, median and mean angles range from 90° to 100°, since these are the most common angles. Data obtained from the branch angle measurements is fairly consistent and constant along the main stem of each tree, regardless of the different quadrants and environments in which these trees grow. Most of the branch angles on any one tree are very similar, even though they occur at different tree heights. This indicates that all trees of the Picea glauca family use the same basic rules for growth and solar energy collection.\n\nIt can also be observed that there is somewhat of a consistent ratio for the tree height to average branch length of the entire tree. There are a few exceptions where the tree stops growing in terms of height, but continues to grow longer branches. The ratio, then, only applies when the tree is growing in the optimal manner for collecting sunlight at first. The ratio ranges from 0.25 to 0.71, which is very close when one is examining the very natural growth of trees that could easily be changed by some specific environmental factors. If one were to state a general ratio number, they could use the mean of all the data ratios that have been collected: 0.426118209. This is the standard ratio number that will be used later on in procedures for this project. Tree height was something that has been manipulated and measured, but only for the purpose of determining whether or not the basic ratio changes with height. Since it does not, the height of a tree would seem not to be relevant when its sole purpose is to collect the optimal amount of solar energy.\n\nThis project is the intellectual property of Eden Full. Use of this information for one's own purposes is not permitted."

Every spring my wife notices the onset of buds on the trees and tells me they are \"blushing green.\" I tell her that \"blushing\" refers to red, not green. She tells me that if I can find a better way to convey the idea of \"blushing green,\" she will deign to use it. Can you help?\n\nA: We think your wife's description of tender young buds as \"blushing green\" is delightful, and it's not as farfetched as you might think. The original meaning of \"blush,\" in the 14th century, had nothing to do with redness.\n\nThe word \"blush\" first showed up as a verb, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, and initially meant to \"cast a glance\" or \"give a look.\" The OED's earliest written citation is from 1325.\n\nThe noun \"blush\" was first recorded in writing in about 1340, when it meant \"a gleam, a blink.\" By this time, the verb was being used to mean \"shine forth.\"\n\nA slightly later sense of the noun – \"a glance, glimpse, blink, look\" – was recorded about 1375 in the expression \"aftur the furste blusch.\" We still use the word this way, in the phrase \"at first blush\" (the equivalent of \"at first glance\").\n\nThe current sense of the verb \"blush,\" meaning \"to become red in the face, (usually) from shame or modesty,\" came along in the mid-15th century, the OED says.\n\nThe first written citation is from about 1450, in the phrase \"blushed red.\" Later, the \"red\" became unnecessary and \"blushing\" by itself meant turning red.\n\nThe use of the noun \"blush\" to mean \"the reddening of the face caused by shame, modesty, or other emotion\" was first recorded in Shakespeare, the OED says."

      "text": "UNITED STATES—As long as it gets done well before buds begin to swell late in winter, the meticulous and specialized pruning that deciduous fruit trees and roses require during winter dormancy does not need to be done immediately. Here in Southern California, where the climate is so mild, some roses may still be blooming. The main advantage to getting an early start is that those of us who have many fruit trees and roses in need of pruning have more time to get them all done within the proper time.\n\nAlthough very rare here in Southern California, bald cypress is prominent enough in the Southeast to be the state tree of Louisiana. It happens to be one of the few deciduous conifers; so the finely textured light green foliage will soon be gone.\n\nIf it helps to start pruning early, it is best to prune fruit trees and roses in the same order that they go dormant and defoliate. The 'stone' fruits (those of the genus Prunus, that have large pits known as 'stones'), like apricots, cherries, nectarines and peaches typically defoliate earlier than the 'pomme' fruits, like apples, pears and quinces, that some of us in cooler zones are able to grow. Modern 'carpet' roses may not defoliate completely, so can be delayed until after all the bare roses get pruned, but may eventually need to get pruned while still partially foliated.\n\nThe specialized pruning that deciduous fruit trees and roses need is serious business. Those who do not know how to do it properly should learn about it before actually doing it. Improper pruning of fruit trees can inhibit production and damage the trees. Roses are not so easily damaged, but will get overgrown and not bloom as well if not pruned aggressively enough. (This sort of pruning will be a topic later in the season.)\n\nLike fruit trees and roses, other trees and shrubs that need pruning prefer to be pruned while dormant through autumn and winter. Deciduous trees and shrubs are obviously dormant while bare, but realistically, are ready to be pruned when their foliage is no longer green.\n\nEvergreen plants are not so obviously dormant, but will be as dormant as they get through winter. This would therefore be a good time to prune to eliminate pine limbs that are too low. If pruned a bit early, the pruning wounds will get weathered more through winter and consequently bleed less through spring.\n\nTree of the Week: Bald Cypress\n\nThere are very few coniferous (cone bearing) trees that are deciduous; and because most prefer cooler winters, very few are ever seen in local gardens. The bald cypress, Taxodium distichum, happens to be one of the few deciduous coniferous trees that really could be more popular than it is, since it seems to be right at home in mild climates, even around the Los Angeles Basin. It is native to coastal riparian regions from Maryland to Florida to eastern Texas, and up the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers as far as Indiana.\n\nThe soft foliage resembles that of coastal redwood, but is more finely textured. It is still mostly light green, but will soon be turning paper bag brown before trees go bare. The tiny individual leaves are shaped like flat pine needles, and are not much more than half an inch long. The ruddy or grayish brown bark is finely shaggy.\n\nIn the wild, mature bald cypress trees can get more than a hundred feet tall with trunks more than five feet wide. Some of the largest trees have buttressed trunks as wide as fifteen feet! Trees in swamps develop distended growth from their roots known as 'knees', which can stand several feet tall! Fortunately, bald cypress rarely get half as tall or develop such massive trunks here in Southern California."

      "text": "The Homeowners Column\n\nNative Flowering Trees for the Landscape\n\nApril 27, 2002\n\nI can't imagine a spring without the glorious show of flowering trees. How nice it is that they are also at nose level so we may take in every molecule of fragrance. Many of these trees reach heights less than 40 feet and can be tucked into many spots in the landscape. Illinois offers some lovely small native trees, which are hardy and ornamental.\n\nCarolina silverbell, Halesia carolina, was a favorite of the famous landscape architect Jens Jensen. He established a grove of silverbells in Lincoln Memorial Garden in Springfield in the 1930's. Silverbells are seldom troubled with insects or diseases. The flowers are the most ornamental part and are borne in late April or early May. Their white bell shape is 1/2 to 3/4 inches long.\n\nSilverbells tolerate sun to semi shade and are found as an understory tree in the wild. They do prefer moist, acidic soils with high organic matter. They make a lovely addition to a rhododendron bed. They will get 30 to 40 feet tall with a spread of 20 to 35 feet. Silverbells are native to southern Illinois, but seem to do just fine here given a proper site.\n\nBlackhaw, Viburnum prunifolium, is one of my favorite plants. It can reach 12 to 15 feet tall. It transplants well and is adaptable to many soil types. It may be found as a small tree or commonly in the wild as a multi-stemmed shrub. It will thrive in sun or shade. Blackhaw viburnums are found in the wild as an understory tree, but also do well in full sun. It, as well as many plants grown in shade, will form a more open airy plant in the shade. Denser branching occurs in the sun.\n\nBlackhaws have full season interest. In the spring the new leaves are maroon. The white flowers are borne in May as flat topped two- to four-inch diameter clusters of tiny flowers. The leaves are glossy green and remain attractive through the summer until they turn red to bronze in the fall. The fruit turns from rosy-pink to bluish-black in September. The fruit is edible if you can beat the birds to them. The small berries have been used in preserves since colonial times.\n\nAnother great small tree with four-season appeal is serviceberry, Amelanchier spp. The graceful branches arch with white flowers that appear now as the leaves emerge. The blue fruits are tasty when ripe but are usually snatched up quickly by the birds. The smooth gray bark is very ornamental with its interruptions of long fissures.\n\nServiceberries are one of the finest small trees for fall color that ranges through orange and red. There are several species of serviceberries and many cultivars so do your homework to get the size and fall color you wish. The story goes serviceberries got their name from their spring flowers that heralded the resumption of the traveling preacher's schedule. It was time to schedule funerals, baptisms and weddings.\n\nIf you would like to see a serviceberry \"in action,\" stop by our office or the city of Champaign public works office for the new University Avenue Tree Walk Guide. In just three short blocks of Champaign you can see over forty different tree species including ironwood, 'Tricolor'beech, blue ash, hardy rubber tree and many more common and not so common trees. The guide identifies trees by address and provides a short description and illustration.\n\nAlso if you want a guided tour of the tree walk, join Bill VanderWeit, City Forester for the City of Champaign and author of the guide, and me on Saturday, May 11 at 10:00 a.m. We will start the tour on the corner of Victor and University Avenue in Champaign."

They have been important plants in many well-known gardens across the nation.\nRecently, a severe blight known as Boxwood blight (Cylindrocladium buxicola), was identified in 2011 in the U.S. causing defoliation of Boxwood\nspecies. This disease thrives in warm and humid environments causing symptoms such as leaf spots, cankers, straw/bronze colored foliage and defoliation.\nThe fungus enters the plant through the leaf cuticle or stomata. It survives in the environment as mycelia in plant debris, and when conditions are\nfavorable, spores are produced spreading the disease to neighboring boxwoods. There are no known resistant boxwood species, although differences in\nsusceptibility can vary with the cultivar. In addition to Buxus spp., Pachysandra terminalis was identified as a new host of this disease\nin 2012.\n\nThe first line of defense to Boxwood blight begins is strict sanitation practices and plant disease scouting so that any infections can be found early and\nremoved from the production area immediately. There has been limited research in the U.S. on this disease but there are products that have shown good\nefficacy on Cylindrocladium species. In 2012, trials conducted by Dr. Kelly Ivors at North Carolina State University showed that fungicides from\nFRAC codes M5, 9, 11, & 12 applied on a 14 day interval effectively protected plants from Cylindrocladium buxicola.\n\nFungicides are best utilized in a plant disease prevention strategy to help protect uninfected plants. Alternate or tank-mix products from different mode\nof action groups to form a good resistance management strategy. Evaluate treatments for plant safety on a small group of plants or cultivars before\nwidespread use, especially if surfactants are included in the mix."

It grows in any soil apart from chalk; it especially likes damp sites. It has good autumn colour and its leaves support several species of butterfly caterpillar.\nCommon White Birch is not suitable for a clipped hedge. It can be grown as a screening tree up to about 20 metres high.\nBrowse all of our other varieties of Birch trees for sale.\n\nCommon White Birch plants are only delivered bareroot, during winter (Nov-March).\n\nChoosing a size: When you are ordering a large quantity of Common White Birch for a big planting project, we suggest that you buy the smaller 40/60cms high plants. They are cheaper than larger plants, easier to handle and more likely to cope well with poor conditions. All of our young trees and shrubs are measured by their height in centimetres above the ground (the roots aren't measured).\n\nGeneral description of Betula pubescens plants: Common Names: Common / European White Birch, Downy Birch, Hairy Birch\nThis tree is very similar to Silver Birch. The most obvious difference is that the young twigs of White Birch have downy hairs on them and feel smooth to the touch. The tree's canopy is also more upright and narrow than silver birch.\n\nHistory & uses of Betula pubescens\nIn the past, birch bark was very valuable because it is oily, waterproof and flexible when heated. It was used to make all sorts of items related to water, from boats to buckets to roofs to hats. Birch was associated with fertility and bundles of birch twigs were used in Medieval times to flog criminals. You might find birch twigs in a traditional Swedish sauna to lightly whip your back with, which is supposed to enhance your detox.\nBirch wood isn't very commercially valuable these days; it is mostly used for paper pulp and disposable things like toothpicks. It burns well, if a little quickly.\n\nNotes on planting Common White Birch:\nCommon White Birch trees will grow well in most conditions where there is full sun. They prefer moist, heavy clay but they will also grow on quite poor, dry soils. Birches are hardy trees, but they will get twisted out of shape on exposed locations with strong winds.\nThey will not grow well if the site is chalky or shady White Birch saplings Common White Birch:\nCommon White Birch is a very tough plant that shouldn't need special attention once it has established.\nIf possible, do not prune birches.\nIf"

A year-old tree needs about 1/10 of a pound; a 5-year-old tree will need 1 to 1½ pounds. It's best to divide feedings into three applications during April, June and August. Be sure to water well. Citrus leaf drop is normal, with some varieties losing thousands of leaves per day. But excessive drop can be caused by lack of water or an infestation of spider mites, which will show up as brown spots on the leaves; treat by washing them off with a strong blast of water from a hose.\n\nIf the weather cooperates, plant tomato seedlings. The soil temperature must have reached 65°F (and nighttime temperatures stay above 55°F). Some kitchen thermometers will measure temperatures in this range. Tomatoes can be planted vertically or horizontally. For vertical, plant deeply, up to the top few leaves (remove all leaves that will be underground). Or, dig a trench, lay the plant horizontally with all but the upper few leaves buried (again, remove all leaves that will be underground). Both methods provide for stronger plants by increasing the root system.\n\nRemove poison oak -- carefully! -- if someone in your household is allergic to the oils in the plant. (About three-fourths of our population is allergic.) Plant removal should be done only by those who are allergy-resistant to this California native plant that provides shelter and food for many native birds and wildlife. Dig up the plant and/or apply herbicides. Caution: Poison oak should never be burned; the fumes can be highly toxic.\n\nCheck for codling moths, which can cause a great deal of damage to apples, pears, plums and walnuts by penetrating the fruit and boring into the core. On apples, look for brown-colored holes. If trees have low to moderate infestation, you can try nonchemical control such as sanitation, mass trapping, trunk banding or fruit bagging. With a heavy infestation you may have to resort to spinosad or carbaryl.\n\nTreat powdery mildew, a common problem on many roses, dahlias, chrysanthemums, peas and squash. It produces a white powdery appearance on leaves. A homemade spray of baking soda, water and salad oil can be an effective, nontoxic treatment. But some roses are so susceptible that it may be easier to remove the plant and pick a disease-resistant variety."

If possible, the best thing you can do in the beginning, is watch an experienced grafter to be sure you are using the proper methods. There are different types of propagation that fall under the title of grafting. The most commonly one is called a side graft or bench graft. This involves an under-stock plant, usually a seedling grown green Japanese maple tree (Acer palmatum).The under-stock is generally one to two years old and is growing in a small pot. The upper part of the graft is called the scion. The scion is a small branch or limb that comes from the tree you want to propagate. Lace leaf and weeping varieties like Crimson Queen, Ever Red and many others, are almost entirely produced by this form of grafting. The use of a bottom heated bench in a greenhouse will greatly improve the success rate. I have heard of several hobbyist grafters setting up a heated bench in their basement and using plant grow lights to successfully produce Japanese maple trees. There are several hundred cultivars of this species alone ranging in height from 2 feet to over 40 feet full grown. Colors include, green, red, pink, white, orange, and seasonal changes from spring to summer to fall can be quite dramatic. Some varieties such as \"coral bark\" maples are even colorful during the winter.\n\nMore Questions"

      "text": "Caring for Japanese Yew\n\nBy Anna Graizbord\n, last updated January 19, 2012\n\nCaring for Japanese Yew isn't particularly difficult to care for, as the plant is winter-hardy and highly adaptable to a number of different environments. You can grow Japanese Yews in either shrub or tree form, both of which are fairly low-maintenance given their slow-growing rate, making them ideal ornamental plants for almost any exterior design scenario.\n\nPlanting\n\nAs they are pretty popular plants, you can find Japanese Yews at most nurseries or garden stores. Though it's difficult to grow right from the seed, you can much more easily propagate them from the bare root, from containers, or from cuttings. Most of the time, however, Japanese Yew are sold as live plants.\n\nWhen planting, make sure to do so in the early spring. If do not have designs on planting your tree within a week of purchase, make sure that you water the root ball regularly until you actually do plant. When you're looking for a planting spot, keep in mind that though Japanese Yews are amenable to a number of conditions, they tend not to like hot winds; as long as you find a spot with at least partial shade, you'll be okay. As with most plants, Japanese Yews do best with well-drained soil; make sure the pH is pretty loamy, about a 5.3 to 7.8 pH. To remove your plant from its container, place the plant and container on its side; roll it back and forth while pressing on the container's sides. Once it feels ready, separate your plant from its container.\n\nDig your planting hole so that it is four times as wide as the the rootball, and no more than two inches deeper than the length of the rootball. If you're planting in clay, the top of the rootball should actually be one to two inches higher than the ground level. If you wish, with a pitchfork or shovel, you can scarify the sides of the hole. Fill the hole in first with a couple of handfuls of sand if you're worried about drainage, position your plant centrally, and backfill the rest with soil and compost (which will also help with drainage). Tap lightly on the soil to eliminate air pockets. If you plan on growing hedges, space your planting holes at least four to six feet apart.\n\nTo ensure healthy roots, create a water ring reservoir around its perimeter. This will direct the most water to the outside of the roots in the first year. You can throw some mulch (at least 3 inches) on top of the soil in the ring if you are so inclined, so the area retains as much moisture as possible. Right after you plant, you should water your tree with one gallon of water. When you're watering during the first year, you should keep the plant's first 18 inches of soil moist in between waterings, which should be at least weekly for the next three months. Eventually, you'll only have to water it when the weather is especially dry and hot.\n\nGeneral Maintenance Tips\n\nWithin the first year you've planted, you'll want to help stimulate root growth by using a fertilizer that is phosphorous-based. In the spring, you can check on the soil to assess its nutrient levels and adjust the type of fertilizer you'll use accordingly. If you feed your plant well in the first few years, you can speed up its growth rate, which is usually pretty slow on average.\n\nIf you prefer your Japanese Yew to be very tall (they can reach up to 40 to 50 feet with a 20 foot canopy), don't prune at all, or only prune for dead wood and leaves once a year. Otherwise, if you want more of a hedge-like result, start pruning early, focusing more on pruning the top of the plant to as high as you'd like it to be.\n\nOther Japanese Yew Facts & Tips\n\nBe careful where you plant your tree, as the fruit of Japanese Yew is actually highly poisonous when ingested. Only the female cones of the tree can produce this fruit.\n\nJapanese yews are dioecious, meaning that each plant cannot hold both male and female organs. It can only be one or the other.\n\nThough it's an evergreen, it grows most in the spring and summer, blooming typically occurring in mid-spring.\n\nNot only is it native to Japan, but it is also native to Southern China.\n\nJapanese Yew leaves are dark green, and like many evergreens, are flat and needle-like.\n\nIn general, it's good to water the plant deeply, and especially in the fall, just before the ground freezes.\n\nJapanese Yew shrubs are typically used as foundation plants or privacy hedges to circle a house. Although, other types of yews that aren't as dense are used more as decorative hedges and foundation plants.\n\nThough Podocarpus macrophyllaplants are sometimes referred to as Japanese Yews, they are not part of the Taxus genus; only true Japanese Yews that use Taxus in their Latin name belong in that category."

It grows poorly in higher areas (Teel 1984). It also occurs as a small tree colonizing mixed thickets and woodlands.\n\nMinimum Altitude (m):\n\n0\n\nMaximum Altitude (m):\n\n2300\n\nPROPAGATION\n\nMeans of Propagation: Direct sowing of seed or sowing the pod when fresh.\n\nSeeds per kg:\n\n12000\n\nSeed Sources:\n\n1200 TSH per kg - Silviculture Research Centre 1991/92.\n\nSeed Treatments: Pods are pale brown, up to 1.8×2.5 cm in size. Fresh seeds need no pretreatment. Soak previously stored seeds in cold water. Information about seed pretreatment for A. lebbeck suggests pretreatment by soaking in concentrated sulphuric acid for 5 minutes or soaking in cold water for 48 hours (Parkash 1991). Seeds can be stored for up to a year.\n\nSeedling Management: Collect seed while still on tree to avoid insect damage.\n\nSILVICULTURE\n\nPlanting Types: As single trees or in clusters near habitations, in fields, pastures and wetlands and along water courses. In Malawi, farmers intercrop A. gummifera as a shade tree among their tea bushes (Palmer and Pitman 1972). It has high potential for agroforestry (IFS 1989).\n\nGrowth Factors: Promising growth was reported in Dodoma region. In Zimbabwe it was reported to be fast growing, strongly fire resistant, and only slightly sensitive to frost (Palmer and Pitman 1972).\n\nLimitations to Planting: Confined mostly to temperate zones, and is sensitive to frost.\n\nManagement Systems: Regenerates under its own shade (Sommerlatte 1990). It has good lopping and coppicing ability when young.\n\nIMPORTANT USES\n\nUse #1: MEDICINE Pods, roots, and bark are used for medicinal purposes.\n\nUse #2: GENERAL PURPOSE WOOD The wood is medium dense, fairly strong, straight-grained, and does not warp.

Phillips explains his concept of health-based orchard dynamics as \"stewarding what needs to be right while intelligently setting limits on what might go wrong.\" Ample color photographs and clear illustrations and diagrams enhance the text. Also covered are the connections between home orcharding and permaculture, including using shade-tolerant berry bushes and plants that benefit native pollinators as understory plantings in orchards. You'll also find information on soil building, planting, pruning, and harvesting. A reference you'll return to again and again, this excellent book is a worthwhile investment for anyone interested in sustainable fruit growing.\n\nWeb Finds\n\nPear Trellis Rust\nMany gardeners are familiar with cedar apple rust, a disease with a complex, two-host life cycle that alternates between apples, including crabapples, and certain species of juniper, including native eastern red cedar. Now it appears that both ornamental and fruiting pears are at risk from a related disease that is new to New England. Called pear trellis rust, it also requires two hosts to complete its life cycle, with many species of juniper serving as an alternate host with pears. This disease is common in Europe and has been present in western Canada since the 1960s and the Pacific Northwest since the late 1990s. But it has worked its way east, reaching southeastern New York State in 2011 and Connecticut in 2012, and is likely to spread to other parts of New England in time. For more on this new threat, check out Pear Trellis Rust from UConn Extension, which contains information on the identification and management of this new disease, including color pictures of symptoms."

      "text": "rate this answer\n\nWednesday - June 29, 2011\n\nQUESTION:\n\nWe have a large, 9-year old Leyland Cypress that has tipped over. It is still green and growing but leaning slightly off center. It's about 20' tall. Should we stake it? If so, we'd like to do it ourselves, but how? It's huge!!! Thanks for your help!\n\nANSWER:\n\nThis tree has a very interesting story. It is a hybrid, which means it does not appear in our Native Plant Database, of two trees that are native to the North American Pacific Coast, Cupressus macrocarpa (Monterey cypress) and Cupressus nootkatensis (Alaska cedar). It hybridized naturally because the two trees were taken to an estate in England and were close enough together to cross pollinate. Ordinarily, in their native habitats in the Pacific nothwest, they would have been 400 miles apart and would never have hybridized. Then, later, the resulting hybrid, Leyland Cypress, was exported back to the United States.\n\nHere is an excellent article on Leyland Cypress. It's kind of small print, but we think it will be helpful to you. Many people look for a tree with a taproot, like a carrot has. They think that it will grow straight down and the roots won't get into their lawns or swimming pools. But if you consider, you can see how a root like that could cause the very problem you have. Taproot trees develop outlying roots to get more water and nutrition from the soil, but also to stabilize the tree in an upright position. It looks like your tree didn't quite get stabilized.\n\nOne note we saw on caring for this tree is that you should avoid growing in moist unstable soils - in windy areas the trees may blow over due to their rapid growth rate. Leyland cypress is a large tree unless constantly trimmed, do not plant too close to structures. That might have something to do with your tree leaning, the kind of soil it is in.\n\nWe want to point out that the parent plants of this tree are both native to areas completely across the United States from Maryland, so we are not sure how well acclimated your tree is to your soils and climate. Since we have no personal experience with either the tree or with tree staking, here is an excellent article on the procedure from Colorado State University Extension Tree Staking and Underground Stabilization.\n\nMore Diseases and Disorders QuestionsDiseased Mexican plum tree in Austin September 27, 2009 - I have a grove of 5 year old Mexican plum trees one of which is oozing sap from its trunk and a branch appears to have died.

      "text": "Wednesday - June 09, 2010\n\nQUESTION:\n\nI have several Texas Pistachio that are about 13 years old. Despite good rainfall in Travis county this year, they seem to be losing most of their new leaf growth now in early June. Leaves are simply yellowing and dropping much as they would in the winter. Any idea what the problem could be?\n\nANSWER:\n\nWhile Pistacia mexicana (American pistachio) is native to Texas, this USDA Plant Profile shows it growing in only one county in the Big Bend area. That doesn't mean it won't grow in Austin, because obviously they do, at least for 13 years anyway. If they had not gone ahead and leafed out in the Spring, we would have blamed the very unusual cold temperatures we had this past winter. That could still be the problem.\n\nWhat we have to do is try to discover what happened between last year and this year that could be causing this. For instance, has some kind of herbicide or \"weed and feed\" fertilizer been spread on your grass to get rid of broad-leafed weeds? Trees are also broad-leafed plants, and a too-vigorous application or (in the case of spraying) a brisk wind might have caused the leaf drop. Of course, if the same conditions don't apply to all the trees showing stress, that is probably not the only cause of the problem. Another clue we found said that the pistachio could flourish for years in the right location,and suddenly die of root rot from too much moisture in the soil. Have you put in a sprinkler system or started wateriing more often? We had several dry years and then a more normal rainfall. If the drainage in your soil is not good, the roots of the pistachio could be drowning. Desert trees do not flourish in lush conditions.\n\nFinally, take a good close look at the tree. While we found no documentation of disease or insect pests bothering this plant, it's always a possibility. Beyond that, we are out of ideas. If you are watering more, we would suggest you direct it away from your trees. You might try treating it like transplant shock, and trimming away some of the upper portion of the trees. If the roots are struggling, this could help them get the needed moisture up to the leaves so the leaves can continue to manufacture food for the whole plant. Don't fertilize.The last thing stressed roots need is stimulation to put on new growth when they are just trying to stay alive.\n\nFiinally, we suggest you contact the Texas AgriLIFE Extension Office for Travis County and see if they have encountered similar problems in the neighborhood.\n\nMore Trees QuestionsMy Cedar Elms drop leaves all year long.

      "text": "March 23, 2011\n\nSpring is green in the literal sense. Everyone is welcoming spring after a difficult winter, including the trees! I have seen many tree buds bursting into leaves. This is also the time of year I receive countless e-mails and phone calls, asking; \"If we have another frost, will it hurt my trees?\"\n\nMy answer... Yes. Tree leaves will surely be damaged by the frost, especially trees that are not native to this region. What can you do about it? Very little. The best thing you can do for your trees that are damaged by the frost is care for them throughout the whole year to ensure the tree is in optimal health to deal with things like frost, insects, fungi, lawnmowers, air toxins, and yes the list continues. Trees are rather resilient when you think about how many challenges they face in their lifetime.\n\nForsythia Flowers from the Administration Building\n\nPlants, if small enough, can be covered with a bucket or flower pot of some sort for minimum protection from an overnight frost. I have even witnessed a neighbor using a quilt for her shrubs. This is another instance where natives shine. One of the benefits to growing native plants is they are used to this crazy Missouri weather, even if we aren't. They have had, literally, hundreds of thousands of years to practice.\n\nAlso, keep in mind frost does not need freezing temperatures to build! Frost in low lying areas can occur in the upper forties! I have seen frost on our turf when the thermometer read a mere 46 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nI am often guilty of forgetting there are multiple perspectives, so for those of us that are worried about the frost, let us not forget to take a moment and enjoy it! Fresh morning frost is a beautiful sight as the sun burns it off, turning it into a gas form, and watching it rise from the ground to the sky as the morning speaks to us. Have a great week and get outside as much as you can!\n\nTuesday, March 8, 2011\n\nWe are starting to see green, and its not just Saint Patrick's Day, I think spring is here to stay! Spring always gets me excited, like the rest of us, so what a wonderful thing it is that they provided me with this space to ramble about my love for trees and plants!\n\nSpring is the time trees get their long overdue credit. Everyone loves the flowers of the Crabapples, the breaking of the Cherry blossoms, and the Redbud and Forsythia flowers side-by-side are a sight to behold. It seems like the most popular plants are also the ones with the most problems. So if I could, I would like to take this opportunity to tell the tale of a very unpopular tree, though why it is unpopular is beyond me.\n\nThe American Fringtree, also known as Chionanthus virginicus, is a Missouri native that is very under-utilized. In the right conditions this tree is beautiful year round, and has very few disease problems. Also, if by chance you can catch it during its short blooming period, it is one of the most interesting and beautiful flowering trees around.\n\nFringe-like flowers close up\n\nChionanthus virginicus prefers plenty of moisture, and in my experience likes very fertile soil. So rocky clay locations aren't ideal for this tree. With adequate moisture it will tolerate sun very well, but also performs well in the shade. It flowers in late spring, and birds love to hide in this small tree. Annual pruning can keep this tree shaped. If left on its own it gets kinda leggy, so an annual pruning is advised. This tree has very few insect and disease issues, and is okay to plant under power lines and in locations where a large shade tree won't have room to grow. If you can find this specimen, it will repay you as a beautiful addition to your yard! See you outside!\n\nTuesday, March 1, 2011\n\nThere are two kinds of people in the world, those that walk by and say \"Ewww, that mulch stinks!\" or those of us that willingly take in the beautiful aroma of spring mulch! Besides the return of the robins song, there is no better sign that spring is here then seeing crews laying fresh mulch!\n\nBelieve it or not, mulch is a heavily debated subject in the tree industry. Everyone has their opinions; mulch, don't mulch, mulch a lot, mulch a little, mulch this, don't mulch that. There have even been numerous studies at Missouri University on the effects of mulch on trees! Needless to say, mulch is serious business, so we treat it as such.\n\nFirst and foremost lets discuss mulch origins. Our mulch is carefully chosen for its quality and its environmental impact. We chose our mulch from a vendor that uses by-products of wine barrel production, so no trees are harvested to produce our mulch! This is very important to us and we take pride in that fact!\n\nSecond, we are certain to apply mulch in a way that is both visually aesthetic, and also beneficial to the tree in multiple ways. Mulch applied correctly can frame the landscape, provide nutrients for plantings, assist in drainage, moisture retention, and ward off disease!\n\nUsing the \"two-finger\" method to remove mulch from contacting the trunk.\n\nThis will help suppress disease transmission and trunk \"rot.\"\n\nMulch around trees should not exceed two inches in depth. one to two inches is perfect to help retain moisture in the root zone, and help suppress weeds. Also, the wider you can make your mulch rings, even beyond the drip line of the tree, the better. This will ensure the root zone is not competing with weeds, and some weeds and turf can even harm the tree!\n\nMulched trees really make a landscape stand out.\n\nAs you travel around campus you will notice a raised \"ring\" at the outside radius of our mulch rings. This serves many purposes. This ring helps retain moisture in the root zone of newly planted tress, forming a dish. It also helps protect our trees from the dreaded disease \"Lawn Mower Blight.\" In other words, it acts as a deterrent to mowers and other equipment from bumping into the fragile trunks of our campus trees.\n\nForests floors are full of leaves, branches that have fallen from trees, and rotting stumps. The forest makes its own mulch, but when we keep our yards tidy, we often pick up these items and deprive our trees of natural organic nutrients. Mulch can replace those nutrients and make your yard look great! Besides, you need an excuse to go outside anyways!"

Formal and long-lived, this slow-growing, bluish tree maintains its form with little or no pruning.\n\nAn Iseli seedling selection, this gorgeous Great Basin Bristlecone Pine is possibly the most refined pine we grow. It has a compact, uniform shape, larger than 'Sherwood Compacta', but smaller than 'Formal Form'. Dense clusters of two-toned needles point towards the tip of each ascending branch and create a consistent shape that hides the stems and buds until new growth emerges in late spring. Jean noted the origin of this beauty as 1975, and conifer great Joe Reis, given the task of naming the remarkable tree in 1982, chose to honor his wife Bess. It has proven difficult to propagate, but is worth the wait. The formal, slow-growing tree requires little or no pruning, but wants full sun.\n\nPinus aristata(longaeva) 'Rezeks Doll'\n\nUpright Broad\n\n4\n\nDwarf\n\nBluish Green\n\nWhen a cultivar bears the name of a conifer icon like Ed Rezek, you know it is among the best. Such is the case with this beautiful Great Basin Bristlecone Pine, named for Rezek's wife Maureen and originating from the same seed group as 'Joe's Bess'. It is a fine pine with a compact form, a little larger and more open than 'Joe's Bess', similar to 'Formal Form'. Dense clusters of two-toned needles point towards the tip of each ascending branch, hiding the stems and buds until new growth emerges in late spring. The formal, slow-growing tree requires little or no pruning, but needs full sun.\n\nThis handsome, slow-growing Great Basin Bristlecone Pine develops a perfectly conical shape and a dense, formal appearance. Tightly packed tufts of medium-long, green needles with white undersides radiate around the ascending branches of the long-lived conifer. Related to the oldest-living known organism, this selection was found and named by late Oregon nurseryman Andy Sherwood.\n\nPinus banksiana 'Al Johnson'\n\nUpright Broad\n\n2\n\nIntermediate\n\nGreen\n\nA unique, slow-growing, character tree, this North American pine has an open, irregular habit that suggests exposure to harsh conditions. The rustic look is accentuated by silver bark and by candles that are so pitch-covered they look as if they have been dipped in wax. The extremely hardy conifer takes tough conditions and makes a striking feature in the rock garden or patio container.\n\nA great little, emerald green witch's broom from the extremely hardy Jack Pine, this tight, irregular globe is perfect for rock garden or trough. Older plants eventually stretch up into a pyramidal shape. Hardy and adaptable, it tolerates heat, cold, and dry, sandy or poor soils.\n\n'Schoodic' (pronounced skoo dik') is an exceptional, dense, ground-hugging native selection of Jack Pine found on Schoodic Peninsula in Maine. Use the spreading, low-growing plant with short, emerald green needles to drape down a bank or sprawl over another challenging site. Typical of the species, 'Schoodic' is extremely hardy and adaptable, it tolerates heat, cold, and dry, sandy or poor soils.\n\nHardy, adaptable and tough, this selection of Jack Pine forms a dense, compact bun with short, green needles. It slowly spreads out, making an attractive groundcover, even on dry, sandy soils. Native farther north than any other American pine, banksiana displays a natural tolerance to tough conditions. Its cones point towards the tips of the branches, another feature that distinguishes this species.\n\nWildly undulating, pendulous branches give unique character to every plant of this distinctive form of Jack Pine. Plants bend and swoop to create a curvy, living sculpture decorated with resinous winter buds. This collector's plant, first discovered in a garden in Richfield, Minnesota, seems to be a reference to everyone's eccentric relative. Extremely hardy and adaptable, it tolerates heat, cold and dry, sandy or poor soils.\n\nAs its name implies, 'Diamant' is a diamond gem for the conifer collector. The small form of Chinese Lacebark Pine becomes a dense, green bun with short, fine needles that spiral around narrow stems. Originally found as a witch's broom in Hungary, it was introduced to the trade by Jeddeloh Nursery, Germany.\n\nNamed for the Ohio arboretum where it was found, this form of Chinese Lacebark Pine is noteworthy for its habit, which is neater, more compact, and more uniform than the open, irregular branching of the species. The tree's narrow needles have an interesting, waxy look, and the beautifully shaped tree displays showy bark, a patchwork of white, green, and brown, as it matures.\n\nPinus cembra\n\nUpright Broad\n\n3\n\nIntermediate\n\nGreen\n\nThe Swiss Stone Pine is a lush, conical tree that has great potential in the landscape. It stays moderately small with branching to the ground and a crown that broadens in maturity. Bundles of soft-to-the-touch, blue-green needles with blue-white inner surfaces give the tree a wonderful color for showing off its attractive, dark blue cones. Native to the mountains of central Europe, the Alps, and the Carpathians, this hardy selection is propagated from seed.\n\nThis narrow, upright selection of Swiss Stone Pine is a gorgeous tree with long, two-toned needles that twist and weave together to form lustrous, bushy branches. It is extremely hardy and needs little pruning to maintain a large, but slender stature. As yet underused, it makes a vastly superior alternative for Pinus flexilis 'Vanderwolf's Pyramid', especially in suburban landscapes. With slower growth, it fits in many positions and stays in scale. Trees develop large trunks and retain foliage to the base, unlike other pines that lose needles on shaded lower branches.\n\nThis compact, wider selection of Swiss Stone Pine grows slowly and has such a soft, fluffy look that it begs to be touched. Branches have a lush, bushy look, the result of 5-needle clusters of long, two-tone needles that twist and weave together. Extremely hardy, it maintains its form with little pruning and makes an elegant pyramidal addition to open spaces in full sun. It grows more slowly than 'Algonquin Pillar' or 'Silver Sheen' and performs admirably as an accent or in a mass.\n\nA beautiful, narrowly conical form of Swiss Stone Pine, 'Chalet' grows slowly into a dense, compact tree that is perfect for today's smaller landscapes. Clusters of soft-to-the-touch, blue-green needles with white undersides add a fluffy elegance to this extremely hardy choice, and colorful cones add character.\n\nPinus cembra 'Pygmaea'\n\nUpright Broad\n\n3\n\nIntermediate\n\nGreen\n\nNew shoots on this lush, mid-size pine are thick with buds that change over time into unique tufts of dark green, congested needles. Densely covered branches give the elegant, cone-like tree a tight, bushy look, but it stays moderately small and fits nicely in confined spaces, like courtyards and entries.\n\nA full, open habit distinguishes this Swiss Stone Pine, the largest of those we grow. Like other cembras, it produces long, two-toned needles that twist and weave together, forming bushy, blue-green branches with a \"silver sheen\". The beautiful, extremely hardy tree needs little pruning to stay in scale and makes a vastly superior alternative for Pinus flexilis 'Vanderwolf's Pyramid', especially in suburban landscapes. Deserving of greater use, it resists pests and disease, grows slowly and produces year-round beauty in many landscape positions.\n\nThanks to the insight and efforts of conifer proponent, Mr. Van Hoey Smith, this old (1855), distinctive cultivar was maintained and shared, assuring its preservation when conifers were not yet popular. Iseli received scions of the compact, slender column from the Trompenburg Arboretum Holland in 1988. Its distinctive shape, dense foliage and slow growth make it valuable and unique despite newer selections. Less blue than others, it takes on a muted gold cast in winter and complements gardens with yellow hues.\n\nNamed for an ancient German city in a nursery region similar to Oregon's Willamette Valley, this beautiful pine represents the finest in hardy garden conifers. Long, luxurious needles give the small, upright tree a full, fluffy look. Slower and wider than other cembras, it has graceful branching, attractive color and striking cones that offer year-round interest and character in a small space.\n\nThe deep, rich, golden-yellow winter color of 'Chief Joseph' creates a striking beacon of brightness in the drab winter landscape. Light to medium green during spring, summer and well into fall, this very slow-growing Lodgepole Pine changes color dramatically as days shorten and temperatures drop. Found by Doug Will in the Wallowa Mountains of northeastern Oregon, it has proven difficult to propagate.\n\nShort, closely set, dark green needles and a sweeping, irregular habit give this dwarf Shore Pine an unusual look that suggests coral. Named for the nurseryman who found it in Washington state, 'Spaan's Dwarf' develops a sturdy, open, upright branch structure and dramatic character with age. Slow growth and a wider-than-tall form make it a natural for rock garden, bonsai and container culture.\n\nBrilliant, golden-yellow, new growth erupts in spring and makes 'Taylor's Sunburst' a vibrant show-stopper. The striking color lasts for weeks, then gradually softens to a light, yellow-green as the foliage hardens. In spring, tiny red cones add contrast to this extraordinary Lodgepole Pine that was introduced by Alan Taylor, who found it high in the Colorado Rockies.\n\nPinus densiflora 'Globosa'\n\nGlobe Shaped\n\n4\n\nDwarf\n\nGreen\n\nThis outstanding selection of Japanese Red Pine provides gardens with superior year-round beauty. Its many upright branches create a dense, structural form, like an egg on its end. The needles, which are shorter and darker green than those of the Tanyosho types, stand up well to both cold and drought. Attractive bark with age.\n\nThe short, thick, bright green needles of this vibrant, dwarf Japanese Red Pine keep their color all year long. They grow densely along stout horizontal branches that give the unusual pine a flat-topped, low-growing habit. Prominent tan buds add interest to this seedling introduction from a witch's broom selected by Sydney Waxman, University of Connecticut.\n\nDesign options abound with this cascading pine. Left unstaked, it becomes a dense, creeping carpet as its wavy branches traverse the ground. With staking, its strongly pendulous branches drape down in waves, all of them decorated with reddish-brown bark and long, dark green needles. In spring, long, white-gray candles give the tree additional interest.\n\nJapanese Red Pine and Japanese Black Pine meet up in this attractive tuffet of a tree. With a flat top and rounded shape, the pine lends reliable, medium-green, mid-size structure to the landscape. Straight, stiff, green needles swirl radially around stiff, upright, light tan stems. This beauty comes from a seedling found by Rudolph Kluis in Marlboro, New Jersey in the 1970's.\n\nEach long, green needle of this spreading form of Limber Pine is striated with silvery-blue on two of its three sides, which gives the tree a glistening bluish cast. If staked upright, 'Glauca Pendula' develops a leader with wide-sweeping branches, and if left unstaked, the vigorous branches form a broad, undulating groundcover. Striking color, texture, and robust cone display add interest to any landscape. Prefers moist, well-drained soil.\n\nAn increasingly popular selection, 'Vanderwolf's Pyramid' makes a dramatic specimen tree or an effective screen or small grouping in large garden beds and borders. Long, blue-green needles cover the uniformly ascending branches, which together form a large, upright, pyramidal tree that broadens with age. Superb color and soft texture add a formal, but friendly look to the landscape. Prefers moist, well-drained soil.\n\nPinus hakkodensis\n\nUpright Broad\n\n5\n\nIntermediate\n\nBluish Green\n\nLong, twisted, green needles with powder-blue striations give this rare pine its bluish cast. A beautiful garden conifer with an open irregular habit, hakkodensis is a naturally occuring hybrid of Pinus parviflora and Pinus pumila. Found on Honshu Island, Japan and introduced to the trade by Joel Spingarn, Long Island, New York in 1982.\n\nFull puffs of long, narrow needles grace the branches of this small, rounded, Ponderosa-type pine. A seedling selected in 1980 by Pete Vergeldt in the Netherlands, it was named for his oldest son Jop. Much slower and smaller, but with the same 6-8\" needles as the immense West Coast native, it is adaptable and provides a big impact in a small, sunny rock garden, container or courtyard.\n\nPinus koraiensis\n\nUpright Broad\n\n3\n\nLarge\n\nBluish Green\n\nExceptionally soft and colorful, the Korean Pine packs a visual punch in larger landscapes. It produces bushy bundles of needles in three distinct colors (blue, green, and white), which gives the tree shimmer. In winter, loads of showy cones, iced with pitch, decorate the tree like ornaments. The cold-hardy, adaptable pine performs in a wide range of conditions.\n\nThis gorgeous cultivar of Bosnian Pine boasts clusters of clean, lustrous, dark green needles decorated with white resin on buds, candles and stems. The easy-care conifer with a big personality conjures words like chubby, squat and pyramidal, but none does justice to the compact, friendly dwarf with the sturdy constitution and almost cuddly presence. Another superior selection from this wonderful species, it requires no pruning to maintain its wide-bottomed form.\n\nThis plant is the utmost for avid conifer collectors. Tight clusters of fused needles create a needle assortment of various lengths, some straight, some twisted, and some with hooks on the end, all of which are spirally arranged around the stem. Widely spaced clumps form an open silhouette on this upright grower. Found as a seedling at Iseli Nursery.\n\nA very slow-growing, narrow tree, 'Compact Gem' is a time-honored treasure for the garden, especially one with limited space. The sturdy Bosnian Pine matures into a dense, well-proportioned, columnar tree that stays trim even after many years. Elegant, long, dark green needles cover the tree's branches thickly and contribute to a dynamic, full-size feel that fits in tight garden spaces. Superior disease and pest resistance and outstanding health assure year-round beauty. Originally introduced to the trade in 1964 by Hillier Nursery in England, 'Compact Gem' warrants continued acclaim and wider use in today's tighter garden spaces.\n\nOur ongoing efforts to find improved compact conifers resulted in the discovery of this outstanding narrow pine. Upright branches on the tall, trim tree display pairs of elegant, dark green needles accented by silvery white fascicles and bark. 'Emerald Arrow' gives the impression of being a big tree, yet it stays decidedly narrow. Whether used as an individual focal point, paired to mark the entrance to house or garden, or grouped in an informal cluster, this beautiful garden pine scores a bull's eye on the designer's dartboard.\n\nNamed for the eye-catching, cobalt blue cones that decorate each shoot tip in spring, this precocious \"coner\" demands attention and deserves greater use in gardens. From an early age, cones appear up and down every branch, bright blue at first, then gradually softening to brown during summer. Attractive, broadly upright trees develop an open, slightly asymmetrical shape, which affords each tree a unique character that will intrigue gardeners in their outdoor living spaces. The healthy, easy-to-grow trees retain their ornamental cones and their stiff, dark green needles, giving trees a beautiful, tidy, clean appearance throughout the year.\n\nThis sturdy, dwarf Bosnian Pine boasts a handsome, broadly pyramidal form that stays compact, neat and well-mannered. Trees gradually widen into a classic bell shape, narrow at the top, broader near the ground and about as wide as tall. A mature 'Irish Bell' displays a colony of upright branches, each one decorated with tufts of straight green needles and glistening white fascicles. The bright white accent gives the impression that light dances among the needles, a feature that accentuates the beauty of this useful ornamental pine and adds to its value as a striking garden specimen. Well regarded in the trade, this selection is a good choice for urban and suburban gardens for year-round impact.\n\nPinus leucodermis (heldreichii) 'Iseli Fastigiate'\n\nUpright Narrow\n\n5\n\nLarge\n\nGreen\n\nA superior cultivar to fit today's smaller outdoor living spaces, the narrow, tall tree provides a stately architectural presence without overwhelming its space. Long, upright branches, covered with pairs of long, lush, dark green needles, practically parallel the trunk, giving the shapely columnar tree a distinctly vertical posture. 'Iseli Fastigiate' makes a significant statement through all seasons, but its big, lush form fits comfortably into a surprisingly compact space. Utilize its unique, structural qualities to provide dynamic vertical accents in the garden, to frame an attractive view, to screen an unsightly one, or to provide privacy.\n\nShaped more like a broad teardrop than a gourmet truffle, this highly useful Bosnian Pine is nevertheless a wonderful treat. Dense, finely textured, green needles cover every shoot completely, in contrast to some cultivars that reveal bare stems. Characterized by restrained, slow growth, gently incurving branches and a compact, well-proportioned form, 'Mint Truffle' offers gardeners a tasty option for adding year-round beauty to a small garden. Very little needle drop and exceptionally good health, including resistance to disease and pests and tolerance of a variety of conditions, contribute to the value of this unique plant.\n\nPinus leucodermis (heldreichii) 'Satellit'\n\nUpright Narrow\n\n5\n\nLarge\n\nGreen\n\nDense, brushlike clusters of long, luxurious needles give this superior, narrow cultivar a full look, but its slim, upright form fits in a smaller garden. When young, the rich green spire has an open look, but with maturity, the upright shoots fill in with tightly held needles. Year-round elegance and reliable performance make it a choice addition to the sunny site, a great focal point with exceptional health and tolerance to disease, salt and drought.\n\nOne of the nicest of the Bosnian Pine cultivars, this choice bush-form miniature deserves a prominent position in a very small space, such as a container or rock garden. A rare, highly desirable cultivar, 'Smidtii' maintains its neat, compact habit without any pruning, shaping or shearing. The extremely small bush with tightly congested, dark green needles, very slow growth and a rugged, durable constitution provides striking beauty and long life in even the smallest spaces. A 100-year-old specimen, discovered in 1926 in the mountains near Sarajevo by Eugen Smidt, had retained its dense, compact character and reached only 10' tall in a century.\n\nPronouncing the name of this beautiful cultivar from Horstmann Nursery in Schneverdingen, Germany, is much more difficult than growing it. Feel free to use the translation for \"zwerg,\" which is \"gnome\" or \"dwarf\" to get a sense of the compact habit of this excellent landscape tree. Long, fine, dark green needles circle the upright branches, giving the elegant tree a lush, full appearance. The outstanding Bosnian Pine develops a more open habit with maturity, but stays slim enough for narrow garden spaces.\n\nPinus monticola 'Pendula'\n\nWeeping\n\n5\n\nIntermediate\n\nGreen\n\nA rare, pendulous form of Western White Pine, this cultivar is more adaptable to drier, sandier soil than Eastern White Pine, which it resembles. The smooth, gray-brown bark of youth gradually develops fissures and rectangular plates with age. 'Pendula' can be trained to a specific height when young, then allowed to cascade and drape to ground level.\n\nAdd some color to the winter garden with this globe shaped Mugo Pine. The display of light green needles throughout the growing season turns to a golden yellow with cooler temperatures in fall. The warm color maintains through the winter, returning to green as the new growth emerges in the spting. This plant has the characteristic toughness and durability of all Mugo Pines.\n\nBoldly textured, medium length needles make this sturdy, upright, multi-stemmed tree a favorite for areas in the landscape with a little more room. The slow-growing trees become taller than wide and quite bushy. Very hardy with a unique, dense habit, 'Big Tuna's resinous buds turn showy during cold winter months and stand out distinctly against dark green foliage.\n\nA very narrow, upright Mugo Pine, this cultivar is perfect for tight landscape spaces where a strong vertical accent is appropriate. Conspicuous buds, coated with white, waxy resin, stand out against long, dark green needles in winter, and colors intensify as the seasons change. The compact columnar habit is open enough to show off interesting reddish orange bark. Plants reliably produce small ornamental cones too.\n\nDonna's Mini TRUdwarf® Mugo Pine stays tiny even when mature, so the super-slow-growing, evergreen dome won't outgrow a trough or rock garden. Its very short, green needles are only 5/8\" long, and they cover the thickly held branchlets densely, producing a very smooth overall texture. Discovered at Iseli Nursery, the congested conifer seems to resemble a small sea urchin or pincushion.\n\nThis exciting new selection from Denmark naturally has the aesthetics associated with an ancient skillfully manicured bonsai specimen. The dark green needles are set artfully against the strong trunk and branch structure giving this slow-growing pine the look of venerable age and beauty without the need for human manipulation.\n\nCurving, twisted needles of different lengths give this extremely dense evergreen a playful look, which seems appropriate, since the cute bun-shaped plant was named for the granddaughter of conifer enthusiast Thom deLange. Many bright brown buds stand out prominently on dense branches of vibrant green needles. Cutting grown to assure uniform size, shape and color, this miniature selection will liven up the rock garden or trough.\n\nExtremely slow-growing and dense, this tiny, bun-shaped conifer looks like a mound of moss. It sports so many short branchlets and so many slightly twisted, short needles that the surface appears smooth. A TRUdwarf® mugo selected by John Mitsch of Aurora, Oregon, the reliable, consistent pine takes on a frosted look when its waxy buds emerge. Site this distinctive beauty in a prime location in the rock garden, trough or miniature railroad.\n\nPredictable and uniform, this extremely slow-growing TRUdwarf® Mugo Pine was found as a witch's broom on Pinus mugo 'Mops' at Iseli Nursery. Since it grows only about 1\" a year, the dense, miniature dome is an excellent choice for the smallest sites: rock garden, trough or miniature railroad. Prominent buds stand out against the very short, medium green needles of this reliable, hardy selection in winter.\n\nThis genuinely dwarf selection grows into a low, dense dome that stays compact without shearing. The mounding plant has a smooth appearance that comes from many evenly spaced needles growing at a uniform rate on abundant branchlets. During most of the year, 'Mops' displays a hint of gray/blue in its green, but during the crisp, cold months of winter, needles take on a warm, golden hue. It's no wonder this choice is one of our most popular for confined spaces.\n\nFor longer needles, a more natural, open look and a consistent habit, the versatile TRUdwarf® 'Palouse' is perfect for a casual landscape where a larger Mugo Pine is warranted. The robust green selection grows into a bushy, rounded mound, or with annual candle pruning, it can be kept smaller and more refined. A reliable and hardy addition to the sunny mixed border, it also works well as a divider or to fill a corner.\n\nPinus mugo 'Paul's Dwarf'\n\nGlobe Shaped\n\n2\n\nDwarf\n\nGreen\n\nCollectors, bonsai and rock garden enthusiasts value the extremely short needles and a relatively open habit of this choice, miniature TRUdwarf® mugo. Needles on the low, mounding plant are separated slightly more than those on some of the denser plants, which gives the tiny plant a more natural look. It maintains an attractive medium green throughout the seasons and combines perfectly with the scale of the choicest alpine plants.\n\nPart of the miniature group of TRUdwarf® mugos, 'Sherwood Compact' boasts short, stiff branches that are heavily clothed with slightly twisted needles. Discovered in the 1950's by plantsman Andy Sherwood, the compact, dense mound produces rich green foliage with golden tips in winter and white fascicles that give plants a radiant look.\n\nSometimes the best prize comes in the smallest package. Such is the case for this tiny, quintessential alpine conifer. An extremely slow-growing introduction from Iseli Nursery, it stands out among Pinus mugo selections for its unusually tiny needles that cover very short branches. Many visible buds punctuate the foliage and contribute to the dynamic presence of this dense, slightly irregular, miniature bun. A reliable, very hardy TRUdwarf® selection.\n\nFor the mugo you always hoped for, try 'Slowmound.' This Iseli introduction has so many superior traits that it is designated a Jean Iseli Signature plant, a distinction reserved for plants that exhibit \"marked improvement\" over others on the market. The dense, dark green mound is one of the best, with highly reliable color, texture, growth rate and habit. Beautiful year-round, it produces many showy buds and matures to a wide, even shape that is naturally compact. At only 1-2' in 10 years, it works well in even the most confined areas.\n\nThis perfectly formed Christmas tree shaped tree displays an exceptionally good habit and the tough constitution of other mugos. Believed to be the first single-stem tree form of Mugo Pine to be commercially produced and distributed, it was selected from hundreds of seedlings in the trial beds of McCrory Gardens at South Dakota State University. Foliage is rich green with a hint of gray/blue, even during winter. Highly adaptable to a wide range of environmental and climatic conditions and very hardy. The original plant reached 10 to 11' tall and 6' wide after 25 years.\n\nThis dwarf mugo sports tiny, uniformly straight, rich green needles, a very neat habit and extremely slow growth. Needles are held radially, spreading out from the center on each of many, short, well-clothed branches. Terminal buds are very showy, and the tight globose plant will not outgrow even the smallest garden space.\n\n'Valley Cushion' offers a spreading habit to the mix of TRUdwarf® mugo choices. The very compact, dense pine stays low and flat, much wider than tall. Reddish, new buds complement the short, medium green needles, and plants grow very slowly, so they require little or no pruning. Selected at the North Willamette Research Station in Oregon's famed Willamette Valley, this cultivar is extremely hardy and an excellent choice for cold parts of the country.\n\nIn winter, this unique Iseli introduction shows off an exceptional seasonal trait. Cold weather brings a white resinous coating to each terminal bud, producing a dramatic frosty effect against the plant's dark green winter foliage. During the rest of the year, the reliably low, globe-shaped plant requires little care and maintains its small stature without candle pruning. Highly desirable for rock garden, entry or border."

We're looking for a deciduous tree that doesn't grow too tall, maybe 20'. We'd like it to have spreading branches to provide shade during the summer and it needs to tolerate wind. It's going to be near the house so we don't want anything known to cause problems with foundations. We get some fog in the summer, heat in the spring and fall and rain in the winter. We'd also like a tree that's not too messy. We're replacing an almost dead fast growing brittle tree that drops branches in the winter winds, flowers in the spring, seed pods in the summer and tiny gutter clogging leaves in the fall.\n\nANSWER:\n\nMr. Smarty Plants feels that the best bet for deciduous trees native to your area would be Quercus kelloggii (California black oak), Quercus douglasii (Blue oak), Quercus lobata (Valley oak), or Acer macrophyllum (Bigleaf maple). The oaks all grow rather slowly, so that it would take many years for them to surpass the 20 foot height you prefer. You will see by clicking on the underlined names that the Valley oak ultimately grows much taller than the other two species. The growth rate of the Bigtooth maple is considerably greater than that of the oaks.The maple naturally grows in moist valleys, and you would need to provide it with more water than needed for the oaks. I am assuming that your homestead is in a dry area typical of your part of California.\n\nThis web site provides information about the care of oaks. They are generally free of disease and insect problems. But Sudden Oak Death has been found to affect some California black oak trees. The Bigleaf maple is relatively resistant to disease.\n\nThe Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center Image Gallery does not contain photos of these trees, but I incluce photos from the Internet of California black oak, Blue oak, Valley oak, and Bigleaf Maple. Any of these trees should be available at one of your local plant nurseries. Winter is the least stressful season for tree planting.\n\nMore Trees QuestionsWhat eats American holly bushes in winter?

      "text": "Introduction\n\nOne of the hardiest of the bauhinias, Brazilian Orchid-Tree is a deciduous to semi-evergreen tree reaching 25 to 30 feet in height with interesting twisted ascending branches which droop at the ends, an often-leaning trunk, and large, bilobed, dark green leaves. The beautiful, white, three to four-inch-wide, orchid-like blooms appear in abundance from spring through summer and are followed by flat, dark brown seed pods. Brazilian Orchid-Tree makes a spectacular vase-shaped specimen, shade, or patio tree, or fits well into a mixed shrubbery border. The trees vary in form when young from one individual to the next so uniform plantings are difficult to achieve. Trees become more uniform and symmetrical as they grow older. Probably too messy and sensitive to alkaline soil for a residential or downtown street tree but would grow well and be suited for a median strip where the debris would be washed away and less noticeable.\n\nUse and Management\n\nOrchid trees benefit from some pruning early in their life to increase branchiness and to produce a form which will be suited for most landscapes. Left unpruned, many trees are beautiful, forming multiple trunks and branches close to the ground which is fine for specimen use in a lawn area or other open-space landscapes. Purchase trees with one trunk for parking lot or other urban landscapes where vehicular clearance will be necessary. Be sure to train branches so they will grow up before they spread out. If this is not done, lower branches will droop toward the ground and they may have to be removed, disfiguring the tree. Orchid trees drop fruit, small branches and leaves periodically so some people consider it a messy tree. But regularly fertilized in an acid soil, orchid tree is a wonderful flowering tree.\n\nGrowing in full sun or high, shifting pine shade, orchid tree thrives in any well-drained soil but in alkaline soils will show interveinal chlorosis (yellowing) on the leaves. Potassium deficiency shows up as necrosis, magnesium deficiency as chlorosis. Although tolerant of some drought, Brazilian Orchid-Tree should receive some afternoon shade, or irrigation, in hot, dry weather to prevent the blooms from shrivelling up. The flowers are followed by many brown, woody, 12-inch-long seed pods which fill the tree and could be considered unattractive on the tree in the winter and a nuisance when they drop.\n\nPropagation is by seed, suckers, layerings, or cuttings.\n\nPests and Diseases\n\nNo pests or diseases are of major concern. Potassium, magnesium and micronutrient deficiencies are common. Orchid tree seeds itself into the landscape.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1.\n\nThis document is ENH248"

      "text": "ICD-9 / Health Information\n\nOak wilt is a fungal disease which can quickly kill an oak tree. The tree reacts to the presence of the fungus by plugging its own cambial tissue in an attempt to block the fungus from spreading further. As the area around cambium (the vascular tissue) is crucial for delivering nutrients and water to the rest of the plant, this plug prevents them from travelling up the trunk of the tree, eventually killing it.The fungus originated in eastern Russia, and was brought into North America by human trade. It is very similar to Dutch elm disease. It affects much of the eastern and central US, from Virginia to Minnesota to Arkansas, with pockets of infection down to Texas. It is particularly common in the Midwest.\n\nInfections and Symptoms\n\nOak wilt spreads in two basic ways. A transmission via root graft is the most common source of infection, as trees within as much as 15 m (50 feet) of an infected tree can be infected. The second method of infection is via sap beetles. These beetles are attracted to the bleeding sap of the oak tree, as well as the fungus in an infected or dead tree, and so can transfer the disease to healthy but injured trees. This is less common as trees are rarely infected this way unless injured, but it is the only way to jump barriers (rivers, for example) and infect trees in new areas. Oak wilt is identifiable by the rapid pattern of wilting starting from the top of the tree and progressively dying down to the bottom, and on specific leaves, wilting from the edges to the base. Oak with oak wilt stand out with their dead crown compared to a green canopy in the summer, so much so that oak wilt infections can be spotted from the air. A new infection via beetles instead of root grafts can kill a tree somewhat more slowly, if a branch is infected instead of the trunk.\n\nEffects on Species\n\nOak wilt affects all oak species, but has somewhat different effects on different groups. Red Oaks such as the Northern red oak are particularly susceptible, and when infected, generally die over the course of a single summer. White oaks are more resistant, and can live for several years after infection, losing a few branches each season (from the top down). White oaks in particular are resistant. Some types of white oak, such as bur oak are more susceptible, although still not as much as red oaks.Although possible, it is rare for oak wilt to jump between oaks of different species via root grafting. Different species do not graft often, and so contaminate each other less frequently.\n\nManagement\n\nAlthough similar to Dutch Elm Disease, Oak wilt is more controllable. Prevention is key, as there is no permanent cure. To prevent beetle transmission, oaks should never be pruned in the spring months. Late fall and early winter are preferable. Also, care should be taken to prevent injury during this period, particularly during construction. If a tree is injured through a storm or accident in the spring, tree paint to cover the wound is advised, although it is not a good idea in general. Reducing the source of infection is also helpful. Dead oaks should be checked for fungal mats in the spring, and if present, all wood should be chipped, burned, or covered in plastic. Logs from wilted trees should never be moved to unaffected areas, even for firewood.If a tree is discovered to be infected, a trench (or better yet, two at different distances) should be dug between it and any other trees of its species to prevent root graft disease transmission. This will sever any root grafts that could carry the disease to neighboring trees. Injections of propaconazole can help to prevent transmission as well. Injections every other year can also be used to treat a white oak, if it is not yet greatly affected, although this is expensive. An infected tree should not be immediately cut down, as this can force the oak wilt down into the roots to affect other trees, and can also injure nearby trees and make them more susceptible to beetle transmission. The tree should be cut down the following fall, and debarked, chipped, burned, or covered in plastic by the next spring to prevent contamination by fungal mats."

      "text": "Finally, fall is here. The weather is becoming slightly cooler, and gardeners are slowly migrating back outdoors after record-breaking heat this summer. Now is a perfect time to add a new tree or a grouping of shrubs to the landscape. Or perhaps you have an area in the landscape that needs \"remodeling\" or rejuvenating. The fall may be the best season to plant, surpassing even the spring.\n\nMany people prefer January through March for planting, but the fall months of September through December have distinct advantages. Fall planting follows the heat of summer, and precedes a cool winter season. Trees and shrubs planted use this to good advantage. Plant roots grow anytime the soil temperature is 40 degrees or higher, which may occur all winter in Texas. During the winter months, the root systems of the fall-planted specimens develop and become established. When spring arrives, this expanded root system can support and take advantage of the full surge of spring growth.\n\nFall planting is the optimum time to plant balled and burlapped trees and shrubs. Balled and burlapped plants have ample time to recover from transplanting and proliferate roots before spring growth begins. Remember however, all bare root plants, including roses and pecan and fruit trees should be planted in late winter when they are completely dormant.\n\nWhen buying plants for your landscape, be sure to get healthy, well-grown plants. Always buy from a reputable dealer. Those in the plant selling business year-round depend on repeat customers, and only by selling customers quality plants can there be assurance of future business. Beware of plant bargains. They can easily turn out to be real headaches. A bargain is no good if it dies. The price tag, especially the cheapest one, is not the best guide to quality.\n\nAll plants have growing requirements. Think about the plant's needs before you invest. Is it adapted to your area's soil? Will it grow in sun or shade? Does it need a wet or dry location? Is it cold hardy? Some nurseries have this type of information on tags beside the plant. If not, ask a nursery professional or the county Extension agent.\n\n'Plan before you plant' is always a good rule of thumb. Whether you are planting a single plant or an entire landscape, plan first, then plant. Good planning is a worthwhile investment of time that will pay off in greater enjoyment of attractive and useful home grounds, and in increasing the value of your home. It's much easier to move plants on paper than to dig them after planting in the wrong place. A plan saves many planting mistakes.\n\nEvery plant in the landscape should serve a purpose. Ask yourself if you want a plant for screening, for privacy, or for shade. How large will it be five years from now? Plants, like people, grow up. Remember, that a small one-gallon size plant will look entirely different after a few years of growth in your landscape.\n\nPlant properly for success. Here are a few guidelines on getting the job done right:\n\nDig a hole large enough in diameter so that the root system has at least six inches of clearance on all sides. The root ball should rest on a solid soil foundation, so don't dig the hole much deeper than the ball.\n\nPlant the tree or shrub slightly above the level of the surrounding soil, to allow for settling and increased soil drainage.\n\nCarefully place the tree or shrub in the hole. Handle the plant by the root ball, not by the trunk. A broken ball of earth can mean a dead plant. Always remove any container before you plant.\n\nBackfill the hole, using only the native soil removed from the hole; do not use soil amendments when planting large shrubs and trees. Fill the hole, and firm the soil around the plant. Water thoroughly to settle the soil around the roots and to eliminate any air pockets.\n\nDo not fertilize your tree or shrub after planting. Wait until early in the spring to do this, and even then, go lightly. Heavy applications of fertilizer may burn and injure the root system, and could possibly kill the plant.\n\nWatering has been and remains paramount in transplanting. At the time of transplanting, soak the root ball and surrounding soil. A thorough watering every 7 to 10 days dramatically increases the success ratio. More frequent watering may encourage root rot. Remember more trees and shrubs fail from over watering than from under watering.\n\nBefore calling it a day, add 4 to 6 inches of mulch around the base of newly planted trees and shrubs. This helps to keep down weeds and conserve soil moisture. Use pine bark, compost, grass clippings, or leaves.\n\nFall is for planting. Visit your nursery today, and beautify and add value to your home."

      "text": "After all, the tree was being planted outside the Leonard branch library in Williamsburg that is described in the 1943 classic and that Ms. Smith herself frequented during her childhood.\n\nAnd what better symbol of big-city resilience, even today? Ailanthus altissima, the Tree-of-Heaven, served as an allegory to Ms. Smith's own impoverished World War I-era childhood, as well as that of the book's main character. Often considered a \"least wanted\" tree, it sprouts happily in sidewalk cracks and growing rapidly to 20 feet in a few seasons. It is so hardy that the death of large numbers of them a decade ago alarmed the state environmentalists. It is so hardy that annoyed neighbors have contemplated arborcide.\n\n\"No matter where its seed fell,\" wrote Ms. Smith, who died in 1972 at age 75, \"it made a tree which struggled to reach the sky. It grew in boarded-up lots and out of neglected rubbish heaps and it was the only tree that grew out of cement. It grew lushly, but only in the tenements districts.\"\n\n6 Comments\n\nAilanthus grows quite large, very quickly. Go to the library- there is only a small space between the fence, tree and flagpole. This is an old, urban library with no real green space around it. A bigger tree would block the flagpole and the beautiful Carnegie building. As an aside, check out the historical photos from the 20s and 50s on the Library's website, showing a small, shrub-like ornamental tree. That kind of tree was there when Betty Smith went to the library.\n\nFascinating story. I read years ago that the ailanthus was brought to the United States via the China trade, possibly as seeds or seedlings in the burlap bales used to transport goods, but this wikipedia article  claims that its introduction was deliberate – as with so-called \"Long Island Duckling\" and cured \"Virginia Ham.\"\n\nThose last two appear all-American, but, like the main ingredient in apple pie, they came here directly or indirectly , via the China trade. It was, if I recollect correctly, the Chinese who first domesticated the duck, and who devised the curing techniques used in making preserved ham.\n\nI live in a five-story 50-unit brick apartment house in Jersey City. Until a decade ago, two ailanthus had thrived for years in the building's courtyard, reaching to a point just three feet short of the roof of the building.\n\nBut squirrels used the trees to get to the upper floors. A tenant who reacts to squirrels as no better than rats complained about them as \"weeds\" and they were cut down.\n\nThe squirrels found a different route, but with the ailanthus missing, the touch of nature and the shade they offered in the summer are now gone for good.\n\nWhile probably one more Ailanthus in Brooklyn wouldn't alter the overall ecology the trees are regarded by botanists as noxious weeds. This is from the Plant Conservation Alliance's Alien Plant Working Group:\n\n\"… All parts of the tree, especially the flowers, have a strong, offensive odor, which some have likened to peanuts or cashews…..ECOLOGICAL THREAT\nTree-of-heaven is a prolific seed producer, grows rapidly, and can overrun native vegetation. Once established, it can quickly take over a site and form an impenetrable thicket. Ailanthus trees also produces toxins that prevent the establishment of other plant species. The root system is aggressive enough to cause damage to sewers and foundations…\"\n\nHaving said that and despite it all I admit to having once thought more than halfway seriously of planting an Ailanthus here in my Massachusetts back yard figuring that if I couldn't return to my native Brooklyn to live anytime soon I could at least bring a piece of Brookyn here.\n\nPlanting a serviceberry, depending on what they exactly mean by that, could actually be a wonderful substitute. Serviceberry berries are quite tasty, and they were eaten for a long time in North America in jams and pies. Unfortunately, they haven't really been taken up by the industrial food system very often, so they're a bit unknown now. Although an ornamental serviceberry might not be exactly the same, planting some kinds of serviceberry could be a move that would hardly be gentrification…\n\nAilanthus shares the same struggle as do the people it shares its habitat. It is ignored, maligned and seen as an ugly, alien, wild, overpopulating scourge to be eliminated by the dominant American society. It is referred to as \"Ghetto Palm\" a weed to be gentrified and replaced by well-behaved, groomed, attractive and domesticated plants. Despite the odds, it continues to thrive where few other plants survive.\n\nUnlike Americans, the Chinese call it the \"Tree of Heaven.\" They use its wood to make fine cabinetry, its leaves to feed silk moths, and its extracts to treat a variety of ailments from dysentery to cancer. The Europeans highly regard its beauty so much so that it is featured in their prized botanical gardens and used to line their posh urban streets. Another man's trash, indeed, is another man's gold. In the same vain, Europeans and Chinese highly regard and cherish Hip Hop music and culture that arise out of America's untouchable, outcaste ghettos.\n\nAilanthus is fundamentally Hip Hop. Its distinctive branches and leaves should be emblazoned as a symbol on the hoodies, jackets, and sneakers of rappers as a symbol of the common roots it shares with this mighty and noble plant. Given its alien origins, it is a symbol of peoples who were imported to the US who are no longer seen as valuable and continues to thrive despite neglect, stigmatization and eradication attempts.\n\nServiceberry, Amelanchier, shadberry or shadblow bush … these are North America native plants, and well worth restoring to their old home.\n\nSome are small shrubs, others small trees, although left to their own devices, some of them can become quite tall — my mother was given one from William Carlos Williams' yard about 20 years ago; it now is almost as tall as the house next door, although the branches are slim and twiggy in comparison with the nearby horsechestnut trees"

      "text": "Softwood Trees\n\nNova Scotia has 10 native softwoods or conifers- Red, black, and white spruce, balsam fir, white, red and Jack pine, hemlock, eastern larch also known as tamarack, and eastern cedar.\nIn addition there are several introduced species, such as Scotch pine, Austrian pine, Norway spruce and Colorado blue spruce.\n\nEastern Larch (Tamarack)\nTamarack has the hardest wood of the native conifers. It will tolerate a wide variety of growing conditions, but due to its intolerance to shade it is often found growing near swamps and marshes where many other tree species cannot survive.\nTamarack is unique in that it is the only softwood that completely sheds its needles on an annual basis. In the late autumn glow it presents a stunning sight when the needle leaves turn a golden hue colour.\n\nPlanting Benefits\nTamarack will survive in damp areas\nwith acidic soil.\nThe cones provide seed for finches, siskins and crossbills.\nA fast growing tree that can grow up to 70 ft on fertile land.\nThe wood is often used for fence posts and can easily last up to 10 years buried in the ground without preservatives.\n\nPlanting Tips\nTamarack has fibrous roots and is relatively easy to transplant.\nDoes well in damp, cool areas.\nIt has a very low tolerance for shade.\n\nEastern Hemlock\nA massive and majestic tree of the Acadian forest.\nA stand of old-growth Hemlock\nis a memorable sight. Such a stand can be viewed on protected islands in the Tobeatic Wilderness area. Well worth the time and effort spent to reach this destination and to reflect and marvel at the age and size of these majestic trees.\n\nPlanting Benefits\nA long lived tree 300-500 years.\nDoes well in cool environments on North facing slopes.\nResponds well to clipping - a line of young hemlock can easily be trimmed into a hedge.\nRetains its lower branches which can provide winter shelter for wildlife.\n\nEastern Cedar Cedar is a slow growing, long-lived tree with a pronounced conical shape. It can reach 50ft in height and live for 350 years.\nThe leaves are\nscalelike in appearance and overlap to form a dense, dark yellow-green foilage. The bark is dark brown and shreddy with an obvious taper to the trunk.\n\nPlanting Benefits\nOften planted in yards as an ornamental.\nThe wood is strong and light with excellent decay resistance.\nCedar shavings are fragrant and often used for pet bedding, or can be loosely bagged and placed in a trunk to impart\ntheir scent to stored items.\nCedar is easily clipped and shaped to form a cedar hedge, or a yard centre-piece.\nThe overlapping foilage provides nesting cover and winter shelter for various small birds.\n\nPlanting Tips\nCedar does best in an alkaline to neutral soil, but they will grow in less favourable soil types. I have a few cedars growing along the northern edge of my wild blueberry field and more in my front yard.\nIt Is moderately shade tolerant\nand has a long-reaching root system capable of tolerating extreme sites, such as cliff faces.\n\nRed Pine A fast growing pine that can reach 80ft in height and live for 200 years. The needles are long and brittle, bundled in pairs. Red Pine bark is flaky and reddish brown in young trees. As the tree ages the bark forms flat, plate like structures on the trunk.\n\nPlanting Benefits Suited to restoration of dry,poor soils and acidic lands. Ideal for planting in clearings and old fields, in parks and open areas. The root system is relatively deep and wide-spreading which helps to secure the tree in high winds.\nOften used for Christmas wreaths. The seed is a favourite food of the pine siskin,chickadees and nuthatches.\n\nPlanting Tips\nRed pine requires an open location with adequate light and does well in acidic,sandy soils.\n\nWhite Pine\nThe tallest of eastern softwoods. White pine can reach 115ft in height with a 4ft diameter at chest height. This tree was much sought after and used as masts for sailing ships in the late 1700s.\nAn easy identifcation method is W:H:I:T:E consists of five letters, which is the same amount of needles bundled on a twig. Red pine, Jack pine, Scotch pine and Austrian pine all have needles bundled in two's.\n\nPlanting Benefits\nIs moderately shade tolerant\nand can be underplanted in existing woodlots."

      "text": "General Information:Red cedar is an evergreen growing 40 to 50 feet tall in\nan oval, columnar, or pyramidal form (very diverse) and\nspreading 8 to 15 feet when given a sunny location. It\ndevelops a brownish tint in winter in the north and is\nsometimes used in windbreaks or screens. The fruit is a\nblue berry on female trees and is ornamental when\nproduced in quantity. Birds devour the fruit and 'plant'\nit along farm fences and in old abandoned fields. Some\nbotanists do not separate J. virginiana from silicicola.\nThe eastern red cedar is not a true cedar (genus Cedrus),\nit is actually a variety of juniper. It occurs naturally\nas an upright tree with many small branches, curving\nsharply upward. Old trees often have many natural jin on\nthe lower part of the trunk, and that branches are more\nnearly horizontal. The wood of the red cedar is fragrant\nand is\nused extensively for furniture. The foliage is bright\ngreen to dark\ngreen. With sufficient early training, the red cedar can be\nused for most styles, though multiple-trunk styles\nprobably require planting multiple trees close together.\nCascade and semi-cascade styles could be a challenge,\ngiven the strong apex dominance of this tree.\n\nFamily: Cupressaceae\n\nLighting:Full sun or\npart shade.\n\nTemperature: Hardy in\nzone 2 through 9.\n\nWatering:Spray the\nfoliage with water daily during the growing\nseason. Water when the soil is moderately dry (to a\ndepth of 1/2 to 1\ninch) but do not let the soil dry out completely. Feeding:Simon and\nSchuster's recommends feeding junipers from early spring\nto autumn ever 20-30 days using a slow-acting organic\nfertilizer. If you prefer to use chemical fertilizers,\napply a half-strength solution every other week of a\nreasonably balanced fertilizer, such as Peter's\n20-20-20. You may wish to alternate with an acidic\nfertilizer such as Miracid. You should not fertilize\nduring the hottest part of the summer\n(July-mid August in the northern hemisphere), or if the\ntree is weak or has recently (2-4 weeks) been repotted.\n\nPruning and wiring:\nReduce the roots gradually, removing no more than one\nthird of the roots at each repotting. To develop the\nfoliage, pinch out the tender new shoots using your\nfingers. Do not use scissors, as the cut needles will\nturn brown. Pinching must be done continuously during\nthe growing season. Prune undesirable branches\n(especially those growing straight down from their\nparent branch) when repotting or during the growing\nseason. Wiring is best done in autumn or early winter,\nso that the branches can become accustomed to their new\nposition while the tree is dormant.\nWiring done at other times must be watched carefully for\nsigns of wire cutting into the bark, and must be removed\nimmediately if this happens. If necessary, the tree can\nbe re-wired after removing the old wire.\n\nPropagation:Cuttings\nor layering.\n\nRepotting:Repot young\ntrees (up to 10 years) every other year. Repot older\ntrees every 3-4 years. Repotting is best done in spring.\nJunipers can also be repotted in autumn if necessary,\nsince they enter a period of renewed root growth at that\ntime. Extensive root pruning in autumn is probably not a\ngood idea, however. For junipers, Simon and Schuster's\nrecommends 60% soil, 10% peat, and 30% coarse sand.\nRémy Samson recommends 1 part loam, 1 part leaf mold,\nand 1 part coarse sand. Peter Chan recommends 1 part\nloam, 1 part peat, and 3 parts coarse sand. The tree\nshould be protected from wind and direct sun for a month\nor two after repotting.\n\nPests and diseases:\nPests: Bagworm caterpillars occasionally web foliage and\ndebris together to make bags up to two inches long. The\ninsects live in the bags and emerge to feed on the\nfoliage. Use sprays of Bacillus thuringiensis. The\ninsects can also be picked off the plants by hand.\nJuniper scale causes yellowed needles, and infected\nbranches fail to produce new growth. The scale is round\nand at first white, later turning gray or black. The\nJuniper webworm webs twigs and needles together, causing\nthem to brown and die. The larva is 1/2-inch-long and is\nbrown with darker stripes. The larvae are often in the\ndensest part of the plant and can go unnoticed. Mites\ncause\nstippled and bronzed foliage.\n\nDiseases:Twig blights\ncause death and browning of twigs tips. The diseases may\nprogress down the stem killing the whole branch. Small\nlesions may be seen at the base of dead tissue. Prune\nout dead branch tips. Dieback from Kabatina blight\nappears in early spring, from Phomopsis in summer. Three\nrust diseases seen most often are\ncedar-apple rust, hawthorn rust, and quince rust. The\nmost common is cedar-apple rust. On Juniper the first\ntwo diseases form galls and orange jelly-like horns in\nspring. The horns are most likely to form following\nperiods of rainy, warm weather. Spores formed in the\nhorns infect the alternate host. The diseases are more\nserious on the\nalternate host than Juniper. Prune out the spore horns\nwhen seen in the spring. Do not plant near hawthorns,\napples, or crabapples. Junipers are not tolerant of ice\ncoatings. Expect dieback when Junipers are covered with\nice for several days. Removing the ice is\nimpractical. Junipers are a favorite victim of red\nspider mites. If the tree appears weak, with yellowing\nfoliage, it may have spider mites. To check for spider\nmites, hold a sheet of white paper under a branch and\ngently shake the foliage. If the paper comes away with\nmany small dots that move, it has spider mites. To\ncombat spider mites, spray with\ninsecticidal soap or a nicotine solution (which can be\nmade by soaking tobacco in water overnight)."

All it would need to say is common sweetshrub (Calycanthus floridus): Smell it, love it, plant it.\n\nAbove: Common sweetshrub (Calycanthus floridus)\n\nOne of two plants in my backyard just started to bloom, and the fruity fragrance of the flowers gathers outside the back door whenever the air is still. William Cullina provided an effective description of the fragrance in his Native Trees, Shrubs, & Vines (Houghton Mifflin, 2002). He summed it up as \"a fruit salad perfume of strawberry, banana, mango, and peach guaranteed to get your stomach rumbling.\"\n\nEastern white pine (Pinus strobus) won't ever make the short list of plants grown for fall color, but this native species is pretty this time of year nonetheless. The two- and three-year-old needles are now turning yellow and dropping, so don't worry if your trees have lots of yellow needles. This feature is widely ignored in descriptions of the species, which simply list the plants as evergreen, but the patterns the yellow and green needles create really are quite pretty. So, as long as the needles on the tips of the branches on your white pines are still green, they are healthy and right on schedule.\n\nAbove: Yellow and green needles on Eastern white pine make a pretty, if subtle, pattern.\n\nWhite pines are valuable, long-lived evergreens. This species once covered much of the northeast, and 200- to 220-foot-tall trees were common. Logging from the 18th to early 20th century claimed all but about one percent of virgin stands. Today in cultivation, mature white pines typically reach 75 to 100 feet and spread to 75 feet. Virgin stands still exist in Great Smokey National Park and a few other locations—they are worth visiting! (See \"Range\" at this link for a list!) Although white pines are happiest in moist, well-drained soil, they tolerate dry to average conditions, sand or heavy clay, pH that runs from 4 to 6.5, and part shade to full sun.\n\nI've been spending far too much time pulling up nasty plants like garlic mustard, so this morning I took a walk through the part of our woods that isn't overrun with invasives. The mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia) is just coming into bloom. It is breathtaking every year, and this one is no exception. I thought I would share some pictures.\n\nOur Mountain laurel is out along the creek in a beech-maple forest. For the most part, it grows just inside the woods. The tallest plants are up to 10 feet or more in height. Spots right along the creek are occupied by sweet pepperbush or clethera (Clethra alnifolia) and some of the blueberry/deerberry (Vaccinium spp.) relatives that I haven't sorted out yet. The woods is about 10 or 12 feet above the water at high tide.\n\nThe flowers are carried in corymbs, and crimped, starry buds open into pleated bowls. Most of our plants have white flowers, although I saw a plant or two with pale pink ones. I need to take my Macro lens out into the woods to try to get a better picture of the individual flowers.\n\nDespite the delicate looking flowers, these are tough plants. They've had a hard time with summer droughts in recent years. Plus snow loads and crashing trees have splintered branches and trunks. Fortunately, they resprout from very mature wood. If you look closely at the base of this plant, you'll see lots of new sprouts. I was happy to see regrowth everywhere.\n\nI surprised a young eagle out on the point, and I also heard a great blue heron flap away across the creek—their prehistoric croaking is an incredible sound. Pileated woodpeckers called and drummed in the treetops, although I didn't spot any of them. Finally, this lovely box turtle crossed my path. He would only stick out the tip of his nose for a picture, but he is actually one of the largest ones I have ever seen. Very handsome!\n\nIf there' one plant combination that could lure me to live in the deep South, it is live oaks festooned with Spanish moss and resurrection ferns. Live oak (Quercus virginiana) is a massive evergreen, hardy to Zone 8, that supports the other two plants. Blue-gray Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides) sways romantically all around the canopy, while leathery leaved resurrection fern (Polypodium polypodioides) clusters along the tops of the branches. I can't think of a similar iconic combination for the Eastern Shore, at least not one that instantly tells you where you are the way live oaks and Spanish moss do.\n\nAbove: A live oak with Spanish moss and resurrection ferns gracing the plantings of Brookgreen Gardens outside Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\n\nI've recently had plenty of time to think about it. My husband and I just returned from visiting family in Florida. For various reasons, we drive, and I enjoy the time spent looking at plants and landscapes. (Once again this trip, I contemplated compiling a horrible pruning errors blog post, but stopping and taking pictures of people's yards seemed rude. Suffice it to say the pair of tightly sheared camellias that had been shaped into dense giant green gumballs studded with struggling red flowers won this year's prize!)\n\nWe travel back roads as much as possible, since 95 is boring and hectic. (Did you know Route 301 goes the entire way, only joining up with 95 for a couple short sections?) I started thinking about iconic plants as I watched spring roll in as we drove south.\n\nOne plant that seemed to signal spring is Carolina jasmine (Gelsemium sempervirens), whose yellow, trumpet-shaped blooms were much in evidence by the time we reached the Carolinas. A native, evergreen to semievergreen vine that reaches about 20 feet, it grew along fences and climbed up through trees and shrubs lining the roads. It's a lovely plant, hardy in Zones 7 to 9, that should be grown more often.\n\nI added improved cultivar 'Margarita' to the garden here at Hackberry Point a couple years ago. I got my plant from North Creek Nursery, who report the cultivar has larger flowers than the species and is reliably hardy to Zone 6. Its clear yellow flowers appear in early summer. (See North Creek Nursery for more information and a photograph.) In a \"do as I say, not as I do\" move, I finally installed a permanent trellis for it last year—luckily, without major damage!\n\nCamellias were also much in evidence both on the way down and the way back, and as we rolled back onto the Eastern Shore, I noticed the first signs of spring up here as well. There were early daffodils, especially in warm, south-facing spots, along with cherry trees in full bloom. I also spotted a Cornelian cherry dogwood (Cornus mas) strutting its stuff in Chestertown yesterday.\n\nAbove: American holly along with tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica) in full fall regalia.\n\nAs for iconic plants and plant combinations for the Eastern Shore, marshes along the Chesapeake Bay spring to mind. As a horticulturist, though, I decided to pick a native plant that most of us can grow, and for me, that's American holly (Ilex opaca). I've never lived anywhere that it grows so well. Plants thrive in our beech-maple woodland along Worton creek. I've seen hollies combined with all sorts of plants, and grown alone, but its native companions in the woods are my favorites. There, it grows with summersweet clethra (Clethra alnifolia), mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia), and what I think is deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) filling in below. In the patches of sun beneath the shrubs is a ground cover of emerald moss and partridge berry (Mitchella repens). Hollies anchor a more subtle combination than live oaks provide, but it is one that grows on you. I'll happily claim it!\n\nA travel note: If you've always wanted to see manatees, plan a trip to Blue Spring State Park in Orange City, Florida. My picture isn't great, but if you look you can see one of the many manatees we spotted. (Reminder to self: Check your camera battery before you go so you can take better pictures next time!) Best time to visit is during cold weather, from late November through early April. Blue Spring is a consistent 72°F, and when the weather gets cold, manatees from the St. John's River gather there. One person I talked to saw over 300 on a day when it was 26°F in the morning!\n\nAbove: A manatee glides through the clear water of Blue Spring off the St. John's River in Florida.\n\nShowy red buds opening into flowers signal the season for a favorite native that is coming into bloom this week: red buckeye (Aesculus pavia). The tubular flowers are borne in panicles at the tips of the branches. (A panicle is a type of inflorescence that has a main stalk with branched side stems.) Each panicle is 4 to 8 inches long in bloom, and the individual flowers are about 1½ inches long. The flowers are showy for a couple weeks from mid spring to early summer. The flowers are very attractive to hummingbirds.\n\nI've been poking around for sources of the two new dwarf oakleaf hydrangeas released by the U.S. National Arboretum since I first posted about them last week. While it seems that Hydrangea quercifolia 'Munchkin' and 'Ruby Slippers' are going to be scarce on the retail level for at least another year, plants are available. Fortunately there are nurseries hard at work building up stock. Both cultivars are well worth the wait, if the descriptions and initial reports I've heard are any indication.\n\nABOVE: H. quercifolia 'Munchkin'\n\nThis handsome cultivar features white, 6½-long flower clusters that fade to pink as they age. The dark green foliage turns mahogany in fall. The Arboretum reports plants are 3 feet tall and spread to 4½ feet at 9 years of age. Plants can be used in mass plantings, as hedges, and in mixed borders. Since they're wider than they are tall, I also will be using them as tall ground covers!\n\nRon Rabideau of Rare Find Nursery has had 'Munchkin' for several years. He reports that it is considerably smaller than other dwarf selections, including both 'Pee Wee' and 'Sikes Dwarf'. ('Munchkin' is a seedling of 'Sikes Dwarf'.) Rare Find has a few plants of 'Munchkin' available for this spring, with more to come in the fall.\n\nABOVE: H. quercifolia 'Ruby Slippers'\n\nSelected for its showy blooms, 'Ruby Slippers' produces 9-inch-long trusses that emerge white, but quickly turn pale pink and then deeper rose pink. Dark green foliage turns mahogany in fall. This cultivar is the result of a cross between showy 'Snow Queen' oakleaf hydrangea and dwarf 'Pee Wee'. Plants are about 3½ feet tall and 5 feet wide at 7 years. It, too, makes a handsome addition to shrub borders, and can be used in mass plantings or as a hedge. Again, because of the spreading character of the plant, I'd consider using it as a tall ground cover for a large area.\n\nNote that while the plants in these pictures are growing in full sun, they are irrigated. Both are growing in McMinnville, Tennessee, where the Arboretum's shrub breeding program is located. To grow them in gardens on the Eastern Shore, look for a spot in partial shade with rich, moist, well-drained soil for best results. A spot with afternoon shade is ideal. Plants located in dry soil and full sun are liable to be stressed, and their leaves will begin turning color and will likely exhibit scorching by late summer. Mulch to retain soil moisture and help keep the roots cool.\n\nI also wanted to mention another nursery I found in the process of looking for sources that is new to me: Hydrangeas Plus. They are working to build up stock of both 'Munchkin' and 'Ruby Slippers' and will offer it eventually. In the meantime, if you love hydrangeas, check out their other listings!\n\nI left the Mid-Atlantic Nursery Trades Show (MANTS) in Baltimore last week with a deep case of plant lust. This is a serious problem on a number of levels, not the least of which is the fact that it's beastly cold and snowy outside—hardly the season for planting.\n\nNormally, I come away from such shows with lists of annuals and perennials I'd like to try. The lust for these beauties is easily satisfied, since it's a relatively simple matter to find garden space for them. This year, however, a couple species of native shrubs and trees grabbed my attention. Finding room for them is another matter altogether.\n\nAbove: Oakleaf hydrangea with daylily 'Patricia Fay'.\n\nOakleaf hydrangea (Hydrangea quercifolia) has been in every garden I've ever had, and the MANTS show renewed my my interest in this handsome native shrub. For those of you who don't know it, it is a deciduous, summer-blooming shrub that also features fabulous fall color and attractive exfoliating bark. Plants range from 6 to 8 or more feet tall. They spread by suckers, and Michael Dirr (Manual of Woody Landscape Plants) estimates the spread at 10 to 12 or more feet wide."

What causes this and how do I prevent it?\n\n1 Answer\n\nfungal parasite\nSymptoms: Yellowing of needles younger during the summer, for a portion or in their entirety. Subsequently emerge from the needles attached vesicles elongated, finger-like white or orange to rust, which would break with ease emitting abundant spores. Following the loss of the needles.\nPREVENTION: If the vesicles are white, the spores can infect rhododendrons, resulting in the appearance of typical rust, and then ritoornare to infect the fir. Provide deleting or moving the rhododendrons from the immediate vicinity of the plants fir attacked.\nCARE: Remove infected branches, dealing with specific products only in case of massive infestation."

Trees that have been seriously neglected or pollarded in the past are the most likely candidates for pollarding.\n\nWhat Our Customer's Say...\n\nDear M & M Tree Service. Your crew trimmed our trees on Tuesday. The head trimmer is an artist. He did such a beautiful job thinning and shaping our oaks. We are so pleased.

Maybe -- that's if you are willing to water.\n\nAsk Eileen Conzet what makes her Saint Paul home so special, and she's quick to tell you it's all about the trees, \"These trees are really what sets these neighborhoods apart. Kids play in them, they play around them, it is part of the history of the neighborhood and the beauty of the neighborhood.\"\n\nConzet lost a majestic 75-year-old sugar maple two years ago -- and the elm in front of her home is one of the last on the street, \"I know I should be watering more, and I know we need to pay really good attention to these trees.\"\n\nJohnson says water now, water often, and water right up until the ground is frozen.\n\nLast fall's drought already stressed the trees, and their oh-so-important root system.\n\nAn unusually hot and windy summer has soil moisture levels down considerably, so if you don't water and those trees go into winter stressed from two seasons of bad weather; those trees may never come back.\n\nJohnson warned, \"There is going to be a lot of widespread damage.\"\n\nWe asked if it is too late, or if some of the damage can be reversed, \"Absolutely it can be reversed,\" Johnson told us.\n\nHow often should you water?\n\nHe advises once a week for big trees, more often for smaller trees that have been recently planted.\n\nThe Extension also suggests laying down mulch, which can stop the water from evaporating by as much as 30 percent."

      "text": "Winter is a time when many plants in the garden need a prune. During the past few weeks we have covered both bush and climbing roses, but hydrangeas, fruit trees, grape vines and many perennials need a prune at this time too. Here are some guidelines for what to do.\n\nHYDRANGEAS\n\nLike roses, the main objective of pruning hydrangeas is to encourage young wood as this produces the best flowers. First remove all old flowering stems and any old wood. These are cut out at the base leaving only young, strong, healthy, un-flowered stems. The terminal or tip buds on these remaining stems will produce large quality flowers the following season. If more flowers are required, canes can be cut back to the pair of largest buds near the top of the stem. If the canes are very crowded, thinning will be necessary.\n\nDECIDUOUS FRUIT TREES\n\nThese trees are pruned once all their leaves have fallen and they are dormant. Pruning can limit the size of the tree as well as shape it, allowing light to penetrate, ultimately enabling the tree to produce lots of good quality fruit.\n\nIn the past, most pruning of deciduous trees and vines was carried out in winter. Now it is used as a maintenance prune to clean the tree up, and the main prune is actually done during the growing season, between November and March. By pruning at this time we can decrease vigour and keep trees to a manageable size, allowing more control over growth and fruiting.\n\nTrees that are very vigorous may need a top prune in November and again in January. When pruning your fruit tree, aim to shape the tree, define the leaders, thin and balance lateral growth, remove dead or diseased branches, and reduce or remove bare and unproductive wood. Prune trees when they need it.\n\nWith trees such as peaches, nectarines and apricot this should be annually, however with apple and plum it need only be every two or three years. The way you prune a fruit tree varies depending on the cropping habit of each variety.\n\nGRAPE VINES\n\nPrune grape vines when their leaves have fallen and they are completely dormant.\n\nGrapes are produced on new season's growth which arises from buds on last year's canes. Shoots which arise from older wood generally do not flower or fruit. Regular annual pruning is essential for grape production. Grape vines are pruned hard and up to 90 per cent of the season's growth is removed at pruning each year.\n\nPERENNIALS\n\nDepending on their growth habit, many perennials like salvias and catmints respond well to a hard prune to remove last season's foliage. Yarrows and Sedum Autumn Joy simply need old flower spikes or old unattractive foliage removed, while wormwoods like Artemesia Powis Castle are best cut by one third to one half.\n\nShare this story\n\nFollow us\n\nHave your say\n\nComments on this story\n\nMarion Waller Posted at 4:00 PM September 04, 2012\n\nDear Sophie Could you please tell me why my pomegranate is not bearing any fruit it was planted four years ago and has produced no fruit at all i fertilise with seasol do i kneed to use anything else Thank you Marion"

      "text": "The north-west of the island is home to great many almond trees, and at this time of the year, they're all blossoming.\n\nPuntagorda covered with almond blossom in late January\n\nThe trees in El Paso and Garafía are beautiful, but the best display of all is at Puntagorda. In fact Puntagorda hosts an annual almond blossom fiesta. The date varies — the Town Hall sets it a couple of weeks in advance, to (hopefully) coincide with the best blossom. This year it's planned for February 1st-3rd. I'll be giving more details nearer the date.\n\nThe north of La Palma is one of the best places to see dragon trees. These exotic-looking plants grow throughout the Canary Islands, and also in Cape Verde, the Azores, Maderia, and western Morocco, but on La Palma, they're still reproducing naturally.\n\nThe Canary Islands used to have a large, flightless bird, something like a Dodo. This bird ate dragon tree fruits, so the seeds evolved to have a hard protective covering to survive the bird's digestive tract. Now that the bird is extinct, this covering makes it had for the seed to germinate. In other places they put the seeds in an acid bath for a few hours (much like the inside of a bird) to remove the hard coating before planting the seed.\n\nThe Latin name is Dracaena draco. Although they grow anything up to 12 metres tall, botanically, dragon trees aren't trees. They don't have annual rings, for one thing. Actually, they're classified in the same order (Asparagales) as garlic and asparagus, although they look nothing like each other. In fact, young dragon trees look like giant loo brushes and mature ones look like broccoli on steroids.\n\nBecause they don't have annual rings, it's hard to tell their age. The trunk branches every time they flower, which isn't every year. So you can tell how often a trees has flowered, and make an educated guess at its age that way. The tree in the photo has flowered just twice. The oldest ones seem to be about 650 years old.\n\nThe resin is reddish. In ancient Roman times, people used to dry it and sell it to alchemists as dragon blood. It must have fetched a packet.\n\nOne of the best places to see them is at Buracas, below the village of Las Tricias in Garafía which is where I took the sunset photo. The photo below is of another lovely group at La Tosca, in Barlovento, which you can see from a viewpoint on the main road from Barlovento village to Gallegos. And there's the famous twin dragon treesin Breña Alta.\n\nThe highest point of the island is the Roque de Los Muchachos, at 2,426m (8,000 ft) above sea level. Most days of the year, the view is spectacular. Even when it's raining at sea-level, the summit is nearly always above the clouds. In fact, you can often look down on a sea of clouds surrounding the island. Of course that's one reason why the observatory is up here.\n\nYou also get a wonderful view into the Caldera de Taburiente. I believe the patch of bright green at the bottom here are fields near the water-manager's house, some 1,600 m (5,280 ft) below. South, along the central ridge.\n\nThe Roque is just inside the Caldera de Taburiente National Park, and part of the municipality of Garafía. When I came to La Palma, seventeen years ago, the place was as nature made it. But now that there's a road, they got enough visitors here to cause a serious problem with erosion. Now they've built paths out of local stone, and they've done a really good job of making it look natural, except for the occasional fence. It's best to keep to the paths. If you slip on the lose gravel it's a long way down.\n\nRoque de Los Muchachos means Rock of the Boys. The name comes from the stone pinnacles at the summit, which look vaguely like giant peopleManel Soria, who gave a talk on night photography at FotoNature 2012 now has amazing photos of La Palma on his website at \nThe photo above was taken in the observatory, looking north. From left to right you can see the empty dome of the Swedish 60 cm telescope, MAGIC II (on the horizon, some distance below), the Superwasp Follow-up Telescope (closer), the Liverpool telescope (peeking from behind the ridge), the Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope (at the back) and SuperWASP below the JKT.\n\nThe photo below looks south over the Caldera to the southern sky. Because La Palma is closer to the equator, we get to see some stars in the southern hemisphere, which you never see from Britain. This photo includes Alpha Centauri which is the next nearest star after our own sun. You can also see two stars of the southern cross, just peeking over the ridge: Mimosa and Gamma Crucis.\n\nBoth these photos are reproduced with written permission from the photographer. For any other use, please contact him at frikosal [AT] gmail[DOT]comTourists sometimes go nuts trying to find the village of Breña Baja, or Fuencaliente.\n\nThere's a really simple reason why they can't find them. They don't exist. Breña Baja and Fuencaliente are municipalities, and their town halls are in the villages of San Jose and Los Canarios, respectively. It like driving all over the south east of England, looking for the town of Sussex.\n\nThe map shows the 14 municipalities (in blue) , with their administrative seats (in pink). Where there's no name in pink, the municipalities are named after their chief villages, which makes things simpler. Just to keep things interesting, one, San Andrés y Sauces, is named after the two biggest villages. The town hall is in Los Sauces, which is much bigger and on the main road.\n\nCommon Ravens live all over Europe, Asia and North America, but we have a different sub-species here. Some biologists group our raven in with the North African sub-species (Corvus corax tingitanus) and others think the Canaries have their own sub-species (Corvus corax canariensis).\n\nLike other members of the rook-and-crow family, they'll eat whatever's available: carrion, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, and food waste. And they're pretty intelligent about getting it. At least two individual ravens at the Roque have learned to provide a photo opportunity in exchange for some food.\n\nCarmelo outside the Galileo telescope, Garafía.\n\nCarmelo hangs around the car park at the Roque itself, although I've met him at the Galileo telescope and observatory heliport. He's got a ring around one ankle. The other raven doesn't have an ankle ring, and I mostly see him near the Los Andennes viewpoint, and I call him Nevermore, after the poem \"The Raven\" by Edgar Allan Poe. (\"Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.' \")\n\nFor a couple of years now, we've had major roadworks on the road from Los Sauces to Barlovento and beyond into Garafia. They're straightening out as many of the bends as possible, which often means building a big wall and filling in behind it. It's going to be great when they finish, but it does mean that in many places the traffic is one way, so that you have to stop at traffic lights. One friend counted 14 traffic lights between her home in Franceses and her job in Los Sauces, which add an average of about 15 minutes to the journey.\n\nWorse, since June they close the road completely for several hours at a time.\n\nIf you get stuck just south of the road closures, Los Tilos and San Andres are particularly nice. If you're stuck north of them with a swimsuit, I recommend La Fajana swimming pools and the village of Barlovento."

      "text": "Introduction\n\nThis silver-blue foliaged cultivar is a handsome evergreen for specimen planting where it will not be crowded since the tree looks its best when branches are left on the tree to the ground. This shows off the wonderful pyramidal form with lower branches spreading about half the height. It reaches 40 to 60 or more feet tall and 30 to 40 feet wide. The trunk stays fairly straight with lateral branches nearly horizontal. Allow plenty of room for these to spread. They are best located as a lawn specimen away from walks, streets, and sidewalks so branches will not have to be pruned. The trees are much too large for most residential properties. It looks odd if lower branches are removed. Older trees become flat-topped and are a beautiful sight to behold.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nYoung Cedrus atlantica 'Argentea': Silver Atlas Cedar\n\n[Click thumbnail to enlarge.]\n\nGeneral Information\n\nScientific name: Cedrus atlantica\n\nPronunciation: SEE-drus at-LAN-tih-kuh\n\nCommon name(s): Silver Atlas Cedar\n\nFamily: Pinaceae\n\nUSDA hardiness zones: 6A through 8B (Fig. 2)\n\nOrigin: not native to North America\n\nInvasive potential: little invasive potential\n\nUses: specimen; Bonsai\n\nAvailability: somewhat available, may have to go out of the region to find the tree\n\nFigure 2.\n\nRange\n\n[Click thumbnail to enlarge.]\n\nDescription\n\nHeight: 40 to 60 feet\n\nSpread: 35 to 50 feet\n\nCrown uniformity: irregular\n\nCrown shape: pyramidal\n\nCrown density: moderate\n\nGrowth rate: moderate\n\nTexture: fine\n\nFoliage\n\nLeaf arrangement: spiral (Fig. 3)\n\nLeaf type: simple\n\nLeaf margin: entire\n\nLeaf shape: needle-like (filiform)\n\nLeaf venation: parallel\n\nLeaf type and persistence: needled evergreen, evergreen\n\nLeaf blade length: less than 2 inches\n\nLeaf color: silver\n\nFall color: no color change\n\nFall characteristic: not showy\n\nFlower\n\nFlower color: unknown\n\nFlower characteristics: not showy\n\nFruit\n\nFruit shape: oval, cone\n\nFruit length: 3 to 6 inches\n\nFruit covering: dry or hard\n\nFruit color: brown\n\nFruit characteristics: does not attract wildlife; showy; fruit/leaves not a litter problem\n\nUse and Management\n\nDifficult to transplant, it should be moved as a container plant or root-pruned balled-in-burlap. Soil preference is for well-drained deep loam, on the acid side, but it can tolerate sandy or clay soils, if they are well-drained. The tree looks its best when sheltered from strong winds but tolerates open conditions, and will grow in full sun or partial shade. Allow for plenty of soil space around the tree since growth will be poor in restricted soil space. Tolerates extensive drought only when grown in an area where roots can explore a large soil area. Performs well in all areas within its hardiness range. It is suitable in zone 9 in California and perhaps in Florida.\n\nPests\n\nGenerally free of insect pests and resistant to diseases, they may occasionally fall prey to tip blight, root rots or black scale and the Deodar weevil. Usually no pest protection or control is necessary.\n\nSap-suckers are attracted to the trunk and often riddle it with small holes. This usually does little lasting harm to the tree.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1.\n\nThis document is ENH290"

      "text": "Ohio buckeye is found growing on fertile, moist soils of bottomlands and river banks throughout most of Ohio but less commonly in the eastern half of the state. It is also known as the fetid or stinking buckeye because the flowers, bruised bark, and broken twigs give off a disagreeable odor.\n\nThe Indians named the fruit of the buckeye tree hetuck, meaning the eye of a buck, which it certainly does resemble. Today the buckeye has the distinction of being the state tree of Ohio.\n\nThe fresh seeds of this tree are reported to be poisonous to man but not to squirrels. The Indians powdered the seeds and dumped them into small pools. This would stun the fish and make them rise to the surface, where the Indians quickly collected them. It is also reported that a flour made from the seeds makes an excellent library paste which will repel roaches.\n\nThe pioneers favored the wood for cabin building and for making furniture. Early settlers cut long, thin shavings, which were then woven into summer hats. Although buckeye wood is now used extensively for making artificial limbs because it is light, easily worked, and resists splitting, it is of little commercial importance.\n\nThe State Tree - Ohio Buckeye, Aesculus glabra\n\nSize: small tree of central states, chiefly of Ohio and Mississippi Valley regions, 30'-50' in height, 2'-3' in diameter\nGrowth: grows best in deep fertile soils, will usually reach maturity in 60-80 years\nLeaves: palmately compound with five nearly elliptical, serrate leaflets 4\" - 6\" long\nBuds: large terminal bud (nonresinous)\nBranching: stout limbs in opposite positioning\nBark: grey, scaly plates\nFlowers: showy, pale white to greenish yellow, branched clusters 4\" -6\" long\nFruit (nut): 1\" -2\" seed capsule, somewhat spiny with 1-5 non-edible seeds (nuts) inside\nOther information: also known a fetid buckeye, stinking buckeye. It is one of the first trees to leaf out in the spring and drops its leaves early in the fall. Fall leaf coloration is orange to red\nUses: today mostly pulp; in the past - furniture, crates, pallets, caskets, artificial human limbs\nFolklore: nut is considered a good luck charm, relieves pain of arthritis and rheumatism, resembles the eye of the buck deer\nState Champion Big Tree: circumference - 162\"; height 82' crown spread - 67'; location - North Bend, Hamilton County\n\nThe Buckeye - Description, Uses and Legend\n\nBotanical Name: The botanical name for the Buckeye is Aesculus which was taken by the Swedish botanist, Carl von Linne from \"Aesculapius,\" the name of the mythological Greek god of medicine. The Ohio variety was named Aesculus glabra, by the German botanist Willdenow in 1809.\"\nCommon Name: The common name \"Buckeye\" was derived from the Native Americans who noticed that the glossy, chestnut-brown seeds with the lighter circular \"eye\" looked very similar to the eye of a buck (male) deer.\nDescription of the Ohio Buckeye Seed Nut: The seed nut is glossy and chestnut-brown in color. It is velvety smooth to the touch with lighter circular \"eye.\" It is contained in a spiny, two-inch hull and is set in five palmately compound, five inch long, decidusous leaflets. The leaf formation has been described as \"praying hands\" by poet Albrecht Duerer. The seeds and bark are slightly poisonous and bitter tasting. The properties can be eliminated by heating and leaching.\nUses by Native Americans and Early Settlers: The Native Americans roasted, peeled and mashed the buckeye nut, which they called \"Hetuck,\" into a nutritional meal. The early settlers found the buckeye wood to be lightweight (28 pounds per cubic foot as compared to 75 pounds per cubic foot for oak), to be readily split, and to be easily carved or whittled. Due to these qualities, the buckeye wood was used by settlers to make utensils. Thin planed strips of the wood were woven into a variety of hats and baskets. The buckeye wood has been found ideal in artificial limbs production due to its lightness and non-splitting characteristics.\n\nMedicinal Properties: Early travellers and explorers carried the rare and curious buckeye to the east with them and reported the Aesculus glabra's highly prized medicinal properties and talismanic attribute of wisdom. The extracts from the inner bark of the nut has been used in cerebro-spinal treatments. Some believe that the buckeye relieves rheumatism pain and provides good fortune when carried in the pockets of their garments or worn as an amulet around the neck. Instantly dubbed \"buckeye\" in frontier speech, the mysterious nut was used as a general cure-all for generations.\n\nPolitical Campaign Symbols: As a result of a political remark made by an opposition newspaper, a long cabin decorated with raccoon skins and a string of buckeyes became the symbol of General William Henry Harrison's presidential campaign.\n\nThe following became his campaign song:\n\nOh where, tell me where was your buckeye cabin made?\nTwas built among the merry boys who wield the plough and spade,\nWhere the log cabins stand, in the bonnie buckeye shade.\nOh what, tell me what is to be your cabin's fate?\nWe'll wheel it to the capital and place it there elate,\nfor a token and a sign of the bonnie Buckeye state.\"\n\nAs a result, citizens of Ohio became known as \"Buckeyes.\" The buckeye tree was officially adapted as the state tree on October 2, 1953."

      "text": "The transition from youth to adult is associated with growing pains for most organisms. Trees are no exception. As a young tree grows to maturity, such as this Freeman maple (Acer x freemanii- cross of a silver and red maple), trunks that for years looked smooth and evenly colored can begin to split and become irregular. Don't be alarmed. This is only natural as growth from beneath the surface places continued pressure until the surface breaks. The patterns of cracking can be regular, as for this tree, and point to regions of the truck experiencing faster growth and expansion rates.\n\nUnderneath the trunk surface of most trees are two distinct layers of dividing cells.. They actively divide in order to produce new vascular system tissue and cork. The vascular system transports water and nutrients throughout the plant. The innermost layer of dividing cells is the vascular cambium and gives rise to vascular system tissue. The vascular cambium produces new xylem cells (wood) towards the inside of the tree and phloem cells towards the outside. Xylem transports water and nutrients from the root system and xylem cells are dead at maturity, and phloem consists of live cells that transport sugars and other substances to living cells throughout the plant. The second layer of dividing cells is the cork cambium and it is just outside of the phloem. Cells of the cork cambium divide to produce cork tissue that pushes outward to provide the tree with a protective barrier.\n\nDavid C. Zlesak\n\nA Symbol of Love: Lady's Slipper Orchids\n\nChris Currey, University of Minnesota Graduate Student\n\nShowy Lady's Slipper (Cypripedium reginae). David Zlesak\n\nLove becomes a theme in many lives this time of year, especially two weeks into February. Love must have been in the air for the Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus when he published the first description of our state flower, the showy lady's slipper (Cypripedium reginae) in 1753. The \"slipper\" had been lost by the Roman goddess of love, Venus. She had been out with her love Adonis when they had to suddenly take shelter from a passing storm. They seized the opportunity the close quarters offered them, and after the storm passed and the lovers had gone, one of Venus' slippers remained. A mortal spotted this lone slipper and it turned into a flower before the mortal reached it! This story led Linnaeus to combine Cyprus, Venus' home, and pedi(l)on, meaning slipper. In keeping with the theme of love, Heinrich Pfitzer (1886) published the classification of the tropical lady's slippers of Asia into the genus Paphiopedilum. The prefix Paphos is an acknowledgement of the city of Paphos on the island of Cyprus, where the goddess was born and came to shore and a temple was built to worship her. Though our native lady's slippers lay dormant underneath the snow, this is a great time of year to enjoy the blossoms of the tropical lady's slippers within our homes.\n\nComplex Paphiopedilum hybrid. David Zlesak\n\nThere are two genera of tropical lady's slippers with horticultural importance: the Old World Paphiopedilum species (spp.) and the New World Phragmipedium spp. The genus Paphiopedilum includes about 77 species with distribution spanning from Nepal to China and south to New Guinea. Plants usually grow on the forest floor of tropical forests (terrestrial) with their roots penetrating the thick duff layer that holds moisture, yet drains freely. Other Paphiopedilum members grow in trees (epiphytes) or on rock ledges and cliffs (lithophytes). Many commonly cultivated Paphiopedilum spp. have relatively short, light-green leaves with darker mottling, while some others have larger, plain, bright-green leaves. One, occasionally more, flower(s) will bloom per stem, lasting for a few weeks to over a month.\n\nPhragmipedium spp. are distributed from southern Mexico to southeastern Brazil. There are about 20 species that are nearly all terrestrial or semi-terrestrial. They have long, slender leaves that resemble large sedge plants. Many flowers bloom successively on long flower stalks, sometimes for months on end!\n\nLight and Temperature\n\nPhragmipedium sp. David Zlesak\n\nOne of the advantages of the tropical slipper orchids is there amenability to growing in the home environment. Light can sometimes be a limiting factor inside, yet many mottled leaves species of Paphiopedilum especially grow well under relatively low-light. Position plants near an east facing window or an area of a room with bright, diffuse light. Areas with more sun, like an exposed south window, are where Phragmipedium and Paphiopedilum spp. with plain-green leaves should be grown. During the summer Paphiopedilum and Phragmipedium plants grow well with day temperatures around 85°F. For night temperatures, Paphiopedilum slippers prefer nights around 60°F, while Phragmipedium slippers prefer temperatures around 70°F . In the winter, Phragmipedium species and hybrids may be grown warm at similar summer day temperatures, but the night temperature should drop another 10 degrees to the low 60's. Paphiopedilum species do better with a larger drop in temperature for the winter season. Day temperatures should be reduced to 75°F and the night temperature should reach 55°F. This lower night temperature in combination with shorter days is thought to promote flowering.\n\nWater and Fertilizer\n\nPhragmipedium sp. David Zlesak\n\nThe tropical slipper orchids have different watering requirements than some of the other cultivated orchids. Since plants of the genus Phragmipedium are terrestrial plants, often growing in areas that may be flooded temporarily part of the year, these plants seasonally require more water. Watering two to three times per week in the summer and once per week in the winter is recommended. Paphiopedilum species do no require as much water as their Old World counterparts. Usually watering twice per week in the summer and once per week in the winter is adequate. When watering, water thoroughly until the point that excess water begins to drain. This is easily done by bringing placing plants in the sink and watering for 5-10 seconds. You can feed slippers with a typical water soluble houseplant fertilizer such as a 20-10-20 every other week, half-strength once a week, or quarter-strength at each watering. At least once a month pots should be leached with plain water to remove excess salts. Buildup of salts can lead to root injury.\n\nHumidity\n\nLady slipper orchids do best with relatively high humidity, like they experience in their native habitats. These habitats typically are relatively warm and experience frequent precipitation. A simple way to increase humidity around plants when one does not have a greenhouse or terrarium is to place them on a humidity tray. This is simply a dish from 1/2 - 2\" deep that is filled with rocks (typically pebbles or small stones). Pots with slipper plants are then placed on top of the rocks and water is poured until it is just below the top of the rock. This will allow the pot to not sit in the water itself, yet as water evaporates the relative humidity will increase around the plant. This can be especially important in Minnesota households during winter months when the air is especially dry.\n\nMedia and Repotting\n\nBoth Phragmipedium spp. and Paphiopedilum spp. require free-draining growing medium. There are just about as many different recipes for tropical slipper media as there are slipper growers. Both genera benefit from a media that will allow water to drain readily, yet retain some moisture. The most commonly used component of orchid mixes is conifer bark (3-5 parts). This material will hold water, yet allow very free drainage due to the size of the bark pieces. For additional drainage, perlite and charcoal are good additions to a mix at one part each per batch. For Phragmipedium spp. and terrestrial Paphiopedilum spp., adding coarse peat (1-2 parts) in the mix will increase the water-holding capabilities of the medium. This outlines a general mix for your slippers, though custom-made or specialty mixes may be purchased at most local garden centers or orchid specialists.\n\nFor this coming Valentine's Day, and for the rest of the winter, consider how love can be represented in your life and the lives of those you care about. Perhaps a beautiful, flowering, tropical orchid with both a unique flower and romantic story would be a great gift and tribute to love!\n\nGroundhogs, also known as woodchucks, are common sight along Minnesota roads and in yards and gardens. Groundhogs are Minnesota's largest squirrel. They are short and stocky with an overall brownish colored fur that is often tipped with gray. They have short, strong legs that allow them to dig extensive burrows.\n\nGroundhogs are vegetarians with a hearty appetite. Jeff Hahn\n\nGroundhogs are most active March through October; otherwise they hibernate in the winter months. In early spring females will have up to 6 offspring that stay with the mother for about 6 weeks. During the day groundhogs are active in the early morning and late afternoon. Although associated with open ground, groundhogs prefer areas near brushy cover. Hidden amongst brush or under buildings are the entrance and exit holes to the burrow. This tunnel system allows the groundhog to escape predators such as fox, coyote, hawks, and dogs. These tunnels can be over 25 feet long! The entrance and exits holes are usually 6 inches or more across.\n\nGroundhogs are vegetarians. They eat a wide variety of vegetation including fresh plant shoots, grasses, clover, garden vegetables and tree bark from fruit trees and shrubs. It is this diet that tends to get them in trouble with people. A healthy groundhog can do quite the number on a vegetable patch or the bark of a fruit tree.\n\nThere are many ways to deal with a groundhog intruder, everything from smell and taste deterrents, changing the habitat, removal, and exclusion fences. If the groundhog is just eating grass and clover it may be simplest to just leave it alone. If it's eating flowers or vegetables, smell and taste deterrents can sometimes be effective, especially if different types are used and rotated. Taste deterrents include soap spray and chili pepper spray. Smell deterrents include blood meal, human hair, and mothballs. Smell deterrents should be placed in small mesh bags and staked a couple inches above the ground to allow for air circulation. Both taste and smell deterrents need to be reapplied every few days. Habitat modification can make the area less hospitable to groundhogs. Remove woodpiles or scrubby underbrush that provide cover for the groundhog.\n\nGet permission to release a trapped groundhog on public or private property. David Zlesak\n\nActive burrows typically have recently pushed out soil that is marble-like in shape and small. David Zlesak\n\nTo protect a specific area, such as a vegetable garden, from animals build an exclusion fence. For a groundhog the fence should be at least 18 inches tall inches tall and buried at least 4 inches deep. Any additional height or depth will help to protect the garden. A heavy weight metal mesh, such as hardware cloth, is a good fencing material. Place support stakes in the ground every 18 inches. If there is extra height at the top of the fencing, push it outward somewhat facing away from the garden. This extra lip will help deter the occasional woodchuck with climbing tendencies.\n\nIn some areas shooting is an acceptable method of removal. In areas were firearms aren't allowed, trapping and relocating is the best option. If you decide to trap an animal you will need a raccoon size live trap, these can be purchased or rented from most large garden stores and rental centers. Place the trap in an area where you have seen the groundhog. Place food items such as carrots, apples, and other greens around the outside of the unset trap for a couple of days. After a few days open the trap and bait it with fresh food. Remove the old food from arimages2/ound the outside. Check the trap every morning and evening. If after a few days you haven't caught the groundhog, try fresh bait in the trap or move the trap to a new location. Once you have captured the groundhog, move the animal at least 5 miles away. Note that you need permission from the landowner before releasing any animal onto public or private land.\n\nExtra tips:\n\nTo determine if a burrow is active check the outside for recently pushed out soil, usually small and marble-like in shape.\n\nScattering flour outside the burrow can show off tracks from animals going in an out.\n\nPotential groundhog bait includes, apples, broccoli, peas, carrots and there tops, and other beans and greens.\n\nCut Roses - Their Production, Selection, and Care\n\nDavid C. Zlesak, Regional Extension Educator\n\nAlthough ranking third for overall yearly sales in the cut flower market, roses move to number one for Valentine's Day. Cut rose producers try to take advantage of this window of opportunity to schedule a bumper crop of flowers to meet the Valentine demand. Plants are carefully pruned several weeks before Valentine's Day and their growth carefully monitored in order to maximize the Valentine harvest and take advantage of higher market prices.\n\nWith increased fuel and labor costs in the United States and Europe becoming prohibitive for many domestic cut rose growers, there has been a shift to off shore cut rose production. Production has shifted from primarily greenhouses in Northern latitudes to more economical greenhouse and outdoor production systems in warmer areas of the world including Columbia, Ecuador, India, Kenya, and Israel. Faster and more affordable transportation from production regions to key markets (primarily the United States and Europe) has also helped make relocation of production possible. With this production shift, significant effort has been devoted to the breeding and development of cut rose cultivars having better adaptation to the new climates and production systems used. The market for the breeding and development of new cut roses, in fact, is much larger than that of garden or landscape roses.\n\nCut rose production in a basic greenhouse structure in Ecuador. Jim Sproul\n\nIn an effort to compete in the marketplace, Northern greenhouse cut rose producers need to be more creative than ever and take advantage of unique niche opportunities. Some niche opportunities that are proving successful tend to emphasize the fact nearby producers can supply a very fresh, high quality rose targeted to local or regional markets. In addition, an emphasis on excellent customer service never hurts either. Quick turnaround from harvest to florist affords the ability to grow some of the higher demand varieties that may have a shorter shelf life. For instance, roses with a strong damask or old rose fragrance that is so valued tend to have a shorter shelf life, and because of that are not typically grown for international distribution. However, a fragrant rose can command a premium price and may be feasible if grown near a key market even though it has a shorter shelf life.\n\nThe only cut rose producer/wholesale supplier left in the upper Midwest is Len Busch Roses in Plymouth, Minnesota. Part of the reason they are able to stay viable is that they invested years ago in an efficient heating system that burns waste wood products. Len Busch Roses emphasizes fragrance, quality, and freshness in their roses, customer service, and also grow a number of other high value cut flower crops including lilies and gerbera. In addition, they have worked with flower dyes to transform the flowers of a very good, long lasting white rose they produce into almost any color imaginable.\n\nTips for Selection and Care of Cut Roses\n\nNo matter where a cut rose was produced, here are some tips that are helpful to select high quality roses at the florist and extend their beauty once in the home or office.\n\nSelection:\n\nEmployees at a cut rose production facility in Ecuador separate and package roses by quality and stem length. Jim Sproul\n\nOptimum flower maturity is critical for extended display life. Optimum maturity can vary depending on variety. Generally look for roses where the outermost few petals are loosening and beginning to unfurl. If the flower was cut tighter than this, it may not open properly. If the bloom has several loose opening petals when it is purchased, vase life is already compromised. Over mature blooms typically are not due to the flower being cut too late from the plant, but rather the flower has opened during an\nextended time in transit or time in the florist shop before the flower is purchased.\n\nLook for flower heads placed squarely on strong, straight stems. Especially examine the neck of the stem for straightness. The neck is the portion just below the flower and above the first leaf. This is the part of the rose stem most likely to wilt if under water stress. After recovery from water stress, this section of the stem may no longer be straight and be a signal that the stem was under water stress during production. This can contribute to reduced display life.\n\nLook for roses with foliage, stems, and flowers possessing normal color and size for the variety. Leaves and stems that are light green or yellowed and blooms with less coloration and size typical for a variety can be a sign of nutrition problems and can result in reduced vase life.\n\nLook for roses that are free of disease and insects and have not been bruised or otherwise injured during handling.\n\nTips to make roses last longer\n\nIn order to extend vase life of roses it is important to 1.) promote water uptake, 2.) provide energy to sustain tissue and allow for continued growth of especially petal tissue, and 3.) slow down flower development for extended enjoyment. Use floral preservatives to help extend vase life. They contain ingredients to acidify the water, a carbohydrate (typically dextrose or sucrose) as an energy source, and anti-microbial agents.\n\nPromote water uptake:\n\nAvoid microbial growth in the water since it can clog vascular tissue and interfere with water uptake. Use a floral preservative because they typically contain an antimicrobial agent and acidifier, both of which limit bacterial growth. Change the solution every day or two in the vase. Avoid having foliage underwater which is subject to rotting and can increase microbial growth.\n\nRecut stem ends to promote water uptake. David Zlesak\n\nUse a sharp knife or pair of pruners to cut stems and avoid crushing vascular tissue.\n\nRecut stems once you get the flowers home to remove ends which may have bacteria beginning to clog them. If possible, cut stems underwater or place in water soon after cutting to prevent air from getting into vascular tissue. Contrary to popular thought, cutting at an angle, although adding surface area to the cut end, does not promote greater water uptake. The vascular tissue is made up of small tubes that can be compared to straws. Even if the ends of these \"straws\" are cut at an angle, their diameter and water uptake ability doesn't change.\n\nUse luke warm water to help promote initial water uptake, especially if stems were transported out of water.\n\nKeep your roses away from drafts that can place a higher demand for water uptake by increasing evaporation of water from their tissue.\n\nProvide energy to sustain tissue and support growth:\n\nFoliage and stems of cut roses can continue to photosynthesize and provide some energy to the tissue. Placing roses in indirect natural or artificial light can fuel a limited amount of photosynthesis.\n\nUse a floral preservative because it contains a carbohydrate energy source.\n\nSlow down flower development:\n\nKeep in a cool place. If the room in your home or office where you would like to enjoy your roses is relatively warm, consider moving your roses to a cooler location when you are away.\n\nDirect sunlight should be avoided because it can place a greater demand for water uptake on your roses, increase tissue temperature, and promote faster flower opening.\n\nFloral Preservatives\n\nCommercially prepared floral preservatives are affordable, carefully balanced and prepared, ready to mix with a defined amount of water, and are easy to use. However, if you do not have access to them there are a number of ingredients commonly found in the home that can help to extend display life. A simple home floral preservative is to add to one quart of water: 2 tablespoons of lemon juice (reduces pH), 1 tablespoon sugar (carbohydrate source), and 1/2 teaspoon of bleach (suppresses microorganisms). Other ingredients people commonly mix with vase water include aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid- reduces pH) and clear soda pop (low pH, sugar, and some antimicrobial agents).\n\nDespite the frigid weather outside, many gardeners are flipping through seed catalogues in anticipation of warmer days. A wide variety of flowers and vegetables can be started indoors long before the weather becomes warm enough to move them outside. Different types of seeds have different optimal planting dates and different growth requirements. Read this past article to learn more about starting flower and vegetable seeds indoors.\n\nAlthough a flush of young green sprouts coming up in a sunny window can be a refreshing sight in the cold months ahead, it is important to start working now to prevent losses from damping-off, a common disease of seedlings. Damping off is a fungal disease caused most commonly by the fungi Rhizoctonia spp., Pythium spp., and Fusarium spp. All three of these fungi survive quite well in soil and plant debris. Since the tissue of young seedlings is soft and easy to infect, these pathogens can attack a wide variety of flowers and vegetables when they are seedlings. Damping off fungi can kill the seed before it emerges from the soil or it can attack the young stem and new leaves, resulting in tan mushy spots, pinched, rotted stems, and often complete collapse of the seedling. Once an infection has begun, the damping off fungi can move through the potting mix to infect nearby seedlings. Quite often a large section or an entire tray of seedlings is killed by damping off, resulting in few or no surviving seedlings to grow into mature plants.\n\nDamping off is only a disease of seedlings. Once plants have mature leaves and a well developed root system, they are better able to naturally resist the damping off fungi. There is a critical period of growth where special care needs to be taken to protect sensitive seedlings. This period begins before the seeds are ever planted. One of the most import strategies of controlling damping off is preventing it in the first place. Since the damping off fungi typically survive on plant debris, soil, or in contaminated water, all pots, trays, potting mixes and other planting equipment must be sterilized prior to planting. New trays, pots, and potting mix are typically sterile. If you are reusing last year's pots and trays, they should be soaked in a 10% bleach solution for about 30 minutes. It is best to use new unopened potting mix to start seeds. Garden soil should not be used.\n\nInfection of seedling stems by the damping off fungi results in thin wiry rotted stems that cannot support the seedling. Michelle Grabowski\n\nOnce seeds are planted, it is important to maintain a good growing environment for the seed. Potting mix should be moist but not soggy. The damping off fungi thrive in wet cool conditions. Many types of seeds, like tomatoes, need warm soil to germinate and grow well. Warming mats designed specially for heating seedling trays from below are sold through many garden catalogues and nurseries. These may be very helpful in preventing damping off especially if seeds are being grown in cool areas like a basement or garage.\n\nCareful attention should be paid to watering seedling trays. Seeds need moisture to germinate, but too much water will encourage damping off. All pots and trays should have drainage holes to allow excess water to drain away. Seedlings should be watered with lukewarm clean water (like tap or other drinking water). Watering with cold water will slow seedling growth and favor the damping off fungi. Hoses and watering heads should be kept off the floor where they could come into contact with infected soil or plant debris. An oscillating fan can be used to increase air flow around the seedlings, but care should be taken to avoid over drying of the sensitive new plants.\n\nCultural practices that result in tall, thin, weak plants like growing plants under low light conditions or over fertilizing with nitrogen will result in increased damping off problems. Provide seedlings with just enough of what they truly need. A little care now will have great rewards later in the summer when you are enjoying your beautiful garden plants.\n\nNarcissus Bulb Fly\n\nJeffrey Hahn, Asst. Extension Entomologist\n\nNarcissus bulb fly adult. J. Hahn\n\nThe narcissus bulb fly is an insect that attacks a variety of flower bulbs, including amaryllis, narcissus, tulip, hyacinth, and scilla. Although it looks likes a bumble bee, this insect is a type of syrphid fly (also called flower fly or hover fly). Most syrphid flies are black and yellow and smooth-skinned, mimicking bees or wasps. A narcissus bulb fly, on the other hand, is very hairy. It is about 1/2 inch long and varies in color but is generally orange or reddish brown and yellow.\n\nWhile many syrphid flies are beneficial because their larvae feed on aphids, a narcissus bulb fly is one of the few in this group to damage plants. Adults lay eggs in the spring between the sheath and stem of plants. After ten to fourteen days, the eggs hatch into maggots which bore into the outer bulb scales, eventually tunneling down to the basal bulb plate. After a while they move directly into the bulb where they complete their development. This tunneling usually turns the inside of the bulb soft and mushy. This feeding often kills the bulbs - if they should survive, they will not put up very vigorous growth the following season.\n\nNarcissus bulb fly and damage on amaryllis. J. Hahn\n\nAlthough this fly occurs throughout the U.S., it is not clear how common the narcissus bulb fly is in Minnesota. At best it appears to occur infrequently. There are 28 specimens in the Entomology Department's insect collection but none are recorded from being collected in Minnesota. On one occasion during June, the author has seen an adult flying outdoors (although it was not correctly identified at the time) but has otherwise not encountered specimens himself or from submitted samples.\n\nBut narcissus bulb flies do occasionally damage plants as some infested bulbs have been reported. A home grower found a small percentage of her amaryllis to be infested (this was verified by rearing a larva into an adult fly). She had kept them outside in potted plants during the summer of 2006. She noticed damage later in the winter after she brought them in. These amaryllis were grown from seed so it was not a matter of buying already infested bulbs. She also found damaged amaryllis bulbs again in 2007. If you have bulbs that have wilted for no apparent reason, take a closer look, you might find the narcissus bulb fly. It is not clear whether this fly attacks the hardy bulbs planted in Minnesota gardens.\n\nControl is difficult, especially since this is not a common pest. Your best bet is to destroy badly infested bulbs so the fly can not complete its development. If bulbs are not too far gone, it may be possible to salvage them. This can be done by cutting bulbs vertically into four or more sections making sure that each piece has at least 2 scales attached to a portion of the basal plate. Let the cut surface dry for a few hours so it can suberize (make a corky-like layer of dried cells- like what one does with potatoes) before planting. The corky layer can make pathogen attack less likely. The larger the bulb piece, the faster it can produce a new flowering plant. Be sure to plant bulb sections in new, clean potting soil that is kept moist but not soggy.\n\nGarden calendar for February\n\nContributors: Michelle Grabowski and David C. Zlesak\n\nRabbit and human tracks in freshly fallen snow. David Zlesak\n\nLook for tracks of rabbits and other critters in freshly fallen snow to get an idea of wildlife activity. Consider protecting valuable plants with wire or other barriers if you have not done so already. As the winter progresses, herbivores can become less and less choosy and eat plants they normally would avoid.\n\nContinue to plan your 2008 gardens and place orders for seeds and nursery stock that you plan on getting from mail order suppliers.\n\nEstablish a game plan for pruning. Scout trees and shrubs for cankers and galls and determine which trees and shrubs many need some pruning to direct growth, remove dead or broken branches, or thin overcrowded or rubbing branches.\n\nContinue to scout houseplants and new seedlings for insect or disease pests and intervene quickly to avoid outbreaks.\n\nThe lengthening days can stimulate overwintering plants like coleus and geranium into more active growth and allow for nice stem cuttings from which to propagate more plants. For more on taking stem cuttings please refer to this past issue."

      "text": "Office Hours\n\nFall Foliage\n\nPosted: October 15, 2012It's a combination of several factors. First, the eastern\nseaboard is home to a wide variety of deciduous trees that naturally color\nwell, such as maple, oak, birch, hickory, ash, black gum, and sweet gum.\nSecond, at our latitude, as autumn progresses into winter, we get temperatures\ncooler than those of more southerly latitudes combined with days longer than\nthose of more northerly latitudes. Third, our normal weather pattern is such\nthat we often get long stretches of ideal conditions for the brightest colors:\ndry, relatively warm, sunny days and cool, but not freezing, nights.\n\nOf\ncourse, \"normal\" weather varies from year to year, and we don't always get\nthose ideal conditions. Drought, excessive rain, cloudy days, warm nights, or\nan early freeze can all lessen the intensity of fall foliage; but there will\nalways be some trees that live up to our brightest expectations.\n\nThat's\nbecause some of that bright fall color is in the leaf throughout the growing\nseason. We just don't see it because it is masked by the green chlorophyll, the\nsubstance in the leaves that absorbs sunlight to transform carbon dioxide and\nwater into oxygen and carbohydrates used by the plant.\n\nIn\nautumn, as the days begin to shorten, a special layer of cells develops at the\npoint where the leaf stem attaches to the branch. This \"abscission layer\"\ngradually cuts off nutrients and water to the leaf. As a result, the green\nchlorophyll in the leaf begins to break down, exposing the more stable pigments\npresent in the leaf. Orange colors result from carotenoids, the same pigments\nfound in carrots, oranges, and marigolds, for example; yellow colors come from\nxanthophylls, the pigments that also color dandelions, egg yolks, and bananas,\namong others.\n\nThe\nreds and purples of autumn are the result of another class of pigments, called\nanthocyanins, that also give apples, grapes, cranberries, violets, and other\nfruits and flowers their color. In certain leaves, these pigments occur only in\nautumn as sugars are trapped in the leaves. Red maples, with more acidic sap,\nturn red; while ash, which is more alkaline, turns purplish. The amount of\nanthocyanins that develops depends on the weather; the ideal combination of dry\nsunny days and cool nights means the brightest reds and purples.\n\nIt's\na pleasure to take a hike in one of our nearby state parks to enjoy those\nwonderful colors of fall. But fall colors are not limited to red, orange, and\nyellow, nor found only in leaves. Flowers, berries, bark, and seedheads expand\nthe range of autumn colors to include tans, lavenders, pinks, mauves, and soft\nrose. And we don't all have room for a sugar maple in our backyard. Shrubs,\nperennials, ornamental grasses, bulbs, and annuals can bring just as much fall\ncolor as a sugar maple to your garden or even a container, but on a smaller,\nmore manageable scale."

      "text": "AROUND THE GARDEN; Blooms for the Winter\n\nThe ''dormant'' season usually stretches from early December until buds start to swell in spring in mid-April. The term is suggested by deciduous trees and shrubs, which lose leaves and are truly at rest - dormant. Evergreens, however, because they retain foliage are never truly dormant. Although they do not grow during the cold period, their leaves are subject to desiccation from sun and winds. Leaf surfaces are warmed and lose moisture. At night temperatures plummet and leaves - and plants - are often damaged. The use of windscreens, anti-desiccant sprays and watering dry soil during the January thaw help. Sometimes winter damage never shows up until late spring when evergreen leaves show dark browned patches. In severe winters, flower buds are killed. LAWN/LIME\n\nWould it damage a lawn to lime it now? F.G., Baltimore, Md.\n\nNo. If the lawn is free of snow, but still cold, it can be walked on safely and lime applied with a spreader. The lime will work down into the soil with snow thaws and spring rains. But if the lawn is soggy and wet, not frozen, it should not be walked on or worked on. These footmarks remain and can cause irreparable damage. Lime application should be delayed to late spring when the ground is firm. Note: Lime and fertilizer can be applied at the same time. FRUIT TREE PRUNING\n\nOur five-year-old peach tree has never provided fruit. Should we prune it now or will we cut any chances of fruit this year? B.C., Pelham, N.Y.\n\nSince peach trees flower on wood that grew last year, pruning now would remove any possible fruit for this year. Delay pruning until after the flowering season to stimulate new growth, strengthen the tree and encourage fruiting wood for the future.\n\nAddress questions to Garden News, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.

      "text": "How to Prune Hibiscus Trees\n\nThe hibiscus tree, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L., is native to China but widely planted in tropical areas of the United States. For most of the year, hibiscus trees produce large flowers that open for only one or two days. The plant blooms on new wood, so heavy pruning greatly reduces flower production. The best course is to prune lightly throughout the year. If heavy pruning must be done, do so in February or March, before the surge of new growth in the spring.\n\nInstructions\n\nClean tools before pruning. Sanitize them with rubbing alcohol or a 10 percent bleach solution before each cut. Use pruning shears or loppers for most cuts.\n\nRemove dead, diseased and broken branches. Make cuts at a 45-degree angle just above a healthy bud, or cut back to the main trunk flush with the branch collar.\n\nPrune out weak branches and branches that rub or interfere with other branches or nearby structures.\n\nMaintain the size and shape of the tree by pruning a few branches each month. Trim the longest branches each month until the bush is the size and shape desired. This will allow you to prune the tree without interrupting flowering."

      "text": "Swamp White Oak\n\nSwamp White Oak — Quercus bicolor\n\nQuercus is Latin meaning fine tree; bicolor refers to the two colors of the leaves — dark green above and pale or silvery white below. One of the most famous specimens of Swamp White Oak is the \"Big Tree\" in Geneseo, New York, under which western New York was purchased from the Seneca Indians for $100,000.\n\nAlthough the common name implies that this species belongs in a swamp, it is one that adapts well to Denver's heavy, poorly-aerated clay soils. It is because this native of lowland soils of the midwest and eastern United States can tolerate poorly-aerated, swampy soils that it can also tolerate our heavy soils.\n\nThe two- toned leaves are glossy green above and whitish beneath. The white tone is the result of a covering of fine hairs or pubescence. This characteristic is most evident on the younger leaves. The foliage is shallowly lobed, or perhaps better described as coarsely toothed. Acorns are on long stalks with a cup-shaped base covered with wart-like scales similar to those of white oak. In winter, this species is often confused with its close relative, white oak, because the mature bark is similar. The distinguishing winter features, when compared with white oak, are the more prominent, but blunt buds and less open, and more upright growth habit.\n\nPlease Note: Both trees at this Station were replaced in 1995. The Swamp White Oak was struck by lightning and later was severely damaged by heavy snowfall in 1995. The Lodgepole Pine died of unknown causes. Because of the ability to adapt to the heavier, poorly- drained soils and the strong branching habit, this tree deserves more planting."

      "text": "The Atlas Cedar has thin needles that spread off the branch in small bunches and are about one or two centimeters long. Seed cones are egg-shaped and fairly smooth, looking like they've been woven out of thin wicker, about two to three inches in size which turn from green to brown. On most varieties the needles are a rich Christmas green color, with the exception of the Blue Atlas Cedar where they're a silver-blue. The trees grow in a wide based pyramid shape with bases between 30 and 40 feet and heights of 40 to 60 feet. Branches don't grow in a regular pattern and the shape of the tree can be fairly irregular.\n\nGrowth and Care\n\nAtlas Cedars prefer moderate climates as they're not particularly fond of the cold, which often leads to damage in marginal climate areas. They grow best (although always fairly slowly, at about 12 inches per year) in anything from partial shade to full sun and if they're rooted deep enough that can stand little water, wind and excessive heat. Acidic, moist soil areas are best but it can tolerate other types (especially with fertilizer). When picking a fertilizer for the tree, you want one which is formulated for woody growth, not foliage growth. When thinking ahead into long term care, keep in mind that you can keep snow damage to a minimum by pruning long branches early in its life. Other problems which plague the tree can include borers, root rot, sapsuckers and weevils.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nAtlas Cedar wood is often used in construction of furniture and railroad ties. The oil is heavily cedar scented, which keeps away bugs. It was brought to the United States in 1845 as an ornamental tree and has failed to become popular. In its natural habitat in Morocco, the area is currently lacking a ready water supply and the trees are suffering the effects of sapsuckers."

Besides beauty and greenery, fruit trees provide you with tasty, healthy fruit that you never have to worry about being chemically sprayed. You may not believe that growing fruit trees is easy. You may even doubt that you have enough space. You will be shocked to discover that fruit trees come in dwarf sizes, and are very easy to grow. You can have a stunning little tree with wonderful fruit producing right on your balcony or patio.\n\nDwarf fruit trees are ideal for beginning gardeners or anyone who only has a limited amount of backyard space. With only about 8 feet of space, you can have a high producing produce tree. You can also grow dwarf fruit trees in small containers. You will have a surprisingly large crop of fruit growing right on your patio or home balcony. This makes it possible to have great little trees in any landscape.\n\nMost dwarf fruit trees are really easy to grow. It will be important to know what type of fruit grows best in your climate. A professional from a nursery in your town should be able to give you the smartest advice. Some fruit trees are easier to maintain, and grow better than others. Some of those are dwarf apple trees and dwarf persimmon trees. These trees are great for a new gardener because they are easier to prune and harvest. Dwarf fruit trees give the same size fruit as bigger trees.\n\nSome fruit trees are hardy, but they mostly thrive in a mild climate. Places like California are wonderful for plum trees. They do not like months of tough, freezing winter, nor will they do well with tough heat. Persimmon trees are the toughest, and can deal with almost anything. Almost all dwarf trees will need much sun and tons of water.\n\nEven with very little space, you will be able to enjoy a fruit tree. A dwarf fruit tree will bring you beautiful foliage and plump fruit for very little maintenance. Ask for professional advice so that you can have a fruit tree with success. This will help you understand what your dwarf tree will need on a daily basis. You will get to have delicious fruit in your home for seasons to come."

      "text": "As a county agent, many questions that come to me by phone, email or office visit get to be more routine over the years. Many are seasonal questions while others are get more item specific.\n\nI wish I could tell you the number of times clients will ask me about what is growing on their trees. Obviously, the concern is that the organism is causing damage to the tree.\n\nThis may be true on some things, but also may be a symptom to other tree problems. I will share information from a UGA publication prepared by Mila Pearce, IPM Homeowner Specialists.\n\nFirst, to get an image of some of the items I am going to describe, you may want to get a copy of this educational publication or do a computer image search to get a visual impression.\n\nThe first item I want to discuss is lichens. I have probably received thousands of calls over the years on lichens.\n\nYou not only will find lichens on trees, but you can find them on rocks, window panes and plants. Lichens are blamed for causing poor tree health, but they are a symptom of other issues and are not the cause.\n\nTo be technical according to Pearce, lichens are composite, symbiotic organisms made up from members of different biological kingdoms. The lichen fungi will group up with items such as algae, cyanobacterium or even both to make food through photosynthesis.\n\nWhy is it on my tree? When living things, such as trees or plants, are stressed and are in decline, their canopy can be reduced. When the canopy is reduced, more sunlight can get into the interior and aid photosynthesis for lichens. How do you get rid of lichens?\n\nRemember, that lichens are harmless to the tree, but is a sign that the tree is stressed. If you can improve the health of the tree, the tree canopy should become fuller.\n\nThis will cut down the available sunlight so photosynthesis will be reduced for the lichens to prosper. For more detail, read up on how the lichen fungi and its partners work together to make food. Pretty interesting.\n\nMistletoe is an evergreen parasitic plant found on many trees in our area. Since it is an evergreen, you can see it fairly easily right now. Mistletoe is known to have a wide range of host trees such as oak, maple, cottonwood and birch.\n\nIt is true that mistletoe can get minerals and water from the host, but it is capable of making food. Mistletoe leaves have chlorophyll and can make food like other plants.\n\nMistletoe will grow berries that can be eaten by birds. The birds will then spread the seed to other tree hosts by excreting the seeds. The seeds will germinate and grow into the tree. This is how it can obtain water and other mineral nutrients.\n\nMistletoe normally grows slow at first and takes years before producing seed. Most healthy trees can handle a small mistletoe infestation, but over time the individual branches can be damaged according to Pearce.\n\nThe branches will be more damaged by wind or cold. A heavy mistletoe infestation can affect overall tree health and even kill a tree if the tree is going through other stresses.\n\nRemoving mistletoe when it can be done easily can help. Pearce states that mistletoe may be pruned out one foot below the point of attachment.\n\nIf the mistletoe is located on a main limb or trunk, removing the top of the mistletoe and wrapping the cut with an opaque plastic will prevent sunlight and be helpful.\n\nFinally, slime molds are a group of organisms that have over 700 different species.\n\nYou will find them in lawns, flower beds, gardens and anywhere organic matter is present. I get calls on folks seeing the blobs of slime mold in areas such as mulch.\n\nI mention slime molds since you see it more after times of good moisture like we have now. Slime molds are more nuisance than harmful.\n\nIn mulch, raking the mold or jet spraying with water usually solves the problem.\n\nFor more information, contact Gordon County Extension at 706-629-8685 or email gbowman@uga.edu."

      "text": "Sunday - May 16, 2010\n\nQUESTION:\n\nWhat plants are good to put under pine trees in the shade? I live in the Dallas Fort Worth area? The previous owners stuck a Japanese Maple in there that seems to be ok and some sort of holly bush (non bearing) that's doing ok. The space beneath the trees is about 20 feet long and 8 feed wide. I'd like some color if possible.\n\nANSWER:\n\nAcer palmatum, Japanese maple is non-native to North America, which puts it out of our area of expertise as well as our Native Plant Database, so we can't comment on that. Both it and the holly are tolerant of shade so that is probably why they are doing okay under the pine trees. We were curious about what pines you had, and checked on the 10 members of the Pinus genus native to Texas. Of these, 8 were native to very far West Texas or very far East Texas. Pinus echinata (shortleaf pine) and Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) both grow in Northeast Texas, not too far from Tarrant County. Of course, you can buy any plant and plant it wherever you wish, but the plant won't necessarily prosper where the soil, climate or rainfall are not what that plant is accustomed to.\n\nWhen considering plants to go under pine trees, you not only have to look at the shade, but also the litter factor; that is, pine needles falling virtually year-round, even though the tree is evergreen. Those needles will contribute to the acidity of the soil, whereas many of the areas in Texas, including Tarrant County, have mostly alkaline, clay soils. Because of this acidity, pine trees can sometimes exhibit allelopathy, which is the emission of substances intended to inhibit competing plants. Another consideration is water: the pines have shallow roots and will soak up all the water they can get. So, before we recommend any plants native to your area to go under those trees, let us make some recommendations of action to take first: (1) Limb up the pines, trimming back lower branches both to cut down on the number of needles and also to let more light and rainwater in under those branches. (2) Spread an organic topsoil, or, better, a good quality compost about 3 or 4 inches deep over the area. This protects the shallow tree roots, adds nutrients to the soil, and gives your new plants a slightly less acidic environment. (3) Rake up pine needles about once a week with a small rake that can be maneuvered between your in-ground plants. If you have a compost pile, they could go in that. If you want to make a path, they are excellent for lining paths. (4) For at least the first year or so your new plants are in the ground, keep them watered beneath the pines, remembering that the pines are moisture-grabbers.\n\nNow, for plants to go beneath those pines, we will go to our Recommended Species for North Central Texas, and choose some native shrubs, ferns, and perennial herbaceous blooming plants for part shade (2 to 6 hours of sun daily) or shade (less than 2 hours of sun). Follow the links to our page on individual plants to learn how big they get, how and when to propagate, when and what color they bloom, etc.\n\nMore Compost and Mulch"

The resulting tree wounds also disrupt the necessary movement of organic compounds to roots and trees which can cause a reduction in vigor.\nSo bump and bang away with your mower and trimmer; burn those leaves and trash next to a tree trunk or under a tree's canopy; let your pet cat scratch on the bark or a newly planted sapling."

      "text": "JAPANESE BLACK PINE\n\nSummary\n\nWhen looking for the perfect tree to train for bonsai, the Japanese Black Pine\nshould land on the top of the list. This strong tree responds quite well to a\nnumber of techniques while providing excellent growth characteristics. Because\nof the Japanese Black Pine being so hardy and versatile, it makes a great choice\nfor beginner or advanced bonsai enthusiasts.\n\nProper Care\n\nKeep the soil well drained and a mixture of 50/50 pumice and akadama. If you\nhave a younger Japanese Black Pine, then you should add a little more grit\nwhereas the more mature trees like more akadama. The key is to go with soil that\ndrains well to eliminate the risk of root rot. In addition, the Japanese Black\nPine must be kept evenly moist, never too damp. In fact, when watering, we\nsuggest you keep the soil a little more on the dry side in that this tree can\nwithstand some drought. Just remember that water for the Japanese Black Pine\nshould have a pH level between 5.5 and 6.5 for the best results.\n\nThe Japanese Black Pine loves full sun and in the summer time, can easily\ntolerate temperatures of 100 degrees or more. Keep in mind that when kept in\nfull sun all summer long, the color of this bonsai tree will change to a\ngreen/yellow color whereas in the shade or partial shade, the color would turn a\nbeautiful, deep green. Because the hot sun can cause the bonsai container to\nbecome too hot, thus baking the tree's roots, you should cover the container\nwith some type of material that can block out sun.\n\nDuring the springtime, the Japanese Black Pine must be significantly pruned.\nInterestingly, while other deciduous trees need to be fertilized, this species\ndoes not. However, this type of bonsai does appreciate products like Bio Gold in\nmid-spring through early fall. For pruning, this would be performed in late fall\nor early winter to help stop sap bleeding. Once a branch has been cut off, use a\nsharp knife with putty cut paste around the edges of the wound.\n\nThe key with the Japanese Black Pine is to work slowly. In fact, training of\nthis type of bonsai tree should take place over several years. Unfortunately,\ndramatic pruning causes too much stress on the tree. Then, once the tree has\nbeen pruned, make sure it stays in shade for about three to four weeks.\nAdditionally, the Japanese Black Pine should not put in locations where there\nare extreme temperatures.\n\nTo help promote ramification, shoot trimming should be done but only after the\ngrowing season is over. While you can prune this tree in the fall, be sure this\nis done only on well-fed and mature trees. Typically, the best time to wire this\ntree is late in the wintertime. Wiring any other time of the year causes sap\nleakage, which damages and even kills branches. The repotting schedule for the\nJapanese Black Pine depends largely on the region in which you live. For this,\nyou would need to talk to your local gardening center or nursery for the best\nadvice. Regardless, be sure you do not remove too much root at the time of\nrepotting and be aware of root feeder channels during the trimming process.\n\nFor the Japanese Black Pine, you want to rearrange the roots gently each time\nyou repot the tree. This tree will need good surface root structure as well.\nOnce the tree has been repotted, it should be set in partial sunlight or bright\nshade for about three to four weeks. Finally, the red spider mite is an enemy of\nthis tree, attacking stressed or weak trees. Therefore, make it a part of your\noverall maintenance to check for these insects weekly, appearing as red specks\non the tree's needles."

However, if you live in an area where cold temperatures are a much greater concern it mandates that you know which palms to buy. It's a must that you know how cold it actually gets in your aea.\n\nThe limiting factor in the successful growing of palms is the degree of cold weather that any given palm species will see during the winter. So, if you don't want to grow a palm for a few years just to see it severely damaged or killed by one cold night, you must determine how cold does it get on the coldest night during the winter. And, is that low value typical of most winters. Regarding palms, you don't need to know the \"temperature zone\", but the actual low temperature \"number\". This is because, within any zone, there are variations and microclimates.\n\nThere are methods and instruments you can use to determine the lowest temperature during a winter, but they only record the current winter. That doesn't do you much good if you want to plant some palms now. If you are new to an area, the best thing you can do is to ask some locals about low temperatures. Or, go to a local nursery - one that's been around for a while - and ask the owner or an employee who's worked there for a long time.

      "text": "Invite fall color home\n\nBrilliant hued leaves announce the arrival of autumn almost everywhere you look this month.\n\nFor sure, trees are the stars of this seasonal show. Along roadways, our eyes are riveted to the wide spectrum of changing leaf pigments – from greens to golds, reds to purples. During walks, I pause to tuck leaves into a pocket and secretly wish for yard space to contain a forest of such colorful mature trees.\n\nYet for more than 1,200 years, people have invited fall color into their lives and enjoyed the changing seasons around their dwellings by planting trees in containers. Renown for its foliage, the slow-growing Japanese maples (Acer palmatum) is a popular pick featuring striking branch patterns and different leaf shapes in a variety of textures. With numerous cultivars to choose from that fit well in either a pot or a plot, you and I can also cultivate the beauty and ambiance of a mature tree however small our space. The most important consideration is matching the maple to a location.\n\nWhat to plant\n\nJapanese maples produce small red or purple flowers and winged fruit I label \"miniature helicopters\" that twist and turn as they spiral toward the ground. The leaves feature five to nine palmate lobes –some wide, while others are finely dissected and threadlike. Branch patterns vary from round to vase or weeping. Height ranges from the dwarfs (developed for bonsai) that reach maturity at under 6 feet to trees that grow 15 to 30 feet tall. Japanese maples are separated into two groups:\n\nCascading lace-leafed varieties (Dissectums) popular for their finely cut foliage and graceful draping branches. This group is often seen in rock gardens, along pathways, near water and containerized.\n\nMini-maples (Uprights) that can grow as wide as they are tall in an open form with space between branches while some form pendulous branches that provide a striking winter silhouette. Many are slow growing, others are robust. Several tolerate sun and heat, most do not.\n\nWhere to plant\n\nOften called \"understory trees\" in their native habitat of Asia, Japanese maples flourish best in the afternoon shade of buildings or under the filtered canopy of tall trees. Although most maples are moderately drought-tolerant, they are thin-barked and easily scald in the sun, especially recently transplanted younger trees that are still establishing roots. Some sun is necessary to trigger pigmentation, but too much can bake roots and burn leaf tips.\n\nRed-leaved and variegated varieties do not tolerate direct sun as well as green-leaved cultivars. Wind is also a stressor that fries leaves and dries the soil. This past summer in Solano County's warmer sections, weeks of hot temperatures turned many Japanese maple leaves prematurely brown and/or disrupted the pigmentation process, especially if they were under-watered.\n\nPlanting in a container\n\nChoose a container that is no larger than twice the diameter of the root ball and half the depth of the roots. Japanese maples prefer well-drained slightly acidic soil but can tolerate alkaline soil. During the summer, an application of loose mulch provides protection from sun damage and help retain moisture. However, keep mulch away from the tree's trunk to avoid root rot, especially in rainy weather.\n\nPlacing the container atop a wheeled platform offers you flexibility to roll your maple tree to different locations until you find just the right spot for it to thrive.\n\nWhatever variety of Japanese maple that you pick to plant, the color choices are endless. Do you like chartreuse and amber leaves, or magenta, scarlet, or maroon? How about rosy or salmon pink or mauve? Maybe crimson, soft creamy yellow, milk chocolate, purple brown – or what about an orange that's fiery or one that's rusty? Do you want your tree with green bark or black bark – or coral? Even leaf veins vary from red to black to brown.\n\nWhatever your preference, you can't go wrong when you invite home the spectacular fall color of a compact, slow-growing fit-for-a-container Japanese maple.\n\nLauna Herrmann is a Master Gardener with the University of California Cooperative Extension office in Fairfield.

When choosing your tree, check for freshness. Look for a healthy, green appearance and needles that are flexible and don't come off in your hand when you gently stroke a branch.\n\nThe most popular species of Christmas trees in Virginia are the eastern white pine, Fraser fir, Scotch pine, and Norway spruce. A study conducted at Cornell University rated the Fraser fir as the best of these four species for needle retention and fragrance and equal to or better than the others for \"resistance to ignition.\"\n\n\"When you get your tree home, you need to cut an inch off the bottom,\" said Sanderson. \"Cutting the bottom helps ensure your tree will take in the water it needs to stay fresh in your home.\"\n\nYour Christmas tree can absorb as much as a gallon of water the first day you have it up, so placing it in an adequately-sized stand with a sufficient reservoir for water is important. You'll also need to keep it away from heaters and fireplaces.\n\n\"If the tree dries out, you need to take it down and cut the bottom off again,\" said Sanderson. \"It may be a little inconvenient, but you have to check the water every day, maybe even twice a day.\"\n\nSanderson says a good rule of thumb is to treat a green Christmas tree like a fresh bouquet of cut flowers.\n\nLiving, balled-and-burlapped Christmas trees are another popular choice especially since the late-December or early-January climate in Virginia is often conducive to planting. These trees need to be conditioned in an unheated garage or shed for a couple of days before being brought into a heated home. They also need water, but not as much as cut trees, and they shouldn't be kept inside more than ten days.\n\nA choose-and-cut farm can provide a fun outdoor recreational experience for your family as well as a beautiful Christmas tree. Some farmers provide hand saws for you to cut your tree while others will cut the tree for you. To find a choose-and-cut farm, go to \n\n\"I've gone with my family to cut a Christmas tree,\" said Sanderson. \"I have to tell you, it was wonderful!\""

      "text": "2114 Winter browning of evergreens\n\nBrown evergreen needles, needle tips and branch tips are a common sight during the winter and early spring months in Colorado. These are all examples of winter injury usually caused by the drying winds, lack of snow cover, fluctuating temperatures, and low soil moisture that are typical of Colorado's fall and winter seasons.\n\nEvergreen needles transpire or lose moisture during the winter months. To keep functioning well, the plant must replace lost moisture through its roots. But sometimes roots are unable to keep up with the moisture loss, especially in windy conditions when water rapidly evaporates from the needles. In some cases, there's plenty of soil moisture, but plants are unable to absorb it, because the ground is frozen. In other cases, there isn't enough soil moisture available to evergreens. As a result, the needle tissue dries out, turning brown or red.\n\nTo reduce or prevent winter injury, water the root area of evergreens during dry fall and winter months. When snowmelt and rainfall are inadequate, apply water monthly during warm periods when the soil can absorb it. Apply mulch over the root zone to help conserve soil moisture and reduce loss from desiccation.\n\nAlthough it's unattractive, winter injury symptoms are eventually masked in the spring when new growth develops and old needles drop. Affected plant parts don't usually need to be removed."

      "text": "The Garden Life: Winter can be a colorful time in garden\n\nRobb Rosser is a WSU-certified master gardener. Reach him at Write2Robb@aol.com.\n\nThe most effective gardens start with a basic selection of plants that offer something of interest throughout the calendar year. In midwinter, the most striking plant in my garden is the large shrub known as \"Copper Beauty\" witch hazel (Hamamelis intermedia 'Jelena'). This dramatic shrub sports spindly, metallic orange-yellow flower petals that emerge from bare branches in such profusion that it seems fall color has returned to the garden.\n\nIn addition to colorful blossoms, this 6- to 8-foot-high shrub has an attractive vase shape, beginning 21/2 feet wide at the bottom and spreading 12 to 15 feet wide at the top. In the foreground, at its feet, the golden hue of the yellow threadleaf cypress (Chamaecyparis pisifera \"Filifera Aurea\") deepens as temperatures drop. It's a striking combination in my winter garden.\n\nThere are quite a few shrubs and small trees that produce red fruit that persists into the winter months. The vast assortment of hollies could fill a landscape with winter\n\nberries in red, yellow and orange. Creamy yellow and bright green variegated forms are especially showy in winter. Even the deciduous holly (Ilex verticillata), with winter branches as bare as weathered bones, hosts a profusion of bright red berries. There are more red berries on my holly this year than ever before.\n\nAll hollies need a male and female to produce their berries. Both will flower, but the trick is to find male and female hollies that will flower at the same time so that cross-pollination will produce berries on the female plants. \"China Boy\" and \"China Girl\" know the secret as well as \"Blue Angel\" and \"Blue Prince.\" When you buy your holly, check with your nursery personnel to be sure that you are getting compatible varieties.\n\nOther berry-producing plants include an assortment of viburnums, including the highbush cranberry (Viburnum trilobum) and the deep, purple-black berries of David's viburnum (Viburnum davidii). Aucubas, even those planted in shade, have decorative oblong berries. Many trees, including the European mountain ash and crabapple, carry berries through winter, drawing an assortment of birds to the garden.\n\nIn Southwest Washington it's often true that we don't see the forest for the trees. Evergreens are such a solid part of our gardens that we occasionally forget the impact they have. There is a reason that we are called the Evergreen State. From the vast selection of conifers available to us today, we can fill any size of garden with a solid base of year-round color. Take any established plant from the Hinoki cypress to the basic arborvitae and you'll find a variety with Aurea added to the name to denote its yellow coloration.\n\nTake advantage of the barrenness of the season and plant deciduous trees with good bark color and texture. The European whitebark birch (Betula utilis var. Jacquemontii) is breathtaking. A single, clump-forming birch will have multiple trunks to show off its bark but won't overwhelm a small garden. If you have a large, country property with rocky, well-drained soil in full sun, plant Aspen for their ghostly gray winter bark.\n\nIn winter we can appreciate many of our plants' features that get lost in the muddle of the summer garden. Two small trees that I often recommend grow easily in Clark County and shine in winter. These are the paper bark maple (Acer griseum) and the coral bark maple (Acer palmatum \"Sangokaku\"). The peeling, paper bark curls back to reveal bright cinnamon branches and the coral bark has the reddest highlights of the winter garden.\n\nOther winter bonuses include the flowering winter camellias and the fresh blossoms of the perennial Christmas rose (Helleborus niger). If you have a bare spot in a shrub border, try planting a small stand of dwarf heavenly bamboo (Nandina domestica). On a dreary day next winter you can cut a spray of scarlet berries on evergreen foliage and bring it indoors. If it's cold enough, the frost will give the foliage a blush of red that only comes in winter.\n\nEnjoy the splendor of the winter garden in the Pacific Northwest. Longing for the end of winter in November makes no more sense than wishing for a summer snow. After all, winter weather does have some merit. Because our soil is chilled in winter, daffodils, tulips and crocuses will bloom in spring. Without cold weather, the lilac would not flower and its sweet scent would not fill the garden in late spring."

      "text": "Foliage season begins in mid-to-late September and extends through mid-to-late October. Peak color is estimated to be between October 11 and November 13. However, depending on the weather in the coming weeks, the peak date may be adjusted a few days earlier or later as the season progresses. Beginning in mid September, state foresters report the levels of color spread from across the state. These reports are updated as information becomes available.\n\nAs a savvy foliage fan, it is important to know why we get such splendid colors in the fall. What most people don't know is that the leaves on the trees already possess these spectacular colors but they are hidden. Leaves contain a chemical substance called chlorophyll, the substance that gives leaves their inherent green color. As the season begins to turn cold, trees begin to block the flow of water to their leaves. Without water, the chlorophyll breaks down and vibrant colors are revealed in all their splendor."

      "text": "Gardening with native plants\n\nAuthor and naturalist Christine Lister knows a thing or two about native plants, growing more than 160 gum trees in her hideaway in the Melbourne suburb of Montmorency. Take a stroll through her garden for some local inspiration.\n\nAsk her about her feelings for the bush and Christine will tell you that she feels an affinity for gum trees. So much so she grows 29 different species and thinks of them as the true elders of our country. She appreciates their graceful form, the variety of barks, the different sizes and shapes of the gumnuts and the delicate fringed blossom that attract birds and insects.\n\nAt her property tall gums ring the perimeter with smaller eucalypts planted close together in groups nearer the home to create a natural effect. Twenty grafted gums, which have a long flowering period and more spectacular flowers than the species, have more prominent positions in the garden. They include the lovely 'Summer Red', which has been blooming on and off for nine months and has the added attraction of sculptural gum nuts.\n\nShadow of a drought\n\nSince the long drought, she has chosen to revert to mostly native plants creating a garden of bright dappled shade. She loves plants with fine foliage, such as the Willow Needlewood (Hakea macraeana), and those with a multi-stemmed or irregular habit, such as the Snowy River wattle (Acacia boormanii) and the Zig zag wattle (Acacia macradenia).\n\nHow to design and maintain natives\n\nWhen planting trees, Christine now avoids the larger growers preferring to plant copses of the lower growing, multi-trunked, mallee-style gums. \"I also prune the lower branches of the larger shrubs such as the hakeas, banksias and casuarinas,\" she says. \"This allows your eye to be drawn into the garden so it can wander through the undergrowth.\" That undergrowth is made up of a wide variety of grass-like plants and correas which are long flowering and attract nectar-eating birds. There are many sorts but her favourite is the Chef's Cap Correa (Correa baeuerlenii) which has fuchsia-like flowers. In grass-like plants, she prefers those with fine leaves for the way they move, even in gentle breezes.\n\nMost plants are pruned once a year after flowering to keep them bushy. They are watered at this time and fed with a native plant fertiliser and, like all good gardeners, Christine is prepared to remove plants that are not doing so well rather than nurse them through ill health.\n\nPrecious metal Shade houses and shaded areas feature lush ferns and orchids, which have been Christine's passion for more than 25 years. They are watered using two 3000-litre rainwater tanks beside the front home and two 5000-litre underground tanks near the rear house.\n\n\"I love the element of surprise and delight these areas bring along with the clivias, daffodils and freesias springing up at the feet of the native plants in spring,\" she says. There is also a collection of stag and elk ferns, belonging to her brother-in-law, which are suspended on a reo mesh wall.\n\n\"The other elements of surprise in the garden are my quirky metal sculptures – my garden friends. The older ones have names – Percy the Pelican, Onslow the Owl, Champagne and Charlie Crane and others, now too numerous to name, are just there to capture the imagination,\" she says with a smile.\n\nBringing birds to her paradise\n\nWater is a key element in the garden for its ability to cool the space and attract wildlife and there are dozens of bird baths providing water for birds and insects. Christine used to put out seed for the birds but found that it attracted big birds that kept smaller varieties away. \"So when I built the new house I put in lots of plants that have bird-attracting seeds and planted a dense middle storey for the mid-sized birds like honey eaters and spinebills,\" she says. \"A friend living nearby bred frogs and he released some into the front pond and they come back each year to breed.\"\n\nGet the look for yourself - Ironbark (Eucalyptus sideroxylon 'Rosea') flowers from late autumn to spring with red, pink or cream flowers and a dark furrowed bark. - Geebung (Persoonia pinifolia) has fine foliage and yellow flowers followed by yellow flower spikes then edible fruit. - Rose she-oak (Allocasuarina torulosa) has needle-like foliage and a deeply fissured corky trunk. - Grass tree (Xanthorrhoea australis) are quintessentially Australian and prized for their sculptural form.\n\nWhy you should go native Christine says, when planning your garden, you should go with local plants as they have \"a different palette of colour, shapes and patterns to those of introduced plants\". She says many people discount gum trees because they are not as interesting as imports but argues, \"Gum trees have a subtle beauty in their elegant array of trunks. Some look like old gnarled wood, others like the patterns have been painted on them.\""

This would limit the distance that roots grow outside\nthe planting area and the time they would have to grow into\nsewer line cracks, as well as foundations, sidewalks and\nother infrastructure.\n\nThe University of Tennessee recommends these steps for prevention of tree root damage:\n\nPlant small, slow-growing trees near sewer lines.\n\nIf faster-growing species are desired, plan to replace trees\nevery eight to 10 years.\n\nEven slow-growing trees will eventually interfere with\nsewer lines. These trees must be replaced periodically.\n\nWhen building new sewer lines or improving existing\nlines, consider landscaping plans and potential root intrusion\nfrom trees.\n\nIf you have to plant a tree, choose small, slow-growing species, varieties or cultivars\nwith less aggressive root systems and to replace them\nbefore they get too large for their planting area. There are\nno safe trees, but by using small, slower-growing\ntrees, sewer lines should be safer from the intrusion of tree\nroots.\n\nUT also recommends these common trees as planting options near water and sewer lines: Amur maple, Japanese maple, dogwood, redbud, and fringetree.\n\nThere are some options if you already have tree root damage to your lines. There are products that contain slow-release chemicals\nthat prevent root growth. Other root barriers can include\nvery compact layers of soil; chemical layers such as sulfur,\nsodium, zinc, borate, salt or herbicides; air gaps using large\nstones; and solid barriers like plastic, metal and wood. Each\nof these barriers can be effective in the short term, but long-term\nresults are difficult to guarantee and can significantly harm the tree. Seek professional advice when using these options."

The disease is commonly found on the hard pines, particularly those with two needles in the fascicle. Shore pine (Pinus contorta), lodgepole pine (P. contorta var. latifolia), mugo pine (P. mugo), Scots pine (P. sylvestris), and Austrian pine (P. nigra), appear particularly susceptible. Ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa) does not appear particularly susceptible. This is one of the most common diseases of shore pine yet can be very patchy in distribution.\n\nUnlike white pine blister rust, western gall rust does not require an alternate host to complete its life cycle. Spores produced on pine can reinfect susceptible pines. Spores are shed primarily during shoot elongation. Shoots are susceptible from budbreak through shoot elongation. In the natural landscape, the disease is most commonly found in riparian areas or locations where moist air collects.\n\nSymptoms Rough, globular galls on trunk or branches. Galls are proportionate in size to the branches bearing them. When the fungus is fruiting (aecia), galls are orange or yellow. Galls may kill small trees but increase in size for many years on larger trees. Trees may break easily at the gall.\n\nChemical control Needed only for landscape trees or Christmas trees. Protect new shoots from budbreak through shoot elongation.\n\nPreventive fungicide applications. Based on a single trial in California with Monterey pine, triadimefon provided 7 days of protection and about 2 weeks of kickback activity. Disease control averaged 70%.\n\nArmada 50 WDG at 9 oz/100 gal water. Do not use a silicone-based surfactant. Not for nursery or greenhouse use. A Group 3 +11 fungicide. 12-hr reentry.\n\nBayleton 50 T&O is registered. Landscape only, not for use on plants for sale. 12-hr reentry.\n\nDithane DF at 1 to 2 lb/A or per 100 gal water plus a spreader-sticker. Effective for Scots pine. 24-hr reentry.\n\nPenncozeb 75 DF at 2 to 4 lb/A. 24-hr reentry.\n\nStrike 50 WDG at 8 oz/100 gal water. 12-hr reentry.\n\nGallex (ready to use) painted on very young galls to reduce further development. Galls may return the following year or, if treated late, may continue to develop. Tissue surrounding the gall may be injured especially on younger plants. Prepare the surface by removing debris from around the galled area. Allow drying before application. Registered for use in Oregon and Washington but not registered in Idaho. 24-hr reentry."

      "text": "Everyone can relate to that feeling of panic after making a cut and realizing you've just ruined the shape of your shrub.\nOr perhaps you have ignored a plant's obvious structure problem because you were afraid or unsure of what pruning action to take.\nI continue to see poor pruning decisions throughout the county. The other day after teaching a class on proper pruning techniques, I came home to a neighbor topping their crape myrtles. Why is this bad?\nTopping is a term used to describe the practice of indiscriminate removal of a tree's crown by cutting off large branches and the main stem of a tree, leaving large branch stubs.\nMost topping tragedies happen because we want to maintain a plant at a specific height or to keep it from growing too fast. Topping plants or cutting the central leader is fine when you want to make a scrawny shrub broad and full, but it is a nightmare for trees.\nRemoving the tops of the tree causes it to create several new leaders to replace the ones lost. These leaders compete with each other and compromise the structural integrity of the tree. Trees with one dominant leader are better equipped to handle wind and storms. Also by cutting into thick established wood it can expose the tree to insects and disease.\nAlthough it was once standard practice to make a flush cut when removing a limb, studies show that flush cuts cause extensive trunk decay because the wood that is actually part of the trunk gets cut.\nLarge branches can be too heavy to hold by hand when pruning, so a three-cut method is recommended. The first cut is made on the underside of the branch about 15 inches away from the trunk and as far up through the branch as possible before the branch weight binds the saw.\nThe second cut is made downward from the top of the branch about 18 inches from the main trunk to cause the limb to split cleanly between the two cuts without tearing the bark. The remaining stub can then be supported easily with one hand while it is cut from the tree. The final cut should begin on the outside of the branch bark ridge and end just outside of the branch collar swelling on the lower side of the branch.\nThe branch bark ridge is usually rough, always darker than the surrounding bark, and fairly obvious on most species. The collar is a swollen area at the base of the branch. This region between the branch and the trunk acts as a natural barrier to decay-causing organisms.\nPainting wounds with tree wound dressing is no longer recommended. Research has shown that wound dressings do not prevent decay. When exposed to the sun, the protective coating often cracks, allowing moisture to enter and accumulate in pockets between the wood and the wound covering. This situation may be more inviting to wood-rotting organisms than one with no wound cover.\n\nSusan Brown is a horticulture agent with the Brunswick County Extension Service.

I am considering renting a commercial property with a gigantic chinaberry,that shades the house & parking, but when voicing my concerns about the berries causing anybody to fall, was told that there was a spray that would prevent the forming of fruit, nuts and berries. Yes or no?\n\nANSWER:\n\nThe tree in the previous answer was a pecan, not an almond. Here is an excerpt from that answer:\n\n\".\"\n\nIf the question had been about an almond tree, we would not even have been answering it, as Prunus dulcis (almond) is non-native to North America, but rather originates from Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan and Lebanon. It is a member of the Prunus genus, family Rosaceae, and therefore related to peaches, plums and cherries. Carya illinoinensis (pecan) is a native to North America, and a member of the Juglandaceae or hickory family.\n\nNot only is there no way to keep the chinaberry tree from producing seeds, it is a prolific producer, and an alien invasive tree, native to India, Southern China and Australia. California, in particular, is vulnerable to non-native invasive plants. Read this website from the Plant Conservation Alliance Alien Plant Working Group \"Least Wanted\" Melia azedarach (chinaberry tree). Whoever told you it could be sprayed to keep it from being super prolific with seeds was having you on, as the British say. The primary command in any organism's genetic structure is to reproduce itself, and the chinaberry does far too good a job at that. In answer to your question, no, that's not true that a spray will prevent the formation and distribution of seeds. Our recommendation would be to have it cut down and hauled off. If you want the shade more than you want an environmental friendly, less messy native tree, then you will be stuck with the chinaberry"

      "text": "Grafting Apple Trees\n\nBy: Gene Rodriguez, III\n\nGrafting apple trees is an important way to reproduce trees that won't grow true from seed. Grafting involves taking stems from one tree and attaching it to the trunk or branches of another. The transplanted stem will become part of the \"stock\" tree and continue to grow as normal.\n\nGrafting Apple Trees For Future Growth\n\nThe process of grafting apple trees has a number of benefits, including reproduction of hybrid stock, accelerated growth of pollinated apple trees and the ability to combine different apple type on a single tree. If you are interested in grafting apple trees, here are some tips to get you started:\n\nWhen to start collecting. Once your apple tree has gone dormant (typically in early winter), you can begin to select grafting stock-often called \"scions.\" Scions are healthy stems about one foot long and no wider than ½\" in diameter. Once you've selected the desired number of scions, cut them cleanly from the tree with a sharp knife. Tie the scions together and store them in damp sawdust, moss or wrapped in plastic. Keep the scions over the winter in a cool damp place\n\nBeginning your graft. The best time to begin grafting is in the spring, when the flower buds on the host tree (called the understock) are about to open. To begin, cut off a branch of the understock tree that closely matches the diameter of one of your scions. Leave a stub at least one foot long on the understock branch.\n\nA more perfect union. Next, at the cut end of the scion, cut the branch at an angle creating a sloped end about 1-1/2\" long. Try to make a smooth, accurate cut-a single stroke is often best. On the understock branch, cut a matching slope along the end of the branch stub. These two cuts will form the union between scion and understock.\n\nGetting together. Match the scion with the understock, making sure that at least one side of the scion lines up, and is in contact with, the inner back of the understock branch. Bind the two branches together with electricians tape so that the scion is firmly attached to the understock.\n\nSealing up. Cover the bound area with an asphalt and water tree-sealing compound. Although a wound sealer will work, look for material created specifically for grafting. Use a thick coat and make sure the area is completely covered.\n\nPost op. Once the scion shows signs of growth, you can remove the binding and allow the branch to grow as normal. Don't leave the binding in place indefinitely, as it may inhibit the healthy growth of the grafted branch.\n\nTo get the best quality fruit, apple trees need to be pruned and thinned. This is a daunting task to most homeowners and something that keeps many from trying to grow apples. But homeowners with a little common sense and good tools should be able to prune their apple trees well enough to get good fruit results.\n\nManzanita is a tough but pretty evergreen shrub or small tree common to the arid regions of the United States. Its popularity as a garden plant is growing as gardeners seek native plants that can withstand drought."

      "text": "Cedar-apple, cedar-hawthorn and cedar-quince rust are a series of fungal\ndiseases that depend on two host plants to complete their life cycle. The rust\ndisease spends part of the year on a susceptible juniper and part on a\nsusceptible apple, crabapple, hawthorn or quince, on which they cause premature\ndefoliation, distorted or deeply pitted fruit and fruit abortion.\n\nCedar-apple rust is by far the most serious and widespread of these rusts in\nthis area.\n\nThe symptoms of cedar-apple rust on flowering crab and apple are very easy to\nspot:\n\nIn late spring or early summer, bright, yellow-orange spots about 1/8 to 1/4\ninch in diameter appear on the upper surface of the leaves. The spots slowly\nenlarge and turn orange. Eventually an orange cup-like fungal structure appears\non the lower portion of the leaf directly beneath the lesion on the upper\nsurface. Leaves with numerous spots drop during the summer. Cedar-apple rust\nalso can cause fruit lesions. The affected fruit usually develops deep pits or\nbecomes distorted, and normally drops before harvest.\n\nPremature defoliation weakens the tree, and reduces fruit set and yields the\nfollowing year. Trees with severe defoliation are at risk for other diseases.\n\nCool temperatures (from 50 to 75 degrees) and prolonged leaf wetness (4-6\nhours) favor infection of flowering crabs and apples with the rust. The lesions\nbegin to develop about 3 weeks after infection. As with many fungal diseases,\nthe weather conditions determine the severity of infection.\n\nTo control cedar-apple rust avoid planting apples of flowering crabs adjacent\nto junipers. Keeping apple and cedar trees sufficiently distant from each other\ncan accomplish control of cedar apple rust on apple, so that the fungus cannot\ncomplete its two-year life cycle. But this is hardly practical or even possible,\nas the fungal spores can be carried by wind for up to 2 to 3 miles, and junipers\nare heavily planted in urban and rural areas. Plant apples or crabapples that\nare resistant to the disease. And, apply fungicides in the spring as soon as the\nbright orange gelatinous tendrils of the galls are seen on junipers. Continue\nspraying every 7 to 10 days for as long as the galls remain active (usually\nuntil the end of May). The same spray schedule is used for control of\ncedar-quince rust and cedar-hawthorn rust. Call the Extension Office for current\ninformation on the best fungicides to use, and for a list of resistant or\ntolerant flowering crabapples, apples, hawthorns and quinces."

We went out after dinner last night to observe and gather some specimens for our study. Can I just say that we were intrigued with the variety we have right in our own backyard?\n\nMr. B and I both sketched buds into our nature journal. There has to be no better way to really see what a bud looks like than to try to sketch it in detail. Picking the correct color and seeing the different ways that buds are shaped lead to really truly *seeing* the subject.\n\nAdvanced Study Notebook Page from More Nature Study Book 3\n\nMr. B used the advanced notebook page from the ebook to try his hand at sketching an enlarged bud using the grid paper. He thought this was hard.....I think he just needs a little practice.\n\nSweet Gum Tree Bud\n\nWhat a glorious bud he chose to sketch! This is the sweet gum tree bud...it looks like it is ready to burst open at any moment.

We had never taken the time to really examine the walnut tree bud before so it was a surprise. It was a fun exercise to try to get the sketch right in my journal. It helps to know a little bit about twig anatomy so you notice all the important parts like the leaf scars and the lenticels.\n\nSilver Maple Buds and Key\n\nThe maple tree buds are all burst open and you can see the keys in the image above.

      "text": "Pruning Trees Properly\n\nThe first one is always safety. Trees in areas around your home or on properties where there is foot traffic or vehicles need to be pruned to remove deadwood. Dead limbs fall from trees frequently and should be removed to reduce liabilities with trees making areas safer. During this type of pruning, it also gives the arborist a chance to view the trees canopy (aerial assessment) to look for any types of stress cracks, hanging limbs, structural defects etc. Another safety issue involving tree pruning is to prune for any type of visual obstructions for traffic areas or low hanging limbs and foliage that people could walk into.\n\nSecondly, trees should be pruned for maintenance concerns with homes and buildings. Limbs and foliage touching and rubbing can damage paint and excessive rubbing can even cause minor structural damage. They can also become an entry point for insects or even unwanted critters. Too much low canopy can start to encroach and present conditions favoring mold or mildew build up from poor air circulation and too much shade. Mosquitoes can also become more prevalent in this environment and fungal problems with trees and plants will become more likely. Thinning tree canopies may be necessary for added exposures to certain plantings or turf grasses.\n\nThirdly, trees may be pruned to promote overall health and to help encourage proper growth and structural integrity. Generally speaking, healthy trees have good foliage density but are not overcrowded in the interior. Crown thinning can help alleviate the wind sail effect. Trees with good symmetry and scaffold branch arrangement are typically stronger and less susceptible to storm damage. Dead limbs that are removed routinely and properly vs falling off on their own can prevent damaging wounds that can sometimes happen and lead to decay columns. Dead wood removal also eliminates the hosts for wood boring insects and some diseases. Trees in close proximity to one another often times start to conflict; pruning can helps keep separation between them. This helps maintain good air flow, sunlight, and symmetry in their crowns. Structural pruning could be done to help fruit trees withstand the added weight of the fruit.\n\nFinally, trees are pruned for aesthetics. The purpose for this is to help embellish a property, adding curb appeal and accenting architectural features. Properties with poorly maintained trees and plants can detract from the beauty and make them feel less inviting and hospitable. Differentiation between trees and between trees and structures is welcoming and makes the overall look and feel of a property better. Vista pruning could be put into this section as well. This type of pruning is done to gain a sight line or improve a view, typically of a natural feature such as a lake, mountains, or golf course"

      "text": "Type Your Question Here\n\nMonday, February 6, 2012\n\nAlmost All Plants Like Wood Mulch - Even Desert Plants\n\nRoses don't like rock mulch\n\nQ. I heard it is best to move rock away from my shrubs and replace it with mulch.What is your recommendation?\n\nA. Rock can also be a \"mulch\" and we call it that in our desert landscapes; rock mulch. We have three categories of mulches; organic, inorganic and living. In the organic category are wood mulches. In the inorganic category we have rock mulches. All mulches are important but organic mulches, like wood mulch, give extra benefits to plants that rock mulches cannot.\n\nOur desert creates its own rock mulch and that's why plants that originate from desert environments can \"tolerate\" rock mulches. It is not that they grow better in rock mulch but rather that they survive better in it.\n\nNearly all plants grow better with organic mulch rather than rock mulch when grown in our desert soils. Plants like most of our fruit trees, roses, iris, lilies and those which are not true desert plants, perform better with wood mulch.\n\nMockorange yellowing in rock mulch\n\nThose that come from desert climates like mesquites, acacias, desert bird of paradise, agaves, cacti, etc. will tolerate rock mulch better than nondesert plants. But in most cases they still perform better surrounded by wood mulch.\n\nNewly planted trees and shrubs should have wood mulch kept away from them a distance of about one foot the first few years of their life. After that they usually tolerate wood mulch in contact with their trunk. This is because the wood mulch keeps the soil too moist and can cause the trunk to rot when they're young.\n\n1 comment:\n\nI have gardened in California for more than 30 years where you throw something on the ground and it grows, had an avocado grove in Fallbrook (San Diego Co.) So it's been quite a challenge to garden here, but I am an avid reader of your columns (you seem to always hit on what problem I'm having) and bought Lynn Mills book Gardening in Nevada. With this advice and trial and error I have quite a Paradise, with lots of roses (except the ones that were stolen by a thief I caught with a shovel in my garden one Sunday afternoon- he took 5), fruit trees, lots of bulbs, even a camelia and hydrangeas. When I first heard that you wanted me to cover everything with 4\" of mulch, I thought, no way, it is expensive and the cheaper bigger bags are very heavy, but I have to say, through years of adding purchased and my own mulch (I compost), it's the best thing that I could do for my plants! With vegetables I'm having more trouble, probably because I may not have enough sun with so many trees. For the potatoes, however, I seem to have done everything you suggest, I planted them from seed, in March or beginning of April, and I have been adding soil as you mentioned. I guess I'll have to keep this in mind for next year. Thank you very much for all your help! Respecfully, Ana"

      "text": "Juglans nigra\n\nblack walnut\n\nBlack walnut (Juglans nigra) is a North American flowering tree that is related to the hickory. Dendrologists, and others who fancy deciduous plants and trees, appreciate the fact that these stately giants are outstanding shade providers. However, there is a long-standing belief that black walnut trees also protect the home from lightning strikes. While some believe this is due to the presence of an abundance of minerals in the timber that act as electrical conductors, it may also be due to the fact that mature black walnut trees can reach up to 60 feet in height. Whatever the reason, these trees have apparently saved many abodes from disaster since it was once commonplace to adopt a strategy of planting groves of them in proximity. In fact, the next time you visit a historic residence or farmstead, conduct a visual scan of the property. Chances are you'll see several black walnut trees standing ready to deter misfortune. As an added bonus, early homesteaders knew that the presence of black walnut on a potential stake of property indicated that the land was fertile since these trees require a rich, slightly alkaline, and well-drained soil in order to thrive.\n\nThe hardwood of black walnut is highly valued for its exceptional beauty and durability. The wood is particularly dense, yet it splits readily and is easier to machine than many other types of wood. These qualities have inspired seafarers, gun manufacturers, and undertakers to use the wood to make boats, gunstocks, and coffins from the wood. Of course, many specimens of fine antique furniture are also made of this material. In fact, until mahogany came into fashion in the late 18th century, black walnut was the wood of choice of furniture makers. During World War I, the husks of the tree were used to produce a high-grade charcoal to filter gas masks. In the mid-20th century, various parts of the tree were used to make an insecticide and herbicide, the effectiveness of which was owing to the presence of juglone.\n\nJuglone, chemically known as 5-hydroxy-alphanapthaquinone, is classified an allelochemical, meaning that it negatively affects the growth of certain neighboring plants by impairing enzymatic processes necessary for survival. This is why some gardeners consider black walnut to be a hindrance in terms of limiting options in landscaping. Regardless, juglone is potent stuff. It's the reason that black walnut trees are rarely impacted by disease and explains why insects won't even come into contact with the leaves."

It has been commercially propagated and available in the trade since 1955, ten years after it was discovered by Henry M. Eddie, a Vancouver, B.C., nurseryman.\n\nThe \"white wonder\" part of the name refers to the prolific, attractive white blossoms that the tree produces in spring. The big, beautiful white flowers grow to more than four inches in diameter. Composed of four to six large, rounded and overlapping bracts, these blooms create a striking display.\n\nIts dark green foliage is handsome throughout the summer months, and in the fall, it turns a brilliant, rich red. Small red fruits decorate its branches in winter and attract robins, mockingbirds and cedar waxwings.\n\nA hybrid of the Pacific Northwest native dogwood, Cornus nuttallii, and the Eastern dogwood, Cornus florida, it grows taller and has larger flowers than Cornus florida. It is also easier to grow, more resistant to anthracnose, and generally more adaptable than its other parent, Pacific Dogwood.\n\nUpright and rather pyramidal in form, with slightly pendulous branches, 'Eddie's White Wonder' grows to a height of about 25 feet with a spread of 15 to 20 feet. They grow naturally in partial shade, but will also grow in full sun with ample summer watering. Too much shade will cause them to produce fewer flowers.\n\nThey prefer\n\nAdvertisement\n\nwell-drained, acid soils high in organic matter and like evenly moist soil conditions, but will not tolerate standing water. Be sure your site is well-drained even in the winter.\n\nDogwoods are low maintenance trees. They should only be pruned after flowering to avoid removing any of the current season's flowers. Careful thinning will enhance the horizontal branching pattern but improper pruning can ruin the lovely layered effect. Remove crossing limbs when in flower and use the lovely cut branches for house decorations.\n\nThe flowering of 'Eddie's White Wonder' is somewhat dependent upon the previous years summer weather. After a long hot summer, the spring flowering will be magnificent, so they generally bloom very well in our area.\n\n'Eddie's White Wonder' is a fine specimen tree planted in a prominent corner of the yard. It looks lovely planted with Lily-of-the-valley shrub, Pieris japonica, variegated holly bushes and evergreens.

      "text": "A field guide to campus trees\n\nJudging by the reaction of many Arches readers to our story about the December 2006 windstorm, we may have given the impression that the storm nearly denuded the campus of trees. Not hardly. Southerly gusts did take about 60 trees, but there are more than 800 others, many of them notable. Here, for summer strolling, a brief field guide.\n\nAMERICAN BEECH Fagus grandifolia Description: Broad tree from 35 to 55 feet tall with rounded crown, strong branches, and edible nuts. The bark of both this and the European Beech have a history of being popular with graffiti artists who favor knives over spray paint. Grows up to 100 feet tall. Also known for its fruit, a small, sweet nut in a spiked husk. Leaves: Elliptical, ovalish, ridged, with veins and small, sharp serrations ranging in size from 2.5 to 5.5 inches. Leaves turn copper colored in fall. Bark: Thin and smooth. Grayish in color. Range: Between Jones Hall and Howarth and McIntyre Halls, and on the east side of Todd Field. (Native to eastern North America.) Trivia: Not only is the north of the two beech trees at Jones Hall loved by climbers, it's also popular with those who like to leave their mark in the form of graffiti. \"People climb up and carve their names in it,\" says grounds manager James Vance. While it may be a tradition, cutting into the tree to carve graduation dates, names, and other messages can hurt it. The grounds crew checks the tree two or three times a year to make sure it hasn't been damaged. While the south tree is healthy, it doesn't appear to be as robust or leafy as its northern counterpart because it was damaged in an ice storm. Both trees were moved and replanted when the campus relocated to its current location in the 1920s.\n\nAMERICAN RED HAZELNUT/RED FILBERT Corylus americana Description: Small shrub-like tree about 15 feet tall with light-colored catkins, clusters of flowers that hang down like a tassel. It is known for its fruit, a rounded edible nut in a small husk. Leaves: Rounded to oval, almost heart-shaped, 2 to 3 inches across with serrations. Bark: Brownish and smooth. Range: Near Collins Memorial Library. (Native to eastern U.S.) Trivia: \"I don't think people realize how rare that tree is,\" Vance says. The hazelnuts are rarer still. Students who want to try one fresh from the tree will have to fight campus squirrels for it.\n\nAUTUMN-BLOOMING CHERRY Prunus autumnalis Description: A deciduous tree known for its pink-white flowers, which bloom in early spring, autumn, and during occasional warm periods in winter. Bears half-inch, black fruit. Leaves: Spiky, ovate, green, approximately 1 to 4 inches long. Bark: Gray-brown to dark brown. Range: West side of Wheelock Student Center. (Native to Japan. ) Trivia: Students decorate these trees with paper cranes each spring as a memorial to the 30 Japanese-American students enrolled at the College of Puget Sound who were sent to relocation centers during World War II. Examples of a different variety of cherry tree, on the north side of McIntyre Hall, were planted by the Japanese students themselves in 1942.\n\nDOUGLAS FIR Pseudotsuga menziesii Description: The main component in the river of green that runs the length of the campus, this large, coniferous evergreen is almost cone shaped. Leaves: Long, thin needles ranging from 1 to 1.5 inches long, with tips that may be either blunt or slightly rounded. Color ranges from light yellow green to blue-green on top with a white stripe underneath. Bark: On mature plants, thick, red-brown with deep furrows. Range: Throughout campus. (Native to the Pacific Northwest.) Trivia: Most of the campus firs survived the winter wind storms, although the tree is subject to the risk of being blown over in a stiff wind if growing in clay or glacial till. When workmen cleared trees felled in the December storm from the arboretum, one with a waggish sense of humor carved a remnant stump into the shape of a mushroom. (It was still there as Arches went to press.) Another, larger tree was cut up and made into a picnic table and benches. For many years, the Douglas fir frustrated classification. Over the years it has been tagged as belonging to the spruce and sequoia families, among others. In fact, it isn't a fir at all. It's a member of the pine family. Even its name Pseudotsuga means \"false hemlock.\"\n\nGIANT SEQUOIA Sequoiadendron giganteum Description: A tall, column-like tree that seems to go on forever. At approximately 70 feet, this is one of the highest and most majestic trees on campus, which is in keeping with its characterization as one of the world's tallest types of trees. Leaves: Bluish green, flattened scale-like needles that are short and broad. Also described as awl shaped. Bark: Soft, thick reddish brown with many furrows. Range: In front of Wheelock Student Center. (In nature, generally restricted to the Sierra Nevada of California.) Trivia: The Flower Growers Garden Club planted the UPS tree in 1932. Although university officials and the groundskeepers did not know it, students who climbed to the top of the sequoia at night logged their accomplishment in a waterproof tablet, Vance says. The rite of passage and the tablet were discovered when a student fell out of the tree and was injured. \"It's an extremely difficult tree to climb,\" Vance added. The contents of the tablet appear to back up his assertion. \"There weren't very many names in it.\" (Rumor has it that students are in the process of replacing it with a \"Rite in the Rain\" waterproof notebook. Appropriate, since \"Rite in the Rain\" is based in Tacoma and owned by Scott '74 and Todd '75 Silver.) A sister sequoia was removed to make way for construction of the science center. While it could not be transplanted, the school is growing another one in the greenhouse using branch cuttings from the original.\n\nSILK TREE MIMOSA Albizia julibrissin Description: A broad tree with slender branches and an umbrella-type canopy of small, puffy, pink, almost azalea-like flowers with a white base, producing a riot of color when in bloom. Leaves: Feather-shaped, fern-like compound leaves with lots of leaflets on either side of the stem. Bark: Smooth, grayish. Range: Jones Circle, in front of Howarth Hall and McIntyre Hall. (Also in a swath from most of the Eastern Seaboard below New England, down through the Mid- and Southwest, and up to California.) Trivia: Planted in the 1990s, these campus trees were strategically placed so that people on the second and third floors of buildings would have something pretty outside their windows in mid to late spring, Vance says. Although the best view is from above, these are also attractive when seen from ground level. The tree planted in front of McIntyre Hall honors 30 years of service by Ruby Adams, who worked in Dining and Conference Services. The Howarth Hall tree honors Mike Kinney, a 43-year member of the Facilities Services team.\n\nTALL STEWARTIA Stewartia monadelpha Description: A slow growing, rounded-pyramidal shaped, ornamental deciduous tree with handsome half-inch, white, bell-shaped flowers. Leaves: 1.5 to 2.5 inches, elliptical to oblong, dark green leaves that turn coppery brown in fall. Bark: Reddish, almost cinnamon-colored, bark. Range: Karlan Quad. Also found in a narrow swath on the edges of the U.S., ranging from the Northwest and central California along the Southwest up through the lower Northeast. Trivia: These were donated by a member of the biology faculty. The Stewartia was planted in 2001 as a replacement for a tree originally planted by the alumni from the Class of 1946.\n\nJAPANESE ZELKOVA Zelkova serrata Description: 15- to 20-foot-tall deciduous tree; ideal for providing shade. Also called \"green vase\" and often referred to as \"vase-shaped,\" the tree has a short trunk and branches that grow at tight angles. Often found lining streets. Leaves: Ovate, tapering to a slender point. Dark green on top, lighter shade on lower side. Leaves often change color in fall with hues running the range from yellow and gold to burgundy. Bark: Smooth, light grayish, which peels to reveal a layer of orange below. Range:Along Lawrence Street. (Native of eastern China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.) Trivia: There is no truth to the rumor that these trees were planted in the 1990s just so the university could say it had trees for every letter from A to Z."

      "text": "Garden Q&A\n\nAugust 10, 1997\n\nThe leaves on my two pear trees are developing black splotches, and then they're falling off. The fruit is fine, and I know it's not fire blight, because I'm 83 years old and spent 52 years on the farm.\n\nIs this some new disease?\n\nSounds like the combination of heat and drought is getting to your trees. Ornamental pear trees, like the Bradford, are also exhibiting similar symptoms this summer.\n\nPear leaves tend to turn black during periods of drought and high heat, especially near the leaf tips and margins. Continue to keep trees well watered. Water the root zone deeply (out past the canopy).\n\nPesticides will produce similar symptoms on fruit trees if they are applied during hot, dry weather. (See checklist item.)\n\nOn some of the trees in my yard, I'm noticing twigs and branches that are losing leaves and looking dead. Should I prune them out now?\n\nThis summer's drought is taking a toll on landscape plants, including mature trees.\n\nBefore getting out the pruning shears, though, you should scrape away the outer bark of those dead-looking branches with a sharp knife to see if the underlying tissue is still green. If you see green, that means the tree branch is still alive and will recover.\n\nIf you have any question about whether a particular branch is still viable, wait until the trees leaf out in the spring. Regrowth means the branch is OK.\n\nStrange-looking green and black insects with black legs are running all over my squash plants, and the leaves have white speckles all over them.\n\nPlease identify these unwelcome invaders and tell me what I can do about them.\n\nYou're noticing squash bug nymphs.\n\nThese pests hatch out from copper-colored eggs that you may have noticed on squash leaves, stems, blossoms and fruits. The bugs turn from black to brown as they reach the adult stage and attain a length of a half-inch. Adults emit a strong odor when crushed.\n\nThe nymphs and adults suck plant sap, leaving small white or yellow spots.\n\nBotanical insecticides containing pyrethrum and soap or neem should be effective on the nymphs. Also, look for and destroy eggs before they hatch.\n\nGarden tips are provided by the Home and Garden Information Center of the Cooperative Extension Service of the University of Maryland. For more information on these questions, or if you have questions of your own, call the center's hot line at 800-342-2507 or visit its Web site at http: //\n\nChecklist\n\n* When vigorous tomato vines grow over the tops of stakes or cages, they can be trimmed back with lopping shears. This will not diminish your harvest.\n\n* Remove all blackberry and raspberry canes that fruited this summer. Also, prune out and discard all dead and damaged canes. Thin out first-year canes to a 6-inch spacing between each.\n\n* Do not spray pesticides when the weather is hot and dry. Doing so can cause leaf burning."

      "text": "Northern Red Oak\n\nFast-Growing Shade Tree\n\nThe Northern Red Oak is a long-lived tree and one of the fastest-growing Oaks. It would be a perfect shade tree for your yard. There's nothing quite as peaceful as whiling away a few hot summer hours under the cool shade of an Oak tree, and the Northern Red Oak would be a perfect choice for doing just that. Imagine sitting under your Red Oak. Tilt your head back to view the straight and true trunk that grows to a height of 75-140 feet. See how the branches reach toward the sky in a spreading form that creates a pleasing rounded crown. Notice the dark green leaves as they gently rustle in the breeze, their 8 inch, wide-lobed surface filtering the sunlight above you. In the autumn you'll still enjoy sitting under your Red Oak amid the deep reds and yellows of its fall foliage. If you sit very still, you'll even share in the excitement of neighborhood squirrels and other wildlife that come to collect the 1-inch acorns your Red Oak generously produces for them. In the spring 2-4 inch green catkins will appear on your Red Oak as flowers to announce the coming of another growing season to enjoy…and all the charming features of your Red Oak will begin again. The Northern Red Oak is an important source of food for wildlife. A variety of birds depend upon Red Oak acorns, the wild turkey in particular. Several mammals also value the Red Oak acorn, including the Black Bear. You will likewise value the Northern Red Oak for all it has to offer. * Fast-growing * Long-lived * Fall color * Food for wildlife"

      "text": "Archive for March 2011\n\nToday's post is about the Okame cherry, which is one of the first cherry trees to bloom in my area. Its official Latin name is Prunus x incamp, but I always call it by its more easily-remembered common name, the Okame cherry. A cross between Prunus incisa and Prunus campanulata, this tree is one of the few cherry trees I am happy to recommend planting in a residential garden.\n\nA young Okame cherry in a front yard garden in northwest Washington, DC\n\nUnlike many other cherries, the Okame is relatively pest- and disease-resistant, giving the designer confidence that it can be planted without worrying about it being short-lived. Its blossoms - a rich but not screaming rose-pink – appear before the leaves in early spring. (Only the Prunus x subhirtella 'Autumnalis' cherry, a cousin of the famous weeping cherry, blooms earlier.)\nBecause the blooms' calyxes – which bud out before the blossoms appear – are also pink, the tree gives the appearance of being in bloom longer than is actually the case.\n\nA close-up look at the dark red calyxes that precede the opening blossoms on an Okame cherry\n\nThe blossoms of the Okame cherry\n\nLike other cherries, Okames have distinctive horizontally-lenticiled bark.\n\nNote the horizontal banding on the Okame's bark.\n\nIn the right site, Okames are fast growers. Don't plant them too close together. At maturity, they can easily reach a width of 20-30′ (and a height of 15-20′, although I have seen them taller).\n\nIn this garden, designed early on in my career, I made the mistake of planting two Okames less than 10' on center. Lesson learned, although the homeowner loves having them both.\n\nSo do give them lots of sun and room to grow. Fall color? Not so much here, although apparently farther north the leaves will turn attractive hues of red and gold, if you're lucky. Good for Southern gardens, too, I've read, since they have a low chilling requirement. So if you're looking for a tree that will give your garden an early start to spring, take a close look at the Okame. You won't be sorry.\n\nWhile I wait for spring to arrive, I've been spending some time looking at my photos from my trip to English gardens in 2002 (or thereabouts, my mind is like Swiss cheese these days). One of the gardens/historic sites we visited was Churchill's home in Chartwell (in Kent). I remember thinking at the time this destination was announced that it couldn't be a serious garden – unless his wife had been a devoted gardener. While I have only a few images from that day, they do bring back memories of stunning vistas from the terraces behind the house and delightful surprises, both anecdotal and visual.\n\nValerian and red clematis on a stone arch on one of Chartwell's upper terraces.\n\nAccording to what seems to be the official Churchill website, Winston Churchill bought Chartwell in 1924 for its impressive views. Over the next 15 years, he spent considerable amounts of money on both the house and garden. There is a walled garden, generously planted in the cottage style, whose brick walls he apparently helped build himself.\n\nExuberant cottage-style plantings in a section of Chartwell's gardens.\n\nOne of the most famous parts of the garden is the Golden Rose Walk, a gift from Churchill's children to him and his wife Clementine on the occasion of their golden wedding anniversary in 1958.\n\nA view from above of the Golden Rose Walk in June.\n\nAccording to the website, there are over 1000 rose bushes at Chartwell. Lady Churchill loved having cut flowers in the house, and we saw plenty of roses, as well as other flowers, in the arrangements inside the house – as well as out in the gardens.\n\nIn 1945, the expense of maintaining Chartwell was troubling Churchill. A group of wealthy friends arranged to purchase the property and donate it to the National Trust (which maintains it today), with the stipulation that he be allowed to live in it at a nominal rent until his death. In 1966, one year after his death, Chartwell opened to the public and remains open to visitors today. Visit it if you can.\n\nLike this:\n\nYes, I know, spring is just around the corner – but those of us in the mid-Atlantic region of the eastern U.S. aren't quite there yet. Still, there is some excitement to be had in the garden these days, especially if you are fortunate enough to have somewhere in your landscape a witchhazel (Hamamelis x intermedia). These shrubs usually grow about 12-15′ high and have a wide spread at maturity. Their strap-like, twisted petals are a sight for sore eyes in winter.\n\nA witchhazel in flower at Dumbarton Oaks in early March. I'm not sure, but I think its a Jelena.\n\nAs I wrote when I first began this blog, it was the sight of a 'Jelena' witchhazel in bloom at the National Arboretum, many years ago, which helped spark my interest in garden photography. But when it comes to planting them, it's hard to choose a favorite. All of them provide welcome color at the end of winter, when a gardener's soul – and eyes – are eager for spring to arrive. The petals, which appear on bare stems, are lightly fragrant. And there's even a bonus, in the fall, of beautifully colored foliage.\n\nDo you like yellows? I saw two specimens at Dumbarton, close by each other (not far from the Orangerie), that were equally lovely. Thanks to a little sleuthing by my work colleague, Abby Yager, I'm able to identify them for you.\nThe first one is Hamamelis x intermedia 'Arnold Promise,' with a rich golden yellow color. This is a favorite for landscape designers since it's quite vigorous and reliable; it was developed at the Arnold Arboretum. This particular specimen, according to Dumbarton Oaks, was grafted onto H. virginiana rootstock.\n\nAccording to what I've been able to learn, 'Angelly' is a more upright-shaped witchhazel that blooms relatively late in the season. Around here, you see most witchhazels in bloom in late February into early March. There is another species, H. mollis, which blooms in late fall.\n\nNew cultivars are developed regularly. But sometimes if you dig a little into history, you learn something fascinating and sweet about the old tried-and-true cultivars. According to Wikipedia, Jelena and Robert de Belder of Arboretum Kalmthout, selecting for red cultivars, found three: the first, with bronze flowers, was named 'Jelena'; the next, with red flowers, was named 'Diane' (the name of their daughter); the last, with deep red flowers, was called 'Livia' (the name of their granddaughter). Nothing like keeping it in the family. Now I just need to find space for one in my own garden.\n\nAnd now for something different. Last year I put together a photo essay for my camera club's spring program, featuring images taken over the years at Chanticleer Garden. Here's the chance for you to see it too. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did making it and sharing it with other friends. Thank you, YouTube."

      "text": "Eutypella canker is a plant disease caused by the fungal pathogen Eutypella parasitica. This disease is capable of infecting many species of maple trees and produces a large, distinguishable canker on the main trunk of the tree. Infection and spread of the disease is accomplished with the release of ascospores from perithecia. Therefore, the best way to manage the Eutypella canker is to remove trees that have been infected. If infected, it can decrease the quality of wood cut for lumber and can thus have a negative economic impact.\n\nSymptoms are similar to all species of maple and include a canker forming most commonly 2–12 feet (0.61–3.7 m) from the ground.[3][4] The formation of the canker begins with a small pronounced necrosis of the bark and requires several years to expand. The canker enlarges as the tree ages by increasing its width and forming ringed callus around it.[4] It is then capable of surrounding over half the trunk with a typical diameter of 0.3–2.5 m (10 in–8 ft 2 in). Although the canker can become quite large, it normally does not kill the tree but does increase the risk of the trunk failing and being blown over by the wind. As for visible signs of the fungus, if the bark is peeled back at the center of the canker, a mat of white mycelium (fungal tissue) will be revealed.[5][6]\n\nDisease cycle\n\nEutypella parasitica is characterized as an ascomycete fungus that produces fruiting bodies called perithecia.[7] When conditions are favorable (moderate temperature and high humidity), the perithecium will produce sexual spores called ascospores which are dispersed primarily by the wind. If they land on the susceptible host they may enter through a wound and establish themselves in the xylem tissue of the host. Each year, the fungus kills the callus material formed by the tree and invades more cambium during the growing season.[4] During the summer months, the fungus is also able to produce asexual spores called conidia that are dispersed by the wind to be used as secondary inoculum to infect other maple trees in the area. Upon dispersal, they potentially land on a susceptible host which induces the spore to germinate and produce mycelia. At the end of the season, the fungus produces perithecia.[8] Then, the fungus can overwinter as perithecia or as mycelia in the host. Due to the slow development of the disease, these fruiting bodies are not produced until 5–8 years after initial infection.[9][4] Once they are produced they can be visible with very close observation in the center of the canker, which can give it a speckled, gritty appearance.\n\nEnvironment\n\nThe main factors that contribute to the release of the ascospores are moisture and temperature. For the most part, as long as temperatures are above freezing spores can be released, but they are most likely to be released at moderate temperatures of 4–36 °C (39–97 °F).[10] In the case of moisture, humidity alone is not enough to make the perithecia release the spores, as the perithecia themselves need to be wet. The temperate climates of North America and Europe are most conducive for Eutypella canker development.[10]\n\nManagement\n\nThe best way to lower infection is to control the probability of infection in the trees. Trees that are infected need to be cut down and removed optimally on a dry day, as do seedlings and saplings that are also found to be infected.[5] This is done to eliminate the source of the inoculum that can infect other trees. If a tree has cankered branches, the infected branches need to be cut off close to the trunk without damaging the trunk. Cutting the branches flush to the trunk gets rid of the infected branches and also reduces the risk of infection since the tree can heal from this wound more easily.[4] To ensure that the disease is eliminated and not going to spread elsewhere the removed branches and trees should be burned.\n\nImportance\n\nMaple trees with Eutypella canker have a reduction in quality due to the deformity of the trunk. Therefore, if used for lumber products the cankered area will be wasted wood. This disease can then cause reduced economical value of lumber in areas of high infection. Also, aesthetics of the tree is diminished due to the symptoms of the pathogen. Although it can decrease the quality of the tree, the incidence is usually quite low. Infection rates are typically 2%–10% in a particular stand, but it has been recorded to infect over 20%.[3]"

      "text": "When harsh winter winds beat against evergreens, or there is an unseasonably warm, sunny day, moisture evaporates out of the leaves. Because the ground is frozen, water cannot come up from the roots to replace what is lost. This dehydration is a major cause of winter burn, which causes die-back in evergreens, especially the broad-leaved ones. That is why I have become a fan of antidessicants.\n\nAn antidessicant (anti-transpirant) is a spray that coats the leaves and prevents or diminishes the loss of moisture. On the other hand, it limits the uptake of carbon dioxide. So this is not something to use indiscriminately. But for plants that are vulnerable to winter burn or are at the edge of their hardiness zone, I have found them to be beneficial.\n\nI apply them in late fall, usually in December, before the extreme cold and dry winds of mid-winter. Wilt-Pruf ( is a brand you can find at nurseries and garden centers to apply yourself. I currently pay my arborists to spray a large group of shrubs each year. The Care of Trees ( is a regional company that offers organic and eco-friendly plant care. I find that their employees do care about trees and plants and work carefully and respectfully when pruning, spraying, etc.\n\nWhile my many Rhododendrons are technically hardy in this Zone 6 location, they have suffered severe winter burn some years. The west wind that crosses my property can be very destructive in winter and dries out the broad-leaved evergreens. Though they naturally defend themselves by curling their leaves in extreme cold, this is not always enough. Since I began spraying them with the antidessicant, they have come through the winter in much better shape. This is important because the stress of winter burn is an invitation to other ailments.\n\nI have also taken to spraying many of my Hydrangeas—Nikko Blue and Blue Wave (H. macrophylla), Oakleaf (H. quercifolia), and Serrata (H. Serrata). These deciduous shrubs are also rated hardy for my location, but several flowerless (and miserable!) years taught me that the cold, wind and frequent freeze/thaw cycles of our winters can destroy the flower buds which are formed the previous season. I tried several years of surrounding the hydrangeas with burlap enclosures. This worked to ensure good blooming, but what a nuisance and eyesore it was! The antidessicant spray is far easier, invisible, and, so far, equally effective. Preferably, the Hydrangeas should be sprayed after they lose their leaves for better coverage.\n\nAt right is the delicate bud on a Hydrangea macrophylla 'Blue Wave.' that has to survive the winter.\n\nI do not need to spray my Limelight Hydrangea (H. paniculata 'Zwijnenburg'Limelight) because it blooms on new growth from the current year. So it is worth checking whether your hydrangea blooms on new or old growth to see if it is susceptible to winter damage.\n\nFinally, since I have just planted a precious Magnolia grandiflora this season (see earlier post), and it is marginally hardy here, I will have that sprayed, too, for insurance."

      "text": "What's Growing On Out There?\n\nSeeing someone else's tree blooming just naturally creates demand. Advertising definitely works for trees as well as for any other commodity. At this time of year, nurseries see a spike in sales of just about everything that is blooming that particular week.\n\nLet's talk about those trees in bloom. The first tree to bloom seasonally in the woods of Oklahoma once was the Redbud, our state tree. I'd guess that few know the identity of the tree with white flowers that bloom at the same time as our native Redbud. Dogwood? A Dogwood has a large showy blossom and actually blooms a few weeks after the Redbud, closer to Easter.\n\nThe white flowers that show up around the same time as those of the Redbud actually belong to the Mexican Plum. Its flowers are much smaller than those of the Dogwood, but they bloom in big clumps along the branch.\n\nLandscapers like to mimic this natural show by planting Redbuds with Whitebuds, a genetic variation of the Redbud. I've never had much luck with Whitebuds, so I'm going to plant more Mexican Plum.\n\nSo why isn't the Redbud still the first bloomer of spring? Oklahoma forests are facing an invasion of mutants. The first blooms in the woods these days are the offspring of flowering pears. All those flashy fruitless pears that we loved to plant over the last few decades have found a way to produce fertile fruits. (Oh, the endless resourcefulness of nature.)\n\nWatch your local pear over the next months, and see if it grows some small, hard, stunted fruits. Don't think you're going to make tasty jelly out of them. Yet, some sort of winged wildlife finds them attractive. The pears have fled the captivity of our urban parking lots and road medians, and now are populating the woods and wild lands of Oklahoma. They boom early, and often they bloom twice in years of severe drought. You can identify them in the woods by the characteristic 'teardrop' shape, as opposed to the 'vase' shape of the native Mexican Plum. Watch for them in a woodlot near you.\n\nKeep your eyes on the woods over the next several weeks to follow the cascade of blooms. A tree flower is often a subtle thing, but nonetheless beautiful. Maples have already flowered, and are beginning to build the little helicopter seeds. Oaks are flowering now, with long catkins and tiny leaflets. Elms are building seed before they put on leaves. Sweetgum, Pine, Cottonwood, Ash, Willow, and Hickory all will put on a show. Locusts are blooming this week. Post Oaks and Blackjacks may hold on to last year's leaves until the new leaf breaks the bud and kicks the old leaf off the stem. Pecan is usually the last tree to flower and leaf out sometime in May.\n\nWe all know the best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The next best time is in the fall of any year. The third best time is when your shovel is sharp and you have the time and inclination to keep it watered. Planting a tree right now is not too late, although the longer you wait, the more stressful it is for the tree.\n\nSmaller trees grown in containers experience less transplant stress than their bigger, 'balled-in-burlap' brothers. Beware of roots growing in a circle around the root mass when you pull the tree out of its container. Those roots will put on a growth ring every year, as will the trunk. After several years the stem meets the 'girdling' root, and the tree has a 'mortality experience'.\n\nThen, you'll wonder why the tree 'suddenly' died, but its fate was sealed the day you planted it without spreading or cutting those circling roots.\n\nThree more rules of thumb:\n\nPlant the tree too high in the hole, then you'll never plant too deep.\n\nDig the hole five times wider than you think you need to… you'll wear yourself out when you get about four times wider, and that will be about right.\n\nThe answer to almost any problem your tree is experiencing is: ADD MORE MULCH. Not too deep, like a mulch volcano, but WIDER is better.\n\nThat's what's growing on out there. Stop and enjoy the flowers, plant a tree for posterity, and beware of the invading mutant pears!"

The name means \"fungus root.\" It colonizes the roots of plants and extends itself into the soil so the plant can absorb additional nutrients such as phosphorous and nitrogen. In return, the plant releases sugars to the fungi that are produced by photosynthesis.\n\nThrough this process plants are more able to survive extremes in temperature, poor soil, soil compaction, neglect, and various other problems.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe US Forest Service has been using Mycorrhizal fungi applications for their forest re-seedling and transplanting projects for many years, decreasing these transplant losses dramatically. With transplanting losses in the 95 percent range, transplanted trees greatly benefit from these applications of fungi, helping the trees to establish new root growth and absorb nutrients.\n\nMature trees benefit from applications of the fungi if they are living in poor or compacted soil and do not have adequate resident populations of Mycorrhizal.\n\nArborwell's Tree Wellness Program Approach\n\nMycorrhizal fungi is applied by injections into the roots or mixed into a vertical mulch. Inoculating plants is very cost-effective, especially when one considers the cost of transplanting and/or losing specimen trees.

The small larvae can only chew the edge from the needle, but as they grow, they consume more and more of the needle until eventually they are eating the entire needle down to the stub.\n\nEuropeanpine sawfly larvae are grayish-green with 2 light stripes and 1 dark stripe on each side of the body.\n\nPine sawfly larvae feed only on old needles that emerged in previous seasons and not on the new needles that are emerging now.\n\nPines need a deep root system, and five-needle pines especially need a deep pot to avoid uprooting by wind, due to their dense foliage.\n\nFor this reason, pines and other conifers should never be bare-rooted, unless steps are taken to re-introduce the fungus to the repotted plant, such as making a slurry (thin mud) of the old soil and pouring it over the newly potted soil.\n\nThe larvae of White Pine weevils feed on the sapwood of the leaders and this is devastating to the tree.\n\nPine needles are sometimes eaten by some Lepidoptera species including Pine_Processionary, Bordered_White (also known as Pine Looper), Pine_Beauty and Scalloped_Hazel, and also the Symphytan species Pine_Sawfly.\n\nThe modern English name ''pine'' derives from Latin ''Pinus'' by way of French ''pin''; similar names are used in other Romance_languages.\n\nSome pines are used for Christmas_trees, and pine cones are also widely used for christmas decorations.\n\nOn white pine, the symptoms include dead branches, chlorotic foliage, branch girdling by lesions that exude resin or sticky yellowish fluid (spermagonia), cankers that are diamond-shaped to elliptic with a dead center surrounded by a band of yellowish-green infected bark, light yellow-orange aecia, and death of the tree.\n\nThe killing of cambium by this fungus often magnifies the injury from the fl turpentine beetle.\n\nUp until recently these two factors have been looked upon as the primary cause for the death of Japanese flpine which were at least 15 to 20 years of age and situated in the often stressful sites of the seashore landscapes.\n\nOn the majority of pines which had been cut down or were showing symptoms of decline, pitch tubes from the fl turpentine beetles were found at the trunk base.\n\nA sharp boundary between fl and white, or a relatively small and stable hybrid zone, on the other hand, shows that the two populations do not interbreed to any great extent and are indeed separate forms.\n\nIf the two groups do not interbreed because of something intrinsic to their genetic make-up (perhaps fl frogs do not find white frogs sexually attractive, or they breed at different times of year) then they are different species.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the two groups would interbreed freely provided only that some external barrier was removed (perhaps there is a waterfall too high for frogs to scale, or the populations are far distant from one another) then they are subspecies.\n\nNow is the time to begin watching pinetrees for feeding damage by clusters of Europeanpine sawfly larvae.\n\nThese gray-green larvae with the shiny fl beady heads are common on mugo, Scots and red pine, and may be found on other pine species as well (white and Austrian pines are usually only attacked if interplanted with the more susceptible species).\n\nThe phenological indicator plants and their stage of development that coincide with the onset of Europeanpine sawfly egg hatch and presence of small larvae are:\n\nWhite pine blister rust is the most serious disease of white pine in Maine.\n\nThe fungal spore which carries the disease organism from Ribes to pine is fragile, rarely surviving airborne transport for distances exceeding 900 feet, even less where vegetation interferes with spore movement.\n\nMaine law prohibits the planting and cultivation of currants and gooseberries in most of southern Maine, and prohibits the planting and cultivation of Europeanfl currants and their hybrids anywhere within the state."

      "text": "Current weather\n\nIt's all in the size of the root ball when time for transplanting trees\n\nPosted: Sunday, December 07, 2008\n\nBy Charles Phillips Columnist\n\nThe cold weather that has hit our area the past few weeks has been a blessing. You might not think so, especially if you like hot weather, but your plants are benefiting from this cold.\n\n//\n\nThe cold weather is making our plants go dormant. During this period a lot of the plants rest, such as hostas, hydrangeas and many other perennials. Evergreen trees and shrubs still have green leaves, but they are not growing.\n\nThe root system continues to grow over the winter. This is why it is best to plant trees and shrubs during the late fall and winter months. One of the more common questions that I get is when can I move this plant. The term for this is transplanting. The best time to transplant is the same time that we plant new plants -- in late fall or winter. So, this cold weather is the perfect time to start transplanting trees and shrubs.\n\nMoving established shrubs from one location to another can change your landscape and save money at the same time. The job might be intimidating, but good preparation will make the project somewhat easier and less time-consuming.\n\nPaying careful attention to the recommended practices of root pruning, methods of digging, and root protection will improve the chances of success in getting a plant off to a good start after moving it.\n\nBecause the roots are the most important part of the plant, get as much of the root system as possible when transplanting. A method for doing this is called root pruning. This helps to stimulate root growth, so when you are ready to move the plant you have as many roots as possible in a small area.\n\nIt is almost like growing the plant in a container. The distance that you prune the roots will depend on the plant type. Evergreen plants require more of a root system than deciduous plants. An evergreen shrub that is 4 feet tall will need to be root pruned 2 feet from the trunk, creating a root ball that is 4 feet across. Dig down 10 inches to sever the roots.\n\nIf the plant has low-hanging limbs or branches, tie these limbs up so you can work under the plant. Tying up the limbs will decrease damage. After pruning the roots, make sure the plants have a good mulch layer around them to help protect the roots and conserve moisture. Also, water the plant well to remove air pockets that formed during digging around the root system.\n\nThe time of the year that you root prune is very important. Not all plants transplant best in the fall or winter. Deciduous plants can be moved in the spring. If you are moving deciduous plants, you need to root prune now. This will give the roots time to grow before you move the plant. Evergreen plants need to be root pruned in April or May and then transplanted in the fall.\n\nPlants can be transplanted without root pruning, but your chance of success increases when the roots are pruned.\n\nThe next important step in transplanting is the digging process. Again, tie the limbs up to keep from damaging them. If you root pruned the plant, dig at the point where you did the root pruning. If you didn't root prune, dig at a distance from the plant where you can get the most roots. This is based on the height and type of plant. For a 2-foot-tall evergreen plant, start digging at least 12 inches from the trunk. Plants chance of survival increases with the size of the root ball.\n\nOnce the plant is out of the ground, wrap the roots in burlap, plastic or any material that will aid in keeping the root ball intact. The wrap also helps keep the soil from drying out, which will kill the root system.\n\nWhen digging the new hole for the plant, make sure to dig two to three times larger than the root ball of the plant being moved. Make sure that the hole is not deeper than the root ball of the plant. It is better to have the plant too shallow than too deep. Then, remove the wrap and plant the plant. Mulch the plant and water well.\n\nIf transplanting in the winter, don't prune the plant back. The root system should put on new growth to support the top of the plant. When the weather turns warm, prune out any part of the plant that is dead or dying. If you transplant when the weather is warm, prune the plant if it shows wilt.\n\nThere are many reasons to transplant our plants, such as plants that have been passed down through the family, unusual plants and plants that were planted in the wrong place. Transplanting can be successful if it is done right.\n\nColumbia County Extension Agent Charles Phillips can be reached at (706) 868-3413 or by e-mail at charlesp@uga.edu.

If you do not have a boulevard tree at present and wish to have one call the Recreation and Community Services Department at 905.688-5601 ext. 3222.\n\nPlease note that requests for Oak varieties are only available for spring planting. The fall planting deadline is August 30, and for spring planting the deadline is April 1. All new tree planting requests received after August 30 will be scheduled for the following spring.\n\nForestry Services\n\nThe City of St. Catharines through Forestry Services provides for the City, a greener urban forest by maintaining, pruning and performing surgery on viable trees while removing others. Maintenance and pruning promotes existing tree health as well as public safety. All work is performed by specialized tree personnel (Arborists) who follow the International Society of Arboriculture (I.S.A.) Standards.\n\nWhat is an Arborist? An arborist is a trained professional, who is knowledgeable about tree physiology, biology and is trained and equipped to provide proper care to trees and the urban forest. An Arborist practices arboriculture, which is the cultivation, art and science, and management of individual trees.\n\nWhat is the Urban Forest? An urban forest is a collection of trees and shrubs that are growing within a city. It may contain any kind of woody plant vegetation growing in or around human settlements. An intricate role in sustaining an urban forest is constant management of the vegetation/trees. Some of the major benefits of an urban forest are:\n\nEconomic benefits\n\nAir pollution reduction\n\nRecreational benefits\n\nSocial benefits\n\nWildlife benefits\n\nCommunal benefits\n\nPublic Awareness Homeowners are not permitted to trim trees on city property in front of or behind their homes. There may be an occasion when a tree becomes an issue or concern to the public. This could be in the form of a low-lying limb or branch over a sidewalk or rooftop. Please call 905-935-3813 to report this.\n\nEmerald Ash Borer (EAB) The City of St. Catharines Forestry Services have discovered the presence of EAB within pockets of the city. EAB is an pest introduced from Asia that affects all species of Ash (Fraxinus) trees in North America. EAB has killed millions of Ash trees across southern Ontario and North Amercia. All Ash trees in the City of St. Catharines are at risk of dying from infestation. Mortality may occur in as short a period as one year; however death normally occurs within 2-3 years of a tree becoming infested.\n\nInfestation occurs when the beetle lays its eggs on the bark and in bark crevices on the trunk and branches. The larvae then tunnel beneath the bark and feed on the layer of live cells between the bark and the sapwood (the Cambium), cutting off the transport of nutrients and water to the tree.\n\nAlthough a tree may have some signs of EAB infestation, other diseases/infestations may be affecting the trees growth. It is recommended that if you have a private Ash tree showing signs of EAB to contact a private certified arborist to inspect your tree in order to confirm the presence of EAB and to recommed treatment options. If you see an Ash tree on City property showing signs of EAB contact Forestry Services at 905-935-3813.\n\nAs a result of this infestation, Forestry Services have begun an EAB management program which includes treatment of viable Ash trees, and removal and replacement of non-viable trees where appropriate. The city encourages citizens to treat their Ash trees and limit the movement of firewood wherever possible to help contain the spread of EAB.

We know that these roots help to stabilize large trees, keeping\nthem anchored during high winds, and we know that it is important to get deep\nrooting established in landscape trees when transplanted into urban residential\nenvironments. Early research at the University of Arizona traced deep roots of native\nmesquite to depths below 200 feet. More recent research suggests that these\ndeep roots are important for other reasons.\n\nSinker roots of mesquite not irrigated but close to a river\n\nGlobal\nresearch which surveyed maximum rooting depth of plants (trees, shrubs,\nperennial grasses) in natural settings (290 observations, 253 species) found a\nrange in average maximum rooting depths from one foot (plants growing in\nnorthern tundra regions) to over 200 feet in deserts like the Kalahari; 194\nspecies had roots at least six feet deep, 50 species had roots fifteen feet or\nmore and 22 species had roots more than 30 feet deep.\n\nWhen the researchers grouped these\nplants by similar natural habitats, they found the average maximum rooting\ndepth to be 6 feet for cropland, 30 feet for deserts, 12 feet for conifer\nforests, and nine feet for deciduous forests. When plants were again regrouped\ninto three groups based upon growth habit, then trees had an average maximum\ndepth of 20 feet, shrubs 15 feet and herbaceous plants (nonwoody) 7.5 feet. This\nresearch showed that deep rooting is quite common in woody and herbaceous\nspecies in natural habitats, far deeper than the traditional view held up until\nnow.\n\nDeep\nrooting is suspected, and research supports it, to be more important than just structurally\nanchoring plants in the landscape. Research supports that they could be very important\nfor moving and releasing nutrients and water, both up and down, and redistributing\nwater and nutrients among different soil profiles. Water movement up roots into\ndrier surface soils may affect water use estimates trees and other plants\ngrowing in their vicinity.\n\nMany woody\nplants utilize deep roots for water uptake, particularly when surface soils are\ndry, but how they do this is not well understood. It was thought to be a\ncombination of water \"pulled\" up through the tree by evapotranspiration and\ncapillary action (like a soda straw) and little understood process called \"root\npressure\" (like a submersible pump). Measuring water moved from deep in the\nsoil by roots has always been difficult without disturbing the roots and accessing\nthese roots.\n\nRoots of irrigated fruit tree pulled from orchard\n\nHowever a\nplant process for moving water deep in the soil profile to upper soil profiles\nthrough plant roots has been identified more recently. Research found that during\nperiods without rain, upward flow through deep roots was continuous during both day and night using a plant process\nresearchers call hydraulic lift. Researchers\nidentified that this process contributed up to 20% of daily water movement from\nthat depth with no evidence of\nnighttime transpiration and no water storage inside the plant.\n\nResearch done in Texas on tree\nroots of two native trees found that roots growing at 20 to 60 feet below the\nsoil surface contributed 20 – 50% of daily transpiration, depending on the\nwater content of surface soils. As surface soils dried, more water was taken\nfrom deeper sources. All of this water from deeps soils was attributed to the\nplant's hydraulic lift. Large quantities of this water are lifted at night. When\nhydraulic lift occurs at night then it is termed nocturnal hydraulic lift.\n\nThe\nquestion then becomes, if available water is moved from deep sources through\ndeep roots during nighttime, when the plant is not transpiring for\ntranspiration the next day, then where is this water stored? Other research\nindicates that water lifted from the deep soil profile is redistributed to dry,\nshallower soils where it is stored and used in the future. Deep root water\ntransport varies with changes in the environment. When shallow soils become\nwetted again due to rain and/or the plant's need for water decreases, hydraulic\nlift stops or is reduced dramatically.\n\nHydraulic lift is the passive\nmovement of water from roots where water is more available to roots or root\ncompartments where the soil is drier. It does not require plant energy. While\nthe majority of documented cases for hydraulic lift are in native plants in\ndesert or arid climates, recent studies (such as those in the Northeast with\nSugar Maple) indicate that hydraulic lift is not restricted to desert or arid\nspecies or regions.\n\nRelease of water into the upper\nsoil layers has been shown to benefit plants neighboring roots responsible for\nhydraulic lift. Because soils tend to dry from upper soil profiles downward and\nnutrients are usually more plentiful in the upper soil layers, lifted water may\nprovide moisture to dry surface soils and enhance mineral uptake, beneficial\nmicroorganism growth such as mycorrhizae, and uptake of nutrients by feeder\nroots which typically occupy shallow soils. Some researchers feel that this is\na form of plant parasitism and may have been the primary selective force in the\nevolution of this process. Hydraulic lift may also prolong or enhance root hair\nactivity by keeping them hydrated.\n\nThe direction of water movement in\ndeep roots may be upward, downward or horizontal depending on where soil\nmoisture is more limiting. The transfer of water\ndownwards by root systems, from lets say roots growing in wet shallow soils to\ndry deep soils, has been termed downward\nsiphoning or inverse hydraulic lift;\nthe reverse of hydraulic lift.\n\nSuch downward movement through the\nroot system may allow growth of roots in otherwise dry soil at greater depths,\npermitting more rapid establishment of some plants.The\namounts of water stored deep in the soil are not likely to be significant contributions\nif plant drought is severe. However, downward transfer of water may be\nimportant to plant establishment and the reduction of waterlogging in certain\nsoil types. Inverse hydraulic lift may facilitate root growth into deep soil\nlayers and transfer water away from neighboring, shallower-rooted competitors.\n\nIn addition to hydraulic lift,\nwhere water is redistributed from moist depths to dry topsoil, or inverse\nhydraulic lift which transfers water downward, the process of \"hydraulic redistribution\"\nincludes the transfer of water horizontally, from areas that are moist to areas\nwhich are drier. In some locations and at some times of the year the subsurface\ntransfer of water through roots may actually represent more water than the\namount needed for transpiration.\n\nHow much\nwater can this represent? Researchers aren't really sure but field measurements\nof hydraulic lift in sugar maple in the Eastern U.S. have put these estimates\nas high as 25 gallons per night but other studies indicate much higher values. It\nis suspected that there is a great deal of competition for this water by\nneighboring plants.\n\n3 comments:\n\nI hate to be critical, but (especially a professor) several studies and claims are referred to or made that should be referenced. It is pretty easy to simply hyperlink the reference to the article. I know I would appreciate a place to start other than guessing key words for Google.\n\nSorry. I do that for peer-reviewed articles for publication but this is a blog. I published this previously in Southwest Trees and Turf, a regional trade journal for the Green Industry without references.\n\nThis is a topic I've heard more about, especially in the misguided use of riparian trees as general shade but with xeric ornamentals in desert cities, notably Albuquerque. As ashes and cottonwoods age, they seem to go from opportunistic and xeric, to impossibly thirsty...this seems to relate to your post in the opposite manner of xeric trees.\n\nThe various purposes you bring up really give me much for me to think about."

      "text": "Many new trees have been planted on the streets of Hoboken, some by homeowners and some by the city. Tree-lined streets make a city more attractive and serve to improve the environment. Not only do they provide shade and natural beauty, but they help reduce carbon monoxide levels and improve air quality in general.\n\nHowever, once new trees are planted, there is a certain level of care required in order to maintain a healthy tree. Firstly, the soil that city trees live in, is often deficient in nutrients and gets packed tight and the tree cannot get adequate oxygen and water to its roots. Dog urine is acidic and sometimes a protective metal or wood border is needed. Many of the trees around homes in Hoboken, and many of the trees planted around public buildings like our schools, seem to be in bad health and I have observed that there does not seem to be a maintenance system in place. A private contractor is used to trim trees on our streets and a landscaping contractor is used to maintain Church Square Park, but the trees on Washington Street or the ones around public buildings like the Demarest School never seem to be weeded, watered, and the soil is not turned or fertilizer added.\n\nDoes the city have a program in place to maintain city trees? A tip to homeowners with trees – turn the soil at least once a season and add organic fertilizer twice a year. During heat spells, water regularly, preferably in the evening to prevent burning from the sun."

      "text": "Caneberries\n\nLeaf Spot\n\nPathogen: Mycosphaerella rubi\n\nLeaf spot can cause symptoms on leaves and canes of blackberries.\nLeaf lesions are somewhat circular in shape, often having a brown or purple\nmargin, and typically have a whitish center. Leaf spots are about 0.12 to 0.16\ninch (3–4 mm) in diameter. Lesions on canes and petioles are similar to\nthose on leaves but more elongate. Small, black pycnidia (fungus fruiting bodies of the Septoria stage) can be seen in the whitened area of the\nmature lesions. Symptoms appear late in the season although infection can occur\nmultiple times throughout the season.\n\nLeaf spot is found on erect and trailing blackberry,\ndewberry, olallieberry, and boysenberry. Conidia are disseminated by wind and\nwater splash throughout the growing season, and infection increases with\nincreased rainfall. For many years this pathogen was thought to be the same as\nthe one that causes raspberry leaf spot on raspberry. It is now clear that the\ncausal agent for leaf spot, Mycosphaerella rubi (anamorph Septoria rubi), does not infect raspberry. Raspberry\nleaf spot is caused by the pathogen Sphaerulina rubi (anamorph Cylindrosporium rubi) and is\nnot common in California.The methods\nof control for the two diseases are very similar, however.\n\nThe key to managing leaf spot during the growing season is to\nincrease air circulation within the planting and the row. This includes such\npractices as proper spacing, thinning to maintain proper cane density, and\nmaintaining narrow rows. These practices lower canopy humidity and allow faster\ndrying of foliage and canes, resulting in less infection. The most important\nmanagement tool is dormant lime sulfur applications that serve to burn out old\nlesions and thus reduce sporulation.\n\nThe use of macrotunnels is very limiting to leaf spot infestations\nbecause of the near total lack of free moisture on the leaves and flowers of\nthe plants.\n\nThe pathogen overwinters\nas mycelium and pycnidia in dead leaves and stems. To\nreduce sources of inoculum, it is important to prune out and remove from the\nsite old fruiting canes, and to remove dead and damaged canes and leaf debris\nafter harvest. Clean nursery stock limits introduction of the disease into the\nfield.\n\nOrganically Acceptable Methods\nPractices that increase\nair circulation within the planting, pruning out infected canes, and treatments\nwith a copper sulfate either alone or in combination with lime sulfur are\nacceptable for use in an organically certified crop. Dormant applications of\nliquid lime sulfur eradicate a high percentage of overwintering pycnidia and should be done after putting canes on the\nwires. The use of macrotunnels is also acceptable.\n\nTreatment Decisions\nNo fungicides are currently registered for use specifically against\nleaf spot; however, fungicides used to control anthracnose and Botrytis gray\nmold help control leaf spot.

      "text": "How to Prune a Tree - A Graphic Tutorial\n\n2 of 9\n\nCrown thinning is a pruning technique primarily used on hardwood trees. Crown thinning is the selective removal of stems and branches to increase light penetration and air movement throughout the crown of a tree. The intent is to improve a tree's structure and form while making life uncomfortable for tree pests.\n\nStems with narrow, V-shaped angles of attachment (graphic b) often form included bark and should be selected for removal first. Leave branches with strong U-shaped angles of attachment (graphic a). The included bark forms a bark wedge when two stems grow at sharp angles to one another. These ingrown wedges prevent strong attachment of stems often causing a crack at the point below where the branches meet. Removing one or more of the stems will allow the other stem(s) to take over.\n\nBranches growing off these stems should be no more than one half to three-quarters of the diameter of the stem at the point of attachment. Avoid producing \"lion's tails\" or tufts of branches and foliage at the ends of branches by removing all inner lateral branches and foliage. Lion's tails can result in sunscalding, epicormic sprouting and weak branch structure and breakage. Branches that rub or cross another branch should be removed.\n\nTo avoid unnecessary stress and prevent excessive production of epicormic sprouts, no more than one-quarter of the living crown should be removed at a time. If it is necessary to remove more, it should be done over successive years."

Any opinions would be appreciated.\n\nANSWER:\n\nPurple ash does not appear in our Native Plant Database. This article from eHow Autumn Purple Ash Tree Facts will give you several facts about this culivar of Fraxinus americana (White ash). A cultivar usually means the \"parent tree\" has been selected for traits that suit the purpose of the company producing it. The Purple Ash has male trees only, which means it is seedless, which is a good thing in this case, because ash seedlings can be a real pain. Otherwise, I think we can judge the cultivar by the traits of the White Ash.\n\nThese traits include the fact that the tree is very fast-growing, which we understand you would like to have. A fast-growing plant is usually also a short-lived plant. The genus Fraxinus (ash) tends to be very susceptible to pests and diseases. From Ohio State University here is an article on Common Problems of Ash Trees. Probably the worst of these is the Emerald Ash Borer; the map this link is for shows that the Emerald Ash Borer is not yet in Texas, but we understand seed conservancies are already gathering ash seeds for seed banks in Texas to re-populate the tree if the ash borer decimates our ash trees.\n\nNow we have discussed ash trees in general, here is our suggestion regarding the cultivar of Fraxinus americana (White ash) growing in Lubbock. According to this USDA Plant Profile map the tree occurs naturally only in a few counties in East Texas. If you follow that plant link to our webpage on the tree, you will learn that it needs sunshine, acidic soil, and does better in moist conditions. Having gone to school in Lubbock from 1952 to 1955, we are pretty sure you do not have moist conditions. From knowledge of the soils in Texas we can tell you that you probably don't have acidic, but alkaline soils.\n\nWe realize that this has been a pretty negative response, and we're sorry. Our job is to discourage gardeners from buying plants and using a great many resources like water, fertilizer, money and back muscles when there is a good chance the plant will not thrive or perhaps even survive. A plant that is native to a specific area has already made adjustments to the climate and developed defenses against insects and disease over centuries of experience.\n\nJust to give you something to think about, here are 4 trees that are native to the Texas Panhandle area, either in or near Lubbock County. Follow each plant link to see the projected height of each tree, what kind of conditions they favor, etc.\n\nThere is, of course, no reason why you cannot plant the Purple Ash; it won't be invasive or messy with seeds, it would probably live as long as you wanted it and with appropriate watering and the addition of compost to the hole for it should do all right. Just remember, we recommend planting trees only in the Winter, December to February, when the trees are dormant and less susceptible to transplant shock.\n\nFrom the Image Gallery\n\nMore Trees Questions\n\nGrowth rate of trees August 20, 2007 -"

The addition of a tree can completely transform your landscape. They have the ability to help you create your own sanctuary right in your front yard. Their flowers and leaves add aesthetically pleasing elements and can even increase the value of your home. There are hundreds are trees and plants to chose from to incorporate into your desert habitat. They immediately make any area more attractive, livable and are key in the creation of friendly and pleasing neighborhoods and community spaces.\n\nPhotos of Trees\n\nTrees & Benefits\n\nTrees provide valuable services like shade, fruit, medicine, flowers and even absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen! According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, one acre of forest absorbs six tons of carbon dioxide and puts out four tons of oxygen. Trees and plants also filter air quality by removing dust particles and absorbing pollutants. Trees are key controllers of the climate and mitigate effects of the sun, wind and precipitation. Leaves absorb the radiant energy from the sun and keep the earth cooler in summer and reduce your air conditioning bills. Trees also preserve warmth by providing a screen from harsh wind in the winter. They are part of the essential nutrient cycles in the soil and are home to countless animals.\n\nOverall, trees provide us with an intangible personal and social value. Great trees are often the focal points for socializing outdoors and creating wonderful memories. Without them, life as we know it would not exist. Let the experts are Envirogreen Landscaping help you chose the best trees to incorporate into your yard and family, and transform your landscape today!\n\nTree Types\n\nEnvirogreen provides various types of trees such as, Citrus Trees, Cypress Trees, Fruit Trees, Mesquite Trees, Oleander Trees and Palm Trees. Palm trees and tropical plants will give a dramatic effect to any landscape. Palms can be used as a focal point for your yard and provide shade and screening from the hot sun. Tropicals can bring an exotic and pleasing accent to your landscape design! Other great types of trees to use in your yard are Palo Brea Trees, Palo Verde Trees and Pine Trees. Check out our tree list and get visuals on how the trees we provide will accentuate your yard.\n\nTypical Tree Questions\n\nOften trees shed and the constant pool maintenance can be annoying.

      "text": "Search tree & plant advice\n\nSalt-Tolerant Trees and Shrubs\n\nAcross the Midwest, the use of deicing salts (primarily sodium chloride) in winter to maintain safe roadways, sidewalks, and driveways is a common practice. Despite the benefits, deicing salt deposited on trees and shrubs can cause extensive damage. Deicing salt is dispersed from roads by plowing, meltwater runoff, splash, and aerial spray. Plants sensitive to salts may show injury early and can decline quickly after exposure. When air-borne deicing salt is deposited directly onto twigs, buds, or needles, salt draws moisture out of plant tissue, causing desiccation and burn. On evergreens, such as pines and firs, salt spray causes dieback starting at the tips of needles. On deciduous plants, the symptoms of salt damage become more evident during summer or during hot dry weather, when leaf margins show burn or scorch. Salt spray and excess soil salts can also cause branch dieback, stunted growth of stems and foliage, overall lack of vigor, and death. Turf grass along sidewalks and streets can be completely killed due to excess soil salt.\n\nSymptoms Effects of Salt Injury\n\nAir-borne Salt\n\nPlant damage caused by deposition of aerial salts is more widespread than that done by soil salts in the Midwest\n\nDamage is most severe within 60 feet of the road and decreases with distance, but sensitive plants can show burn at distances of 1,000 feet or more from roadways\n\nOn deciduous plants, salt spray can kill buds and twigs; new growth in spring appears as a cluster of twigs known as \"witches' broom\n\nOn evergreens, salt spray causes browning or yellowing of needles and twig dieback, often on the roadside portion of the plant only; sensitive evergreens planted within 300 feet of roadways can sustain severe damage\n\nBranches protected by snow or other barriers are less likely to be injured\n\nSoil Salt\n\nPlant injury due to soil salt can occur when salt-laden meltwater runs off or splashes onto the soil, and when salt is plowed and shoveled directly on the root zone of nearby plants\n\nExcessive soil salt accumulates in drainageways, depressions, or areas immediately adjacent to roadways where salt-laden runoff is channeled or splashed\n\nConcentrated quantities of sodium and chloride can damage plants by direct absorption into the roots, causing toxic effects or root dehydration\n\nInjury caused by excessive uptake of soil salt includes browning along leaf edges, stunted growth, or fewer and smaller leaves, flowers, and fruit\n\nPlants grown in poorly drained soils and those that are marginally hardy are more severely injured\n\nMinimize the Injury of Salt Damage\n\nAvoid or minimize the use of salt around landscape plants\n\nReduce the amount of salt used by mixing sand, sawdust, or cinders with salt before applying\n\nWait to apply a deicer until after shoveling and plowing, and avoid shoveling salt-laden snow over the root zones of salt sensitive plants\n\nKeep plants healthy by mulching to reduce water loss, and by irrigating to help move salts through the soil\n\nLiterature cited:\n\nThe inconsistency among various authorities in rating salt-tolerance of landscape plants makes it difficult for any one table to be thoroughly accurate.

Growing at a moderate pace, Chinese Jujube reaches anywhere from 15 to 35 feet in height with a spread of 10 to 30 feet and can be trained to a single trunk. Most unpruned plants grow with several trunks. The mottled gray/black bark is rough and shaggy. The one to two-inch-long leaves have a paler underside and sharp spines at the base of each leaf. Fall color is often a showy yellow, but not consistent. In spring, small clusters of yellow or white, fragrant blossoms appear, hidden in foliage between the leaf and stems. The one-inch-long green fruits ripen to dark red and finally black. Eaten either fresh, candied, canned, or dried like dates, these fruits are quite sweet. Even young, two-year-old trees are able to produce these delectable treats but be forewarned that these fruits can create quite a litter problem.

      "text": "hm...whats up with our neighbours???\n\nOk, coming back from work and see this big pile of cut rosebushes just laying there. See some gardeners in my neighbours yard and ask them why they throw all the rubbish into my yard. They answer its the cut off from our bushes growing above the fence, so they wanted it cut down. OK, is it really ok for them to 1. cut it off, and 2. throw it back to our yard??? I`m confused (on my daughters account, she is not back from work )\n\nIf it's growing over the fence from your property the neighbor is entitled to prune them back from their side and give you the rubbish back.Not a very neighborly thing to do as opposed to disposing of it themselves though.\n\nif so...I'd be rather annoyed, and dumping it in your yard seems extremely unprofessional...someones boss would be getting a letter from me! (I get really sick of tradies/service people leaving their crap everywhere when they're PAID)\n\nOur neighbour once called and yelled until we came outside to see what was up. Turns out a forked twig (about 40cm long) from a tree in our yard fell onto the fence. It wasn't in their yard or anything, just chilling on the fence and he cracked a big nah-nah about it. We had to grab it from the fence. He easily could have just pushed it off the fence into out yard. It just ended up in the garden that was beside the fence anyway.\n\nIf they're growing over the fence into their yard they can trim them. It's a trespass to property. If they're just above the fence line, but still on your side, I would probably have a go at the gardeners for trimming them.\n\njust growing above the fence from what I can see. They guy just came over and asked us to remove a 4 meter tall frangipani tree as well, it`s on our side, but he said the roots are pushing the fence, I can`t see the fence has moved a bit though. Well, I believe this is a fight for hubby, they are neighbours and I dont really wanna fight them\n\nMy parents have a lady who does a similar thing we used to have mulberry trees she told dad she was going to cut them back to the fence line. we come home to find 2 stumps a foot tall. they basically cut the trees down they wont grow gain. Second time the cust down some bamboo dad had growing which was not in her yard and nowhere near going over the fence line. for years she's done this and my parents have got to the point now they don't bother saying anything as it neve acchieves anything. i myself refer to her as the dragon lady as she used to kill possums and poisoned my cat with ratsack. she has been in trouble with the rspca before but i find a bit of oldschool justice works better than a fine. just dont react straight away and make sure if you do do anything about it that you keep yourself out of trouble.\n\nHow tall is your fence? If it is only a small one, build it right up with some lattice or wire and grow something quite dense on it - or have a lattice like trellis built right inside your fence line and grow a densely growing vine on it. As far as I am aware, if it is inside your fence line, your neighbours have no rights to do anything other than ask you to trim it. If it were me, i'd be doing a midnight run through their garden....\n\nCollecting skulls does not make me weird. My tweezer obsession does.\n[9:33:25] Australis: ...... ill pull out a rare \"sorry\"... to jen.\nI don't want to be chaste, I want to be pursued.\n\nI just had a look on the internet as our council did have guidelines for how over hanging branches etc should be handled between neighbours. This has all been taken down off their website and all I could find was reference to the law of nusance. So essentially if they want to prune anything on their side they can and can claim the cost of that. However they have to discuss the cost of this with you first they cant just say...you owe me $$. Also anything pruned from their side of the property that comes from your trees belongs to you. They are supposed to neatly return the branches to you so you can do with them what you want. They are not supposed to just throw them in your side of the property. However saying that there is no legislation to protect you other than the law of nusance. And you have to go to a solicitor to take legal action which financially isnt worth it which really sucks big time.\n\nI was interested in knowing about this thats why I looked it up because every 12 months to 2 years we have to prune back a tree on the fence line from one of our neighbours. It is a real pain. We dont speak to our neighbours and I dont want to start so we usually just pay for it all to be removed. I am however going to have a lattice high fence put in as part of our landscaping and I am intending to grow a nice vigorous climber up it....they can have the joy of cutting it back when it is established and I hope it works its way into the tree and creates a whole lot of work for them.... and I dont want them giving me the prunings back....so I guess it is tit for tat...\n\nThey cant make you remove any tree on your property.\n\nCouncils used to get a lot more involved in all these things and it seems they have washed their hands of it all....makes me wonder just what our rates pay for.\n\nPLUS it means you really are on your own when it comes to this stuff and it isnt fair especially when it leaves you having to PAY solicitors big money to defend yourself about neighbours being unreasonable. Which means unless something gets completely out of control there isnt anything you can do about it.\n\nI guess you coud write them a letter letting them know that you dont appreciate them throwing all the branches in your property and that if it happens aagain you will go legal or whatever....\n\nThe problem with poo in he letterbox is...well it would feel good to do it but if they are feral it might meak them do worse back and start a lovely tit for tat between you which you dont want especially if escalates.\n\nOf course another approach is to become romantically involved with a solicitor.....now theres a plan....hi hunnie..I love you..by the way.......theres a small matter of my nighbours I need you to deal with lol"

      "text": "Hybrid oak could be offspring of any combination of two species\n\nDear Neil: We planted a hybrid oak 40 years ago. Now we're wondering, what is it a hybrid of?\n\nA: A \"hybrid\" would be the offspring of any two species of oaks. However, there are hundreds and hundreds of species, which means there could be thousands of hybrids. Oaks are wind-pollinated, so technically, every oak is a hybrid of sorts. True hybrid oaks that have been selected for some superior trait are propagated by budding (grafting). If that was done, you should be able to see the change in the bark color and texture near the ground where the graft was made. But, that still doesn't identify its lineage. Next time you have a certified arborist on-site, you could ask his or her opinion.\n\nDear Neil: Is there an effective control for young goatheads (not grassburs)? Our weeds have compound leaves.\n\nA: Use any of the broadleafed weedkiller sprays. They'll contain 2,4-d, usually in combination with two other herbicides. Apply it directly to the active growth, and give it 10 to 15 days to do its job entirely.\n\nDear Neil: Suddenly this year, we have a terrible outbreak of fire ants. It seems like anything I put out to control them doesn't last. I kill out one mound and several others crop up.\n\nA: Use one of the granular Fipronil products. The ants are drawn to them, and they offer many months of control.\n\nDear Neil: We have some terrible grasslike weeds in our Bermuda lawn. Is there any way to kill them without hurting the Bermuda?\n\nA: Now that we no longer have MSMA as a selective grassy weed control, the answer is sadly \"no.\" Anything you apply to kill one grass will kill both grasses. Depending on what the weed is, your best remedy would be either to apply a pre-emergent weedkiller in early March and again in early June. The June treatment is a \"booster shot.\" If you didn't make the March treatment, there is no reason to treat now.\n\nDear Neil: We planted a lovely coral bark maple this spring. It did very well until the weather turned hot a few weeks ago. Now, the top leaves and those on the side have browned edges. It gets sun from noon until 4 p.m. and shade the rest of the day. One nursery recommended a water-soluble fertilizer, which I have used twice. I'm not sure if there is anything else I should do. Another nursery recommended replanting it into more shade. What do you recommend?\n\nA: Get it out of the sun! Coral bark and other Japanese maples are very intolerant of Texas sun. I've had a coral bark maple for 15 or 18 years, and even in total shade, it still has some of the marginal burn in extreme heat. Keep your tree uniformly moist all summer long, but do note that this is not an issue of insufficient water. It can't handle the sun.\n\nDear Neil: I planted 5-gallon Pink Velour crape myrtles in spring 2009. Last year, they grew well and flowered profusely, but this year the leaves look like autumn foliage. They are shriveling and dropping at an alarming rate. There is little new growth. What should we do?\n\nA: Without seeing a photo, it's difficult to know what to advise, but it sounds like powdery mildew may have been involved. It also sounds like you might need to add nitrogen. Hopefully the plants didn't get too dry at some point late last season. Those are vague answers, I know, but they're at least a starting point for you.\n\nDear Neil: My Texas star hibiscus is in a pot, and it was looking good the day before I took this photo. Then, some of the leaves started developing spots and turning yellowish. What might the problem be?\n\nA: The yellowed leaves are all on one side of the plant. The speckling almost looks like they were hit by either a spray drift or by a sprinkler while the sun was shining on the plant. No insect or disease attack is going to be that unilateral. It's also difficult to maintain any hardy hibiscus in a container, especially one like Texas star. They just require too much water and nutrition to be satisfied with the confined root space. It probably will do better if you'll get it into the ground.\n\nDear Neil: We brought a potted trumpetvine with us when we moved four years ago. It's been planted for three summers on the north end of our front porch, but it hasn't bloomed at all during that time. We've used two commercial fertilizer products on it, but no blooms. What should we do?\n\nA: It's not uncommon for a trumpetvine to grow aggressively for the first couple of years that you have it in the landscape. Two things you need to remember, however, are that vegetative growth will come at the expense of flower bud production, so you really don't want to encourage a lot of new growth. Also, they need full sunlight to bloom to their best capacity. \"North ends\" of houses are often shaded.\n\nDear Neil: Is there a significant difference in Floratam St. Augustine and Raleigh St. Augustine? Also, do some vendors sell better sod than others?\n\nA: Floratam was released jointly by the University of Florida and Texas A&M some 35 years ago. It was one of the very first varieties that were then proving to be resistant to the St. Augustine Decline virus. However, it proved to be winter-hardy only in South Texas. Raleigh came along a couple of years later, having been found in a North Carolina S.A.D. research plot after a very cold winter. It's more winter-hardy, so you're more likely to see it in lawns north of San Antonio/Houston. As for quality of sod, yes, there can be significant differences. Talk to your local independent retail garden center about the source they would recommend.\n\nIf you'd like Neil's help with your plant question, drop him a note to Gardener's Mailbag, PO Box 864, McKinney, TX 75070 or email your questions to mailbag@sperrygardens.com."

We have tried to plant many types of flowers around the tree only to have them die. Is there a particular type of plant that we should be planting?\n\nANSWER:\n\nYou have discovered for yourself that magnolias are allelopathic to other plants. This means that the magnolia produces chemicals that inhibit the germination of seeds and growth of plants that are potential competitors for its resources. The roots and fallen debris (leaves, flowers, etc.) from the magnolia tree contain substances that limit the growth of other competing species that grow underneath it. In the case of magnolias, the substances are sesquiterpene lactones—costunolide and parthenolide—(see Abdelgalel, A. M. and F. Hasinaga. 2007. \"Allelopathic potential of two sesquiterpene lactones from Magnolia grandiflora L.\" Biochemical Systematics and Ecology Vol. 35, no. 11, pp. 737-742.) A complicating factor is that many plants won't grow in the dense shade created by the magnolia tree—or any other tree, for that matter.\n\nWalnuts trees (Juglans sp.) also have allelopathic effects on plants growing beneath them. The substance produced by walnuts is called juglone. Virginia Cooperative Extension has an article \"Trees for Problem Landscape Sites -- The Walnut Tree: Allelopathic Effects and Tolerant Plants\" that offers some tips on reducing the effects of juglone on plants growing near walnut trees that could apply to your magnolia. One important tip is to \"Regularly clean up all fallen leaves and fruit..., keeping debris away from desired landscape plants.\" They also list plants that are tolerant to juglone. These, of course, are NOT guaranteed to be tolerant to the sesquiterpene lactones in magnolias, nor are they necessarily native to Southern California (nor, for that matter, are any of the Magnolia species).\n\nI could find no list of plants that are resistant to the allelopathic effects of magnolias. So, my recommendations to you are: 1) keep the debris from the magnolia cleaned up from the area where you want the flowers/plants to grow, and 2) choose native plants that are shade-tolerant. Here are a few recommended shade-tolerant herbaceous plants that are native to San Diego County or an adjacent California county:\n\nMore Propagation QuestionsWildflower garden with Castilleja indivisa (Indian paintbrush) January 08, 2013 - I want to start a wildflower garden in my front/backyard.

      "text": "CHAMPAIGN, Ill. - For many people, autumn weather brings a welcomed time of the year. Adding to the pleasure of the season are the vibrant colors displayed in nature. Leaf pigment, the physics of light, weather conditions, plant species, and geography all play important roles in the color of autumn.\n\nLeaf Pigment and Light\n\nThanks to the physics of sunlight striking pigments inUnlike chlorophyll and carotenoidsWeather and Color\n\nWeather conditions that occur before and during the decline of chlorophyll production can affect the color that leaves may display. Carotenoids are always present so the yellow and gold colors are the least affected by weather.\n\nColors most affected by weather are the red tones created by anthocyanin. On warm sunny days lots of sugar is produced in the leaves. Trees exposed to brighter sunlight generate the reaction between the anthocynanins and the excess sugar creating the bright red hue.\n\nCooler temperatures cause the veins in the leaves to gradually close preventing the sugars from moving out which preserves the red tones. Thus a succession of warm sunny days and cool crisp nights can paint the most spectacular display of color.\n\nThe level of moisture in the soil can also affect autumn color. A severe summer drought can delay the onset of color change by weeks. Ideal conditions for producing the most brilliant colors are a warm wet spring, favorable summer weather, and sunny fall days with the cooler temperatures at night.\n\nSpecies and Geography\n\nThe genetics of different tree species help determine what color the leaves will turn. Color depends on the levels of iron, magnesium, phosphorous, or sodium in the tree and the acidity of the chemicals in the leaves. Some tree species displaying yellow foliage are ash, birch, beech, elm, hickory, poplar, and aspen. Red leaves are seen most often in dogwood, sweetgum, sumac, and black tupelo trees. Some oaks and maples present orange leaves while others range in color from red to yellow, depending on the specific species.\n\nDeciduous forests and trees, with their many broad leaves that change color almost in unison, display the most noticeable fall color. Evergreen species also display fall colors, only slowly and gradually. The appearance of autumn color starts as early as mid September in more northern latitudes and moves southward, reaching its peak in October, but color continues to appear in more southern regions and higher elevations in the west throughout November.\n\nOnly a few places in the world have the combination of tree species and climatic conditions necessary for the most vivid fall foliage. Some of the best locations with broadleaved deciduous trees and favorable conditions for brilliant fall color are:\n\nEven with these facts, the timing, location, and intensity of autumn color are not completely predictable. To truly experience the colorful display, you must be adventurous. There are many states with thousands of scenic byways designed to focus on the palettes of autumn color. So even if you live in a region that does not produce an array of color, take an autumn vacation and explore nearby states that do.

      "text": "Logan, Jeremy. New Life Journal, June. (2009)\n\nOver the centuries, tree pruning has evolved beyond simply cutting trees to generate firewood or to clear land for crops. Today, the term \"pruning\" brings as many different images to mind as there are reasons to do so. Whether you're trying to improve fruit and flower production, prune for health or structural integrity, provide utility pruning, or are just looking to enhance a tree's natural beauty, there are a few simple guidelines that will ensure positive results.\n\nAt the foundation of proper pruning is an understanding of how trees respond to wounds. Since trees lack the ability to regenerate damaged cells, they must compartmentalize or seal off wounds to prevent the spread of decay and disease. This process -- commonly referred to as CODIT, or the compartmentalization of decay in trees -- should primarily influence the size of branches or stems being removed from the tree. The larger the pruning cut, the longer it will take the tree to seal off that wound. The bottom line is if you can achieve your objective by removing several one or two-inch diameter stems rather than removing a stem that might be six or eight inches in diameter, the tree will be able to seal those wounds quicker and prevent potential decay from occurring. With this in mind, we can begin to explore when, where and how much pruning is appropriate for a tree.\n\nWhen: Certain types of pruning, such as fruit tree pruning, are best accomplished in the dormant season, January-February. However, most trees can tolerate pruning year round as long as there are no extreme amounts of stress, such as; drought, heat waves, or excessive root loss. Dead, dying, broken or diseased branches, as well as vines, should be removed at the earliest convenience.\n\nWhere: Trees have a highly developed system of checks and balances within their structure. When a tree develops a central stem with an undamaged terminal bud, that tip bud has the job of sending signals to the rest of the tree, in the way of hormones release, that tell the tree it has a leader and a direction to follow. When that terminal bud is a damaged or removed, new signals respond by releasing dormant buds into service to replace the missing canopy. Trees that have been 'topped' or have had their entire canopies removed exhibit extreme examples of this response. To avoid this unsightly, counterproductive reactionary growth, it's necessary to prune trees using lateral-reduction cuts. When stems are removed or reduced to a lateral branch at least 30 percent of the diameter of the parent stem being removed, the remaining stem should be established enough to take over the hormonal signaling role and direct growth energy into the remaining stem. It's also important to place pruning cuts just outside the branch collar or swell at the base of a stem being removed. A smooth, round cut will compartmentalize quicker than a long, oval or jagged cut. Pruning cuts should be left exposed to air flow and sunlight. Research has shown that 'tree paints', while popular in the past, actually inhibit the CODIT process and act to harbor insects and decay.\n\nHow much: In a healthy shade tree, and appropriate amount of pruning should not exceed 15-20 percent of the total canopy, or leaf-bearing stems, per year. More sensitive trees, such as ornamentals, old growth and stressed trees, will respond best to a much lighter pruning or removal of live tissue, around 5-10 percent of the total canopy. When major corrective pruning is needed over the 20 percent limit, a five- or ten-year plan may be warranted. You can prune to a maximum percentage once a year or every other year until the desired structure is achieved. When thinning trees, it's desirable to leave some interior branches in the canopy, as they're important for cooling the trees during times of extreme heat. In younger trees, low branches along the trunk help with trunk taper establishment. These branches should be allowed to remain as temporary branches during early development.\n\nBy following these basic principles, you can help your trees grow into healthy, attractive trees to enjoy for years to come."

      "text": "Teach Fruit Trees to Multitask with Grafting\n\nThe other important consideration is keeping the graft from drying out, which is why most are done early in the spring, while the tree and scion are still dormant. \"The strategy is to minimize moisture loss in the tree,\" Ken says.\n\nHeirloom varieties are being studied for wheat characteristics such as disease resistance....\n\nIf grafting is attempted during the peak growing time, the graft has to compete (for nutrients and water) with leaf and fruit production. Since most of the effort is diverted to these processes, the summertime graft will most likely fail.\n\nFrom scion to stout limb\n\nThe first step in grafting is obtaining the scions, the short pieces of branches with two to three buds that are inserted into the understock (tree or root stock). Gathering scions, either from your own orchard, a friend's place or from a nursery selling them, is best done in the winter – from January to the beginning of March – when the trees are still dormant.\n\nScions should come from 1-year-old wood, and never be larger in diameter than the branch you're going to graft to. An ideal diameter is approximately the size of a pencil.\n\nUsing a sharp, clean knife, cut sections of branch at least a couple of inches longer than you need. Three healthy buds on each scion are preferable. Wrap the scions in damp paper towels or newspaper, and store them in a plastic bag in the vegetable drawer of the refrigerator until you're ready in the spring. Keeping the scions in this artificial dormancy increases your chance of success because when the understock is budding, the scion will be a couple of weeks behind. This allows the scion to take before it begins vigorous growth.\n\nThe best time for spring grafting is when the buds are just ready to open, typically in April to May depending on where you live. Jim says he prefers to graft at his Northeastern Ohio location when the water temperature of Lake Erie is 45 degrees. It seems to coordinate well to time budding since air temperature can fluctuate from year to year. If the leaves are already out, it's tremendously difficult to keep the graft from drying out and failing.\n\nA number of grafting styles offer varying degrees of difficulty and success. One of the simplest techniques is the whip graft, although it is also more likely to fail if the graft is not kept tight. But since scions don't cost very much, or are outright free from friends, it's easy to practice.\n\nWhip graft\n\nFor the whip graft, use a sharp knife to make an even, sloping cut roughly 2 inches long from just below the scion's last bud to the root end. (It's important to keep track of the top of the scion, since one inserted upside down will not take.) Make a similar cut on the branch you wish to graft to – take care that the angles of each cut match up as closely as possible. Insert the scion into the branch, and be sure the green, cambium layers beneath the bark on both stems make solid contact"

Chal Landgren, a Christmas tree specialist with the Oregon State University Extension Service, says there are several things you can do to keep your tree fresh through the holidays.\n\nThe first thing, Landgren said, is to look for trees with firm needles.\n\n\"In a tree's late stages, its needles will break,\" Landgren pointed out. \"On a tree that's fully hydrated, its needles will be firm-looking and when you bend them they will tend to bend back.\" Species that stay freshest the longest include Noble fir, followed by Nordmann trees, he added.\n\nOther tips on trees include:\n\nTo store it before bringing it inside, leave it outside, preferably in a bucket of water. It should keep well in a cool, shady spot.\n\nIf you leave the tree out longer than a day or so, make a fresh cut consisting of about a quarter inch off the base of the trunk to improve the tree's water uptake.\n\nOnce you bring the tree inside, make sure its stand is regularly filled with water. Trees drink a lot of water at first. A stand should hold a quart of water for every inch of stem diameter. A tree with a six-inch stem diameter will need a stand that holds a gallon and a half of water.\n\nAdditives in the water are not recommended. Plain tap water is best.\n\nKeep the tree away from heat sources as best as possible. Heat and air movement dry out a tree faster. If it's in water and not near a heat source, the tree could easily last three weeks, Landgren said.\n\nWhen you're done enjoying your tree for the season, recycle it. Several groups, including the Boy Scouts, recycle Christmas trees. You can also bring it to organic recycling facilities.\n\nFor more gardening stories and advice, visit the Extension Service's website at"

A great video on how you can prune apples for maximum taste.\n\nStep 1: You will need Secateurs A pruning saw or loppers 'telescopic pruner' for high branches\n\nStep 2: Remove 'suckers' Use secateurs to cut back the 'suckers', which are the unwanted shoots that grow near the base of the trunk. Remove all of these shoots up to the base of the main canopy of the tree to encourage a good shape.\n\nStep 3: Remove dead wood Remove any dead, diseased or damaged wood which is flaking or discoloured. Remove the whole branch if it doesn't have any buds. If it does have buds towards the base of the branch, make a cut just above an outward facing bud. Angle each cut so rain can drain off the stem rather than sitting on top and rotting the plant.\n\nStep 4: Remove crossing branches To encourage your tree to grow in a vase shape, remove any branches that cross over. Vase shaped trees not only look more attractive, they help wind pass through the plant which prevents it catching airborne diseases. Branches that cross may also rub and become infected. Remove these branches at the base, and any other stems that grow inwards rather than outwards.\n\nStep 5: Prune the remaining branches Cut back the rest of the branches by about half their length, to encourage the stems to thicken and develop flowers the following season. Make each cut just above an outward facing bud to encourage a healthy shape.\n\nIf you have some jobs to do in the garden, but are unsure how to go about them, these videos should come in handy to show you step by step what to do, and provide the advice you need.

DBH refers to the tree diameter measured at 4.5 feet above the ground.\n\nDBH can be measured quickly with a specially calibrated diameter tape, often referred to as a d-tape, that displays the diameter measurement when wrapped around the circumference of a tree. If you don't have access to a d-tape, you can find the diameter of the tree using a string, a measuring tape, a thumb tack, and a calculator.\n\nWith the measuring tape, measure 4.5 feet up the trunk of the tree from the ground. Use a thumb tack to mark the height on the tree.\n\nWrap your string around the tree trunk at 4.5 feet. Make sure the string is straight and tight around the trunk, and mark or cut the circumference on the string.\n\nMeasure the length of string to get the circumference of the tree.\n\nConvert the circumference measurement to diameter by dividing the circumference by 3.14.\n\nIf the tree has a branch or a bump at 4.5 feet, it is better to measure the diameter slightly below or above the branch/bump. If the tree forks well below 4.5 above the ground, measure the DBH of each fork individually, square each DBH, add the squares together, and take the square root of that sum.

For this reason infected leaves are often twisted and gnarled.\n\nEuonymus, rose, phlox, lilac and crape myrtle are common hosts.

The timing and frequency of pruning depends on the species and the general effect required\n\nNative informal or semi-formal hedges will help attract wildlife, providing shelter and food\n\nEvergreen or deciduous?\n\nEvergreens make fine hedges and obviously the bonus is having shelter or privacy all year round. However, they do tend to take more maintenance and need to be pruned annually, ideally twice a year. Conifers are popular evergreen choices, but need to be pruned regularly as neglected or overgrown conifer hedges cannot be restored.\n\nDeciduous plants also make fine hedges, and indeed a beech hedge over winter holding onto its brown leaves is very pretty. You won't get the shelter or privacy with a deciduous hedge as you do with an evergreen. An advantage of a deciduous hedge is that it will filter wind in winter avoiding the damaging turbulence associated with dense evergreen hedges. They are more forgiving with pruning, and although they should be pruned in late summer, if you miss a year or two they will respond well to renovation.\n\nBuying plants\n\nBuying hedging plants in bulk from specialist growers is generally cheaper than from retail outlets.\n\nSmaller transplants (also called whips) about 60cm (2ft) establish more rapidly than larger plants, which can often suffer from establishment problems especially during periods of extreme weather such as drought or excess moisture levels. But if you want to establish a hedge quickly, buying semi-mature plants is the way to go. They are more expensive, and you will need to pay special attention to watering over the first two years.\n\nPlant selection\n\nS = maintain at 30-90cm (1-3ft) M = maintain at 90-120cm (3-4ft) M/L = maintain at 90-180cm (3-6ft) or as taller hedges or screens L = can be maintained at over 180cm (6ft)\n\nDeciduous\n\nCarpinus betulus (hornbeam) M/L: Similar to beech though it does not hold the leaves for as long. Better suited for cold situations than beech Fagus sylvatica (beech) M/L: Suitable for formal hedges. Provides screening in winter as it retains brown leaves until spring"

Grand\n\nThe age-old tradition of kissing under the mistletoe is well known in our culture, and most people have heard of the importance of mistletoe to the ancient Druids, for whom it served ritual and medicinal purposes (2). Many also know the berry-like fruits to be toxic to people, but according to Poisonous Plants of North Carolina, poisoning will occur only if large quantities are eaten.\n\nFewer people know the marvelous mistletoe story from Norse Mythology, wherein a conniving Loki arranges for a mistletoe arrow to be used to kill Balder, whom the creatures of earth were sworn not to harm. The mistletoe – which never touches the earth – was not obligated by the oath (3). On a more scientific note, mistletoe was recognized as being a parasite of its host tree as far back as the 13th century by Albertus Magnus (4), a.k.a. St. Albert the Great, who gets my vote for patron saint of plant pathology.\n\nIn North Carolina mistletoe is a common sight this time of year in oaks and other hardwoods, since it stays green even after its host tree has dropped its leaves. I've seen mistletoes recently in sycamore and even in ornamental pear. They usually appear as round sprays of leafy stems high in the crown. This makes them inconvenient for gathering as holiday decor, and people have been known to bring them down with a shotgun blast. In some cases – this seems especially common in red maple – mistletoe occurs as a trunk infection, causing a gnarling and roughening of the bark. The mistletoe shoots coming from these trunks are more accessible to would-be collectors, but are rather too short for effective decorating. Unless someone is beating me to the bigger ones.\n\nLeafy or true mistletoes in the New World belong mostly to the genus Phoradendron. They are classified in the Viscaceae, the same family as the famous Eurasian mistletoe, Viscumalbum. Both are \"water parasites\" which take up water and dissolved minerals from their host trees but photosynthesize most of their own food. As you might imagine, this arrangement is a more serious burden for trees in the drier parts of the country than here in the Southeast. You would not likely confuse the true mistletoes with their cousins, the dwarf mistletoes (Arceuthobium spp.). Not only are their size and appearance different, but dwarf mistletoes don't occur in North Carolina, even in the seemingly suitable climate of our mountains. They do occur in western and northern U.S. states, where they can be serious pests of conifers.\n\nDwarf mistletoe. Photo by David Shew\n\nIf you look up mistletoe in a Spanish-English dictionary, you'll be given the word \"muérdago\", but in my wife's home in southern Mexico, mistletoe is referred to as \"injerto\". This word means \"graft\" and is a very apt moniker, given the xylem union between the mistletoe and its host. Interestingly, the mistletoe of my wife's upbringing has showy flowers, much different from the inconspicuous flowers of our local types.\n\nThe mistletoe's whitish berries are eaten by birds, but the seeds pass through the birds' digestive systems. Some are lucky enough to be deposited on thin-barked tree branches, where they are held by the seeds' sticky coating (Remember the family name Viscaceae?). After germination, instead of roots the young parasite forms structures that penetrate the branch and establish an infection. The mistletoe's shoots develop later, but are very small the first year. Growth continues in subsequent years, and the mistletoe will be with the branch for life. (6)\n\"Your heart's a dead tomato / splotched with moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch.\" (7)\n\nFrom all of us here at the Plant Disease Clinic, Happy Holidays! Please remember that we'll be closed December 26-30, 2011. We look forward to checking your tomatoes, trees, and the critters that bug you in 2012."

      "text": "Simple and gracefully beautiful is the only way to begin to describe the much-loved native tree, the redbud, Cercis canadensis. One of the earliest of the flowering trees to bloom, the redbud, along with the daffodils, signals that another winter is indeed coming to a close and that the gardening season is here again.\n\nLong before there were modern garden centers and nurseries, gardeners were digging up redbud seedlings from the woodland edges and transplanting them near their homes. Both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson documented their use of redbuds, noting that they were such a lovely sight.\n\nIt is hard for me to imagine that what we perceive as a modern-day landscape plant was as popular in the 1700s as it is today. Perhaps its extensive native range, which runs from Connecticut to the Gulf of Mexico, aided in its familiarity as early Americans and explorers recognized it as they traveled from town to town along the eastern coast.\n\nFoliage, flowers, and pods There is something familiar about a native redbud, even comfortable. It grows only 20 or so feet tall and many times equally wide. It has leaves that are large, 3 to 5 inches in length and width, and they have a wonderful heart shape. Fall color is generally a consistent and good yellow. The smaller stems have an interesting zigzag pattern to them when young, and the bark becomes dark with age, almost black, when it's raining and wet.\n\nThe flowers are what we all remember the most. A color I find hard to describe, it's not red, pink, or lavender but somewhere in between. The flowers are often described as rosy pink with a hint of purple. Blooms appear well ahead of the leaves, and even though they are small, only 1/2 inch or less each when fully open, they make a lasting impression. The blossoms can be found all over the plant, from twigs to trunk, and plants will begin to bloom even when they are very small.\n\nNaturally following flowering is seed production, and the redbud forms a pod like a pea. It slowly forms throughout the summer and then ripens in the fall, when it turns a dark brown. The pods are about 3 inches long, and when they are abundant on the tree they are very obvious, especially in the winter. Many find them an attractive addition while others think it is the worst characteristic of the native redbud.\n\nIt is hard to find a plain old native redbud in a garden center anymore, but there are quite a few cultivated varieties or cultivars that are now commonly available and very popular.\n\nCultivated varieties 'Forest Pansy' is one of the most popular. The new growth emerges a shiny reddish purple that fades to green, usually by early July. The flowers are the same as the native redbud. Another popular cultivar is 'Alba,' or the White Red Bud. It sounds funny, but the flowers are a beautiful white. There is some question about the hardiness of these two varieties, so if you have a protected site with moderate temperature swings in the winter, it may be the best location for one of these two redbuds.\n\nSome other hardy ones include: 'Ace of Hearts,' known for its beautiful foliage and interesting layered effect caused by exaggerated zigzag branching; 'Heart of Gold,' with its golden yellow foliage; 'Little Woody,' which is a dwarf form growing only half the size of most redbuds; and 'Covey,' also called 'Lavender Twist,' which is a beautiful weeping form. All of these cultivars have the traditional rosy pink flowers.\n\nI am really excited about a cultivar of redbud called 'Appalachian Red.' It is not red at all but has a bright, almost neon pink flower. It definitely gets your attention. The foliage looks like any other redbud, but when you see it in flower you will definitely want one.\n\nNurseryman Theodore Klein The redbud 'Silver Cloud' was introduced by the late Theodore Klein, an incredible nurseryman in Crestwood, Kentucky, who introduced us to many wonderful plants over his lifetime, several of which are only now becoming more available. Silver Cloud has interesting irregularly variegated leaves and is best grown in a well-drained but moist site that is partly shady. It is bright and beautiful in the right location. You can view a photograph of the foliage at  in the photo gallery.\n\nYou may want to visit Yew Dell gardens in Crestwood. The residence, garden, and nursery of Theodore Klein are now an arboretum for all to enjoy. I will always remember riding around with Theodore in his golf cart several years before his passing. He was always a gracious host, reminding me to hold on so I wouldn't fall out, and showing me each plant he thought I would find interesting, describing each with such love as if it were a child. Indeed, even just one passionate person can make a difference.\n\nI can't imagine anyone saying they wouldn't want a redbud in their garden for any other reason than that there are simply already so many beautiful ones around to enjoy."

      "text": "Casey Trees » Tree of the Month\nD.C.-based urban forestry non-profit dedicated to restoring, enhancing and protecting the tree canopy of the nation's capital.Tue, 21 May 2013 15:57:11 +0000en-UShourly1 of the Month: Tulip tree\n 01 May 2013 15:56:29 +0000Timothy Hoagland This is a special edition of our Tree of the Month feature – our Tree Planting Director, Jim Woodworth, wrote this for us because it's his absolute favorite tree! Get a look inside his appreciation for the amazing tulip tree:\n\n\"Lilly tree bearing tulips\" is apparently what Linnaeus meant when he described the tulip tree as Liriodendron tulipifera, and we have been calling it all kinds of things before and after: tulip poplar, yellow poplar, white wood, fiddle tree. It is not a poplar, but it is in the magnolia family.\n\nI learned a lot in forestry school, but two tree facts that stuck best in my head were related to our big trees: sycamore and tulip tree. The sycamore is the tree in the northeastern United States with the widest girth (the biggest trunk) and the tulip tree is the tallest. Sure, we can't compete with the redwoods and sequoias of the Pacific northwest, but we've still got our share of big trees around here!\n\nThe tulip tree is actually the tallest deciduous tree in North American, and it is the only species of its genus on this continent. There is one other species in Asia, Liriodendron chinensis. The tulip tree is also one of our fastest growing trees here in the Washington, D.C. region. Often nestled in a little creek or stream valley, they grow quickly and often fool you into looking older than they really are. But their grandeur and superlative qualities belie their finer points. I'm quite fond of their simple, but peculiar blunt-tipped, four-lobed leaves, and I especially love the beautiful greenish-yellow with orange flowers.\n\nI often challenge folks to find new ways to appreciate their trees year round. For me, I rediscovered the tulip tree several times over in my continuing education and life-long work with trees, in very different circumstances. Once was stomping through the bitter cold of winter, crunching through an icy crust of old and frozen snow. It was a quiet, calm winter morning, with winter shadows long through the brown and gray trunks of trees, indistinguishable at first glance. But a little cold breeze picked up, and several large tulip trees, with their open brown seed cones, rained down hundreds of their wind-dispersed samara-like seeds, twinkling through the twigs and branches and skittering across the frozen landscape.\n\nIf you enjoy your trees while out walking around in the District, there are two locations where you can be sure to pay more attention to our majestic tulip trees: the first requires that you head south on 16th Street NW and after crossing the hustle and bustle of U Street, take a break from the people watching and look up to see the view of the White House. This stretch of 16th Street NW is unique in its prominent landscape design choice, with its view-shed framed by the towering, majestic tulip tree, planted just inside the sidewalk, in the front yards or \"public parking\" space of those properties that line the road. It's a design strategy that merits application in other situations, when our street trees are either choked out by small soil volumes of the tree box, or are \"reduction pruned\" for overhead wire clearance—let's plant big trees in front yards where there is space to allow them to reach their full potential.\n\nThe second spot asks that you cross Duke Ellington Memorial Bridge on a hot, humid, muggy D.C. evening between Adams Morgan and Woodley Park, and peer out over Rock Creek Park. You can see the tulip trees reaching for the sky from the park land below and enjoy a rare view looking down ontheir wonderful and seldom-seen flowers.\n\nThe tulip tree is the state tree for Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee, and a couple years back, we had the pleasure of planting one in St. Paul's Rock Creek Church Parish in memory of my friend Nick, from Kentucky.\n\nIt's also an important timber tree, known to have some resistance to termites, and has an American Indian history of being utilized for dug-out canoes. It is also considered a major honey plan. We frequently plant them as specimen shade trees in park and other settings where they will have plenty of space to reach their mature size. However, there are a couple smaller-stature cultivated varieties, including the \"Little Volunteer\" which we have planted at Delaware Circle, and hope to promote for smaller yard plantings.\n\nNo matter where you choose to see these incredible trees, be sure to soak in their presence – and bring a camera, to help you remember until the next time you cross paths. Check out our tree species map below for other locations throughout the District:\n\nThe Hawthorn tree (Crataegus sp.) harkens back to the old woodlands, farmlands, and estates of yore. It is a tree of diverse species with many forms and characteristics. Its wildness is exemplified most by the natural forms with long, stout thorns, and twisting and turning branches that form thickets telling woodland wanderers, \"do not tread here.\" While wildness can be a virtue, you might prefer the more homely cultivars that have been selected over centuries of Hawthorn cultivation. Varieties have been selected to be thornless, columnar, and to have showier flowers and fruit.\n\nThe hawthorn grows native all across the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. There are about 220 species native to North America alone. Many species occur only in certain places, giving many regions a native hawthorn they can call their own. Green Hawthorn (Crataegus viridis), with the now popular cultivar \"Winter King\" is probably the better known of the species native to our region. \"Winter King\" has a magnificent display of red fruit that persists further into the winter than most varieties. Its form can vary, with some cultivars staying under 10 feet, and some wild varieties getting as large as 45 feet. Hawthorns are generally considered tough species, able to deal with a range of soil conditions and drought, but they tolerate only moderate shade. Being in the rose family, Hawthorns are susceptible to some of the diseases associated with species in that family, though they are considered hardier than their cousins and with a little vigilance this tree should be no problem to grow. A healthy Hawthorn of some species can live as long as 400 years.\n\nHawthorn has much lore and a variety of historical uses. The traditional Mayday festival of Northern Europe was, in some places, said to fall on the day the Hawthorns bloomed, May 1st. Its alternate name is \"Mayhaw.\" Hawthorn flowers decorated the woman chosen to be the \"May Queen.\" Hawthorn fruits, also called \"haws\" have been used traditionally to make jams and jellies, with the North American varieties said to be sweeter and less astringent than their European counterparts. There is a movement to expand the cultivation of some southeastern varieties of Mayhaw to a broader commercial level. Hawthorn is also prevalent in folk medicine and has been used to counteract high blood pressure, heart failure, and chest pain. Unlike many folk remedies, these effects have recently been substantiated by conventional medical research and marketing of hawthorn extract has followed.\n\nThe Latin name Crataegus means \"hardness\" and refers to the Hawthorn woods durability. It was used in many applications of wood demanding strength, including for the cog teeth in old wooden watermills and machinery. For obvious reasons, the Hawthorn makes for one of the most functional living fences and hedges. When the commons farmland of England was divided up and privatized in the 18th and 19th centuries, the most popular way of enclosing land and keeping others out was to establish a Hawthorn hedge. Livestock can also be contained this way. Hawthorn is also a great wildlife plant, giving food to the birds into the winter.\n\nSo don't let the thorns on some of those Hawthorns scare you off. This tree has a rich cultural and ecological history, is a beautiful addition to any landscape, and it could even improve your health! Look out for its red berries in the winter and its flowers coming this spring (not exactly on Mayday around these parts) with the species map below:\n\nThe American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana) has a variety of alternate names – \"Blue Beech,\" for the color of its bark, and \"Musclewood\" for the muscle-like ripples in the trunk. It's a stately yet humble tree native to the understory of woods and shady areas along streams. It is a member of the birch family and has finely toothed leaves reminiscent of those of birches, though generally smaller in size.\n\nAn interesting feature of most trees in the birch family is the cylindrical, pendulous flowers with the special name \"catkin.\" The male catkins (which produce the pollen) of the American hornbeam differ from those of its cousin, the hophornbeam, in that they form in the spring as opposed to the previous fall. So if you see fresh catkins on a tree in the fall or winter, you can be sure you are NOT looking at an American hornbeam, but rather something else in the Birch family. The female catkins, when pollinated well, will develop into a long chain of 10 to 30 winged seeds that are a unique and aesthetically pleasing feature. The American hornbeam has a wide range, from Quebec, Canada down south to Florida and from the east coast west to Minnesota and Texas.\n\nThe American hornbeam and hophornbeam are not even in the same genus and their barks look very different, but they do share a well-deserved secondary name: Ironwood. These two species have some of the densest wood around, and were used for some roles that iron metal fills today. The name, 'horn'-'beam' refers to the wood being as durable and close-grained as an animal horn. Traditionally, they were used for tool handles and heads, wooden cogs, flooring, and golf clubs for their durability, as well as for turned bowls and plates due to their tendency to resist cracking. It is also reported that trying to work hornbeam with sharp tools will dull the tools very quickly, as if you were trying to cut into iron. Because of their density, these trees can make great fire wood if they exist in abundance on a given piece of land.\n\nIn a home landscape setting, this tree thrives in shady areas – though with a little pampering and some deep, rich soil, it can be an excellent addition to sunnier areas as well. It reportedly can reach 65 feet in its natural setting but you should expect only around 35 feet or less in a domestic setting, and that much only after many years as this tree naturally grows quite slowly. When allowed to go where they will, American hornbeam grows into a variety of unconventional form, with twists and multiple trunks that can be quite lovely. If trained properly, this species can work well as part of a hedge. A close relative of our tree, the European hornbeam, has been a classic landscape tree for centuries with many cultivars. The American hornbeam has a little more wildness in its blood but is an excellent native candidate for taking an increased role in our cultivated landscapes.\n\nIf you stroll long enough along the Rock Creek Park bike path you will certainly encounter a number of American hornbeam specimens – and if you venture into to the woods a little or close to the creek, you can find them in their natural setting. You can also see two planted in front of the Casey Trees office! Stop on by and say hi.\n\nThe princely, slender White pine (pinus strobus) is December's Tree of the Month, and as the winter season is upon us there is no better time to appreciate the startling beauty of this tree. What's more, the white pine played an important role in a critical time of American history.\n\nPinus strobus range across eastern North America, growing in the remote wilderness of Newfoundland down to the lower reaches of the Appalachian Mountains in northern Georgia. They grow to be old and wise, easily reaching 200 to 250 years old but in some cases approaching 500 years.\n\nThe White Pine prefers well-drained soil and cool, humid climates. It is inclined to grow in the misty foothills of mountain ranges but can grow just as well in boggy areas and rocky highlands. Being somewhat resistant to fire, White Pine trees can occasionally be the sole survivors of a forest fire, and are thus able to re-seed the area rapidly.\n\nHowever amazing its natural attributes are, pinus strobus are very special in another way. Before the revolutionary war, a common source of complaints against the British Crown by the colonials was about the methods that British soldiers used to cut down the tree. Pinus strobus grow very tall and very straight, and it's strength is such that it is able to withstand heavy winds and rot. These traits made it perfect for use in merchant and warships of the time. The trees were in such high demand that the King of England made it a crime for a colonial to cut down and use a white pine. The King sent agents to place a \"Broad Arrow Mark\" or \"King's Mark\" on the best of the White pines to ensure that the colonials would not tamper with royal property.\n\nAs it happened, the same properties valued for shipbuilding (resistance to rot, lightness and strength) were also excellent for building homes, cities, and infrastructure, and the colonials often defied the King by continuing to cut down and use the pinus strobus. The repercussions of this tension and occasional conflict were not lost upon the American colonists who eventually took up arms to overthrow the British.\n\nIn Native American history, the white pine even supplied important nutrition in times of hardship, and the word \"Adirondack\" is an Iroquois term that was applied to a neighboring tribe (today also known as the Algonquians) who they knew to eat the soft inner bark of pinus strobus. It could even be pounded and added to bread or other starchy foods, although they more often ended up feeding cattle and pigs instead of people.\n\nAlthough normally free from many pests and diseases, white pine was quite severely struck with \"pine blister\" in the early 20th century, spread by fungus attaching itself to gooseberries or wild current. Mortality from this condition reached 50-80% in mature pine groves before a laborious and concentrated effort was made to isolate and eliminate the threat. Today, pinus strobus comes in variants that are naturally resistant to the fungus and mortality rates have plummeted.\n\nWhite pines can be enjoyed at any time in the year, but there is no better time to go and appreciate these historic and elegant trees than now in crisp and clear winter weather. Take a look at the Casey Trees tree map below to find out where some grow near you!\n\nDaniel Boone, the legendary frontiersman of colonial times, left his mark on American history as well as on November's Tree of the Month: the American beech. Legend has it that Mr. Boone inscribed \"D. Boone kilt a bar, 1803\" on the trunk of an American beech tree and whether this is true or not, it showcases the rich history that Fagus Grandiflora shares with the United States.\n\nImmense forests of the American beech tree would have greeted Mr. Boone and eager frontiersmen like him as they roamed westward after the Revolutionary War. The range of Fagus grandiflora covers most of the United States east of the Mississippi river, and magnificent forests of the beech tree could be found in Ohio, Missouri, and along the western slopes of the Appalachian mountains.\n\nThe American beech is an elegant and majestic tree that is made possible by a slender yet strong trunk that usually splits into multiple trunks halfway up the height of a mature tree. These smaller trunks then spread tall and wide to give the appearance of a large and vase-like crown. The American beech has very smooth silver-grey bark that adds to its graceful and slender shape, although this attribute can also attract bear-killing frontiersman and others to enshrine mementos with a result that looks similar to writing on paper.\n\nMature beech trees grow to a height between 70 and 120 feet, and it can take 300 to 400 years for them to reach this height. The leaves of the Fagus grandiflora are elliptical in shape with coarse, saw-toothed edges and are typically 3 to 6 inches long and 2 to 3 inches wide. During autumn the leaves turn to a yellow or brown color before dropping. The monoecious beech tree begins to flower in early spring and male flowers are small, yellow balls that are clustered together while female flowers are small and inconspicuous balls with red scales. The fruit of the American beech can be produced every 2 to 3 years and is an edible nut, called a \"beech nut\", that is eaten by many animals.\n\nThe American beech trees prefer moist, well-drained soil that is neither too acidic nor too alkaline. It is commonly said that the first pioneers recognized that wherever beech trees grew was also the best place to grow crops because it had a reputation for growing in the best types of soil. Fagus grandiflora is the most shade-tolerant of the northeastern hardwoods and can be found in forests of final succession and is perfectly at ease in the understory of forests as well.\n\nBeech Bark disease has remained the most significant health concern for the American beech tree. It is caused by the Beech scale insect, as it can open a wound in the tree that allows harmful fungi to enter and create cankers which can ultimately lead to the demise of the tree. Although the disease is widespread, with the proper control and maintenance procedures the disease is not as serious as it once was.\n\nThe American Beech is a very well-regarded source of timber, paper, and firewood. The furniture industry in particular made significant use of the American beech since its wood is very hard but can be bent into a wide variety of shapes using a steaming process. Fagus grandiflora is a common tree around the District, and can be seen in places like the U.S. Capitol, the National Arboretum, and Montrose Park. If you want to see it in the wild, the best place would be Rock Creek Park. For other locations be sure to check out our interactive tree map. Red dots signify trees planted by the city; green dots represent Casey Trees-planted trees.\n\nThe October Tree of the Month is the stately and towering Quercus palustrus, also known as the pin oak. Perhaps one of the most abundant oaks in the United States, the pin oak can be found in almost all corners of the lower 48 states and has even adapted well to its introduction in Australia and is now common there as well. Illustrative of its large range is the pin oaks versatility where it is used by hundreds of local and city governments as canopy cover in public places such as parks, public buildings, and along streets and boulevards.\n\nOne of the characteristics that make the pin oak the tree of choice for these uses is its distinctive growth habit and handsome shape. The pin oak grows in an attractive pyramidal form with a straight and dominant trunk that firmly anchors the tree. The lower branches sweep out wide and droop slightly while the upper branches go from a horizontal to an upright angle as they reach the top.\n\nAlthough the possible planting zones for the pin oak are large and varied, it is a picky tree when it comes to soil type. Quercus palustris requires an acidic, moist soil and cannot tolerate a pH level of 7 or above. Nevertheless, it is tolerant of compacted soil and urban conditions. The pin oak can even adapt to flooding conditions by developing a fibrous and very shallow root system.\n\nGrowing to a height of 60 to 70 feet, the pin oak is a medium sized tree and has broad, lobed leaves. The leaves have deep sinuses and contain 5 to 7 lobes that typically have 3 to 4 bristles extending from the tip. In autumn the leaves can turn anywhere from a bronze to a rustic red color. The bark is fairly smooth and tight, developing small fissures as the tree ages. The pin oak's acorns are smaller than most other oaks and are topped by a thin cap , and the flowers are small inconspicuous spheres extending from the branches.\n\nHistoric uses of the pin oak include examples of the use of its bark in an intestinal remedy concocted by Native Americans and its name is said to have been derived from the early use of its wood as 'pins' during the colonial and frontier age that would hold the frames of buildings and structures together.\n\nBy far the most important condition affecting the pin oak is the onset of Chlorosis that comes from being improperly planted in soils that are too alkaline for the tree to transport enough iron from its roots to the upper structure of the tree, resulting in sickly white leaves that cannot photosynthesize properly. Otherwise this species has no particular diseases or pests that are not common to other species of oaks.\n\nAs the pin oaks are so popular and widely planted, in many cases it takes no more than a walk around the block to find an example of this hard-working and picturesque tree in your neighborhood! Be sure to look for the bristles on the tips of the leaves or the thin caps on the acorns and you have found a magnificent example of Quercus palustris.\n\nThe United States has many national emblems, including a national bird and flower, but imagine what it would be like to add a national tree to that list? Well, if Alexander Hamilton had his way, we would have gotten just that: he was very fond of September's Tree of the Month: the sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua).\n\nMr. Hamilton once said that he wanted to see his favorite tree become \"America's emblematic tree,\" and although it is perhaps unfortunate that the sweetgum did not make it into the same exclusive club as the bald eagle and the rose, it remains a popular and prized tree wherever it's found. Liquidambar styraciflua ranges along most of the eastern United States: from Connecticut to southern Florida, and from the swells of the Atlantic all the way to Oklahoma. It is a member of the Witch-Hazel family and can even be found in areas of Mexico and Central America.\n\nThe best way to recognize the sweetgum is by its five-pointed, star-shaped leaves that bear a close similarity to some members of the Maple species. The leaves are alternate and serrated, with a long stem attaching it to the branch and tinted in a rich green color. In the fall the sweetgum really stands out as its leaves turn to a brilliant spectrum of red, yellow, orange, and purple colors. Flowers come in small, inconspicuous round shapes attached in clusters to a thick stalk, but the fruits of Liquidambar styraciflua are easily recognizable due to their round, hard and spiky shape.\n\nThe sweetgum is one of the most common hardwoods in the eastern United States and is fairly adaptable to different conditions. It prefers moist, acidic or loamy soils and can tolerate poorly drained and salty soils as well. Liquidambar styraciflua are a long–lived species, and commonly reach ages of over 400 years. It is a medium-to-large-sized deciduous tree that normally doesn't grow taller than 115 feet with a minimum height of 70 feet.\n\nThe sweetgum is prized in the lumber industry as an affordable, durable wood that may not be the strongest but the rich red color of the wood can be polished to create many beautiful pieces of furniture or luxury items. Historical uses of the sweetgum include the harvest of its resin as a cure for sciatica and weak nerves. Interestingly enough, a chemical compound from the related Oriental sweetgum helped to invent Styrofoam. They are also widely used in land reclamation projects as they grow quickly and are insect-resistant.\n\nWith its advantages of year-round beauty, longevity, and fragrant wood and leaves it is easy to fall in love with the sweetgum, just like Alexander Hamilton did long ago. We are lucky to see this tree commonly in D.C., and if you want a closer look you need to go no farther than the National Zoo, the U.S. Capitol grounds, Constitution Gardens, or the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, to name but a few.\n\nDo you have a taste for honey, an eye for vibrant colors, and a love for trees with a slightly drooping form? Then Oxydendrum arboretum, also known as the sourwood, may be the perfect tree for you!\n\nThe sourwood is a lively and bold tree that ranges along most of the southeastern United States, from North Carolina to Arkansas, and West Virginia to the Gulf of Mexico (although it largely bypasses Florida). A member of the Ericaceae (heath) family, the sourwood is a deciduous and slow growing small-to-medium sized tree. Although special cases can occur where the tree reaches 90 feet in the wild, most of the time you will find cultivated specimens no taller than 40 feet.\n\nA special feature of the sourwood is its leaves, which are arranged in spiral or alternate form with an oblong, oval shape. The edges are finely toothed and the upper surface is shiny and smooth and bright green in the summer. Part of what makes the sourwood distinctive is that the leaves droop slightly from their branches, giving the tree a weeping willow-type aesthetic. In the fall, the leaves put on a magnificent show, expressing colors that include a bright crimson red or purplish burgundy. But if you have an urge to take a bite from one of the leaves, be warned that the sourwood is so named because of the very sour and bitter taste of its leaves!\n\nAlso contributing to the sourwood's beauty are its small and delicate, yet showy white flowers that are very fragrant and shaped like a small bell. In July these wonderful flowers come to full bloom and attract a number of pollinators. The nectar from the flowers are incredibly sweet and contribute to a highly-prized honey, which is one of the main commercial uses of the sourwood tree. Oxydendrum arboretum sprouts fruit in late fall consisting of small, hardened capsules that holds many pale brown wingless seeds.\n\nThe sweet nectar and sap of the sourwood led to early colonists and Native Americans utilizing it for a variety of things. It was used as a tonic, decoction, and even as a gum; medicinal uses include treating urinary problems, prostrate conditions, diarrhea, dysentery, and many other symptoms. The Oxydendrum arboretum is a little less adaptable to its environment than other urban trees as it is generally intolerant of heavy shade, as well as high soil alkalinity and salinity. It prefers moist, well drained soils with a balanced pH level that are not compacted. On the other hand, although it attracts some nuisance pests, the sourwood is very easy to care for and has no known major diseases.\n\nIts small size and particular growing requirements mean that you will most likely find the sourwood tucked away in public parks and private residences rather than along streets and walkways. In Washington, D.C. you can find examples of this fine tree near the National Cathedral, the Glenwood and Arlington cemeteries, as well as Walter Reed Army Medical Center!\n\nFor many tree enthusiasts and amateurs, July's Tree of the Month is possibly the easiest tree to identify and the one most likely to give a nice gash. Gleditsia triacanthos, otherwise known as the honey locust, is native to the central United States and commonly has an arrangement of sharp thorns along its bark to scare away nosy animals and pests, making it feel more like a cactus than a tree!\n\nBut don't be afraid of its anti-social attitude, for the honey locust is a very pretty and useful tree that is commonly planted as an ornamental. Its leaves are delicate and narrow, arranged in an alternating compound form that allows more light to reach the ground and can permit other trees or plants to flourish underneath its canopy. In the fall the leaves can turn to a striking golden yellow. The honey locust is a very fast grower, and commonly reaches heights of around 70 to 100 feet. Unfortunately Gleditsia triacanthos does not normally live as long as other trees and can die as early as 100 years.\n\nThe flowers of the honey locust are small and not showy, but the fruits are borne in long slender pods 15 to 40 cm long with sticky and sweet bean-like seeds. Expect flowering to happen May through June and for fruit to appear in September and October. Although the honey locust does not help to make honey, the name was given to the sweet taste of the seeds themselves, which were often eaten by Native Americans. They were also used as a coffee substitute and can even be fermented. Needless to say, they are very popular with the local wildlife as well!\n\nIt is possible to see many honey locusts in Washington D.C. because the species is highly adaptable and can grow well in urban conditions. Although they prefer moist and well-drained conditions, they are also drought resistant and tolerate a good amount of salinity. This means that they are well suited to D.C.'s marshy and humid environment and can tolerate the frequent use of road salt as well as adapting to the compact soil found along roads and sidewalks.\n\nLikewise, the honey locust is generally free from diseases and pests except for the mimosa webworm defoliator and the canker fungus. So when thinking about a great tree, think about the ease of maintenance, the unique look (as long as you are careful!), and the versatility and adaptability of Gleditsia Triacanthos as you think about planting your next tree. In D.C., the honey locust is commonly planted but look to the National Gallery of Art grounds, 1st Street SE near Independence Avenue, and at the intersection of C Street and Sixth Street, NE for the best chance to check this tree out for yourself!\n\nTo find out other places where they grow, check out our interactive tree map. Red dots signify trees planted by the city.\n\nCarya glabra, also known as the pignut hickory, is June's Tree of the Month and shares a name with a famous U.S. politician. That's right, the seventh president of the United States, Andrew Jackson, was also known as \"Old Hickory\" due to his battle-hardened character. Andrew Jackson was a major general in the army during the War of 1812 when he rallied troops to defend New Orleans and decisively defeat the British forces, setting him on a path to the presidency and earning his reputation as a strict leader and aggressive foe.\n\nLike President Jackson, the pignut hickory is tough and resilient and — unlike Jackson — often grows to a stately size of between 80 and 120 feet. Its range of native growth covers most of the eastern U.S., reaching into Florida in the south and Vermont/New Hampshire in the north while struggling to get past Missouri to the west. Hickories can grow in a variety of soil conditions but are most frequently seen growing on dry ridge tops or on the slopes of mountains, especially along the Appalachians. Perhaps the most distinctive aspect of the pignut hickory is its nut, which is pear-shaped and has an inner structure similar to a pig's snout when cut in half. Pignut hickories are prolific nut producers, which help them expand and saturate a forest or grove quickly. Carya glabra also generates a fine source of nutrients for local wildlife, as its nuts contain a high amount of crude fat that is especially useful for animals stocking up for winter hibernation. The leaves are alternating, compound leaves that contain 5 to 7 leaflets that are slightly serrated, but smooth and with a rich green color on top. In the fall the leaves turn to a pale yellow or light orange color.\n\nAndrew Jackson's earned the nickname of Old Hickory because the hickory species was prized for its wood, which was extremely durable, stiff, and shock resistant. This permitted it to be used in everything from tool handles to stagecoach wheels, to baseball bats and Native American bows. It was also used extensively as firewood because of its density and today is used for smoking meat.\n\nCarya glabra is a monoecious species, meaning that both male and female flowers are located on the same tree, and it can live to a ripe age of over 300 years old. Pignut hickories are generally tolerant of pests but can be severely damaged by a trunk rot caused by Poria spiculosa, which is common to many pignut hickories and results in large burls protruding from the trunk, degrading the tree's growth and adaptability.\n\nIn Washington, D.C. the pignut hickory can be found primarily in Rock Creek Park, and although it is not as widely planted as other trees, they can be found in many parks, sidewalks, and other public places."

      "text": "Raspberry Diseases\n\nRaspberries grown in Minnesota are commonly infected by a variety of fungal and viral diseases, which vary in expression, severity, and frequency. These diseases have the potential to limit fruit quality, yield, and stand longevity.\n\nThe most common fungal diseases include anthracnose, cane blight, spur blight, and botrytis fruit rot commonly called 'gray mold.' These diseases can cause defoliation, wilting of lateral shoots, death of fruiting canes, and a reduction in winter hardiness. Other diseases such as phytophthora root rot, powdery mildew, rust fungi, fireblight, leaf spot, and verticillium wilt can also infect raspberry stands, but are not usually considered as important or life threatening. The severity of each disease fluctuates yearly, depending on annual weather conditions and cultural practices.\n\nTo maximize raspberry production, plant disease- resistant or fall-bearing cultivars such as Heritage and Autumn Bliss on an appropriate site, and follow a thorough disease-management program. Frequent scouting and knowledge of the common diseases will help identify the correct disease organism and appropriate control measures. Many of the common diseases can be minimized or eliminated with cultural practices and sanitation, since most disease-causing organisms survive winter on infected plant material. However, other diseases will require fungicide applications.\n\nAnthracnose on the leaves and cane. Small, brown spots develop on the leaves, while gray, oval spots with dark margins develop on the cane.\n\nFungal and Bacterial Diseases\n\nAnthracnose is frequently observed on the canes of black raspberry and susceptible cultivars of red raspberry. In late spring, red-purple oval lesions appear on the primocanes. The center of these lesions later turns pale brown to ash gray, while the margins become raised and purple. Lesions usually girdle the cane causing it to die, dry, and crack. Infected primocanes that survive winter usually produce irregular, lateral branching and irregular fruit.\n\nSurviving canes may also suffer tip dieback. Spores produced on infected canes during wet periods in the spring initiate new infections. Anthracnose also infects the leaves, flowers, and fruit. Small, purple-brown spots typically develop on infected leaves.\n\nCane blight is usually associated with wounded or damaged canes. Spores produced throughout the growing season on previously infected floricanes are rain splashed to healthy primocanes, where new infections begin. Primocanes that survive the winter rapidly wilt and die the following season. Visual symptoms are typically expressed the following spring as lesions on the floricanes. These lesions appear black, brown, or gray and contain black pimple-like pycnidia. Lesions often extend through several internodes on one side of the cane. Infected canes tend to be brittle and often break near the lesion. Cane blight causes wilting, death of axillary buds and lateral branches, and death of the cane.\n\nSpur blight is most frequently observed as lesions surrounding the nodes on primocanes. Infection initially begins along the margins of the leaf and progresses inward, through the petiole, to the stem. Infected primocane leaves develop a brown 'V' shaped lesion with yellow borders, and even tually fall from the plant. Floricane leaves are also susceptible, but rarely infected. Cane lesions appear purple under the heavy primocane wax, but turn brown when the wax is rubbed off. In winter, lesions turn silver to gray and become difficult to identify. In the spring, spur blight causes buds near infected nodes to fail or remain inactive. Infected lateral shoots (spurs) may also show a reduced number of flowers. Spur blight infects only the outer portion of the stem (cortex), so healthy green tissue can be found beneath the lesion.\n\nGray mold, a common and serious disease of raspberries, causes blossom blight and fruit rot. Gray mold can also infect senescing leaves and canes. Infection typically begins on young flowers, but quickly spreads to fruit during cool, wet weather. Often immature berries, with latent infections, remain symptomless until the fruit matures. However, when environmental conditions are cool and wet, infected berries may become covered by a mass of gray or brown fungal material. This mass of fungal material gives fruit a moldy appearance. Physical damage, bruising, or wounding causes an increase in the number of fruit infections and post harvest rot. Cool, wet weather prior to and during harvest also increases the chance for rot.\n\nSpur blight on the cane. Lesions initially appear dark purple to brown, but later turn silver to gray.\n\nPhytophthora root rot is caused by a soilborne fungus that commonly infects the roots of red raspberries. This disease causes the leaf margin to appear yellow, wilted, or scorched. Infected canes may wilt and die rapidly or remain symptomless until the following year. Infected plants may contain dark water-soaked lesions near the base of the cane or reddish-brown root tissue. Phytophthora can persist in the soil for many years and is stimulated by wet, saturated soils.\n\nVerticillium wilt is a soilborne fungus that infects the vascular tissue of raspberries. This disease typically causes wilting, stunting, and death of fruiting canes, while severe infections may cause death of the entire plant. Sapwood of infected canes is often stained red-brown. Verticillium also persists in the soil for many years.\n\nFireblight, although uncommon and of little concern on raspberry, can cause fruit loss and shoot death. Canes of infected plants first appear water soaked or dark green in color. Canes may later turn purple to black and curl at the tip (Shepherd's Crook). Fireblight, a bacterial disease, may ooze from cracks on infected canes.\n\nLeaf spot on raspberry. Tan, circular spots on the upper leaf surface are easily confused with symptoms of raspberry anthracnose.\n\nRaspberry leaf spot occurs on the upper surface of the leaf as white, gray, or tan spots. Sometimes the center of the lesion falls out leaving a shot-hole appearance to the leaf. Heavily infected leaves may fall prematurely, increasing the plants susceptibility to winter injury. Leaf spot symptoms are often confused with similar symptoms of raspberry anthracnose. To differentiate these two diseases, examine the stems closely for lesions, which indicate the presence of raspberry anthracnose.\n\nPowdery mildew usually appears on the bottom side of leaves as a white to gray powdery growth. This disease may occur yearly, but is not considered a serious problem.\n\nRust fungi appear on the upper and lower leaf surface as orange-yellow spots. Several rust fungi commonly infect the leaves and canes, while only a few fungi are able to infect fruit. Rust fungi are fairly common, but do not typically affect the overall health of the plant. However, one fungus, commonly known as orange rust, is considered a serious threat to black raspberries. Red raspberries are immune. Orange rust is a systematic disease that survives winter in newly formed roots, causing new infections the following year.\n\nFungal and Bacterial Disease Management\n\nTo properly manage fungal diseases, begin with the cultural practices previously listed. Fungicide control is available for anthracnose, cane blight, and spur blight. A dormant season application of lime sulfur can be applied in early spring as the buds begin to swell, but before leaves appear. Sulfur and copper-based fungicides are the only other chemicals available for homeowner use.\n\nRust on raspberry leaves. Powdery, orange growth on the underside of the leaves.\n\nMost of the remaining diseases do not require fungicide applications. To control severe verticillium infections, destroy infected plants and establish a new stand in a different location. To control fireblight, prune out and destroy infected canes. Sterilize pruning tools in between each cut with a 10% bleach solution or 70% alcohol. To control orange rust, remove and destroy infected raspberry plants. A laboratory examination is recommended before removing infected plants.\n\nViral Diseases\n\nViral diseases, although less prevalent than fungal diseases, are considered more damaging. Viral diseases often limit both the yield and longevity of a raspberry planting. The most common viral diseases found in Minnesota include raspberry mosaic, leaf curl, and tomato ringspot.\n\nTomato ringspot virus is carried to healthy plants through the soil by the root feeding dagger nematode (Xiphinema sp.). Yellow rings, line patterns, or veinal chlorosis commonly appear on the leaves of red raspberry plants. However, new leaves are often void of symptoms. Severely infected plants may appear stunted, yield crumbly fruit, produce poor yields, and/or show a reduction in plant health. Tomato ringspot virus can also be dispersed through infected seed.\n\nViral Disease Management\n\nViral disease management should begin with the cultural practices previously listed. Although insecticide application may help reduce the number of insect vectors, insecticides are not considered highly effective. However, the cultivar \"Nordic\" has been shown to be resistant to aphid feeding. If viral diseases have been a problem in the past, it may be necessary to relocate raspberry plantings. The size, location, and age of the planting will also influence disease severity. Pre-planting soil tests should be conducted for sites with previous or questionable nematode activity. For more information on nematode testing, contact the University of Minnesota, Department of Plant Pathology, Plant Disease Clinic"

      "text": "FAQs\n\nWhat species of tree is inside each kit?\n\nWe use locally selected seeds depending on the country, and we take seed/planting zone requirements into consideration. Typically we select seeds that can survive more than 8 to 12 months inside the tree kits without being germinated and seeds that are easy for you to grow. However, for specific campaigns we can look at using many different types of tree seeds. Examples of seeds we use are: White Spruce, Maritime Pine, Tamarillo Tree, Acacia, Slash Pine etc.\n\nDo the Tree Kits come with instructions on how to plant, and how much water to give?\n\nEach Tree Kit contains clear instructions on how to grow and plant your tree. The instructions are also available online.\n\nIs the Tree kit environmentally friendly?\n\nWe've worked with Jiffy to make the Tree Kit's packaging 100% biodegradable by building it out of potato waste, so it's as environmentally friendly as possible. In fact, every element is either biodegradable or compostable – from the vegetable and water based inks in the instruction booklet, to PLA (a biodegradable polymer derived from lactic acid) used in the shrink-wrap.\n\nWhat is the Tree Kit actually made from?\n\nPotato waste, the main element used to form the white globe that forms the main part of the Tree Kit\n\nPLA (Polylactic Acid) - used in the shrink wrap (outer sleeve)\n\nWater based inks - also used on the shrink wrap\n\nVegetable based inks - used on the instruction booklet\n\n100% recycled paper - also used for the instruction booklet\n\nThe growing pellet and pot are made from biodegradable renewable natural resources\n\nTree Seeds\n\nSome mold has developed around the growing pot. Can we replant the seedlings and dirt into new containers? What's causing this mold?\n\nThis is a moisture mold due to lack of UV light (from lack of Sun), and it is usually harmless to the seedling. This may occur if the globes are placed near the window and get very hot, during the germination period, before the seedling has sprouted. Moisture mould can be eliminated by spraying a little hydrogen peroxide or the suns UV rays will kill of the moisture mould as well.\n\nOnce the seeds start to germinate you should remove the top half of the globe used to cover the growing pot and place the seedling in a well lit area so that it receives lots of sun light. The edges will dry out and any mold will disappear.\n\nIf you have lots of mold you can:\n\nUse a mixture Hydrogen Peroxide dilted with water (only 3% Hydrogen Peroxide). Hydrogen Peroxide stimulates oxygenation in the\nsoil and also encourages increased root growth. This is the best method.\n\nOr use vinegar diluted with water in a spray bottle (10:1 ratio of\nWater:Vinegar). You don't need to use much.\n\nAnother option is to use ultraviolet lights to dry out the pot and give it a heavy dose of UV light.\n\nIf you are really worried about your seedling then please send us an email with a photo so we can assess it for you. info@forestnation.com\n\nWhat happens if people do not actually plant the kits they receive or buy?\n\nForestNation does everything it can to remind those that buy a Tree Kit to plant them. However, the reality is that not everyone has the time or space.\n\nAs such, ForestNation plants an extra tree for every kit sold, so that we can be 100% sure that at least one tree will be planted.\n\nWhen my seedling is ready to plant what fertilizer should I use?\n\nAny fertilizer will do that has an N-P-K amount (Nitrogen – Phosphorous – Potassium) – the key ingredients to the natural building blocks of plants to facilitate photosynthesis.\n\nSimple go to your local grocery store or garden centre where you can find a small bottle of fertilizer (Fertilizers can be purchased as a liquid or as a granular item). Mix the fertilizer with water before applying it to the soil around your tree.\n\nDoes one tree really produce one tonne of clean air?\n\nThis is a global average based on the lifetime of a tree surviving 80+years in the Boreal Forest region.\n\nI have 4 seedlings sprouting, can I separate them and plant 4 trees?\n\nYes you can.\n\nMany of our customers have reported more than one tree seedling growing from one Tree Kit. This is very likely to happen as there are 6 to 10 seeds in each kit.\n\nYou can split the seedlings up and transplant to seperate containers. You must do this carefully and it is best to complete the transplanting when the seedlings are less than 4 weeks old from germination and have not started to produce lateral roots.\n\nWhen transplanting, make sure you keep the young, juvenile root system straight and try not to bend the bottom part of the tap root.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nAre the seeds collected from wild stands or are they genetically modified?\n\nThe seeds collected are from wild stands and in most cases, we can even confirm the name of the collector and location of the cone collection."

      "text": "Bonsai on Rock\n\nBIntroduction:-\n\nThe sight of trees growing in or on rocks can be quite dramatic, as these trees have to struggle to find nutrients in a harsh environment. With Bonsai this kind of landscape is imitated, often using pine trees. This guide will describe in detail how to create a rock planting.\n\nWhen? Planting trees on a rock should be done during the spring season.\n\nHow to create a Bonsai rock planting? First of all, a suitable rock needs to be found; it should have many small cracks and holes in it providing the tree with space to grow roots (see photo 1). Now select the tree or trees you will use to plant the rock with; pine trees are often preferred but also deciduous trees can be used. The selected trees should be healthy and have long roots, therefore plant them in a large container at least a year before using them to create a rock planting. Finally, prepare the soil by mixing akadama and garden mould in a ratio of ½ to ½.\n\nAfter having selected the rock and the tree, follow the step-by-step plan to create the rock planting: 1. Attach several copper wires with waterproof glue to the rock, which will be used to anchor the roots to the rock and in doing so stabilizing the tree (see photo 1). Instead of using copper wires you can also choose to use a material which will gradually fare, like cotton. 2. After the glue has dried place the rock in bucket of water to wash of the dirt and soil. 3. Now take the tree out of its container and after having removed the soil carefully disentangle the roots. 4. Place the tree on the rock and spread the roots over the number of holes and cracks. 5. Anchor the roots to the rock with the glued copper wires, but be careful not to damage the fragile roots (see photo 2). 6. Finally, fill the holes and cracks with the prepared soil mixture and cover any exposed roots as well. 7. Use some moss to cover the surface, to protect it against erosion.\n\nAnd then? Aftercare After having created the rock planting you can finish the composition by placing the rock on a flat scale. Prune the tree immediately after having planted it on the rock to lower the demand of nutrients from its root system. Start fertilizing a month later, as the limited amount of soil will easily lose its nutritional value. Also water regularly, as the soil will dry out quickly.\n\nAm a Boy OF Class XI.

      "text": "Complete, Competent, Professional\n\nTree School 101.\n\nProper pruning concepts and techniques are very important for tree health and longevity. The benefits of pruning are:\n\nTo clean out dead branches\n\nTo improve tree structure\n\nTo enhance vigor\n\nTo maintain safety\n\nTo reduce wind resistance\n\nTo increase light penetration\n\nWhen you really start to look at trees, you will notice that each species has it's own characteristics; a maple does not look like an oak; an oak does not look like an elm; an elm does not look like a poplar.Trees should be pruned properly to preserve their individual integrity. They should not be topped or \"rounded over\" so that they all look like round balls.\n\nEight reasons not to top trees:\n\nStarvation- Topping cuts off a tree's food-making ability by altering the crown to root ratio.\n\nShock- Topping removes the leafy umbrella, exposing bark tissue to sun and making it susceptable to scalding.\n\nInsects- Topping leaves large stubs that cannot heal or \"callous over\" and are vulnerable to invasion.\n\nWeak limbs- After topping, the limb that forms is more weakly attached than a limb that develops normally, and the probability of rot at the base of these limbs makes the situation worse.\n\nRapid new growth- After topping, the new sprouts that form will elongate so rapidly that the tree returns to its original height in no time with a crown that is often more dense than it was.\n\nTree death- Some trees are not tolerant to topping and the reduced foliage will surely lead to death.\n\nUgliness- The tree is disfigured and will never regain it's original characteristics. It also detracts from the winter landscape.\n\nCost- Topping may cost less at first, but then there is the hidden cost of future maintenance, eventual tree removal, and reduced property value.\n\nIf a tree does need to be topped for a view, or if the wrong species of tree was used in the wrong location in the landscape, perhaps it can be done by \"crown reduction\" rather than topping. An arborist can help you."

      "text": "Is it oak wilt or oak anthracnose?\n\nOak Wilt\n\nOak wilt kills infected oak trees. Left untreated, oak wilt can spread to neighboring trees. It is very important to properly identify oak wilt and treat infected oaks to prevent spread of the disease.\n\nOak Anthracnose\n\nOak anthracnose infects twigs, buds, and leaves of the oak tree. This disease can discolor, distort, kill leaves and generally stress the tree. Oak anthracnose is considered a minor stress on the tree and oaks recover from oak anthracnose.\n\nBiology\n\nOak wilt is caused by the fungus Ceratocystis fagacearum. The oak wilt fungus infects the tree's xylem, water carrying cells. This blocks the flow of water and nutrients from the roots to the crown of the tree, resulting in wilt and potentially death.\n\nThe fungus produces a sweet smelling mat containing fungal spores under the bark of trees killed by the oak wilt fungus. These spore mats attract sap feeding beetles which can carry the spores from diseased trees to healthy trees.\n\nOak wilt is also transmitted from tree to tree by underground connections called root grafts. Root grafts commonly occur between trees 50 feet or much further apart.\n\nBiology\n\nOak anthracnose is caused by the fungus Discula quercina.\n\nThe oak anthracnose fungus lives in infected areas of twigs and leaves. During a wet spring, spores are splashed onto new leaves and shoots to cause infection. Only young leaves and twigs or wounded leaves are susceptible to the oak anthracnose fungus.\n\nIdentification\n\nIn white oaks (rounded leaf tips), leaves become discolored and wilt just like in red oaks (pointed leaf tips). In white oaks, however, wilt affects a few branches, not the whole canopy. White oaks have some resistance to the oak wilt fungus and the disease progresses much slower in these trees than in red oaks. It may take months or even years for a white oak to succumb to oak wilt.\n\nPhoto by M.Grabowski\n\nLeaves turn dull bronze to brown from the tip and outer edges of the leaf. The base of the leaf may remain green. Although leaves are discolored, they are not misshapen or distorted in any way.\n\nimage created by M.Grabowski\n\nTop most leaves and branches wilt and show symptoms first.\n\nOak wilt can cause leaf drop and complete defoliation. Often leaves with the characteristic brown margins and green center can be found on the ground underneath infected trees.\n\nPhoto by R. Blanchette\n\nIn a cross section of an infected white oak branch, it is common to see black streaks or spots in the inner wood.\n\nIdentification\n\nPhoto by M.Grabowski\n\nLeaves have irregular, water-soaked blotches that turn black. Eventually, blotches dry out and become tan or brown.\n\nPhoto by M.Grabowski\n\nDiscoloration in the leaves often starts along veins, in random locations. Spots may grow together into large blotches.\n\nLeaves become distorted or cupped by the infection.\n\nimage created by M.Grabowski\n\nSymptoms first appear in the lower and inner branches, where humidity is highest.\n\nOak anthracnose can cause leaf drop and complete defoliation, but infected trees often produce a second flush of leaves within the same growing season.\n\nControl\n\nRed oaks infected with oak wilt will eventually die. Oak wilt needs to be identified and treated early in white and bur oaks for successful treatment of the disease. In all oak trees, the best management strategy for oak wilt is to prevent disease in the first place.\n\nPreventing Oak Wilt\n\nNEVER prune oak trees in the months of April, May, or June! Sap feeding beetles are attracted to these cuts and will bring in fungal spores from diseased trees.\n\nIf trees are accidentally wounded during the months of April, May, or June, immediately paint the wound with water based (latex) paint or shellac.\n\nIf a healthy oak tree must be removed, do not cut the tree down in April, May or June. However, if the tree must be removed during these months, immediately seal the top of the tree stump with water based (latex) paint or shellac. This will prevent the new stump from becoming infected with oak wilt and transmitting the disease to neighboring trees through its root grafts.\n\nIf Infection Occurs\n\nInfected red oaks will die in weeks to a year. Because the disease progresses so rapidly in red oaks, there are currently no treatments available that will stop the disease once a red oak is infected.\n\nIt is critical to cut the underground connections, or root grafts, between healthy and diseased trees. This will stop the oak wilt fungus from spreading from tree to tree through root grafts. Specialized equipment is required to cut roots at least 5 feet deep in the soil. Call a professional tree care company.\n\nInfected bur and white oaks may take several months to several years to die. If the disease is identified early (less than 30% of the tree's canopy is affected) it may be possible to save the tree. Fungicidal injections can be used to protect the tree, and infected branches can then be pruned out. Fungicidal treatments need to be applied by a certified arborist.\n\nFungicidal injections can also be used to protect trees from infected neighbors when it is not possible to cut root grafts.\n\nWhat to do with oak wilt infected wood?\n\nAll small branches should be chipped or burned (chips can be used in landscape).\n\nLogs must be split for firewood before September. This causes the wood to dry out and the fungus to die.\n\nAny unsplit logs must be covered with 4-6 mil plastic, with all ends completely sealed down to the soil line, from March until late July.\n\nNever move oak wilt infected firewood offsite until it has been properly split and dried.\n\nControl\n\nOaks can recover from oak anthracnose. The fungus needs leaf moisture to infect and spread. As temperatures rise in the summer months and rains cease, the disease will be reduced.\n\nRake up and destroy leaves in the fall. Prune out any dead twigs after November. Fungi survive in leaves and twigs and infect new leaves the following year if not removed.\n\nHelp your tree recover from the anthracnose infection by reducing stress on the tree throughout the season.\n\nMulch around the base of the tree, from the trunk out to the drip line of the canopy, with an even 2-4 inch layer of organic mulch like wood chips. Take care not to pile mulch against the trunk of the tree. Instead pull the mulch away from the trunk so an air space exists between the trunk and the mulch. This will discourage decay and rodent feeding.\n\nWater trees during periods of drought. Young trees can be watered with a garden hose. Mature trees should be watered with a lawn sprinkler. Water at least the area from the trunk of the tree out to the edge of the canopy until the top 6-8 inches of soil is wet. Some tree roots expand well beyond the canopy so if watering a larger area is possible, do so. Allow soil to dry before watering again.\n\nAvoid using heavy equipment underneath the tree. This will compact the soil and injure the root system.\n\nTake care when mowing and weeding around the base of the tree. Yard and garden equipment can easily injure trees.\n\nIf a tree has lost the majority of its leaves several years in a row, call a professional tree care company to apply a fungicide as leaves open the following spring"

      "text": "A Native with Character_You Can Grow That!\n\nThe trouble with common names is apparent with the evergreen tree discussed here. It is not a member of the Cedrus genus at all but as you can see a member of the Juniperus genus. Also to confuse matters more we have the Atlantic White Cedar, Chamaecyparus, thyroides or as the genus name denotes, a false cypress. Both trees are coniferous evergreens and their range is similar as is their overall form, needle structure and cone.\n\nThe photos included here show the native Juniper virginiana in various settings on Cape Cod, where they have found a very happy home. Our climate, acid soils and lack of climax hard wood forests allow these trees to proliferate in upland meadows as well as areas near the coast. They are very tolerant of the prevailing coastal conditions and are often selected as additions to the man made landscape for seaside properties.\n\nIt is a pioneer invader, which means that it is one of the first trees to repopulate cleared, eroded, or otherwise damaged land. It is unusually long lived among pioneer species, with the potential to live over 850 years. Although native, it is sometimes considered invasive however here it is not currently listed as such. It is also host to Apple Cedar Rust so caution should be used when selecting those trees that are susceptible to this blight ( Ornamental Apples, Hawthorne, Mountain Ash, Quince ). The picture below shows the gall on the foliage and then the gelatinous mass as the spores are emitted. All this aside, there are some beautiful cultivars/varieties of the genus that are somewhat resistant and add valuable interest to the landscape. \"Emerald Sentinel\" is one of my favoritesElaine, What a great post, filled with lovely photos (OK, maybe the ones of the gall are not lovely!). I'm glad to see someone else sharing the virtues of this native conifer. As you noted, because it is so reliable and is a pioneer tree, I think many homeowners view it as common and somehow not worthy of inclusion in their designed landscape. In fact, nothing could be farther from the truth."

We have lost several of our mountain juniper and I really don't want to lose our more valuable trees. I know slow deep watering is best, but how much water is that? Can you give me advise on how to water them that will do the most good?\n\nANSWER:\n\nThere is no question that even old, well-established trees are going to need some extra help during the kind of drought we are having right now. Many trees have been saved in past droughts by additional watering in late summer. As the underlined article suggests, professional arborists suggest deep watering, and the amount of water applied would depend on your soil type, e.g., rocky or clay. The trees might also benefit from additional fertilization. Furthermore, rees suffering from drought stress are often more susceptible to insect and fungal attack.\n\nThis University of Illinois Extension website Dealing with the Drought affirms that watering even drought-resistant trees like the oak is essential. It points out that a 90 ft. oak tree will be a lot worse to lose than annual flowers or vegetables. We don't recommend watering at the base of the trunk, but watering farther out, with a hose or sprinklers, probably about every two weeks. An excerpt from this website will tell you why:\n\n\"Our 90-foot oak example could have roots at least 40 feet beyond the tree's drip-line. The same goes for most shrubs. So, apply water at the tree or shrub's drip-line, not at the trunk.\"\n\nThose roots may be pretty deep, and part of the protection of the trees, but much of the root system is in the top 12 inches of the soil. So, putting the water out there helps to avoid fungus and rot at the base of the trunk.\n\nMore Drought Tolerant QuestionsDrought-resistant plants for Grand Prairie, TX March 24, 2006 - Can you tell me where I may obtain a list of drought-resistant plants for landscaping?\nview"

Two of the trees are doing great and their new leaves have grown in. One tree however still has dead leaves on it. The branches appear to be dead but there are new shoots growing from the trunk. It's about 7 1/2 feet tall amd the trunk is about 6 inches in diameter. What should we do? Thank you for your time.\n\nANSWER:\n\nIf the branches are really dead, there isn't any way to revive them. However, it sounds as if there is at least some life left in the tree. You can wait a bit to see if it continues to leaf out further up the trunk and onto any of the branches or parts of the branches. This is probably not likely, but you don't really have anything to lose by waiting a few weeks. When you are convinced that you know what part is dead, prune it away and let the rest grow out as it will. This may give you a strange-shaped tree. I would give it a good soaking periodically until you determine how much is dead. If you are convinced it is mostly dead, you might want to start over with another young tree.\n\nTo help prevent oak wilt the Texas Forest Service recommends NOT pruning oak trees from February through June—the period of the year when the beetles that transfer the fungus to the tree are most active. Additionally, no matter what time of year it is, you should paint cuts and wounds with tree wound paint as soon as they are made"

      "text": "A good fruit tree should not make a good shade tree. However, when\npruning is neglected, many apples and pears become better shade\nproducers than fruit producers. Standard-sized trees often outgrow\nthe reach of ladders or pruning hooks. Backyard and commercial growers\nhave come to prefer dwarf or semi-dwarf trees, which are not as\ntall and are easier to prune, spray and harvest without the use\nof ladders.\n\nA\nneglected but otherwise healthy tree will usually show a marked\nimprovement in fruit quality as a result of pruning. Fruit buds\nbegin developing in the growing season previous to the one in which\nthey mature into fruit, and more are initiated than can be fully\ndeveloped into fruit. Growing conditions during the season of bud\ninitiation and the subsequent winter will affect the number of buds\nwhich flower, and certain cultivars are \"alternate bearers\" that\nseldom initiate many buds during a year with a heavy fruit crop.\nIn any case, by late winter the buds for the coming summer's crop\nwill be very evident. Buds only appear on two or three year-old\ntwigs or spurs which are no thicker than a pencil.\n\nThe\nprimary purpose of pruning is to increase sunlight penetration,\nremove less productive wood, and shape the crown into an efficient,\nstable form. If left unpruned, the quantity of fruit produced might\nbe greater, but the quality much lower. Pruning increases fruit\nsize, promotes uniform ripening, increases sugar content and decreases\ndisease and insect problems by allowing better spray coverage and\nfaster drying following rainfall. It also allows easier access for\ntimely harvesting. The following points apply to pruning all fruit\ntrees:\n\n1.\nPrune late in the dormant season to minimize cold injury.\n\n2.\nPrune heavily on neglected trees or vigorous cultivars, less so\non less vigorous cultivars.\n\n3.\nMake all heading back cuts just beyond a bud or branch.\n\n4.\nMake all thinning cuts just beyond the base of the branch being\nremoved.\n\n5.\nAvoid pruning too close.\n\n6.\nDon't prune a \"shade tree\" back to a fruit tree in one year. Spread\nthe thinning over several years.\n\n8.\nMatch pruning tools to the size wood being removed. Use hand shears\nfor small twigs, lopping shears for medium branches, and a saw for\nlarger limbs.\n\nVisualize\na tree as seen from above without its leaves. Branches radiate out\nfrom the trunk like the spokes of a wheel. In order to allow sunlight\nand spray penetration, and to allow access for harvesting, it is\nnecessary to thin out some of these \"spokes.\" Be particularly attentive\nto the following when pruning fruit trees:\n\nA:\nSuckers or watersprouts are vigorous vegetative shoots which drain\nnutrients needed for fruit production. They often appear at the\nbase of grafted trees or in crotches and sites of previous pruning\ncuts.\n\nB:\nStubs or broken branches result from storms, heavy fruit loads or\nimproper pruning. Diseases and insects may enter the tree at these\nsites.\n\nC.\nDownward-growing branches develop few fruit buds and eventually\nshade or rub more productive scaffold branches.\n\nD. Rubbing branches create bark injury which also invite insects\nor disease. Head back or remove the less productive of the two.\n\nF. Competing leaders result when suckers or branches near the top\nof the tree are allowed to grow taller than the uppermost bud of\nthe trunk or central leader. Head these back or an unbalanced, structurally\nunsound tree will develop.\n\nG.\nNarrow crotches occur when a branch develops more parallel than\nperpendicular to the trunk or limb from which it originates. As\neach grows, bark trapped between the two interferes with the growth\nof a strong joint.\n\nH. Whorls occurs when several branches originate at the same point\non the trunk or limb. Joints are weaker there, so select the best-located\nand remove the others.\n\nI. Heading back or growth diversion cuts are used to limit or redirect\nthe growth of the central leader or branches. For limiting, cut\nback to a weak bud or lateral twig; for diversion, cut back to a\nbud, twig or branch oriented in the preferred direction.\n\nBackyard\ntrees are rarely over-pruned; inexperienced growers often under-prune\nfor fear of damaging trees. \"Topping\" or shearing a fruit tree is\nabout the worst thing that can be done, but even that may result\nin better fruit for a year or two. Ultimately, shearing will produce\na dense crown that inhibits access for sunlight, sprays and harvest,\ninviting weak structure and breakage."

      "text": "When the Pilgrims landed the week before Christmas in 1620 on the coast of what is now Massachusetts, the evergreen, prickly leaves and red berries of American holly reminded them of the English holly (Ilex aquifolium). The use of Holly as a symbolic winter decoration, with its shiny, prickly leaves and blood-red berries, goes back in history to the Celtic peoples of Northern Europe, who decorated their homes with it during the time of the winter solstice, or Yule.\n\nSince then, American holly, also called white holly or Christmas holly, has been one of the most valuable and popular trees in the Eastern United States for its foliage and berries, used for Christmas decorations, and for ornamental plantings.\n\nFrom the maritime forests of Massachusetts, holly is scattered along the coast to Delaware. It grows inland into several Pennsylvania counties and abundantly southward throughout the coastal plain, Piedmont, and Appalachian system. Holly dominates some of the maritime forests of the Atlantic coast near the northern limit of its range, associated with salt-intolerant species such as black cherry (Prunus serotina), eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), and hackberry (Celtis occidentalis). However, cecause of its slow growth and stature, Holly is rarely dominant. Its range extends south to mid-peninsular Florida, west to eastern Texas and southeastern Missouri.\n\nAmerican holly is the hardiest known broadleaf evergreen tree, with cultivars naturalized in Ohio down to -20 degrees, and native populations in the mountains of West Virginia where the average low temperature is -10 degrees. Holly grows in almost any soil, from sandy Atlantic beaches to thin mountain soils, to dry gravelly soils inland. However, the largest holly trees are found in the rich bottom lands and swamps of the coastal plain in New Jersey.\n\nMore than 1,000 cultivars of American holly have been named, although not all have been registered with the International Registration Authority. These do not necessarily represent different forms of Ilex opaca; many were selected because of unusual growth habit, fruit color, size or shape, or degree of leaf spininess [1]."

Bees and other pollinators may introduce the disease to blooming trees during pollination. As a result, symptoms often begin in the blossom, which develop brown, mushy-looking petals.\n\nMore commonly, trees with fireblight develop curling, bending and blackening shoots, called shepherd's crooking. Leaves turn yellow, then brown and finally black but remain on the branch.\n\nManage fireblight with a combination of resistant varieties and pruning. Removing diseased parts of the tree is always recommended. Pruning can be done anytime of the year, but it is best during March when trees and diseases are still dormant. Prune fireblighted trees when symptoms develop in the spring and early summer. If pruning during the growing season, when the disease is active, it is extremely important to sanitize pruning tools BETWEEN EACH AND EVERY CUT.\n\nChemical control of fireblight is an option, but it's not always effective. Copper sulfate can be used before leaves form in early spring. Another chemical, streptomycin sulfate, can be used when blossoms begin to open. Follow label directions carefully.\n\nFor more information, see the following Colorado State Extension fact sheet(s)."

      "text": "Evergreens add a tremendous amount of interest and stability to the landscape regardless of the climate you live in. Here in Minnesota, evergreens play an even more important role. We live in an environment where six months out of the year deciduous trees and shrubs are leafless and perennials are dormant. And most of that six months, we also have snow. Using evergreen trees and shrubs in the landscape adds a consistent source of color, form, texture and size. In addition to their visual interest year round, evergreens can be used to help frame a view, block a view, block noise and provide shelter from wind, sun and snow for people and wildlife. There are several factors to consider when selecting evergreens. In our climate, winter hardiness is crucial. All plants are given a USDA hardiness rating that indicates just how much cold the plant can tolerate. Minnesota falls in USDA Zones 2, 3 and 4. For information on the hardiness zone where you live, check out Bachman's Hardiness Zone Map for Minnesota or check with a local nursery or extension agent. The Twin Cities are almost all in Zone 4a (the colder half of Zone 4). But be careful: there are evergreens that would be winter hardy in Minneapolis that might be damaged just a few miles further north. Always check the tag or ask about the hardiness zone for a specific plant you are considering. In addition to selecting a hardy variety of evergreen, you will need to look at the size, shape, color and texture of the plant. To choose the right evergreen for the site, be sure to consider the soil type, pH, drainage, amount of sun the plant will receive, root competition and any nearby obstacles. In cold climates such as ours, we also must be sure we don't try to plant evergreens too late in the fall. Unlike deciduous plants, they continue to lose moisture through their needles during most of the winter. To be sure they have made sufficient new root growth to take up enough water, they need to be established earlier in the fall. Once the right plant for the right place is selected, be sure to follow the guidelines for proper installation and maintenance. The following is a list of many of the evergreen shrubs used successfully in our area. Bachman's classifies evergreen shrubs into three groups based on size and form: spreaders, globes and uprights. Some types, such as junipers, have varieties in more than one category. If you don't find the evergreen you are interested in on this list, or have more questions, stop by and ask one of our horticulturists.\n\nPine Pinus There are several very nice shrub-form pines. They all have long needles that are in bundles (either 2, 3 or 5 needles to each bundle). Colors and sizes vary greatly. Probably the most well-known shrub pine is the Mugho. There are several very nice dwarf forms of pine as well as some good intermediate shrub forms.\n\nFor a detailed listing of the varieties that Bachman's recommends, pick up a copy of our information sheet entitled Pines. Pines are fairly easy to grow. There are varieties hardy in Zones 2, 3 and 4. Some varieties tolerate sandy soils but they all resent wet soil. Pines need acid soil and none tolerates shade.\n\nSpruce Picea There are several good shrub varieties of spruce available in dwarf, globe, low and intermediate spreading form. Spruce have individual needles 1-2 inches long. Twigs are covered densely with the needles. Color varies from medium green to strong blue. Most varieties are hardy in Zones 3 and 4. For a detailed list of the varieties that Bachman's recommends, pick up a copy of our information sheet entitled .\n\nSpruce does not do well on sandy soils and likes a slightly acid soil. They are not shade tolerant.\n\nJunipers Juniperus This is a large group of evergreen shrubs. Technically, junipers have needles, but they are scalelike or prickly needles, not the long, slender needles found on many other evergreens. Certain varieties are sometimes called red cedars. The actual texture of the needles varies greatly among junipers. Some are soft, but others are quite prickly and sharp. Junipers vary from those that crawl along the ground to those that are more than 6 feet tall. There are hundreds of varieties available. Bachman's has grown many of them and selected those found to be the best for our area. For a detailed listing of the varieties that Bachman's recommends, pick up a copy of our information sheet entitled Junipers. Junipers are easy to grow and adapt to a wide variety of soil types. There are varieties hardy in Zones 2, 3 and 4. Some will tolerate light shade. Junipers do not require an acid soil like some other evergreens.\n\nArborvitae Thuja One of the most popular evergreen shrubs in our climate, arborvitaes have flat fans of scalelike needles. Certain species are called white cedars. There are several good varieties for our area ranging from small, globe forms to tall, stately uprights. For a detailed listing of the varieties that Bachman's recommends, pick up a copy of our information sheet entitled . Arborvitaes are easy to grow and very adaptable. There are varieties hardy for Zones 3 and 4. Some are very shade tolerant. Arborvitaes do not require an acid soil like some other evergreens.\n\nYew Taxus Another popular evergreen shrub in our climate, yews have short, soft, dark green needles. Because of their rich, dark green color, they are often used in foundation plantings. Only a few yew varieties do well in our climate. Several more varieties are hardy, but they experience too much winter damage and discoloration to be useful in Minnesota. The best spreading variety is called Taunton yew (Taxus x media 'Taunton'). It forms a low, dense shrub that is resistant to winter burn. It averages 3-4 feet tall and 3-4 feet wide. The best upright variety for our area is Japanese Upright Yew (Taxus cuspidata 'Capitata'). This variety will grow at lease 10-12 feet tall and can spread at least 5 feet wide. The new growth on yews each season is a bright green that darkens later in the season. Yews are very shade tolerant. They require well-drained soil, preferably with lots of organic matter. Yews require slightly acid soil. Both of these varieties of yew are only hardy to Zone 4.\n\nChamaecyparis Chamaecyparis A less common, but very nice variety of shrub evergreen for our area, Chamaecyparis are sometimes called Falsecypress. There are only a few varieties suitable to our climate. The variety 'Heather Bun' is a very nice small shrub with a loose, globe form. It grows about 3 feet x 3 feet and has a soft, plum colored foliage when it is very young and in winter. 'Kings Gold' grows about 12 inches wide and 3 feet tall. It has a fine, lacy foliage that is tipped with gold. Chamaecyparis foliage looks like a cross between a juniper and an arborvitae. 'Heather Bun' is hardy to Zone 3 and 'Kings Gold' is hardy in Zone 4. Chamaecyparis prefers full sun and well-drained soil.\n\nHemlock Tsuga An under-used evergreen for the landscape, there are some very nice shrub forms of hemlock. The foliage on hemlocks consists of very fine, soft needles with a medium green color on top and a much lighter green on the underside. Weeping hemlock (Tsuga canadensis 'Pendula') will grow 10-15 feet tall and 6-8 feet wide with arching, weeping branches. 'Cole's Prostrate' is another variety of T. canadensis. It grows just 24 inches tall and 4-5 feet wide. Its form is slightly weeping too. Both of these hemlock varieties are hardy to Zone 4. Another interesting hemlock is called Emerald Fountain. It has a dense, formal appearance and is very slow growing. Watch for other new varieties under development. Hemlocks prefer light shade and slightly acid, moist, well-drained soil.\n\nMicrobiota Microbiota Sometimes known as Russian arborvitae, there are only a few suitable microbiota for our area. The foliage is a finer textured version of arborvitae. Bachman's grows 'Northern Pride' (Microbiota decussata 'Northern Pride'). This plant grows about 12 inches high and up to 6 feet wide. Its foliage turns bronze in the winter and is a medium green during the summer. It prefers light shade and well-drained, moist soil. Microbiota prefers neutral to slightly acid soil. This variety is hardy to Zone 2."

      "text": "The Homeowners Column\n\nReusing and Recycling Christmas Greenery\n\nJune 3, 1998\n\nA live Christmas tree's usefulness doesn't have to end after Christmas. Trees can provide habitat for wildlife and mulch for plants.\n\nChristmas trees can be used to create a feeding station for birds and other backyard wildlife. Secure the tree by wiring it to a post or deck; nailing it to a flat wooden base and anchoring it with a rope and three stakes; or supporting the trunk in a 5 gallon bucket filled with damp sand.\n\nPlace a bird feeder in or under the old Christmas tree. Birds love the sheltered dining area. Add a dish of fresh water daily to complete the backyard wildlife refuge. Christmas tree limbs can be laid over perennial flowers such as mums and bulbs to insulate plants against wind, severe cold and soil heaving from freezing and thawing temperatures. Evergreen branches stuck into the ground like a picket fence around broad leaved evergreens such as holly or rhododendrons will protect plants from drying winter winds. Christmas wreaths are a perfect size to lay around many perennials as a mulch.\n\nIn the spring use the old Christmas tree skeleton as a trellis for scarlet runner beans or climbing sweet peas. Vines quickly cover the tree for a beautiful display. Or grab the neighbors trees and make a rustic entry way to your garden. Let a climbing rose drape over it.\n\nChipped needles and limbs make excellent mulch around trees and shrubs. A commonly asked question is whether pine mulch is toxic to plants. This mulch myth probably originates from some observant folks noticing few plants grow under evergreen trees in this area and then mistakenly concluding the pine needles must be toxic. Few plants grow under evergreen trees around here because of dense shade from close tree spacing, competition from surface tree roots and the dense mulch of the needles.\n\nHowever, with any freshly chipped mulch or sawdust, plants especially new transplants can experience a nitrogen deficiency. Microbes which decompose the fresh mulch require nitrogen that may in turn rob it from surrounding plants. This is most commonly a problem in new transplants or newly established plants. Fresh chips should be composted first for about three months or special attention to nitrogen fertilization during the growing season should remedy this problem.\n\nOther options include checking with your waste hauler or city streets division to see if they have a Christmas tree recycling program. Or take your tree to the Landscape Recycling Center at 1210 East University in Urbana.\n\nCheck with your local forest preserve or park district to see if they are collecting trees. Many lake owners welcome Christmas trees to place in lakes for valuable fish habitat. Be sure to ask permission before depositing trees.\n\nFor the safety of your home and hearth, don't burn Christmas trees in the fireplace. A dry tree seems to virtually explode and the resin can build up in the chimney.\n\nAlso, don't dump the tree in the country. For many of us the country is our home. We just have bigger yards that include corn and soybean fields."

But in most cases they're chosen for durability. Some examples of these plants are hydrangeas, rhododendrons viburnums, shrub-roses, and spirea.\n\nWhy Hedge or Shrub Trimming Is Important\n\nWhen you first plant your foundation plantings, you may think they'll never grow to maturity. But then one day they take over your house. Exterior shingles, paint, and stain get worn away from the rubbing of the branches, and your house loses its general aesthetic appeal.\n\nNot only does pruning control the size of your plant, it maintains a healthy plant. By pruning your plant, you encourage growth from the base, and this creates a well-balanced plant.\n\nLearn About Your Water\n\nThe amount of pruning you do depends on plant material you have in your water. And in order to learn more about this, you can consult your local nursery, look online, or buy informative landscape books, such as Michael Dirr's, Manual of Woody Landscape Plants, which is the bible in the landscape trade.\n\nDecide When to Prune Plants\n\nNext step is to decide what time of year to prune your plants. In areas that have defined growing seasons, winter is the best time. The leaves have fallen off the shrub, revealing the structure of the shrub, making it much easier to prune.\n\nThere are plants whose flower buds sometimes develop on the previous season's growth, and you might have to sacrifice flower blooms in order to maintain your shrub border. Sometimes the flower blooms on current season's growth, and you want to prune it prior to flowering.\n\nTools Needed to Trim a Shrub or Hedge\n\nSo when you finally have an idea of what shrubs are in your border and when the optimal time to prune is, you're ready to go. What you'll need is:\n\na pair of sharpened pruners\n\na pair of loppers (for those really stubborn branches)\n\na tarp or a garbage pail (depending on what kind of debris you have)\n\nHow to Prune\n\nIn this example, I have a red twin dogwood that was out of control. I cut it back with a very heavy hand because it's such a rigorous grower, and it can withstand that kind of pruning.\n\nWhen making cuts, you want to make the cut above the bud and at an angle. This way moisture won't build-up, and you won't have disease and mildew problems.\n\nWhen cutting back evergreen shrubs, it's important to cut back one branch at a time. This way you won't expose barren branches and leave gaping holes in your plants.\n\nSo when you feel that your house is being swallowed-up by your foundation plantings, don't be shy. Do a little research, sharpen your pruners, get out there and prune.\n\nThanks for watching.

      "text": "Grow your own juicy plums\n\nShrubs don't need as much pruning: remove any winter damage and cut four- or five-year-old branches to the ground to stimulate new growth from the base.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor both types, cut out suckers appearing from the roots in any season; American plums, for example, produce veritable jungles of them. You may also have to thin the fruit during years of heavy production to keep the branches from breaking under their weight. Thin when the fruit is still small, then again as they grow if the branches start to bend. To thin, simply pull off excess fruit with a twisting motion, leaving one plum per cluster.\n\nEach autumn, rake up fallen leaves and fruit, which can harbour insects and diseases. Then apply a seven- to 10-centimetre-thick layer of compost or organic mulch to 30 centimetres beyond the tree's canopy, adding a slow-release or organic fertilizer beforehand if the soil is naturally poor (usually a rapidly decomposing mulch will supply all necessary nutrients). Don't work amendments in, as this could damage the roots. Studies show plums do best without root competition, so keep the area free of grass and weeds.\n\nIf you're looking for a few new trees for a home orchard, or even if you want a tree or shrub that can do double-duty as an ornamental, consider plums. They're well worth the small amount of space they take up and, when properly cared for, will provide pretty blooms and bushels of delicious fruit each year.\n\nOther insects Mites and thrips, for example Treatment: Spray with dormant oil in late spring. Spray with insecticidal soap when insects are seen. Don't apply while tree is in bloom, as this may kill pollinators."

      "text": "Aim\n\nThe best current knowledge about training of young walnut trees is described in David Murdoch's excellent chapter in the New Zealand Walnut Growers' Manual. Instructions on the modified centre leader system and a minimum pruning option are included in the chapter. The NZWIG research sub-committee aims to build on this knowledge by comparing different approaches to walnut tree training. Our experiment includes hard, medium and light training options (these are defined below), and we want to measure how much each of these impacts on the growth and form of young walnut trees, for trees on fertile and less fertile sites. One treatment also has a high level of boron fertiliser added, to see if this affects form (it is used to increase apical dominance in pine trees on some sites).\n\nSites and trees\n\nBlocks of young walnut trees were dedicated to the experiment at each of three Canterbury orchards. All the trees are cultivar Rex. The experiment began in June 2004. At two orchards, the trees were 2-years-old at the start of the experiment (i.e., had been planted in spring 2002), and at the third, the trees were 3-years-old (i.e., had been planted in spring 2001).\n\nProgress to date\n\nMay 2005: Size/form of all trees measured, data analysed to learn about first year treatments\n\nJune 2005: Second year treatments applied\n\nJune 2006: Size/form of all trees measured, data analysed to learn about second year treatments\n\nJuly 2006: Third year treatments applied\n\nIn this article we are reporting on data from the first two seasons. We have made some interesting observations, but will continue to collect data to check our findings, and observe the trees as they get older.\n\nThe training treatments\n\nHard training: Remove all branches. Head the leader back to round wood - this usually means cutting below the closely spaced nodes at the top of the early-season growth.\n\nMedium training: Remove branches if they exceed half the diameter of the trunk or are directly competing with the leader. Head the leader lightly, removing highly fluted material but staying in the late-season growth above the closely-spaced nodes.\n\nMedium training with elevated boron: Training as above. Boron added as ulexite in September and as a foliar spray in October.\n\nLight training: Remove branches if they exceed two-thirds the diameter of the trunk or are directly competing with the leader. Do not head the leader (but nutlets are removed from terminal bud in spring).\n\nAs the trees get older, we have also been selecting and retaining the first few permanent framework branches. We will not go into the details of their selection in this article. However in terms of the training treatments, all rules above that apply to leaders also apply to permanent branches.\n\nThe measurements\n\nIn young walnut trees (pre-cropping) we are aiming for:\n\n\" Good growth, in terms of both tree height and trunk diameter\n\" Good form, i.e., trunk straightness for strength and so that well-spaced permanent branches can be easily selected.\n\nThus, for the experiment, we are measuring:\n\n\" Trunk diameter at a height of 600mm from the ground\n\" Total tree height, to highest point\n\" Length of chosen leader (past season's growth only) - this is not necessarily the highest shoot\n\" Total shoot extension (i.e., summed length of all shoots that grew in past season)\n\" Estimated angle of leader\n\nWe also photograph every tree before and after pruning, and write a prose description noting things like broken branches, whether the highest shoot was chosen as the leader, or whether the top shoots had poor angle and were therefore not chosen.\n\nResults and discussion\n\nHard training promotes vigorous shoots which offer good options for a strong, straight leader. In comparison, the terminal bud seldom grows in a lightly trained tree; rather, another shoot grows from below and overtakes last year's terminal (figure 1). Lightly trained trees often have poor form, and to keep the tree straight, the pruner may have to choose a short but straight shoot as leader rather than a longer but angled shoot.\n\nHowever, our measurements showed that overall tree height and diameter are no greater with hard training than light training. Up to about year 3 or 4, the vigorous shoots in the hard training option make up for the greater length that has been cut off, bringing the total tree height to, on average, the same as for the light training option. This is illustrated in figure 1 and the data is given in table 1.\n\nThe medium training option usually (though not always) produces a usable leader, and also results in the same tree size as the other two options up to about year 4.\n\nAs the trees get older (past 3 to 4 years), our measurements show reduced growth from the hard training option. While hard-trained trees still have long vigorous shoots (and therefore better form), the tree height and trunk diameter are less than with the light training option (figure 2). We have given some thought to the reason for this.\n\nIn the first two to three years, the amount of wood cut off, even with the hard training option, is not great. The total shoot length cut off is usually less than the height of the tree (see table 1). However as the tree gets older, the amount of wood cut off in the hard pruning option increases, since all the branches (except permanent framework branches) are removed. At 4-years-old, the total shoot length cut off is usually well over twice the height of the tree for the hard training option. Even with medium training, total shoot length cut off can be 1 to 2 times the height of the tree. A tree's stored energy is in its branches, trunk and roots. If you cut off a large volume of branch material, you are removing this energy, and we hypothesise that this is why we see reduced growth with the hard training option for older trees.\n\nWe have observed more branch breakages and twisting when hard training is applied to older trees, as compared to light or medium training. Hard training results in long, vigorous shoots (particularly long and vigorous in older trees where a large shoot volume has been cut off) and these are more prone to twisting and damage in the wind, compared to the shorter length of current-season's growth in the light training option.\n\nWe have not found any observable effect of added boron on tree growth or form.\n\nFigure 1: Typical tree response to previous winter's training cuts, as observed at end of growing season. In the early years, light and hard training produce on average the same sized tree (height and diameter) but tree form is better with hard training, providing better options for leader selection.\n\nFigure 2: Typical tree response to last winter's training cuts, as observed at end of growing season. From about year 4 onward, our measurements show that hard training (removal of all branches) reduces overall tree growth (height and diameter) though long, vigorous shoots with good form are produced.\n\nInitial recommendations\n\nThough we are only part-way through our experiment, we can draw some tentative conclusions and recommendations from our observations to date.\n\nHard training in the early years (up to year 2 or 3) is beneficial as the resulting long, vigorous shoots provide good options for strong, straight leaders. Medium training is also fairly successful. In these early years, there is negligible reduction in growth from hard training, as the amount of shoot material cut off is small.\n\nFrom year 4 onward (or from year 3 in big trees on a particularly fertile site), medium training may be a better option, as it allows for better growth while still producing fairly straight, vigorous shoots.\n\nWe do not recommend light training, as the trees tend to have poor form.\n\nFor information about pruning equipment, how to make pruning cuts, when to prune, and overall guidelines, see David Murdoch's chapter in the New Zealand Walnut Growers' Manual.\n\nGrowth rates and wind loading varies between orchards. As you prune your trees, you will find that you refine your technique specifically for your site.\n\nFuture work\n\nWe applied training treatments in July 2006 and will re-measure the trees in winter 2007 and analyse the data. We will then assess whether to continue the trial. In the July 2006 treatments at the Caldwell orchard (5-year-old trees) the hard training treatment has been replaced with a modified medium training treatment. In this treatment, branch removal follows the medium training rules but the leader is headed back hard. Hopefully this will result in straight vigorous shoots at the top, but without the growth reduction associated with removal of large volumes of branch material."

      "text": "Helping Trees Help Themselves\n\nby James Davidson, conference blogger\n\n\"I am a community of one trillion,\" Michael Phillips said.\n\nEven though he looked to be one six-foot-something bearded man wearing a gray vest, Michael Phillips, author of the popular orcharding book The Apple Grower: A Guide for the Organic Orchardist, insisted he was part of a community of bacteria and fungi and countless other microscopic creatures, and it is this wider view that he brings to growing fruit.\n\nDuring an inspiring full-day pre-conference presentation, Phillips discussed the idea that fruit trees are also parts of multi-faceted vibrant systems. Learning more about these living communities and how to support their health allows orchardists to use nature's own power to avoid chemical culture and get beyond even standard organic practices. A holistic approach is not only better for the environment, Phillips said, it also leads to healthier trees and more nutritious and flavorful fruit.\n\nPhillips himself grows fruit on his two-acre Lost Nation Orchard in New Hampshire. Inspired in part by his wife Nancy's holistic approach to human ailments, as well as a desire to spray less sulfur on his fruit trees, Phillips came up with some practices designed to enhance a tree's natural defenses.\n\nA large part of it comes down to fungal duff management. Fungal duff refers to the decaying organic matter and fungal community living beneath a tree. Whereas many standard agricultural practices, even in the organic world, tend to tip the balance toward a bacteria-dominated environment, the best spot for a fruit tree is one that mimics forest edge conditions, where the fungal biomass in the soil outweighs the bacterial biomass by a factor of 10 or more.\n\nStandard substances in the organic toolbox, including copper and sulfur, are okay, Phillips said, if used sparingly and for the right reasons. But the rest of the time, orchardists should focus on keeping the trees in optimal health by fostering the natural defense systems of the trees, particularly on a microscopic level.\n\nPhillips says this is best done through \"biological reinforcement,\" including applications of nutrient-rich organic materials that in turn enhance beneficial fungal communities both on the tree and in the soil. Phillips proceeded to explain some of these new practices, many of which are detailed in his new book, The Holistic Orchard: Tree Fruits and Berries the Biological Way.\n\nI spoke with some of the attendees afterwards to get their reactions to the program. David Sullivan and Julianne Kellogg of Little Rock, Arkansas, said the main reason they decided to come to the sustainable ag conference was to see Phillips, and they were not disappointed. Both are interested in holistic livestock management practices, and they enjoyed seeing how a holistic outlook could be applied in an orchard setting as well.\n\nElizabeth Beak, an agricultural consultant from Charleston said, \"It was absolutely fantastic.\" She enjoyed hearing about how better plant nutrition ultimately can improve human nutrition. She hopes one day to plant some peach and pomegranate trees of her own.\n\nMeg Smith spoke for many of the attendees when she said afterwards, \"My head is full!\"\n\nIt was indeed a lot of information to take in, but Phillips emphasized that as overwhelming as it may seem at first, each orchardist would settle in on his or her own set of issues and would not have to be an expert on every pest and disease. The main point was to do everything possible to help the trees help themselves, thereby avoiding pest and disease problems in the first place.\n\nWith a background in public health, understanding the concept of the human body and disease comes naturally to me. The intricacies of plant health and the infectious modes, explained by Michael Phillips, was a humbling reminder that all life forms are essentially functional and interact with the environment in similar ways.\n\nWhen it comes to plants, Phillips pointed out the four fungal groups, distinguishing between the beneficial and the disease causing ones. Essentially, in order to tackle the specific disease causing fungi, it is imperative to make sure that the target approach does not also eliminate the beneficial fungi. For instance, the use of heavy metals like copper for eliminating a pathogen also means killing the beneficial ones as well.\n\nWhen battling with fungal diseases, it is primarily important to know the timing of the infection season, since the visible form manifests only once the plant has been infected and the fungi has reproduced in a large enough numbers to act have a detrimental effect on the plant. This highlights the importance of understanding that, in order to enhance a plant's immune system, techniques that create a competitive fungal environment – meaning they prevent either kind of fungi from colonizing dominantly – should be employed to keep the plants healthy.\n\nIn this light, the right mix of probiotics for trees can provide the right kind of balance, keeping the unwanted fungi from reproducing and damaging the plant in large quantities. Some of the essential components of the right brew are fatty and oleic acids that create an inviting atmosphere for certain microbes. These can be introduced through liquid fish or ground up fish. Alternatively, milk or whey can also be used for keeping infestations of powdery mildew in check.\n\nFrom what seems like a never-ending list of natural remedies, the probiotics can be targeted either towards the systemic immune system or to the superficial defense of plant cuticles. For instance, salicylic acid from willow trees activates the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) by altering what otherwise may have been optimum pH levels for certain microbes to survive. Oil from the neem tree can repel insects from laying eggs and feed competitive colonization, and the turpenoid components support the SAR as well. Cuticle defense can be acquired through the help of things like coconut soap, horsetail plant, or garlic scapes.\n\nAn Interview with Michael Phillips, author of The Holistic Orchard and The Apple Grower\n\nEditor's Note: Michael is making a rare appearance in the Carolinas at this year's Sustainable Ag. Conference happening Oct. 26-28 in Greenville, SC. There are still a few seats available for a full day workshop on Holistic Orchard Applications taught by Michael! \n\nCFSA: We usually hear the word \"holistic\" used in connection with alternative health or wellness. What does it mean in the context of growing orchard fruit? For instance, how is \"holistic\" fruit growing different from \"organic\" fruit growing?\n\nMichael: Working with nutrition allows body systems the right resources to heal from within. Add the ecosystem component and all sorts of natural advantage can be provided for fruiting plants. Good organic growers have always known this. Yet those intentions of 'never using chemicals' doesn't quite break from the notion of addressing disease pressures solely by toxic means. And thus organically-approved mineral fungicides like sulfur and copper are often used to excess to counter disease. The holistic grower knows that tree immune function and competitive colonization can be reinforced to defeat disease from within. Similar choices on this allopathic/holistic divide speak to how we deal with insect pests. It's simply so much more fun to choose the healthy route.\n\nCFSA: Most orchardists try to limit their chemical spraying, for both environmental and cost reasons. But in this book you actually promote biological sprays. Can you explain what these \"good sprays\" are and how they benefit the orchard ecosystem?\n\nMichael: The holistic spray program is totally about deep nutrition and competitive colonization. The spring applications straddle the primary infection period of many diseases and therefore are necessary universally. Dealing with summer rots and sooty blotch is where the fermented herbal teas fit in. Basically, the phytochemical immune response is that much stronger in a robust fruit tree. Couple that with biological reinforcement on the leaf and fruit surface. . . and scab spores and blight bacteria will find \"no room at the inn\" to establish diseases. I look at this as our part of the stewardship pact with the trees by which we grow healthy fruit despite the vagaries of the season.\n\nCFSA: You mention \"community orchards\" throughout the book. Could you describe what that means in practical terms of orchard size and marketing? Is it similar to the concept of Community Supported Agriculture? And can you make a profit selling fruit locally?\n\nMichael: I hold to the creed that our culture needs to grow food in all the places that we live to the extent that we can. Growers have too long been daunted by not having the ideal site. . . which seems to suggest that much of our fruit should come from the east side of the Cascade Mountains in Washington and Oregon. What I see is serious home orchardists excited to plant more than the family needs. This in turn leads to selling fruit at market or creating a fruit share component for local CSAs. All such efforts are community orchards. The emphasis is now on tree-ripened fruit grown in a living soil. . . and the taste benefits of that simply can't be brought in from afar. A community orchard can be anywhere from 20 productive trees to several acres in size to up to 10 acres. Pricing needs to account for all the labor involved but more and more, people are willing to pay this as they understand that nutrient density in our food matters. And that's why 'fresh and local' tastes so extremely good!\n\nCFSA: As a group, do you think insect pests or diseases pose a greater challenge to the person who wants to create a holistic orchard?\n\nMichael: Insects are definitely easier to get a handle on. All sorts of biodiversity in the surrounding ecosystem helps tremendously here. Plus we have some very effective options in our organic tool box to nudge things back to balance. Disease on the other hand starts off as an unseen force of spores and bacteria. Growers are often not quite as far along on their learning curve to grasp that certain things need to be done at very prescribed times in the growing season. And it's such a long season. . . giving various afflictions more than enough time to gain a foothold. And the weather is always different every year. All this makes dealing with disease the bigger challenge no matter what your approach.\n\nCFSA: There's a lot of information in your book on \"understory\" planting of herbs and flowers, like comfrey and sweet cicely. What kinds of benefits do these companion plants provide for fruit trees?\n\nPermaculture people speak about dynamic accumulator and beneficial accumulator plants. The first group includes tap-rooted herbs like comfrey that draw minerals up from the subsoil to replenish the nutrient profile of the topsoil. That's a boon for tree feeder roots. The second group of flowering plants serves as adult habitat for beneficial insects. Such as the tiny parasitic wasps and syphid flies whose larvae consume foliar pests. Plants like Sweet Cicely and Queen Anne's Lace are nectary sources for the adults. . . which are thus on hand to find moth larvae and aphids and the like for their own young.\n\nCFSA: So much of the orchard's \"business\" seems to take place either underground or up in the tree canopy, often at a microscopic level that we humans can't even see. How do we begin to change our perception of what's really happening in our orchard, and how can we turn that knowledge to our advantage?\n\nMichael: I love the electron microscopy shown in Holistic Orchard. The first image shows the cellular surface of a tree leaf. The next zooms in to show the microbe colonization on a single leaf cell. Just imagine being a disease spore landing in the midst of all that competition! We steward this biological scene as growers. Visualize this action again and again as you do orchard tasks, knowing this is how things work as nature intended.\n\nCFSA: How much of what commercial fruit growers do in terms of spraying (whether chemical or organic) is dictated by the perceived demand for \"perfect,\" blemish-free fruit in the marketplace? Can we ever get beyond this?\n\nThe majority of my fruit looks pretty darn perfect too. But my customers also know that a small dimple caused by an insect sting is harmless. That sooty blotch fungus can literally be rubbed off the apple's skin. That a couple of small scab spots represent an active phytochemical response to disease presence, and thus more antioxidants and other secondary plant metabolites that our bodies in turn utilize to stay healthy. A good third of the sprays being applied in fruit orchards are about upping the ante around appearance. How much better to understand that nutrient density and thus flavor results in part from a fruit tree standing up to environmental stress. Ultimately, that's the ticket, isn't it? Getting people to taste how fruit is really meant to taste when picked off healthy trees.\n\nCFSA: Looked at from a holistic perspective, do we need \"pest\" species in our orchards to ensure a healthy ecosystem?\n\nI use the term 'balance' for a reason when talking about insect pests. Biodiversity happens in part because food resources are available for all sorts of species. You may think life would be far better off without the yellowjacket, for instance, but did you know that all summer long these wasps gather moth larvae to feed their young? We'd lose ladybugs if no aphids whatsoever were to be found. I teach that we need to honor all species, including ultimate pests like the plum curculio. Just remember we have integrated strategies to keep the balance in our favor."

      "text": "Changing the original grade around trees can cause severe injury and in\nmany instances result in the death of trees. Damage to the trees may not show immediately,\nand several months, a year, or even longer may pass before outward signs of injury are\nvisible. How long before injury begins to show will depend upon the age and species of the\ntree and the depth of change made in the grade. When signs of injury do appear, the damage\nis generally too great to save the tree.\n\nRaising the Grade\n\nRaising the soil level around a tree is the most\nserious grade change. Air circulation is cut off and moisture and nutrients cannot reach\nthe tree roots. In some cases drainage is greatly impaired and the tree drowns.\n\nWhen the roots are covered too deeply, the first sign\nof suffocation is generally wilting and defoliation, and the bark begins to decay where\nsoil comes in contact with the tree trunk. The tree may then die slowly or all at once.\n\nGenerally, the original grade may be increased 4 to 6\ninches a year without damaging the tree. However, if the grade is to be increased a total\nof more than 18 inches, a tree well will be needed. A good garden soil, rich in organic\nmatter, should be used for the fill.\n\nConstructing the Well\n\nThe prime considerations in constructing tree wells\nare: (1) air circulation in the root area, (2) water and plant nutrients, (3) proper\ndrainage.\n\nAir Circulation\n\nThe best way to insure good air circulation is to\npile stone completely over the roots of the tree, as shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3. The\nstone should extend from the well or tree trunk past the drip line. Figure 1 illustrates\nthe use of vertical drain tile spaced at 6-foot intervals around the drip line of the\ntree.\n\nFertilizing and Watering\n\nSupplemental water and plant nutrients can be supplied to the\nroot system through the air vents and drainage system. Supplemental leaf feedings with\nliquid fertilizers will greatly benefit the tree.\n\nDrainage\n\nProper drainage is vital to the life of the tree. If\nthe original grade drains properly, an extensive drainage system may not be required. A\nlayer of rock and gravel placed over the entire root system to a depth of 1 to 2 feet\nshould be adequate. If extensive alterations in the grade are made and water does not\ndrain properly, a system of drain tile will be needed, as shown in Figure 4. Make certain\nthat the excess water drains completely from the site, or wet spots may occur in other\nlocations resulting in new problems. Also, make certain that the tile extends through the\nwall to insure drainage from within the well.\n\nNOTE: Cover\nall tree wells with a screen or decking to prevent children and small animals from falling\ninto the well and to keep debris from collecting in the well.\n\nThere are several methods of constructing tree wells\nwhich will provide for air circulation, moisture control, and methods of feeding the tree.\nThere are also many variations of these methods. The method used will depend upon the\nvalue of the tree, the amount of work involved, and the cost.\n\nTree wells may be constructed of field stone or they may be permanent,\nmasonry-type walls constructed of brick or other material. In either case, the well should\nbe built before the grade is changed because construction is easier, installation of drain\ntile simplified, and the well will provide extra protection for the tree against other\nconstruction damage.\n\nSize of the Well\n\nA tree well should extend a minimum of 3 feet from the trunk of the\ntree. The greater the diameter of the well, however, the better the chance of saving the\ntree.\n\nThe recommended height for tree wells is 3 feet.\nDeeper wells have been constructed, however, and have been successful. The additional\nexpense and effort involved is easily justified by the value of the trees and the\ncontribution it makes to the landscape.\n\nDecreasing the Grade\n\nSaving a tree when the grade is to be decreased is\nnot as difficult as when the grade is increased. Move out from the trunk of the tree as\nfar as possible (beyond the drip line is desirable), cut the roots of the trees with a\nsharp spade or saw, and remove the soil with hand tools to the proper depth. A grader can\nthan remove the rest of the soil without tearing the roots.\n\nThe crown of the tree should be reduced by 1/3 to compensate for the loss of roots.\n\nA retaining wall should then be built around the tree. Make certain that the wall\ndrains properly. Weep holes every 2 feet are generally sufficient. Gravel placed\nimmediately behind the wall also aids in drainage.\n\nThe tree should be watered and fertilized the same as if it were growing in the lawn."

      "text": "I can't think of many things that affect us as diversely as trees do. For starters, they contribute to numerous influences on our surroundings. They improve our environment by providing protection from wind and dust, by shading us from our high mountain sun, and by decreasing our households' summer energy costs. Also, because they are the most important assets of any home's landscape, trees carry significant financial value. By planting a tree, we enhance our aesthetic quality of life and improve our physical health. We need to plant more trees!\n\nDeciduous trees are the best to shade patios, courtyards and the west- or south-facing walls of our homes. Their season leaf changes permit solar warmth in the winter and provide dense shade during the heat of summer.\n\nMy favorite deciduous trees for central Yavapai County are readily available for planting now. Although there are dozens of great trees from which to pick, I've decided to narrow the field for those of you who don't want to put in hours of research to find that perfect tree for that special spot in your landscape. I am certain any one of these trees will earn itself a place of pride in your yard.\n\nA mountain favorite because of its classic red color in fall is the autumn blaze maple, Acer freemanii. During summer months its large leaves provide great shade that is rivaled only by the shade of a sycamore. A healthy maple tree will grow 2-3 feet per year, topping out at 40 feet. Mountain wind can tear and shred the leaves of some maples. The ability to withstand mountain winds is why the only varieties of maples that I recommend are the autumn blaze and silver queen.\n\nThe Arizona sycamore, native to the high mountain region, is a large shade tree that seems to thrive in our clay soils and heavy winds. However, the London plane sycamore, Platanus x acerifolia, does even better at this altitude. Its leaves look like maple leaves on steroids, but their leathery texture tolerates our wind and sun better than the leaves of its native cousin.\n\nThe hardiest tree requiring the least amount of water is the sunburst locust, Gleditsia triacanthos, named because its new growth and fall color are a bright sunburst gold. This tree makes up for its small foliage by the vast numbers of leaves that provide a delightful filtered shade unique to locust trees. It is really hardy in low water use landscapes.\n\nProviding more than just great shade in summer is the flowering pear, Pyrus calleryana. It is one of the first trees to blossom each spring and is graced with bridal-white flowers that produce no fruit. In fall, this tree is the last to turn crimson red before evergreens take center stage in winter's landscape. For a deciduous tree that performs extremely well through every season at this altitude, the hands-down choice is a flowering pear.\n\nFor a yard that needs a small tree with an umbrella shape, I highly recommend the summer blooming silk tree, Mimosa pudica. This extremely low water user grows to about 18 feet and produces masses of pink tasseled flowers that cover the top of the tree. Our home's second story looks down on three of these summer beauties. They create a striking view that our family really enjoys when having dinner on that elevated deck.\n\nMy last recommendation is Fraxinus, the entire ash family of trees. There are several types grown at this altitude and all are noted for their fall color, low water use, great shade, wind tolerance and longevity. They have few bug or disease problems, and come fall the leaves are easy to clear away.\n\n***\n\nThis is the time when butterfly bushes, sages, crepe myrtles, roses of Sharon and chitalpas take center stage in our landscapes. Interestingly, they are indifferent to the ups and downs of our springtime weather. These summer shiners even prefer being planted in this season's warm soils, warm days and warm nights.\n\nOne of the truly unusual specimens this season is the bluebird hibiscus. This is an amazing summer bloomer that is coming into its own right now. Considered the best true blue hibiscus for the area, the eye-popping blue flowers with a dark red eye are favorites every summer. This winter-hardy variety is good down to a crazy -20F degrees but loves the summer heat as well. Growing as tall as a gardener it makes the ideal hedge, foundation or specimen plant. It is a standout against fences and large foundation walls, or in fire wise woodland areas. This blue beauty is exciting, whether it's a lone blossom behind your ear or an entire bush admired from a distance. Pick these flowers with the assurance that 50 to 100 more buds will replace them throughout the summer season.\n\n***\n\nMy summer gardening classes have begun at the garden center. They are held, free of charge, every Saturday at 9:30 a.m. They are fun-filled energetic sessions with lots of local gardening information. This week's class is \"Mountain Landscapes, Perfectly Designed.\" Look for the entire class schedule on  under the \"classes for the taking\" section.\n\nUntil next week, I'll see you in the garden center.\n\nThroughout the week, Ken Lain is at Watters Garden Center, 1815 W.

      "text": "Regina, the shy bearer\n\nAn Oregon grower shares his strategies for profitably growing this European cherry.\n\nGeraldine Warner\n\nManuel Ybarra of Quincy, Washington, and other Pacific Northwest growers learn about how to maximize Regina cherry production at the Omeg Orchard in The Dalles, Oregon.\n\nThe German cherry variety Regina has numerous good attributes but tends to crop lightly. However, it's possible to overcome that, Lynn Long, Oregon State University Cooperative Extension educator in The Dalles, explained during a cherry field day this summer.\n\nRegina has been planted fairly extensively in Oregon's Mid-Columbia region, but has not been planted much in Washington State or other cherry-growing regions—except for Europe, where it has replaced some of the standard varieties in the later districts, Long said. \"One of the reasons Washington growers have shied away from Regina is because of the yield, but it can be quite a profitable cherry.\"\n\nThe variety is actually very precocious, he said. Young trees can bloom profusely, with the potential for a good yield in the third leaf, but they do not always set a large crop. Growers need to make sure they have adequate pollinizers and put extra bees in their Regina blocks, Long said.\n\nMike Omeg of The Dalles talked about what his family has done to improve fruit set in Regina cherries without sacrificing too much orchard space to pollinizers. They plant pollinizers between two Regina trees, somewhat like crab apples in apple orchards, rather than allotting them their own space.\n\n\"It's a way not to waste tree space that could be Regina,\" Omeg explained. \"A lot of the pollinizers we use in Regina we don't pick.\"\n\nThe pollinizers are trained to a Y system. They are pruned right after bloom to keep them small and to encourage them to produce lots of blossoms. Omeg said he did not want to devigorate them by pruning later in the season.\n\nHe uses Sam, Stark's Gold, and Attika as pollinizers.\n\n\"We put in three pollinizers because we want a large volume of pollinizer bloom present throughout the entire blooming period of Regina, which is a moving target from year to year,\" he explained. \"We reduce our risk of missing pollinizing by having lots of pollen and different pollinizers there.\"\n\nHe also places more bees in his Regina blocks, renting more than five colonies per acre.\n\nLong said research has shown that the longevity of the Regina ovule can be very short when the weather is hot, and there must be pollen available during the short window when the flower is receptive.\n\nSam bloom probably coincides the best with Regina, but some pollinizers should already be in bloom before the Regina blossoms open. Stark's Gold and Attika bloom a little ahead of Regina. Some growers use Sandra Rose.\n\nOmeg plants a pollinizer tree after every fifth Regina tree in the row, cycling the three types of pollinizers he uses. In the adjacent row, the pollinizers are offset so that they are evenly distributed in the block. Omeg said a study of Regina on Gisela 6 rootstock showed that the trees closest to the pollinizers were the most productive.\n\nHis recent plantings are on Gisela 12. In 1999, his father, Mel Omeg, planted a trial with side-by-side rows of G.6, G.12, Krymsk, and Weiroot, and felt that the G.12 performed the best. It had a good balance of vigor and production.\n\nManagement\n\nDwarfing rootstocks, such as Gisela, Krymsk, and Weiroot, require significantly more management than Mazzard and are much less forgiving of mistakes, he warned. \"To maintain vigor and maintain the size of the fruit is a bigger challenge with Gisela, but it's something that's not overwhelming. We feel that the advantages with Gisela, as in early production and the ability to grow a short tree and harvest the fruit from the ground, outweigh the disadvantages.\n\n\"I don't want to oversimplify,\" he continued, \"but it almost seems that if you take a Mazzard block and have it next to a Gisela block, you're doing almost the opposite as far as horticultural techniques, tree training, and pruning, and also nutrition. The Giselas require a completely different nutritional plan to manage good vigor. If you were to feed the Mazzard block what you're feeding the Gisela block, you'd have no fruit and they'd be growing 12 feet a year. It would be impossible.\"\n\nOmeg applies a baseline amount of nitrogen in the spring: 100 pounds per acre for trees on Mazzard and 125 pounds for Gisela trees. Additional fertilizer will depend on the soil type and the history of the block. He takes leaf samples to determine what needs to be applied as a foliar feed.\n\nHis Regina trees are trained to a central leader system, whereas most of his other varieties are on the steep leader or open vase system. Omeg said Regina's natural growth tendency is conducive to the central leader because of its flat branches. The trees are kept fairly short, with the first whorl of branches low to the ground.\n\n\"We're preparing for the inevitable labor shortage,\" Omeg said. \"Labor is going to be an ever increasing challenge for us in cherries, and consequently I want to be able to harvest as much of the fruit from the ground as possible to reduce the amount of labor we need to harvest our crops.\"\n\nHowever, if the orchard was truly pedestrian, productivity would suffer, he said. \"I don't mind using a ladder, but I think the days of using a 14-foot ladder are pretty much over. Our crews argue over who gets to use the 12-foot ladders. In a few years, they'll be arguing over who uses the 10s and then the 8s.\"\n\nGreat cherry\n\nAsked why he planted Regina rather than another variety, such as Skeena or Bing, Omeg said he wants varieties that maximize the net return per acre and fit into his harvest schedule. \"It's a great cherry. People like the taste. It's easy to grow big, probably because it's hard to grow a lot of them, and it ships very well.\"\n\nIn addition, it is more resistant to rain cracking than other varieties. It matures around the same time as Lapins, about ten days after Bing. Long said with good pollination and vigor, a mature Regina block can yield eight tons or more per acre. \"I think it's a great cherry,\" he"

      "text": "When to Replant a Tree After Having a Stump Removed\n\n\"We just had a tree removed and the stump ground out. I would like to replace it with another tree ASAP, but my wife would like to wait until next year to replant. Can you help us decide?\" -Paul\n\nThere are two things to consider when deciding whether to replant a tree after grinding out a stump. First, the root system of the old tree spreads beyond the grinding hole, and even if you opt for the extra-deep stump grinding service designed for \"replanting,\" there will be large roots that may take years to decompose. Those roots can interfere with the root system of your new tree, possibly affecting its growth and health.\n\nSecond, the ecology of that piece of ground is going to keep changing for a few years, as microorganisms go to work breaking down the old tree roots. A new tree will have to compete with these microorganisms for nutrients and resources within the soil, which will make it more difficult for your new tree to thrive.\n\nThe best approach if you would like to plant a tree immediately is to choose a new spot at least five feet from the old site. This will improve your tree's chances of thriving. If you do decide to replant in the same spot, waiting one year may not be long enough to break down those old roots completely, so wait as long as you can and then offer extra TLC to the new tree until it established.\n\nTags:"

      "text": "apple grafting6 May, 2012\n\nWhile the apples you get from a store or orchard or your back yard have seeds in them, those seeds don't tend to germinate well, and if they did, they often won't grow into apple trees that bear fruit that would resemble the apple you originally ate. And apple trees take some time to grow (and some of them years and years and years before they produce fruit), so it would be really lame to go to all the work of fostering a tree from seed only to end up with lame apples. I say this, but we here at HQ love experimenting, so we've totally got some apple trees growing from seed that are about 6″ tall at the moment. Who knows! None the less, even experimenters like ourselves don't count on seeds to grow good apple trees.\n\nLuckily, plants are incredible. It turns out, if you take a piece of branch from one apple tree, you can attach it a different apple tree, and if you've done it right, it will keep growing. (Pause here and be awed by that.) Grafting takes advantage of this. You take a little baby apple tree, maybe a foot high, that you know does well in your climate and soil type, and that will make the size tree you want (dwarf, semi-dwarf or standard). This will be your root stock, the below ground part of your soon-to-be new tree. Then, you clip off a small branch of new growth from an apple tree whose fruit you like, such that the diameter of the branch matches the diameter of the trunk of the rootstock you have. This is your scion wood, the above ground part of your soon-to-be new tree. You slice off the top of the rootstock at a steep diagonal, slice off the bottom of the scion wood at a steep diagonal, and stick the two together so that they match up. As long as the thin green layers just underneath the bark (called cambium) of both make good contact with each other, the two will grow together. For added stability, you make a notch in both sides to keep the two surfaces from slipping, and then wrap them with a rubber band to hold the two together and seal the whole thing with wax to keep moisture in. If all goes well, you are left with the perfect roots matched with the perfect fruits, all in a new two-in-one tree.\n\nSo here is where this is really really really exciting. We are spoiled when it comes to apples. We lived in Washington for a decade, and while the state grows lots and lots of nothing special apples that fill grocery stores across the country, we discovered Jones Creek Farms at a Seattle farmers' market, and they have a thing for great apples, of lots and lots of varieties. While they've got plenty of kinds you'll find elsewhere, they've got lots we'd never seen before and never seen since (check out their variety list here). Before I met Les and the other awesome folks from Jones Creek, I didn't even think I liked apples. We went weekly, tried them all, brought lots home, and fell in love with some varieties that we simply must have again, even though we are far, far away from their Skagit Valley orchards.\n\nWell, if I want an orchard here at HQ with lots of great heirloom apple varieties like the kinds at Jones Creek (or the Seed Savers Heritage Farm), I'm not going to be ordering them from traditional nurseries. And I couldn't afford it anyway. Instead, the one big apple tree we have here at HQ has plenty of sucker growth, from which I can easily (as in, with my handy digging fork in a matter of seconds) harvest root stock. And I can get scion wood through the mail through the Seed Savers Yearbook, or hopefully from writing really nice letters to the folks at Jones Creek. And when the two combine… apple paradise here at HQ.\n\nGranted, it will still take years for any of these tiny trees to bear fruit. But man, when they do, even if I'm no longer here to enjoy it, it will be brilliant.\n\nSo far, if those three little trees I brought home from the grafting workshop keep up the good work, we'll have Belle de Boskoop, Fameuse and Ribston apples here (I dare you to find those at your corner grocery store), all grafted onto traditional nursery rootstock, in addition to our one old tree (variety unknown, but so far it has only produced three, albeit beautiful and big, apples). And I'm already experimenting a little. The picture on the right is a bit of extra Fameuse scion grafted onto a bit of rootstock from our old apple tree's sucker growth (can you see where the color changes from green brown to grey brown above my hand?), before I've wrapped it. I did it today, when the wood surely isn't dormant as it should be, but who knows?\n\nBy the way, if you want more detailed grafting instructions, Seed Savers has a webinar up here for free on grafting (I haven't watched it, but I assume it will resemble the workshop I took). Or look here for the quick diagram version, from the West Virginia Extension folks.\n\nComments\n\nSounds cool. What is your best guess as to when you might have fruit?\n\n— Bill6 May, 2012 at 5:25 pm\n\nBill – I would be impressed if it took 3 years. Some varieties take longer than others, more in the decade range. And of course, they might all die, and then the answer is never. Who knows? For the moment, the little buds are turning into little leaves! This is exciting enough for the time being."

Founder Sam Hill is a respected educator and resource in the tree care community and has guided Sam Hill Tree Care to become synonymous with strong, healthy, beautiful trees.\n\nMr. Hill's teaching and public speaking credits are numerous. He has presented for the Dallas Trees and Parks Foundation, the Texas Nurserymen and Landscape Association and Richland College. He has also lectured at several area homeowner's association meetings and garden clubs. For more information on availability please contact us. On the right are a variety of white papers about tree care including information about soil conditions, pesticides, turf, irrigation, weed management and more. Please feel free to print out these files and use them for reference. We ask that if you distribute this information, please credit Sam Hill Tree Care as your resource.\n\nLearning Industry Vocabulary\n\nArborist\nArborists are tree care professionals trained and certified in all aspects of woody plant health and care, including diagnosis and treatment of diseases, insect infestations and environmental problems. Arborists can help in the selection, maintenance, care and removal of trees and shrubs in residential, commercial and public landscapes. They can recommend watering, fertilizing, pesticide applications and other cultural programs to help maintain the long-term health and beauty of landscapes.\n\nCommon Pruning Questions\n\nWhy periodic pruning?\nPruning is necessary for safety reasons. Weak branches and those that interfere with structures, lighting, utility lines, pedestrians and vehicle traffic need to be removed. Pruning is also an invigorating process. By removing dead, dying, diseased and crossing branches energy reserves are directed toward growth in the remaining branches. Periodic pruning should maintain a desirable, natural shape while enhancing the beauty and health of your landscape.\n\nCaterpillar Defoliators\n\nSeveral species of insects feed on the leaves of trees and shrubs in the landscape. This is usually a great concern for many tree owners. However, in the North Texas area, few cause significant injury to the tree or shrub. There are exceptions, though. Most defoliation of woody plants in the landscape is the result of feeding by the larva of moths (i.e. caterpillars). The time and severity of the defoliation are a few of the considerations when assessing the impact upon tree health. Early season (spring) defoliation is much more injurious to the tree than mid- and late season defoliation. This is due to the large amount of energy and reserves the tree has invested in the new foliage. Defoliation at this time reduces the capacity of a tree to make food and puts additional demands on the tree to make new leaves. Extensive defoliation or defoliation that occurs two or more years in a row can weaken the tree and make it more susceptible to secondary agents.\n\nNormally, natural factors keep caterpillars in check. Sometimes, however, the environment becomes favorable for one of these pests, and an outbreak occurs. It is important to know a little about the lifecycle of these pests so that the most appropriate action may be taken. A few of the ore common caterpillar defoliators are described on the following pages.\n\nTree Limb Debris Still a Danger for the Hurricane Katrina Recovery\n\nDALLAS, April 3, 2006 – When there is so much clean up and debris on the ground and around you, it's sometimes daunting to realize there's dangerous debris lingering abouve you.

      "text": "April 11, 2010\n\nApple Grafting\n\nThis weekend we left our little urban farm and headed three hours south to Decorah, Iowa the home of Seed Savers Exchange. They put on an apple grafting seminar and we thought it was a great opportunity to learn how do our own grafting and see Seed Savers first hand.\n\nEven without the grafting workshop the trip would have been worthwhile as Heritage Farm at Seed Savers is a really beautiful place and the town of Decorah is beautiful and interesting. That said the apple grafting workshop was amazing! We were interested in taking the workshop so we would have access to more unique and rare apple varieties. There are over 17,000 different named variates of apple but only a few hundred of them can be purchased commercially as grafted trees. By learning to do our own grafting the world of apples opens up as a cutting from a tree is all that is needed to create our own.\n\nThe purpose of grafting apple trees is to get a specific apple variety to grow with a size and hardiness you desire. All non standard sized apple trees are grafted onto a rootstock that controls how the tree grows. The type of fruit the tree produces is determined by the scion-wood that is grafted to the rootstock. Scion-wood is a dormant one year old cutting from the desired apple variety. We learned the the trick of successful grafting is to create contact between the living cambium layers of wood in the scion-wood and rootstock. By achieving this the rootstock and scion-wood can fuse together and become one living tree.\n\nDuring our class the instructor demonstrated several different grafting techniques, then helped us do our own grafting of three trees each. With successful grafts we could have 6 new apple trees to plant! We'll know for sure in 4-6 weeks if the buds on the scion-wood leaf out.\n\nIf grafting sounds interesting we would really recommend taking the class next year at Seed Savers or getting the book The Grafters Handbook by R. J. Garner."

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Encourage tree roots to grow deeper into the soil by occasional deep watering with a soaker hose.\n\nImprove Garden Beds\n\nIt's almost planting season. This is the perfect opportunity to improve the existing soil in your garden beds by adding compost. Organic compost will improve any kind of garden soil including clay and sand. It is available at garden centers and nursery supply stores, or even better, make your own from garden debris and kitchen scraps. If the soil is wet, simply lay the amendment on the surface to till in later when the soil is workable.\n\nPrune Fuchsias\n\nPrune frost-tender fuchsias just as winter comes to an end. Pruning stimulates new growth, so by waiting until late in the season, you eliminate the danger of frost damage. Fuchsias can withstand severe pruning. Hanging plants can be cut back to several inches from the surface of the soil. Leave a basic 5-branch framework so that new growth has good shape.\n\nFertilize Indoor Plants\n\nLonger days are triggering your indoor plants into action. Apply fertilizer at 1/2 the recommended strength so that they have the nutrients necessary for growth without shocking them.\n\nProvide Necessary Nutrients\n\nChemical fertilizer encourages rapid new growth which is more susceptible to insect, drought and frost damage. Instead of encouraging rapid growth, provide your plants with the nutrients they need by applying organic compost as a mulch to the surface of the soil. Each time you water, nutrients will be delivered to the roots as well as improving the structure of the existing soil. The earthworms will thank you too!"

After I planted them, my neighbor said that he and 2 other neighbors had no success with the Shumard/ Red oaks and had replaced them with live oaks which obviously have done well in their yards.\nWe are in heavy clay with a gentle slope to the street. And, my Shumards' leaves looked good until late May, when the far ends of the leaves began to get brown and die, but still retained some green close to the stem.\nI automatically watered my yard 3x/ week this summer for about 30 minutes per time and watered the trees about once more each week. They have not grown taller or put out any new branches since planted! How long before I replace them with live oaks?!\n\nANSWER:\n\nActually, we have no idea which would be the best choice for you, and sure wouldn't give you a date to cut down the tree you have.

Not a true evergreen; most of its leaves turn brown and fall off in early Spring, but are replaced by new green leaves in two or three weeks.\n\nFrom the same Oak Wilt Partnership: \"Live oaks are intermediate in susceptiblity to Oak Wilt but are more seriously affected due to their tendency to grow from root sprouts and form vast interconnected root systems that allow movement (or spread) of the fungus between adjacent trees.\"\n\nIn summary, the Shumard oak can grow larger, the live oak is semi-evergreen, both are native to Central Texas, and both pose threats of Oak Wilt, which cannot be cured, and has laid waste to oak trees in many parts of Texas and other states. We suggest you read the entire Oak Wilt Partnership website before you make your decision. Beyond that, these trees have pretty similar growing conditions, and it's a personal choice on which to grow.\n\nMore Trees"

When inquiring about Dogwood in a roomful\nof spring landscapers, the Dogwood makes every ones top ten\nlists. There are many cultivars to choose from when researching\nabout Dogwood. The various cultivars allow for unique choices\nof flower color for the spring landscape and for unique form\nfor summer and fall landscapes.\n\nThe\nDogwood trees display two wonderful qualities. They are best\nknown for their spring blooms, and for anyone interested in\nlearning about Dogwood, they also provide fine fall foliage.\nCornus florida is the native flowering dogwood tree in the\nU.S., where it is commonly referred to simply as, \"flowering\ndogwood tree,\" as if there were no other. The flowering\ndogwood tree has fall foliage that is so attractive and popular\nto landscaping enthusiasts in the U.S.\n\nDogwoods\nare adaptable to several types of soils; however, they naturally\ngrow in moist, fertile soils high in organic matter. They\nare never found in poorly drained locations in the woods.\nTheir primary demands are good soil drainage and protection\nfrom drought. Planting in poorly drained areas will usually\nresult in the tree dying.\n\nBest\nresults will be obtained when dogwoods are planted in association\nwith larger trees that provide moderate shade. In the wild\nthe dogwood is commonly found as an understory tree growing\nunder hardwoods and pines. Growth problems are more likely\nin hot, dry exposures.

      "text": "Topping occurs when the vertical stem (leader) and upper primary limbs (scaffold branches) on mature trees are cut back to stubs at uniform height. Topping is also referred to as heading, stubbing, or dehorning.\n\nHow does topping damage trees?\n\n1) Topping reduces food-making capacity. Trees require a large leaf surface area to provide food for maintenance and growth. Topping cuts off a major portion of the tree's food-making potential and depletes the tree's stored reserves.\n\n2) Topping stimulates undesirable \"water sprout\" growth. While removing most of the buds that would form a normal branch system, topping often stimulates the regrowth of dense, unattractive, upright branches (water sprouts) just below the pruning cut. Water sprout regrowth is vigorous. A topped tree will rapidly return to its original height, but will lack its original form.\n\n3) Topping leaves large wounds. The branch wounds left from topping are slow to close, therefore more vulnerable to insect attacks and fungal decay. An invasion by either pest can spread into the trunk, killing the tree.\n\n4) Topping creates a hazard. Weakened stubs are more prone to wind and storm breakage because they generally begin to die back or decay.\n\nSome homeowners and tree pruners practice topping whenever trees reach an undesirable height. They mistakenly believe that topping will reduce the storm hazard of falling branches, when in fact, topping has the opposite effect. People also top trees when they interfere with utility wires, buildings, solar collectors, or sunny garden areas.\n\nSelection of trees that only reach desired maximum heights eliminates severe pruning later. If you must prune a tree heavily every five to seven years, the tree is too large for the site. Replace it with a smaller species. The National Arborist Association considers topping an unacceptable practice and advises against it. Unfortunately, even some legitimate tree service companies indiscriminately top trees. Before selecting a tree service, find out which companies advocate topping and avoid patronizing them.\n\nWhat are the alternatives?\n\nIn order to avoid topping, newly planted trees should be properly pruned to develop a good branch structure as they grow. When a mature tree's height must be reduced, an alternative to topping is drop-crotching.\n\nDrop-crotching is a type of thinning cut that reduces a tree's size while preserving its natural shape. To drop-crotch, select and cut higher branches back to laterals at least one-third the diameter of the limbs being removed. Cut outside the branch collar at a 45 to 60 degree angle to the branch bark ridge. Leave the branch collar intact to help prevent decay from entering the trunk. This type of thinning cut will stimulate growth throughout the tree and discourage water sprout development.\n\nWith drop-crotching. Lateral limbs are pruned where they join large diameter side branches. The center leader is cut back to a large diameter secondary branch so that a modified leader remains. This does not change the direction of growth. It encourages stimulation of the apical growth point.\n\nWhenever removing limbs greater than 1 inch in diameter, use the three-cut method to avoid tearing bark. First, about 12 inches from the trunk, cut halfway through the limb from the underside. Second, about 1 inch past the first cut, cut through the limb from the top side. The limb's weight will cause it to break between the two cuts. Make the third cut outside the branch collar, as described earlier. Use a handsaw to provide greater control.\n\nA professional arborist can improve the condition of a tree, even after it's been severely topped and shows heavy water sprout regrowth. As the water sprouts begin to gain caliper, they can be selectively \"thinned out\" using properly placed branch collar cuts. New growth can be directed outward to expand and round out the crown. This process will need repeating for a few years. The scars, both physical and visual, will never completely disappear.\n\nA wiser alternative to topping is careful selection and training of your young trees. Avoid topping altogether. Allow your trees to realize their full potential for health and beauty in the landscape.Rights\n\nLast week's death of an elderly Dougherty County man has been attributed to Africanized honeybees. This fatality confirms the bees' arrival in Georgia, according to the Georgia Department of Agriculture (DOA).\n\n\"The victim was operating a tractor and mower, aggravated a nest of bees and received more than 100 stings,\" said Keith Delaplane, a University of Georgia Cooperative Extension entomologist. Africanized honeybees have been in the United States since October 1990 when they were found in Texas. In 2005, they were confirmed in Florida.\n\nEuropean cousin essential to crops\n\nA sub-species of honeybee, Africanized honeybees can interbreed with the European honeybee that is well known throughout Georgia as an important pollinator and producer of honey. One-third of American diets contain food crops that rely on European honeybees for pollination, according to the Georgia DOA.\n\nAfricanized and European honeybees look and behave alike in some respects. Each bee can sting only once, and there is no difference between Africanized honeybee venom and that of a European honeybee.\n\nHowever, \"the African variety is extremely defensive and responds with a massive stinging reaction with little provocation,\" Delaplane said.\n\nRun, don't swat, and get inside and stay inside.\n\nThe UGA honeybee expert urges the public to become aware of how to react if Africanized honeybees attack. He offers the following lifesaving tips:\n\n1. Be cautious around places where Africanized honey bees are likely to nest, such as abandoned sheds, bee hive equipment, discarded tires and underground cavities.\n\n2. If you are attacked, RUN AWAY. \"You may think this sounds silly, but experience has taught us that people don't run away,\" he said. \"Instead, they stand and swat, which simply escalates the defensive frenzy until it reaches lethal proportions.\"\n\n3. Get inside a closed vehicle or building as fast as possible, and STAY there. \"Here's another hard lesson we've learned. People don't stay inside a closed vehicle if a few bees follow them inside,\" Delaplane said. \"Instead, they panic and flee back outside where tens of thousands of angry bees attack them.\"\n\nThis pattern has repeated itself over and over in the stinging incidents entomologists have monitored in Latin America and the southwestern U.S., he said. \"The lesson is, don't worry about the few bees that follow you indoors. Get inside, and stay inside.\"\n\n4. European honeybees and beekeepers are our best defense against Africanized honeybees. \"Some communities may be considering zoning restrictions against all forms of beekeeping. This essentially cedes territory to the enemy. Only gentle European bees can genetically dilute or out-compete the defensive Africanized variety,\" he said.\n\nFirst aid tips\n\nIf stung, the Georgia DOA says to follow these steps:\n\n• Scrape – do not pull – stingers from skin as soon as possible. Pulling the stinger out will likely cause more venom to be injected into the skin.\n\n• Wash sting area with soap and water.\n\n• Apply ice for a few minutes to relieve pain and swelling.\n\n• Seek medical attention if your breathing is troubled, if you're stung numerous times or if you're allergic to bee stings.\n\nNote that animals in the area (essentially the neighborhood, since AHB will attack in a large area when provoked), such as horses, dogs, cats, livestock, etc. should be taken indoors and protected from bee attack while any AHB control efforts are undertaken. Some of the most heartrending tragedies have occurred when kenneled dogs were attacked by AHB after the bees were disturbed by nearby human activity."

      "text": "How to Prune a Tree - A Graphic Tutorial\n\n6 of 9\n\nA complete ring of callus or wound-wood results from a proper pruning cut. Flush cuts made inside the branch bark ridge or branch collar result in the production of a desirable amount of wound-wood on the sides of the pruning wounds with very little wound-wood forming on the top or bottom.\n\nAvoid cuts that leave a partial branch called a stub. Stub cuts result in the death of the remaining branch and wound-wood forms around the base from stem tissues. When pruning small branches with hand pruners, make sure the tools are sharp enough to cut the branches cleanly without tearing. Branches large enough to require saws should be supported with one hand while the cuts are made. If the branch is too large to support, make a three-step pruning cut (graphic c) to prevent the bark ripping or peeling down into good bark.\n\n1. The first cut is a shallow notch made on the underside of the branch, outside the branch collar. This cut will prevent a falling branch from tearing the stem tissue as it pulls away from the tree.\n2. The second cut should be outside the first cut, all the way through the branch, leaving a short stub.\n3. The stub is then cut just outside the branch bark ridge/branch collar, completing the operation.\n\nThe quality of pruning cuts can be evaluated by examining pruning wounds after one growing season."

Bonsai trees are living miniature trees which increase in beauty and value as they mature over the years.\n\nHow is miniaturizing a tree possible?\n\nNo one single technique is adequate to make a tree small. The fact that the tree is grown in a container, the trimming, pruning, repotting and other care given the tree -- all contribute to the final result of limited growth. Dwarf trees are often found in a natural environment, but in bonsai this environment is provided artificially. Bonsai are grown in shallow containers the size of which determines the amount of soil the roots are able to grow in. This environment definitely restricts the growth of the roots and its functions."

      "text": "Ash yellows is a disease caused by Candidatus fraxinii, which affects the tree's vascular system or its' phloem sieve tubes. It is presently only found in North America. Ash yellows disease cycle is still a mystery. Experts think it is transmitted by insect vectors such as leaf hoppers which also transmit viruses. Symptoms seem to appear most widely on white ash (Fraxinus americana) than green ash (F. pennsylvanica.) It can also affect at least ten other ashes including black ash (F. nigra) and blue ash (F. quadrangulata.) The ash yellows phytoplasma can also cause symptoms of witches broom in lilacs often called lilac witches broom.\n\nAsh decline is the rapid decline of ash trees including sparse crown growth and dieback. It may be caused by many factors including environmental factors like weather stresses or poor soil conditions and other pathogens like ash yellows.\n\nSymptoms and Diagnosis\n\nSymptoms of ash yellows and decline can vary depending upon ash species and environment conditions.\n\nWhite ash shows the most prominent of symptoms for ash yellows and can result in substantial dieback which leads to premature death of the trees. Trees may show slow twig growth and short internodes among the twigs causing a tufted appearance of foliage and thinning of the overall crown. The symptomatic leaves can be stunted, chlorotic (yellow coloring,) have upturned margins, and premature autumn color. When the branches are slow growing laterally, another symptom is deliquescent branches which lose their apical dominance. Additionally, the branches can have severe dieback. The tree may develop witches broom at the trunk collar and occasionally in major branches as well.\n\nGreen ash can have similar symptoms as white ash but usually less severe. Green ashes can develop witches broom at the base of the tree without the other symptoms. Green ash appears to tolerate ash yellows better than white ash.\n\nObservation of the trees' conditions is very important since adverse environmental conditions can cause similar decline in ash trees as ash yellows. Some environmental factors to look out for are mechanical damage, drought stresses, insect infestations, and parasitic fungi. The witches broom can be diagnostic of the ash yellows but this symptom is not always present with infected ash trees.\n\nAsh decline can be caused by both ash yellows and other environmental factors, mentioned above. Ash decline is typified by growth reduction and crown dieback. Both ash yellows and environmental factors can work together to cause the premature death of the ash tree in as little as 2 years or as many as 10 years once symptoms occur.\n\nMolecular method tests such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are available in diagnostic labs for the ash yellows phytoplasma. At this point, the presence of witches broom is the most reliable diagnostic symptom in the field but not all infected trees have them.\n\nIntegrated Pest Management Strategies\n\n1. Remove the tree. There is no cure for ash yellows. Remove any trees that have severe dieback over 30 to 50% of the crown and decline since the tree will not recover.\n\n2. Improve the vigor of the tree. Although there is no known cure for ash yellows or decline, improving the growing conditions of your tree by watering during drought or fertilizing the tree in the fall can help the tree to live longer and look better.\n\n3. Choose trees suited to the growing conditions. Do not plant ash trees in drought prone areas and reduce competitive plants. Plant a diverse group of trees including other types of trees besides ash trees.\n\n4. Plant more resistant trees. Plant other ash trees besides white and green ash. Some cultivars that have shown to be more resistant to ash yellows are Fraxinus pennsylvanica 'Bergeson,' 'Dakota Centennial®', 'Patmore,' and Fraxinus americana 'Autumn Applause.'\n\nOrganic Strategies\n\nStrategies 1, 3, and 4 are strictly organic approaches. Organic tree fertilizers are available and could be a viable organic approach to Strategy 2.\n\nMore images:\n\nAsh yellows or decline on ash (Fraxinus)\n\nAsh yellows or decline on ash (Fraxinus)\n\nAsh yellows or decline on ash (Fraxinus)\n\nPests and Problems\n\nClick a link in the site map below to see other \"Pests and Problems\" pages"

      "text": "Our Regional Care Series this month focuses on the use of bonsai material developed from species native to North America. Specifically, we are seeking to define which native species of trees are suitable for growing as bonsai in different areas of the continent.\n\nWe still, perhaps justifiably, regard the classic Japanese species as the ideal, and to some extent ignore our own native species. In fact, there is very little information in most bonsai books about native North American species, with most information sources limited to journal articles. And in many instances, descriptions about the care of American material as bonsai are oriented towards care in their own region; for example, there is very little in the literature about whether one can maintain a California juniper in the Midwest, or a buttonwood in the north. Thus, for this issue of Bonsai we've decided to explore what grows where.\n\nIn each issue of the Journal, the ABS Regional Care Series examines some aspect of bonsai care that might be affected by geographical climate - i.e. where you live. Most bonsai resources prescribe care as though everyone lives in the same climate. In reality, techniques and species care can vary quite a bit if you live in New Orleans compared to Vancouver. Thus was born this column, to examine the differences in bonsai care in different climatic areas of the American continent.\n\nOur topic for this issue is pruning and restyling. Well, you might say, how much different is it to cut off a branch no matter where you live? Why would we bother looking for regional or geographic differences in such a topic? Well, in fact, there are some significant differences. We readily admit, these differences aren't as striking as with some other aspects of bonsai care, but there are still differences. These differences are\n\nmore in timing rather than technique, but they give us the opportunity to talk about both.\n\nPruning and styling, by the way, are what really make a bonsai what it is. We'll step on our soapbox here and point out that there have been bonsai enthusiasts almost exclusively in America, who, over the decades, have defended a \"natural style\" of bonsai. These bonsai are styled primarily by selective pruning and defended by the argument that they are more representative of nature than the contrived, over stylized, artificial trees of the Japanese. (Oh, by the way, if you are a proponent of this style, the opinions expressed herein are not necessarily the opinions of ABS; in fact maybe you had just better turn the page).\n\nWe like our bonsai trees with healthy limbs and leaves. In order to have this, we have to have healthy roots. Therefore, soil is probably the most important aspect of bonsai horticulture and is unfortunately often the least understood aspect of growing bonsai. The other two primary areas, watering and feeding (some might include pest and disease control), are indeed important and generally get more attention than soil does. Without appropriate watering and feeding, a tree will not be healthy, but good watering and feeding will be less effective if a poor soil is used. On the other hand, a good soil can help make up for poor watering practice and helps to make feeding more effective.\n\nSoil for bonsai is more than just \"dirt\". It not only provides the support matrix but also stores all the ingredients the tree needs for survival. It drives just about everything you do and don't do in caring for your bonsai."

This will provide a good leaf canopy to protect developing fruit and develop a more extensive root system.\n\nPaint tree trunks with light-colored indoor latex paint to prevent sunburn damage. Use an inexpensive brand, or thin down an expensive one to half paint and half water.\n\nThin grape bunches and marble-sized tree fruits for superior fruit quality. Tree branches or vines may break if too much fruit is left on them. Remove about half of the number of grape clusters--more on young vines. Thin tree fruits on alternate sides of branches for balance. The minimum distance to leave fruits on branches is determined by the age of the tree and the size of the mature fruit. Five to eight inches for apples, pears, peaches and nectarines; four inches for plums and apricots. In general, leave on the tree or vine only what you will realistically use. Thin too much rather than not enough so trees and vines aren't strained. Nut trees will usually take care of their own thinning.\n\nMaintain a good mulch of organic matter covering garden soil throughout the summer. Keep it a foot away from the trunk, but extend it several feet beyond the canopy. Better yet, cover the entire garden! A four-to-six inch layer of mulch decreases evaporation from the soil by more than 70 percent, allowing you to water less often (but still deeply each time). This thick mulch layer prevents crusting and cracking of the soil surface, holds in moisture, moderates soil temperatures for optimum root growth, prevents weeds from germinating, improves the soil as it decomposes, and encourages earthworms. Be sure to water the soil well before laying down the mulch, so you'll be insulating the moisture instead of the dryness."

      "text": "Thousand Cankers Disease of Walnut Trees\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat does a walnut tree look like? • Leaves: The long leaves of the black walnut are arranged alternately on the stem, have 11 to 23 leaflets per leaf and emerge later in spring than most other trees. Each leaflet has fine serrations on its margin, and the terminal leaflet at the end of the long leaf is frequently absent on leaves from mature trees. While most parts of this tree are pungent when rubbed or bruised, its leaves are especially so; crushed leaflets and stems have a distinct odor similar to turpentine.\n\n• Fruit: The fruit ripens in fall into a dark brown nut with a brownish-green, semi-fleshy husk. The whole fruit, including the husk, falls in October; the seed is relatively small and very hard.\n\n• Bark: The bark of the black walnut is flaky when young, but becomes ridged and deeply furrowed with age, forming a diamondback pattern as the ridges interlace. Bark color is gray-black.\n\n• Twigs and Buds: The dormant twig of the black walnut is characterized by being stout, having large leaf scars without hairy twigs, and with a prominent terminal bud.\n\nWhat is killing the walnut trees in Boulder? There are a significant number of black walnut trees, dead and/or dying around Boulder. The rapid decline and tree mortality is the result of the walnut twig beetle (Pityophthorus juglandis) and a Geosmithia fungus. This previously unidentified beetle/fungus combination on black walnut trees has now officially been named, \"Thousand Cankers Disease\" by staff at Colorado State University (CSU).\n\n• Black Walnut Twig Beetle - Parks and Recreation Urban Forestry staff first identified the arrival of this new insect pest in 2004. Native to the Southwest, the beetle has apparently migrated north and made itself at home in Boulder (and other Front Range communities with concentrations of walnut trees). This is a very aggressive beetle that will attack both healthy and stressed trees. When trees are under additional stress due to lack of supplemental water or construction damage, they are more vulnerable to attack. The beetles have multiple generations per year and are capable of attacking both tree branches and trunks so populations can build rapidly if dead/dying walnut trees are left standing.\n\n• Geosmithia canker fungus - a pathologist at CSU has confirmed the presence of the Geosmithia canker fungus in the dead/dying walnut trees in Boulder. The fungus is transmitted to healthy trees by the walnut twig beetle and can accelerate the decline of an otherwise healthy tree.\n\nHow can I tell if my black walnut tree is affected? The beetles and fungus girdle the twigs and trunk restricting water and food movement within the tree so symptoms often mimic that of drought stress. Symptoms include yellowing, browning and wilting foliage, usually starting at the top of the tree and progressing downward. The brown leaves often remain attached to the branch after the branch dies. Trees showing symptoms in the fall may not leaf out at all in the spring or will leaf out but quickly collapse once temperatures increase.\n\nWalnut trees throughout Boulder have been attacked however the largest concentrations of dead/dying trees are in the Goss/Grove, Whittier, Iris/Broadway and University Hill neighborhoods.\n\nHow long does it take the walnut twig beetle to kill my walnut trees? The Thousand Cankers Disease can kill a mature black walnut tree in one year or less.\n\nHow did the walnut twig beetle get to Boulder/CO? The walnut twig beetle (Pityophthorus juglandis) is native to the southwest United States (California, Arizona, and New Mexico) and northern Mexico. The beetle either moved northward naturally, or was transported to the area in firewood. In any case, the beetle unfortunately appears here to stay. Even if we are able to reduce beetle populations through swift and proper removal of diseased trees and wood, total eradication is not likely.\n\nWhat does the walnut twig beetle look like? The dark brown beetles are hard to see because they are very small; most are approximately 1.5 mm in length. The exit holes are again very small and best seen with a magnifying glass when looking at smaller twigs.\n\nWill the walnut twig beetles attack trees other than walnut? No, the walnut twig beetles attack only walnut trees. Most walnut trees in Boulder are black walnuts; the disease will also attack Persian or English walnuts but those are not prevalent in Boulder.\n\nCan you recommend a company to prune, remove or treat my walnut trees? You are allowed to contract with any tree service contractor at any time to perform maintenance on your trees. Removing trees can be difficult and dangerous, we recommend that you hire a reputable tree service company that is insured and licensed (in order to reduce the risk of injury or property damage).\n\nThe following tree service companies have done work recently for the City of Boulder. They can dispose of the walnut wood properly, are all insured and have a City of Boulder business license. 1) Berkelhammer Tree Experts, 303-443-1233 2) Davey Tree Experts, 303-449-2525 3) Ironwood Earthcare, 303-366-3020 4) Taddiken Tree Company, 303-554-7035 5) The Green Plan, 303-938-8230\n\nMy walnut tree still has some green leaves - will it recover? Any portion of your tree that is dead or has brown leaves will not recover or releaf back out again. Trees attacked by walnut twig beetles often sprout from the base of the tree. Generally, basal sprouts are not well attached to the trunk and should not be left to grow into large trees.\n\nThousand Cankers Disease is very aggressive. Once your tree is symptomatic, it will not recover. If your tree is not symptomatic, there is a chance you might prevent attack if you follow the guidelines below. The disease is often found in the tree long before symptoms appear however so we highly recommended that you contact a tree care professional immediately to determine if your tree is already infected and determine the best option for preventing further damage to your tree.\n\nWhat can I do to save my walnut trees? Good sanitation - If you have several walnut trees, remove all dead/dying walnut trees from your property and dispose of the wood properly to reduce the chance of having your other trees attacked. Proper disposal of wood is mechanical chipping of all branches and smaller diameter wood as soon as possible.\n\nWalnut wood may not be kept for firewood; if wood is kept to be milled or used in woodworking projects, it must be debarked to prevent the beetles from emerging and attacking other walnut trees.\n\nMaintain overall tree vigor - All efforts should be made to keep your walnut trees as healthy as possible.\n\nWater the trees - Trees should be watered at the rate of at least 15 gallons per inch of trunk diameter every two to three weeks through the summer months (example: 10-inch diameter tree should receive 150 gallons of water every 2-3 weeks). Roots can continue to grow during winter months so supplemental watering should be continued monthly on warmer days through the winter.\n\nAvoid damaging the trunk or roots around your walnut tree during construction projects and lawn maintenance. Avoid using your walnut tree for a child's swing or other recreational use. If you are planning a construction project, contact a certified arborist to get advice on how to best protect your trees.\n\nPesticide treatment - soil injections of a chemical pesticide - imidacloprid - may be effective at preventing attack by the walnut twig beetle only if the product is applied prior to any attack. Local tree service companies can inject the product directly into the trunk or soil so there is no direct public contact. The product can also be purchased through local garden centers and be applied by a homeowner as a soil drench. We recommend that you consult with a tree-care professional to determine the best care for your tree(s). Preventive sprays of permethrin, used extensively to protect trees against ips and mountain pine beetle, have not proven to be effective.\n\nWhat is the city doing for public walnut trees? The City of Boulder Urban Forestry staff conducts an annual Tree Health Survey to locate trees on both public and private property that have a potentially epidemic insect or disease problem. These are problems where prompt tree removal is the best method to prevent widespread infestation. In past years staff has looked for Dutch elm disease, ips beetle in spruce, pine wilt in Scotch pine, etc.\n\nAny public trees that are affected are removed promptly. All the public trees identified during our survey are now on a contract to be removed by September 15.\n\nWhat is the city doing to stop the spread of this complex? The best way to reduce the spread of this deadly complex is to remove dead or dying walnut trees to prevent new infestations. Property owners of known affected trees will be sent a letter requiring tree removal and proper wood disposal. Our city ordinance typically requires property owners to remove an infested/infected tree within 15 days of notification; due to the large number of affected trees the city is giving property owners 30 days to remove their trees and properly dispose of the wood.\n\nThe city will continue to monitor and remove all public walnut trees known to be infested. We will also continue to monitor private trees through our annual Tree Health Survey, issuing new letters requesting private tree removal as needed.\n\nCan I keep my walnut wood? Where can I get some walnut wood? All walnut wood must be disposed of properly otherwise beetles can still emerge from the cut wood and infest nearby walnut trees.\n\nIf you have received a letter requiring you to remove a walnut tree on your private property, the wood must be disposed of or extra steps taken to prevent emergence of the beetles. If you are a wood worker and want to keep smaller sections of wood, you must debark all wood, place all bark and wood waste in the trash and contact our office (City Urban Forestry at 303-441-4406) to have an inspector inspect the wood to ensure the beetles cannot complete their life cycle.\n\nWalnut wood cannot be kept for firewood within the City of Boulder or transported to other communities. If walnut wood is moved to another city, walnut trees there are at risk of attack.\n\nWhere can I bring my walnut wood? Because tree removal can be difficult and dangerous, we recommend you hire a reputable tree service company to do the removal. Hiring a company that is insured and licensed will both ensure proper disposal of all wood and reduce the risk of personal injury or property damage. The companies listed above have been notified about the walnut twig beetle/canker complex problem and understand all available wood disposal options.\n\nIf you have any further questions, please contact the City Urban Forestry office at 303-441-4406."

      "text": "Frances Smithson has written an informative article about crown gall disease in the April 1998 issue of The Potomac Rose, Newsletter of The Potomac Rose Society. In this article she tells about a local rose garden that lost more than 60 Peace rosebushes to this disease, how they diagnosed the problem and what they did to correct it. Smithson writes:\nWhile many of the diseases common to roses are caused by fungi, crown gall is the result of soil-borne bacteria. The bacteria enter the plant through an injury or wound that creates an opening into the plant near the ground. In addition to appearing at the crown of the plant and on the roots, the growths may also appear on canes above the ground...\nA rosebush infected with crown gall may not show symptoms initially. Because the galls often develop either below the ground or at ground level, they may not be observed until either the plant is declining of the gall grows large enough to be seen when being pruned or a gall is formed on a cane. Infected plants may appear stunted with smaller foliage and blooms and generally seem less healthy than in the past. This is caused by the gall cells growing and damaging the tissues of the plant, reducing the amount of water that can be transported through the plant...\nThere is no spray avilable to cure crown gall...\nThe general recommendation is that unless the rosarian has a strong emotional tie to the infected plant, it should be dug up and destroyed. Agrobacterium radiobacter, strain 84, has proved to be a successful biological control of crown gall when used as a soil drench or when a plant's roots are dipped in it prior to planting. (This product is available through the Helena Chemical Co., Fresno, CA, Tel: 209-453-9385, under the brand name Galltrol-A.)\n\nSummarized from Crown Gall, by A.P. Hert and J. B. Jones, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida USA in Encyclopedia of Rose Science: Crown gall is caused by bacteria called Agrobacterium tumefaciens, commonly found on apples, roses, raspberries, peaches and grapes. The bacteria are soilborne and can live in the soil or plant debris for 3 to 5 years years. Roses should not be planted in soil with a history of infection for 3 to 5 years. Soil can be steamed for an hour with water at 130 degrees F or replaced.\nThere are no chemical pesticides to control Agrobacterium tumefaciens, but biological control does provide some protection. Before planting, roots and crown can be dipped in a solution containing genetically modified related bacteria, Agrobacterium radiobacter, strain 84, that protect against infection.\nAerial galls on canes above the ground are rare. Cuttings from healthy-appearing parts of plants should not be used because Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been shown to move systemically into healthy parts of the plant."

It is a strong tree that retains its leaves late into autumn, making for a beautiful addition to the lawn.\n\nThe Cape Fear is also known to be a prolific variety. The precocious nature of the Cape Fear pecan tree means that from a young age, you can expect large harvests.\n\nThe Cape Fear ripens in mid to late October and is sure to attract wildlife to your yard. These pecan trees produce a large, thin shelled nut that cracks easily.\n\nThe packing tissue around the kernel separates very cleanly, which makes shelling trouble-free. Cape Fear averages 55 nuts per pound. The 51% kernels range in color from cream to golden, and are light and attractive.\n\nThe Cape Fear pecan tree has a good resistance to pecan scab and an average resistance to other leaf diseases.\n\nCape Fear should be cross-pollinated with a Type II pecan tree such as the Forkert, Stuart or Sumner. Cape Fear also make an excellent pollinator variety for many other pecan trees because of its long pollen shed period.\n\nMore information about planting and growing pecan trees is available from Bass.

This is because thereare some plants that sap water very fast and would thus dry up you well quickly this include trees such as eucalyptus\n\nWhat are the structures of the roots?\n\nThere are two types of tree roots, fibrous roots and tap roots…why are this is importance? Fibrous roots grow widthwise and would thus destroy any structures and affect any plants within a certain radius over time. Case have been observed where some tress destroy buildings\n\nThe climatic conditions\n\nVarious areas have various climatic conditions. There are arid, semi-arid and wet climates. There humid and windy conditions as well at temperature considerations. Lack of knowledge could for example cause you to plant trees that work well in wet areas in arid areas,this would in effect increase the cost of taking care of the trees or else they would fail\n\nDo leaves fall off?\n\nSome trees shed their leaves and flowers periodically as seasons change and this could mean extra work in terms of collecting leaves. So in case you do not want to do all this work all the time then avoid such trees\n\nDoes the tree whisper or crackle?\n\nIn times of wind some trees make a whispering or crackling noise which you really can do nothing about. Keeping this in mind it is good to consider whether you can put up with this reality\n\nHow long does a tree take to mature?\n\nSome trees especially hard woods take ages to grow into mature trees. Some may take as long as 25years to grow, so in case you are the impatient type please consider planting the faster growing varieties\n\nDoes it play host to caterpillars/ birds/wild bees\n\nSome tress play host to caterpillars and wild bees as well as birds whose very presence could either be annoying or entertaining…it is good to ask around to find out what animals like to inhabit such trees for example acacia trees attract weaver birds which can be quite noisy at times\n\nDoes it flower or produce? How often?\n\nPart of the beauty of trees is flowers and fruits. Not only to flowers bring beauty but could give a garden a sweet scent. Some fruits could also be eaten or sold for extra income. So in case any of these is of interest to you then plant such trees\n\nLevel of sedimentary rock\n\nOne of the reasons that plants fail is the fact that their growth might be stunted by sedimentary rocks beneath the surface. In case the sedimentary rock is near the surface then it is good to consider planting tree that do not have an elaborate tap root system"

Which is the hardiest variety?\n\nANSWER:\n\nIf you are referring to the Kwanzan or one of the many other oriental cherry trees that have made the Washington DC cherry blossom festival famous, we cannot help you. But if you are referring to one of the cherries native to Georgia, we can! The mission of the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center is to increase the sustainable use and conservation of native wildflowers, plants and landscapes.\n\nTo determine which cherries are native to your area visit our Native Plant Database and insert \"prunus\" where it requests \"Name\" and click \"Go\". A list of 32 plants in that Genus (cherries & plums) will be generated. Then \"Narrow your Search\" for Georgia and you will have 12 plants to choose from. Each plant on the list is linked to a detailed information page with images that will tell you about blooming and plant requirements. There is also range information available which will help you determine which is most hardy (some of them grow as far north as Canada). There is a link to the USDA website which shows a map of where each plant grows, as well, which will make that determination simpler.\n\nHere is an article on how to plant a tree from TreeHelp.com that will illustrate proper planting technique and one published by Tree Canada which has more information about care of your newly planted tree. What is most important for you as you have clay soil is to be sure that you don't overwater your newly planted tree. Clay soil does not have a lot of pore space so it can become saturated (plant roots need air as well as water) and it can retain water much longer than sandier soil.\n\nMore Trees"

      "text": "Dealing with Leaf Galls\n\nWhat Are Those Bumps on Your Tree's Leaves?\n\nLeaf galls are a frightening sight, but are not usually as serious as they appear. These bumps and deformations are usually the result of insects or mites feeding on the leaves. The gall itself is the plant's response to the irritation. It's not unlike the bump you get when an insect feeds on you, expect the leaf gall is not going to go away.\n\nDespite appearances, the insect is not living in the gall. In fact, it is very likely that once you notice the galls the insects have moved on. Before they do, they can do a lot of cosmetic damage to many plants and in particular trees. Many common trees are susceptible to leaf galls, especially in the spring. Maple, oak, elm, hackberry and others each are favored by a different insect that causes unsightly and intimidating galls.\nDamage will be greater following a mild winter, since more insects have survived and are hungry. Galls won't usually kill a tree, but they may cause early leaf drop. A healthy tree will send out new growth and recover.\n\nWhat Can You Do About Galls?\n\nSince the damage occurred before the gall formed, treatment is rarely recommended. If you have a reoccurring problems, you can spray your tree in early spring, to lessen the severity of the damage. Contact your local extension office for specific guidelines and recommendations in your area."

      "text": "Like many boys, I was a wannabe monkey who loved to climb high into the boughs of neighborhood\ntrees. One particularly impressive arboreal skyscraper across the street, however, was off-limits\nto my pals and me.\n\nThe tree was a towering honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos), about 60 feet tall, its trunk armored with spines. Ascending such\na plant would be a thorny problem indeed, and the tree's veneer of clustered spikes effectively\nkept children at bay.\n\nFew trees are as easily identified as the honeylocust. Its most noteworthy feature is the\nclusters of spines that beset the trunk. On older specimens, the thorns become multibranched and\ncan exceed a foot in length. Honeylocust leaves are, to use botanical-speak, \"twice compound.\" A\nleaf is made up of several laterally branching leaflets. The airy leaves of honeylocust create an\nopen canopy, which makes for an excellent shade tree.\n\nClusters of greenish-white flowers deck the tree in early summer and attract valuable\npollinating insects. Later, the conspicuous fruit forms. The flattened pods can be 8 inches long\nand resemble strips of bacon strung from the branches.In each pod are two neat rows of shiny brown\nbeans packed in rich pulp that tastes of mild honey. Once the pods fall, they are eagerly snatched\nby all manner of wildlife, including rabbits, raccoons and squirrels.\n\nHoneylocusts also attract amazing moths. All moths have a caterpillar stage, and the foliage of\nthe tree is essential fodder for at least a dozen species of moth caterpillars. A few of them eat\nonly honeylocust leaves. Perhaps the most beautiful of these is the bisected honeylocust moth. The\ncream-colored beauties sport gorgeous rose-pink underwings, and the antennae of males resemble\nlittle ferns. Most caterpillars never make it to the moth stage, though, because the warblers,\nvireos, tanagers and other songbirds snap them up.\n\nPutting seed in the feeder is only one way to feed birds; growing the right types of native\nplants fuels an entirely different crop of feathered friends.\n\nWhen pondering the honeylocust, an obvious question arises: Why all the thorns? We have to go\nback to the Pleistocene Epoch for the answer.\n\nIt is thought that the tree evolved its spiny defense system during the 2.5 million-year epoch,\nwhich ended about 12,000 years ago. Then, massive mammalian herbivores such as giant sloths roamed\nthe forests. The honeylocust's thorns acted as botanical concertina wire, keeping would-be\nplant-eaters out of the tree's crown and away from the fruit. Thus, the pods and seeds could ripen\nunmolested and fall to the ground, where animals such as peccaries and tapirs could eat them. As\nsome seeds passed through digestive tracts intact, the locust fruit eaters made for an effective\nmethod of transporting seeds to new sites.\n\nThe honeylocust is a well-formed beautiful tree. Although it no longer needs its thorns to fend\noff giant sloths, it is quite effective at thwarting adventure-seeking kids.\n\nIf you aren't worried about climbers, buy a thornless variety.\n\nNaturalist Jim McCormac writes a column for The Dispatch\non the first and third Sundays of the month"

      "text": "Carpinus betulus (European or common hornbeam) is a hornbeam native to Western Asia and central, eastern, and southern Europe, including southern England.[1] It requires a warm climate for good growth, and occurs only at elevations up to 600 metres (1,969 ft). It grows in mixed stands with oak, and in some areas beech, and is also a common tree in scree forests.\n\nContents\n\nIt is a small to medium-size tree reaching heights of 15–25 metres (49–82 ft), rarely 30 metres (98 ft), and often has a fluted and crooked trunk. The bark is smooth and greenish-grey, even in old trees. The buds, unlike those of the beech, are 10 mm long at the most, and pressed close to the twig. The leaves are alternate, 4–9 cm long, with prominent veins giving a distinctive corrugated texture, and a serrated margin. It is monoecious, and the wind-pollinated male and female catkins appear in early Summer after the leaves. The fruit is a small 7–8 mm long nut, partially surrounded by a three-pointed leafy involucre 3–4 cm long; it matures in autumn. The seeds often do not germinate till the spring of the second year after sowing. The hornbeam is a prolific seeder and is marked by vigorous natural regeneration.\n\nCarpinus betulus is a shade-loving tree, which prefers moderate soil fertility and moisture. It has a shallow, wide-spreading root system and is marked by the production of stump sprouts when cut back. Because it stands up well to cutting back and has dense foliage, it has been much used in landscape gardening, mainly as tall hedges and for topiary. The wood is heavy and hard, and is used for tools and building constructions. It also burns hot and slowly, making it a very suitable firewood.[2] This was the reason for lopping and hence indirectly the saving of Epping Forest, where the hornbeam was a favoured pollarding tree.\n\nCarpinus betulus is cultivated as an ornamental tree, for planting in gardens and parks. There are several cultivars, notably C. betulus 'Fastigiata' or 'Pyramidalis', a very fastigiate tree when young, which has become a popular urban street tree in the United Kingdom."

      "text": "var. Brown Turkey\n\nFicus carica Family: Moraceae Fig Tree, Brevo Origin: Southwest Asia\n\nA small tree native to southwest Asia. Widely grown for its fruit and is commercially grown in the United States in California, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. The fig was one of the first plants ever to be cultivated by humans. Fossilized figs dating to 9400-9200 BC were found in an early Neolithic village in the Jordan Valley.\n\nThe lovely lobed green leaves make it valuable in the landscape even without its fruit. They are very large, prominently veined and deeply lobed and may be 8 to 10 inches long. Most figs are deciduous during the winter months and drop their leaves in late December and resume growth in February and early March.\n\nThe fig fruit is actually a hollow receptacle with hundreds of small fleshy flowers facing each other on the inside. In their native habitat, figs are pollinated by a tiny gall wasp that enters the flower cluster through a small opening in the apex. Each flower then produces a small fruit containing the seeds. The wasp is not present in most of North America, so seeds are not produced.\n\nFigs are prized for their delicious fruit, which can be one to three inches in length, violet, brown or black. There are even varieties with yellow fruit. Most fruits are borne from early summer to late fall on new growth, and the fruits generally mature very quickly.\n\nFigs grow nicely and will bear fruit when grown in containers where they can be artfully pruned to create a living sculpture to decorate deck or patio. The fig makes a splendid patio or indoor plant that grows with little attention, save for constantly moist soil and bright light. Prefers alkaline, well-drained soil, but can tolerate wet conditions (waterlogging). Drought tolerant, once established. Mulch heavily with organic materials to conserve moisture, improve soil structure and reduce root knot nematode levels. Responds well to pruning and can be espaliered or pruned heavily in the dormant season for size control and to increase the main crop.\n\nTrees are very sensitive to frost when actively growing, but can withstand 10F when dormant. Young fig trees should be watered regularly until fully established.\n\nFigs will shade out anything growing beneath. Repeated pruning to control size causes loss of crop. Roots are greedy, traveling far beyond the tree canopy. For container grown plants, replace most of the soil in the tub every three years and keep the sides of the tub shaded to prevent overheating in sunlight.\n\n4417 Ficus carica - Fig Black Mission Fig Tree - dark fruit Black Mission variety. Introduced in California around 1770 from mission station in Baja. A hardy and easy to grow fruit tree, tolerates freeze. Black color fruit, with amber to strawberry color pulp.

      "text": "DE-ICING WITH SALT CAN HARM TREES\n\nAFTER a major snowstorm, many New Yorkers de-ice their walkways with rock salt. But according to the New York City Street Tree Consortium, they may not be aware of the severe damage this can do to neighborhood street trees.\n\n''Salt has the same effect on trees that it has on us,'' said Marianne Holden, the consortium's executive director. ''If we take in too much, it will make us thirsty. Likewise, it will create a droughtlike environment for trees.''\n\nThe sodium chloride in rock salt absorbs water in the soil and dehydrates a tree's roots. The damage, which may not be evident until late spring, is stunted growth, twig dieback and brown and black scorching of leaves.\n\nMs. Holden recommended using the plant fertilizer urea as a de-icing agent near trees, instead of salt. Urea, widely available at garden supply stores, costs about $4.25 for a five-pound bag.\n\nOther alternatives to rock salt are sand and cinders, Ms. Holden said. She warned, however, that both can be big cleanup problems in spring.\n\nThe calcium chloride pellets in cat litter are another alternative, Ms. Holden said. The chloride does cause some dehydration in tree roots, but it is not as damaging as salt. And calcium chloride can be used in smaller quantities.\n\nTo avoid damage from salt placed on sidewalks by municipal workers, Ms. Holden recommended removing all plowed snow from around tree pits or trunks. Concentrated salt in the snow could damage the trees. When removing the snow, she said, be careful not to nick trunks with a snow shovel, because the nick can be an entry point for disease.\n\nEarly in March, or in periods when the air and soil are above freezing, it is a good idea to water the soil around trees to leach out salt.\n\nThe New York City Street Tree Consortium includes environmental, horticultural and civic groups. It seeks to educate New Yorkers about caring for street trees. For more information, call 212-679-4481."

      "text": "Monday, November 5, 2012\n\nA flowering dogwood tree in autumn...\n\nThe bright red berries of a flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) tree bring a rush of everything autumn into my heart when I see them. When I was young, dogwood trees could be found everywhere. To me their airy branches and delicate spring blossoms were the most beautiful of all the flowering trees, and when the hot summer days were swept away by cool and crisp breezes and red and orange leaves danced in the forest, I couldn't wait for the burst of cheery red berries that would soon follow...\n\nThese berries are all from a dogwood tree I found while hiking around the lake at Greenbo Lake State Park in Kentucky during our annual fall trip. The tree was big, and I was excited when I turned the bend and found it. Around here, dogwood trees have succumbed to Dogwood Anthracnose, a fungal disease that stunts and often kills the tree. I remember back in the 80s when reports predicted dogwood trees might all be wiped out by the turn of the century, and it was all but hopeless. Luckily, some of the trees are surviving. A few seem to have a natural resistance to the fungus, while others seem to have survived because they are growing in a perfect location—sun, good air circulation, good drainage, yet sufficient water are all important. Since this tree was so big, there's no doubt location, location, location was in play because it didn't seem to have been affected by the fungus and its fruit production was substantial...\n\n...autumn leaves and red berries of the flowering dogwood add a splash of color to the fall woods.\n\nThe anthracnose fungus likes cool and moist conditions, and trees deep in shade are often more susceptible to infection. This tree was hugging the lake, but it was on a small promontory with nice sun exposure and plenty of air circulation. Because it's an understory tree, it was in partial shade, but the front faced the lake, which gave it access to extra sunlight. (Click here for a page on wet weather leaf diseases from the ODNR, which includes information on Dogwood Anthracnose.)\n\n...red berries of Cornus florida on a healthy tree in Greenbo Lake State Park in Kentucky.\n\nDogwood anthracnose (Discula destructiva) affects flowering dogwoods (Cornus florida) in the east, south, and parts of the midwest...and Pacific dogwoods (Cornus nuttallii) in the Pacific northwest. Click herefor information on how to identify and control Dogwood Anthracnose. The most common symptom of infection is \"spotting and blighting of the foliage,\" which shows asa tan spot on the leaf ringed in purple (click here for Cornell University's explanation).\n\nIn the 80s we were warned flowering dogwoods could someday disappear from our forests, so it's always wonderful to stumble across a large, healthy fruiting tree in the woods!\n\nThe disease was first identified in 1978 and through the 80s its spread was swift and thorough through the east, south and parts of the midwest, as well as parts of the Pacific northwest, but some trees exhibited a natural resistance to the fungus. In 1991 79% of the flowering dogwood trees in Catoctin Mountain park in Maryland were dead from the fungus, but a few escaped infection and were found to be resistant to the disease. Those trees became part of a study by the University of Tennessee Dogwood Research Team. The research team was able to produce an anthracnose-resistant tree called \"Appalachian Spring\" from clones of the Catoctin trees. In 2001 they planted many of the disease-resistant clones in the forest to help replace those lost to the disease (for more on this story, click hereand here). The University of Tennessee Dogwood Research Team, chaired by Dr. Mark Windham, a professor at the University of Tennessee, is still working to improve and protect dogwoods from all diseases (click here for a recent article on what they are doing now).\n\nThese bright red berries stand out like fruit flags to migrating birds. The berries are nutritious and full of fat and can help fuel their long flights south.\n\nNutritional quality among berries differs. Dogwood berries are high in fat and calories. They ripen in late summer and early fall and are a favorite among migrating birds such as thrushes and catbirds, according to Geoffrey A. Hammerson in \"Connecticut Wildlife: Biodiversity, Natural History, and Conservation\" (page 366). Hammerson also mentions not all birds can handle high-fat diets; e.g., American Robins absorb digested fats poorly, so the bright red dogwood berries are probably not their first choice in berries, which is good because it leaves more of the berries for the migratory species traveling long distances that need them (...and all this time, I thought a berry was pretty much a berry). If Dogwood trees and their berries disappear from the forests, they will leave a hole in many migrating birds' diets.\n\nIt sounds like these beautiful trees now have a fighting chance. Let's hope they survive, not only so we can continue to enjoy their beautiful spring blossoms and brightly colored autumn berries, but more importantly, so migrating birds have a ready source of high-fat fruit to fuel their journey south in the fall.\n\n15 comments:\n\nOh Kelly... I hope that dogwood tree problem doesn't get to Tennessee. As you know, we have LOTS and LOTS of dogwoods here... I love them. We have a beautiful pink dogwood in our front yard... I would hate to lose it....\n\nBeautiful photos and interesting information, Kelly. As I began the post, I was wondering if the berries were fruit for birds and you answered my question. I love dogwoods, and we have two growing in our yard that we planted. I don't remember them having red berries, so I wonder if they are a different type"

Oleasters make gorgeous lawn ornaments and are able to withstand city living. E. angustifolia, the Russian Olive, is a vigorous growing tree native to Asia and Europe. This tree usually has more than one trunk that eventually becomes gnarled and covered with dark brown, shaggy bark. This variety, when grown as a single-trunked tree, can grow up to 25 feet high. It can also be grown with multiple trunks or as a large shrub, ultimately reaching a height of 12 to 15 feet. The attractive, Willow-like foliage of the Russian Olive is pale silvery gray. Each slender leaf grows 11/2 to 31/2 inches long. In early summer, the stems are lined with small, fragrant bright yellow flowers. These are followed by edible, sweet, yellow, 1/2-inch berries that are devoured by birds. Multi-trunked trees are strong windbreaks for rugged climates. E. commutata (Silverberry), a native of North America, forms a shrub that grows up to 15 feet high. The Silverberry produces shimmery foliage and blossoms.\n\nPOTTING: These plants need full sun and will grow in almost any well drained soil; however, loamy soil is the best.\n\nPROPAGATION: Seeds can be sown in pots of sandy soil set in a greenhouse, in the spring. Varieties can be increased by short cuttings of semi-ripe or firm shoots and set in a warm greenhouse or cold frame, in August. Grafting may also be done in the spring."

A special open house called the Bloom-Time Festival is held in May when the 200 crabapple specimens are in bloom. This collection was first established in 1952 when the Hort. Farm was purchased. The large trees along the main entrance road were the first specimens planted.\n\nA crabapple is a small apple; not different from apple trees. They are edible. Early crabapples were selected for eating. Crabapples are also grafted like apples, not planted from seed. So different rootstocks produce different heights, sizes, and dwarfed varieties.\n\nHere at the HRC, pruning practices are basically \"let them be what they want to be.\" There is no pruning except for maintenance pruning (diseased, dying, dead, and damaged wood; and rootsuckers). The majority of trees here are well over 25 years old, so this collection displays what mature trees look like.\n\nThis collection shows that it is a four season plant, with interesting characteristics all year round, and a wide variety of leaf colors, fruit colors, and fruit size. Homeowners can come here to see their characteristics and see its potential before they buy it.\n\nThe fruit on some trees are persistent, and make a great source of food for wildlife. Having a variety of crabapples whose fruit mature at different times is important to wildlife who need to eat the fruit at different times of the year.\n\nCedar apple rust is a fungi that can negatively impact crabapples and apples; which can result in yellow and orange leaf spots, and lesions on the fruit. The fungus overwinters in galls on alternate hosts Juniperus virginiana (whose common name is eastern redcedar), J. horizontalis, and J. scopulorum. In the spring, the fungi spores are liberated and can then attack crabapple trees. As with apples, new disease resistant cultivars are being developed.\n\nSome crabapples planted here in the 1950's are still sold today for human consumption (jams, jellies, etc.) The crabapple is a very popular ornamental tree in the north country."

Zone 13 on the plant zone map reflects the warmest region indicating a warmer winter temperature limit of survival while Zone 1 reflects the coldest region indicating a colder winter temperature limit of survival. The USDA rating system was recently updated with data measured at weather stations during the 30-year period, 1976-2005.\n\nSo, what are the implications of the new USDA Hardiness Zone Map? Previously, the southern half of the state was in Zone 5 and the northern half was in Zone 4. Only a few counties in the northern Panhandle are in Zone 4 on the new map, or put another way, 90 percent of the state is now in Zone 5. Whether you agree or not, the new hardiness zone map does reflect a global warming trend, but more importantly to the gardener this information means planting marginally hardy plants like peaches and apricots, is less risky in most of Nebraska. An ornamental tree favored by many gardeners is the magnolia tree. Nurserymen have often considered one magnolia species, Magnolia acuminata, worth trying on protected sites in southeastern Nebraska. Armed with new USDA hardiness zone ratings, residents of central Nebraska may want to try planting this beautiful species. No doubt, many gardeners and landscapers will have their own list of favorite, but marginally hardy plants which now may be worth planting.\n\nEven though the USDA rating system gives gardeners and landscapers a predictable temperature range for plants that might survive in each zone, don't always accept the information as gospel. Remember the USDA system is based on average minimum temperatures and not on the extreme minimum temperatures that can occur in each zone. You may find this information along with the USDA zone recommendation on plant labels that you purchase at your local nursery or garden center. So don't overlook all of this valuable information for your locale when predicting whether the plants you select will survive over many years.\n\nMany variables, like extended drought prior to arrival of winter weather, will influence how well a plant withstands extreme winter conditions, so visiting with respected plant experts may help you make a wise decision. And speaking of wise decisions, please don't overlook the possibility that your favorite plant is potentially invasive. Land managers already have a long list of noxious and invasive plants to battle, so please don't plant a species that could one day overwhelm a local ecosystem."

      "text": "Force the issue\n\nThe sunny yellow blooms of Forsythia are the quintessential harbinger of spring.\n\nForcing tree branches to bloom weeks before Mother Nature's plan is a fun and easy project, bringing the outside garden inside, with a profusion of flowers to chase away the winter blahs. Once the flowering shrubs and trees have had several months of cold weather, their dormancy successfully can be broken.\n\nEarly spring flowering trees and shrubs form their flower buds in the fall, before the plants go dormant. The later in the winter you cut the branches, the shorter the forcing time is needed.\n\nAlmost any branch that blooms can be forced. Among suitable common shrubs and trees are forsythia, flowering dogwood, star magnolia, saucer magnolia, apple, crabapple, and flowering cherry.\n\nForcing is simply cutting the bare branches and placing them in warm water indoors. Look for plump buds; the more developed they are, the quicker they will come into bloom indoors. The best time to cut branches is mid-day, when the temperature is above freezing.\n\nChoose branches from crowded areas of the plant when possible, since you will be removing some of the plant's natural spring beauty. Select those that will improve the symmetry of the tree or shrub. Very often, cutting some lower branches will enable you to walk under your tree more easily. Branches that cross one another and those that extend out too far from the shrub are good choices.\n\nThe branches you cut can be short, or long, depending on your vase. Just remember that you have to live with this plant all year long and you want it to be attractive.\n\nGET THE SHEARS\n\nUse pruning shears to cut the branches. After they're cut, they will begin to form a scab. One by one, recut one-half- to one inch off each branch, then split the cut ends for several inches to increase the surface area and encourage the branches to take up water; you want a fresh cut, so each branch can absorb lots of water. Remove any buds or twigs that would be under water and make sure the water is warm. Change it every few days to minimize bacteria development.\n\nOn Jan. 30, I cut several magnolia branches to begin forcing them. I noticed some plump flower buds on the stems and thought that they could very possibly reward me with some early blooms. By Feb. 13, a few of the buds started to show some magenta color on their tips, and I anticipated the flowers would soon be in full bloom.\n\nWrong! More buds began to show color, but the buds were reluctant to open more fully for another 10 days despite my coaxing and \"huffing\" some of my warm breath on them. In retrospect, I should have waited until March to take some magnolia branches and allowed a longer time period for blooming.\n\nFORCING FORSYTHIA\n\nThe forsythia was a totally different story. On Feb. 9, I cut a multitude of branches for forcing. The best method of pruning forsythia is by cutting several of the largest canes to the ground each year. Your forsythia will maintain a natural-looking shape in this manner and avoid having a chopped-off look.\n\nBy Feb. 18, the gorgeous yellow flowers started to open; three days later, every branch was fully open with a fabulous display of blooms. At that point, I regretted cutting so many branches at the same time. Had I taken one-fourth as many that day, I could have cut another fourth two weeks later, and so on, and had fresh forsythia blossoms from the middle of February until the actual blooming of the shrub, probably in late March or early April.\n\nYou may notice that some of your cut branches may begin to root during the forcing period. If you would like a new plant to share with a friend, remove the branch from the water when the roots are ┬╝ to ~ inches long. Trim the branch so that it is about 6 to 8 inches long and then pot up individually.\n\nKeep your new plant moist until permanent roots are formed; when warm weather arrives, the new plant can be planted outdoors. I would recommend you sink the entire pot with the new plant into the ground for protection for a year or two, until it is established and large enough to be permanently planted in the garden.\n\nHave fun on these dreary winter days by cutting a few branches of both flowering and non-flowering trees and shrubs each week. You'll be rewarded by an early spring indoors and given a \"jump-start\" on the most beautiful season of the year.\n\nGARDEN NOTES\n\nFrom tomorrow until April 12, the Orchid Show, \"Brazilian Modern,\" will be staged at the New York Botanical Garden.

They may be trees which grow on council owned property, but can be anywhere, including besides canals, railways, rivers and in private gardens.\n\nThe UK has strong legislation to protect trees, woods and conservation areas which give local planning authorities (LPA's) powers to protect trees, either in groups or single specimens. It is a similar power which protects listed buildings, and anyone can ask for a tree to be 'TPO'd'. To do so you must contact your local LPA (Emergency TPO's can be granted if the application is 'urgent').\n\nIf you own a tree which has a TPO, you may still carry out work on it, provided you have applied to the LPA, making a good cases as to why the tree needs to have work carried out i.e. it is dangerous or diseased etc.\n\nAny trees may have a TPO placed on them, including trees in hedgrows.

Plenty of homeowners have seen their prized plants shriveling, and their trees shedding leaves.\n\nCBS 2's Suzanne Le Mignot has some tips to help homeowners protect their trees from the dry conditions.\n\nHomeowner Sue Paist's Norway Maple tree has started showing signs of scorching from the hot, dry weather. Its leaves are browning and crumbling to the touch, just one of many signs of stress that many homeowners have seen in their trees, due to the drought.\n\n\"We were just really trying to take care of it this summer, because of the heat and drought,\" Paist said.\n\nShe has been working hard to make another tree in her yard — a sapling and an endangered species of plant — survives during the latest heat wave.\n\n\"We have to water it every day, a lot … because it's a baby,\" she said.\n\n\"In the next year or two, it'll start to establish more on your lawn, and you'll probably want to get rid of some of that grass, put a mulch ring down and you'll be fine,\" she said.\n\nTaylor said some of the major signs of trees in distress are leaves that are browning, curling, and wilting.\n\n\"I never really spent much time water trees in the past, now we have to spend a lot of time,\" Paist said.\n\nShe is not alone. At the Morton Arboretum, workers have been busy watering the plants during this summer's drought. There have only been 11 inches of rain there this year, compared to 22 inches last year, and it's taken a toll.\n\nTaylor said as little as one inch of water per week can keep an established tree healthy.\n\n\"It'll keep it alive during these drought periods, just because that water does percolate down about six or eight inches,\" Taylor said.\n\nIt's new trees that need more water, to help their roots grow.\n\n\"Anything you put in this year, those are what don't really have established root systems into the soil, so those are the key plants to keep watering, if you can,\" she said.\n\nExperts also advise homeowners and gardeners not to plant anything new right now, but instead wait until fall"

In a world where we are packed together in zero lot line homes like so many sardines, hedges divide us and give us something we cherish — privacy. They can make our property a place where children can play and adults can frolic by the pool and barbeque without the prying eyes of our neighbors.\n\nWhen you think of a hedge, you probably think of well-manicured hedges cut at just the proper height and perfect angle. These hedges are a monoculture and up until very recently in South Florida were most likely to be ficus hedges.\n\nThe ubiquitous ficus hedge, made up of the species Ficus benjamina, is a terrible hedge because of its propensity to be attacked and defoliated by the Ficus Whitefly. But even before the Ficus Whitefly came calling, the ficus hedge was a poor choice because it grew so fast that it needed constant trimming, and its roots sometimes caused structural damage. Ficus benjamina are, after all, trees and not shrubs and will grow to heights of 50 feet if given the correct space and nutrients.\n\nNow that the king of hedges has lost its crown, we must rethink the way we create privacy around our homes.\n\nEnter the informal hedge, consisting of multiple species of plants that are not pruned to a set level. Rather the hedge is allowed to grow at its natural height. The informal hedge will never look as tidy as its stuffy cousin, the formal hedge, but it brings a multitude of benefits.\n\nThe informal hedge is composed of several species of plants that all grow about the same height and should be staggered slightly and not planted on a direct line.\n\nBelow is information about a number of plants that work well in the informal hedge. When used together, these plants will bring butterflies, many species of birds and other wildlife to your home.\n\nThere is also no need to prune this hedge because your goal isn't a stuffy square or rectangle; instead, it is simply a natural barrier between you and the rest of the world. Birds? Butterflies? No maintenance? Yes, yes and yes. The informal hedge is the next step in the evolution of your yard. With the planting season just around the corner in late April, why not start planning your informal hedge today?\n\nUse the plants below in combination based on height and watch your garden come alive with activity. None of these plants needs irrigation or fertilizer once it becomes established.\n\n• West Indian Cherry, Prunus myrtifolia. This native tree is fast-growing and an excellent screen. The leaves are glossy and the fruit are much prized by many species of birds. Despite the name, the fruit is not edible and should be left to the birds. The tree can reach heights of 25 feet and is columnar with a spread of only 8 feet.\n\n• Florida Boxwood, Schaefferia frutescens. This is a Florida native that is underused. Its leaves are small and dark green and the plant has small white flowers that produce fruit that will attract several species of birds. The growth rate is moderate and the plant can reach heights of ten feet with a width of eight feet. Full sun is best, but it will do well in partial shade.\n\n• Firebush, Hamelia patens. The firebush is one of the best native plants in South Florida. Whenever anyone asks me for a great landscape plant, this one is always on my short list. Its small, red, tubular flowers give the plant its name and appear in great quantities year round. The flowers attract butterflies and hummingbirds. The 10-foot tree is highly manageable through pruning and can be kept as a 3- to 4-foot shrub. The firebush makes an excellent screen. The leaves are green with an occasional red blush and the trunk is an attractive dark brown. If the firebush is planted near the native passionflower Passiflora suberosa, you will have a complete habitat for the zebra longwing butterfly. This plant does best in full sun"

      "text": "Boxwood blight update\n\nA new study shows some varieties are exhibiting tolerance to the plant pathogen.\n\n|\nNovember 14, 2012\n\nA recent report from the North Carolina State University Cooperative Extension showed considerable variability in the susceptibility of boxwoods (Buxus spp.) to boxwood blight. This fungus is often referred to as Cylindrocladium buxicola, the name it was given in the U.K., where it was first observed. It is also sometimes referred to as C. pseudonaviculatum.\n\nBoxwood blight is only recently introduced to North America. The first confirmed finding was in October 2011. The disease can cause significant leaf drop and stem lesions creating bare and brown patches. It has been discovered in 10 states (Conn., Ohio, Ore., Mass., Md., N.C., N.Y., R.I., Pa. and Va.) and three Canadian provinces (BC, ON, QC).\n\nThe researchers evaluated 23 varieties of boxwood at the Mountain Horticultural Crops Research and Extension Center in Mills River, N.C., during summer 2012. They trialed several species of boxwood grown as ornamentals: B. microphylla, B. sempervirens and B. sineca. The sempervirens types tended to be more susceptible to blight, said Dr. Kelly Ivors, associate professor and extension specialist with the Department of Plant Pathology at N.C. State University, one of the researchers involved in the study.\n\n\"Essentially, the main point we found was the two most common boxwood varieties grown in U.S. are most susceptible to the disease,\" Ivors said. \"We almost have a monoculture of these two types that helps the fungus get around. When we looked at microphylla, those types tend to be more tolerant.\"\n\nB. sempervirens 'Suffruticosa' was found to be the most susceptible to boxwood blight. Unfortunately, Suffruticosa (common boxwood or English boxwood) is the mostly commonly planted boxwood variety in the U.S. However, nine of the 23 varieties trialed were determined to be \"moderately tolerant\" to \"tolerant.\" The most tolerant is B. microphylla var. japonica 'Green Beauty.'\n\nHowever, not all sempervirens varieties were classified susceptible or highly susceptible. One takeaway from the study is that plant canopy is very important.\n\n\"A couple of the sempervirens species that are tall and upright, like the 'Dee Runk' are becoming more popular,\" Ivors said. \"They tend to be more tolerant because they are upright and tall. They have more airspace in their canopy. The resistance is dependent on genetics and the density of the canopy.\"\n\nLooking forward\n\nThe results of the research lead Ivors to anticipate a change in the varieties of boxwood that will be propagated.\n\n\"Homeowners like English and American boxwood, but they are harder to grow commercially because they don't have a lot of disease resistance,\" she said. \"In another 10-20 years, I think they will become like an heirloom variety.\n\n\"As we see boxwood blight established in landscapes, growing and field production of these more tolerant varieties will probably become a key strategy for some growers because they will be able to plant these more tolerant varieties in landscapes that already have boxwood blight and they won't defoliate,\" Ivors said. \"If you can start putting some of these varieties out in the field now, in four to 10 years, you'll be able to sell these to those particular areas where BB has become a big problem.\"\n\nThe N.C. State group of researchers is currently working on another boxwood blight-related project. Ivors said the group wants to be able to provide recommendations for commercially available fungicides that commercial growers could use for preventing infection in production areas.\n\nThe data is still being finalized, and she estimates the research will be ready to be published in about a month."

The same would apply to Texas native trees. Perhaps you were referring to nut trees only? In that case, from the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center Plant Database, we learned that Juglans nigra (black walnut), Carya texana (black hickory), and Carya illinoinensis (pecan) are all nut trees native to Texas, which makes three. Then we started looking at the same Database for trees that were considered native to Texas. We found 30 trees, including the above-named nuts, three elms, four oaks, another walnut, two pines and many others that are familiar to students of Texas native trees. If you were asking about two trees native exclusively to Texas, we found two oaks, Quercus buckleyii and Q. graciliformis, but no pecans.\n\nWe're sorry we couldn't answer the question about \"which is the other truly native Texas tree?\" Maybe there is another qualifier to that question that we don't know about.

The\nrust fungus requires two different tree species to complete its\nlifecycle. On the\nprimary host, juniper or red cedar, the fungus infects leaves\nand soft shoots, becomes perennial in the living bark and causes\nswellings that\ngirdle twigs and small branches. During damp weather in April\nand May, orange spore masses emerge from infected, swollen juniper\ntwigs and may\nbe splashed or blown to hawthorn, one of the alternate hosts.\nOn the hawthorn, this fungus causes distortion of fruit, twigs,\nand buds. Fruits become\nshrunken and often die; twigs become enlarged and woody. Pinkish-orange\ntubes, about the size of a pencil lead, protrude from affected\nfruits and twigs and shed orange spores that are splashed or blown\nback to the\njuniper, completing the life cycle of this rust fungus.\n\nEffective control of this fungal disease includes both cultural\nand chemical approaches.\n\nPlanting resistant varieties when installing new trees will\nreduce the need to invest time and money into chemical control. The\nfollowing\nHawthorns have shown some degree of resistance to rust.\n\nIf rust is a chronic problem causing poor tree vigor, registered\nfungicides may be used on the hawthorn. These fungicides are\npreventive and must be applied several times during early spring to\nmaintain a protective\ncoating on developing twigs and fruit. Fungicides such as chlorothalonil,\nmancozeb or triadimefon, when used regularly during infection\nperiods, will help control hawthorn rust. When spring weather is dry\nfungicide\napplications are generally not required. Read and follow label\ninstructions regarding amounts of fungicide, method of application,\nand safety precautions."

It is a deciduous tree growing to 20–30 m tall with a trunk up to 1.5 m diameter, and a broad, rounded crown. The bark is grey-brown and shallowly grooved; unlike many other maples, mature trees do not tend to develop a shaggy bark.\n\nInvasive Species\n\nAcer platanoides is a decidous maple, native to Europe. It is commonly planted as an ornamental along streets and in parks. It has escaped and invaded natural forested habitats all over North America. The dense canopy of A. platanoides's shades out native species and the shallow root system prevents native species from establishing. Its foliage releases toxins that alter the soils fungal and microbial composition. The full impact of this species has not been seen yet as the majority of Acer platanoides are still in the sapling stage awaiting openings in the canopy.\n\nThe leaves are packed around apples, rootcrops etc to help preserve them;\nThe trees are fairly wind tolerant and are often used in to give protection from the wind in mixed shelterbelts; They are fast-growing and rapidly produce a screen;\nA rose coloured dye is obtained from the bark;\nWood - hard, heavy, fine grained.

      "text": "Making a Tree Identification by means of studying its bark and fruit\n\nTrees can also be identified by its bark. Therefore, you are ready to explore the power of touch! Touch the bark of the tree and try to feel the texture of the crust. It could be uniform, with spines, scales, smooth or ribbed. This method could be useful in the case of trees that have reached their age of maturity. You may experience different patterns when you touch the tree bark. The color of the bark can also be a parameter in the identification of trees.\n\nFor example, if you try to peel birch bark, which breaks down into small strips in the horizontal direction. When you try to peel birch bark, leaves and large strips and expose the layers of pink-orange underneath. You will experience how different types of bark peel in different ways.\n\nSome trunks are unique in appearance, therefore, can be readily identified. Examples of these are the acacia trees and the tree of Hercules-club. In this case, the identification by the bark is not interesting enough, could also attempt to identify flowering trees.\n\nAnother way to identify trees is by studying fruit. Oaks produce acorns. Therefore, if you know what it looks like an acorn, they could easily identify an oak. Fruits can be classified into several types: berries, Bacatá pepo hesperidium, drupe and seed are just a few categories. Everyone knows what they appear to berries. The fleshy pericarp is a part of it. This is the wall of the ovary of the fruit, which softens when ripe.\n\nThe Bacata include fruits such as bananas and avocados. Watermelon, pumpkin and other fruit in the Cucurbitaceae family can be identified with their hard and thick crusts. Citrus fruits like oranges and lemon are classified hesperidium.\n\nDrupes include mangoes, almonds and coconut. These fruits have seeds with a hard coating layer around them. Nugget is made up of fruits such as pear and apple. The core of the fruit is covered by an edible tissue called hypanthium. You can also identify trees by their fruits. The hickory trees could be identified by their fruits.\n\nThus, identification of trees would be easier if you learn the different parts of a tree. Identifying their leaves, fruits, bark and how it grows. Therefore, look in your field and start to enrich their knowledge of tree identification. It's time to go green."

      "text": "Officials tracking tree fungus\n\nTrent Williams, Summerside, Prince Edward Island horticulturalist, collects samples of what he suspects may be Anthracnose, a fungus that may be affecting Island maple trees. (Photo: The Journal Pioneer)\n\n\"I have seen some trees symptomatic here of that,\" says Trent Williams, the city's horticulturalist.\n\nResidents in the western end of the Island have been noticing many maple trees are losing their foliage weeks ahead of schedule and one cause was put forward as being a fungus known as anthracnose.\n\nSeveral trees within Summerside have been flagged as potentially suffering from the affliction.\n\nBut Williams is hesitant to say for sure what is causing so many maple trees to defoliate because there could be a number reasons for it. Trees can lose their leaves for other reasons, such as blight or tar spots, he said.\n\nSamples are being collected today (Aug. 18) and will be sent to Charlottetown for testing. Williams should have the results by the end of the week.\n\nAnthracnose is not something he has seen before during his time in Summerside, he said. But there have been suspected cases in the past.\n\n\"It's not rare but it's not extremely common, I mean not from what I've seen over the years. However, it is a fungal disease and conditions are right.\"\n\nAnthracnose can strike several species of trees. In maples it dries out the leaves causing them to turn brown and die from the centre stem out.\n\nThe fungus is not usually deadly for trees, but it can cause them to die if it returns over several consecutive growing seasons.\n\nWilliams said one of the only ways to combat the fungus is by treating a tree with lime sulphur in the spring. He also advised that anyone with a suspected tree to clean up fallen leaves as soon as possible to avoid spreading the fungus.\n\nDutch elm worries\n\nSome Summerside residents will be receiving letters next week informing them one or more of their trees has tested positive for Dutch elm disease. The city has already destroyed a small number of trees this summer that have tested positive and have been doing ongoing testing for the destructive disease.\n\nA tree with less than 30 per cent infection has a slim chance of being saved, but trees with more than 30 per cent infection will have to be destroyed.\n\nComments\n\nCarol Goodwin\n\n- August 31, 2010 at 14:48:40\n\nBoth tar spot and anthracnose have been occuring together on maples in Nova Scotia for four or five years now - it probably just blew over to PEI from here! Norway maples are particularly susceptible, but red and sugar maples are affected as well. Shifts in disease incidence are expected with global warming - all the more reason to make sure we don't overplant any one species cook\n\n- August 29, 2010 at 10:10:26\n\nI have a tree that is a norway maple and has been affected by tar spot in past years but especially this year. However, none of the ornamental japanese maples such as Amur, Bloodgood, Inaba Shidare, etc. are affected by that disease. Kevin\nThe Honey Tree Nursery"

The Brazil tree has a long life and it can live for about 500 years. This tree is large and so the branches and the leaves of this tree are very high. Unlike other trees you can touch the branches and leaves of Brazil tree. The tree is so beautifully large that is rainy days it acts like a canopy and the travelers of old times were found to rest under the tree of Brazil nut. The leaves of this tree are beautiful and waxy. They have a yellow orchid at the end of the leaf. When the flower is pollinated the fruit produced in called Brazil nut. One of the largest trees of Brazil nut which grows in the tropical jungle is about 165 ft tall and it bears fruit after 20 years and the tree has a life of 5-800 years. The kind and quality of tree depends on the ecological system and reproduction of the tree. Because the real fruit takes a long time to grow, many researchers and scientist tried the plantation but is was never successful so all the Brazil nuts throughout the world are natural.\n\nThe process of pollination is very different. There are some special species of bees which can pollinate the flowers of Brazil nuts, the main reason why scientist couldn't use the plantation method over Brazil nut trees. The process which involves the production of these nuts is strange and somehow unknown too. Like mentioned above that only a specific type of bee specia can pollinate these flowers, there is a strange kind of specie which can chew these hard fruit pod and disperse these seeds.\n\nThe most interesting fact about the Brazil nut is that it's the seed of the tree it grows on. There are pods with the size of man's hand and one pod contains around 30 seeds. The collectors of Brazil nuts have to wait till the pod drops on the ground because the tree is very large. But the pod is so hard that if it falls on your head, it can kill you. Not throughout the world but in the countries mentioned above where Brazil nuts are grown in abundance, Brazil nut processing is among the largest and most developed industry. The industry thus provides job opportunities to many people and also offers alternative to their jobs.Bedemco is the world's largest supplier of Brazil nuts and the only supplier which offers new types and kinds of Brazil nuts. They also offer products made up of Brazil nuts and export them throughout the world."

      "text": "FAQ: Tree House Packages\n\n2. How big is the log? Answer: Each log is different, but they are typically 4' in diameter and 6' tall.\n\n3. How big is it inside? Answer: The clubhouse floor measures 4'x5'. The height at the peak of the ceiling is about 6'; an adult can stand straight up inside with room to spare. The Holt Hideout features a lower clubhouse with a 5'x6' floor, a 5'x6' balcony, and a 4'x5' floor in the upper clubhouse. Whether you have 1-2 kids or 5-6 kids or even more, we have a design that will accommodate your needs.\n\n4. How much does it weigh? Answer: Clubhouses weigh anywhere from 1,100-1,600 lbs. Most logs weigh about 2,500-3,500 lbs. Some normal size logs can weigh as much as 7,000 lbs. The heaviest log we ever brought in weighed 26,000 lbs!\n\n5. How long does it take for my order to arrive? Answer: Typically from 6-8 weeks.\n\n6. Can I make custom requests? Answer: Absolutely! Many of our standard options actually came from special requests.\n\n7. What age group do you recommend for your tree houses? Answer: We recommend all ages! Kids or no kids, they make incredible additions to any landscape!\n\n8. What kind of trees do you use? Answer: We primarily use oak, pine and eucalyptus trees. Each kind works equally well.\n\n9. Where do you find trees that big? Answer: We find them all over the central coast of California. Since we only use dead or dying trees it makes the search harder, but we have developed several ways to locate them.\n\n10. Are you allowed to cut down trees that big? Answer: We only use recycled logs! Any log we receive must be dead or dying before we'll accept it. The only other situation in which we acquire a log is when its alternative fate would either be a trip to a local landfill or firewood cutter.\n\n11. If I buy a tree house and later sell my home, will you help me move it? Answer: We recommend that you sell your tree house with your home (after all, it will add value to your property) and order a new one from us!\n\n12.How many kids can fit inside? Answer: For a base model tree house, 3 kids fit OK; the 4th one will make things a little crowded. There are several ways to accommodate larger crowds though.\n\n13.What does it look like inside of the clubhouse? Answer: They typically look something like this but feel free to call us about painting or theming out the interior to make it your own!\n\n14.I live on the other side of the country or out of the country. Can you ship the tree house to me still? Answer: Absolutely. We can ship worldwide. If shipped within the US, shipping rates vary from $500-$3300 in most cases. We can ship to most overseas ports for $3500-$4500.\n\n15. Can a Tree House Package come with electricity?\n\nAnswer: Yes. But why stop there when we can hook you up for cable and internet?"

Our experts know how to remove just the right branches to assure the tree's health and beauty when the spring growth emerges. Best of all, we reduce the cost of pruning performed in the winter, since there is less debris to remove.\n\nFruit Tree Pruning – Fruit trees should be pruned by the end of February. This will allow the fruit to develop on the healthy, remaining branches in the spring. Absent consistent winter pruning, the fruit production will decline because the tree's energy will be diverted in part to non-productive or damaged branches.\n\nGet on Our List for Spring Aeration and Fertilization – Sign up now for spring aeration of compacted soil around trees and fertilization. This will allow water and nutrients to reach the root systems early in the growing season and will make your trees more resistant to drought in the summer months.\n\nFor our Business and Commercial Property Owners – Remember, we can handle not only your tree care needs, but we can also handle snow and ice removal.

      "text": "The Sun is Shining . . . but Wait Awhile\n\n4022012\n\nGet out there and prune!\n\nWe always seem to get this great burst of sunshine and moderate temperatures in February, a gift I say, from Mother Nature allowing us a glimpse out of the darkness of winter and into the spring days ahead. The key, my friends, is to remember it's a GLIMPSE. Don't go crazy out there and start pulling back mulch and planting your spring seeds yet. YES, absolutely if you have a coldframe or some other garden protection get those brassicas started! But for those everyday people with an itch to plant, wait awhile, the weather isn't ready to cooperate fully yet.\n\nIt IS time to get out there and prune though. Apples, pears, blueberries, and the like are all ready for their seasonal trim. If you are lucky enough to have a resistant peach give it awhile more, they don't rebound well when pruned and then hit by a hard frost. Take a look at your tree and make a plan before you make any cuts. Tying different colored ribbon to limbs helps mark those that stay and those that go. Remember, the rule of thumb is no more than a third of the tree can be pruned at a time, but don't be afraid to make the necessary choices especially in shaping new trees. The choices you make now will effect future growth, disease resistance, production, and yield. Make sure you have sharpened your loppers and pruners before starting as a sharp, clean cut is one of the keys to a good pruning job. Carry a bottle of rubbing alcohol in your back pocket and clean the blades between trees. One of the quickest ways to spread disease is through cross-contamination. Check for breakage and split limbs, they've gotta go as they are a doorway for pest and disease.\n\nNeed a \"how to\" on pruning? Check out Urban Abundances Fruit Tree Stewards Program, you give them a few hours in the community and they teach you the proper techniques to pruning! A fair trade if there ever was one. \n\nNo matter your garden decision, to plant, not to plant, prune now in the sunshine or wait until next week and do it in the rain, GET OUT THERE and enjoy this window of wonderful weather we have been granted once again this February."

      "text": "Since the launch of the Great Plant Picks program eight years ago, almost 500 plants have been selected as the most reliable garden-worthy plants that can be grown in the maritime Pacific Northwest. This unique awards program brings together more than thirty horticultural professionals from nurseries, botanical gardens, and the landscape industry to identify the best choices for gardens from Eugene, Oregon, to Vancouver, British Columbia, and from the Cascade Mountains to the Pacific Coast. This year, ninety-one plants have been added to the comprehensive list of Great Plant Picks. These picks represent several collections of related plants, and others resulting from plant evaluations held throughout the region in the last few years.\n\nSmall Trees for Small Gardens\n\nFlowers of American fringe tree Chionanthus virginicus (FS)\n\nMany of this year's picks are excellent options for the urban landscape. Despite their size, smaller gardens can hold an array of interesting yet easy-to-care for ornamentals. Trees must be chosen carefully, considering scale, branching structure, and seasonal interest, to get the most from these pinnacles of the garden. Golden full moon maple (Acer shirasawanum 'Aureum') is a stunning example of a tree useful as a focal point. Slow growing, a twenty-year old tree will only reach twelve to fifteen feet tall and about as wide. The new spring foliage emerges a vibrant lemon yellow that will tone down to rich chartreuse later in summer.\n\nChinese fringe tree (Chionanthus retusus) is a slightly larger choice, maturing at around twenty feet tall. Flaky bark provides year-round interest; lacy, fringe-like, flowers appear in midsummer. The more shrub-like American fringe tree (C. virginicus) can easily be trained into a multi-stemmed tree. Lowbranching, with a similar lacy white bloom, it will grow to about fifteen feet tall with an equal spread in ten to fifteen years. Both fringe trees are dioecious, male and female flowers being formed on separate plants. Male trees produce copious displays of the fringed flowers; female trees are more subtle in their floral beauty, but will produce showy clusters of blue black fruit into the late summer. A lone female fringe tree will still produce fruit even without a male for pollination, but will have a heavier set with a partner nearby.\n\nGolden full-moon maple Acer shirasawanum 'Aureum' (LT)\n\nFor late summer flowers, try seven son flower (Heptacodium miconioides), a large shrub that can easily be pruned into a small tree fifteen to eighteen feet tall with a slightly narrower spread. Small, fragrant white flowers are borne in clusters at the branch tips in August and early September. After the blossoms drop, the calyx gradually turns red and remains showy until obscured by red and yellow fall foliage.\n\nSugar maples (Acer saccharum), known for spectacular autumn color, are not often thought of as trees for a small garden. Indeed, most of GPP's sugar maple selections will ultimately become too large for many urban spaces, but two of them are well suited for this purpose. Acer saccharum Apollo ('Barret Cole') and 'Temple's Upright' (also known as 'Monumentale') are columnar types that can serve in many useful landscape roles. Apollo sugar maple is unique because it is not only columnar but also dwarf; mature trees will reach about twenty five feet tall and spread about ten feet wide. 'Temple's Upright' has a strong central leader almost twice the height of Apollo and ultimately will have a slender oval profile.\n\nPlants for Dry Shade\n\nJapanese forest grass Hakonechloa macra (RS)\n\nDrought tolerance is much the catch phrase of gardening these days; finding plants that thrive in dry and shady locations can be especially difficult. Cornus sericea 'Baileyi' and 'Hedgerows Gold' are selections of our native red-twig dogwood that will tolerate a moderate degree of both drought and shade. The rich yellow variegation of 'Hedgerows Gold' makes it stand out in the garden. This was discovered by nurseryman David Mason and has been generously shared with many. Two native ground covers that are top performers in dry shade are oak fern (Gymnocarpium dryopteris; western forms are now classified as G. disjuncta) and redwood sorrel (Oxalis oregana). Oak ferns will form a delicate carpet with fresh, bright green, fine-textured fronds. The new fronds emerge in early spring and start to die down in early autumn. Underplant this fern with Cyclamen hederifolium to add fall and winter interest until the fern returns next spring. There are several selections of redwood sorrel, including some that are evergreen in the Northwest; all will form a thick blanket preventing weeds from encroaching. In spring, the mat is dotted with pale pink to rose flowers.\n\nColorful calyxes of seven son flower Heptacodium miconioides (RS)\n\nA stalwart shrub for the shade garden is aucuba (Aucuba japonica). These resilient evergreen shrubs can be the backbone of almost any shade garden. Aucuba japonica 'Goldstrike' illuminates the dark woodland with leaves dusted with golden-yellow spots. For something a little more sedate, try A. japonica 'Serratifolia'. Its dark evergreen leaves will add depth to background plantings. Wintergreen barberry (Berberis julianae) will also work well in the back of the shade garden. It has the added bonus of becoming a formidable hedge, with stems covered in sharp spines. A word to the wise: avoid planting beneath deciduous trees, so that fallen leaves will not have to be picked out of its prickly branches.\n\nThe Herbaceous Layer\n\nWood fern Dryopteris lepidopoda (RS)\n\nPerennials and bulbs can really pull a garden together by adding color and texture to make a good landscape great. To add interest and extend the blooming season, try the fall-blooming Amaryllis belladonna, seductively called naked ladies. In late August or early September, the dormant bulbs send forth two-foot-tall, spear-like stalks that burst into rich pink trumpet flowers heralding the coming of fall.\n\nSoon after naked ladies end their sultry show, Colchicum enters the scene. Erroneously given the common name of autumn crocus, due to the flower's superficial goblet-like resemblance to true crocus blossoms, these robust bulbs erupt from the bare ground with stemless flowers in September and October. Two selections with distinct features to recommend them are C. autumnale and C. 'Waterlily'. Colchicum autumnale offers profuse, cup-shaped, lilac-pink flowers about six inches tall; C. 'Waterlily' has fully double flowers truly reminiscent of real water lilies (Nymphaea).\n\nVariegated Japanese forest grass Hakonechloa macra 'Albostriata' (RS)\n\nI always look to foliage for textural elements that will establish a sense of continuity in the garden. Japanese forest grass (Hakonechloa macra) is dynamic for linking the landscape together; even the typical green form, is anything but plain. The thin, ribbon-like leaf blades stand twenty-four to thirty inches tall, forming gently arching mounds that may approach eight feet wide at maturity. The variegated form 'Albostriata' is about one-third smaller and slower growing. The light variegation of this selection adds color to the garden without shouting \"look at me—I'm gold and green!\" I find its more refined mounding habit suggests flowing water when the breeze blows through. Sometimes, subtlety is not the way to go: to give a little punch of color, plant a few clumps of H. macra 'All Gold'. Mounds of brilliant, acid yellow leaves slowly mature to about twelve to eighteen inches tall and three to four feet wide. With a half-day of morning sun, it will keep this intense coloring until fall; with a little more shade, it will tone down to clear chartreuse. This bright smaller grass looks great with the bold fronds of thick-stemmed wood fern (Dryopteris crassirhizoma) or the orange bronze new growth of sunset fern (Dryopteris lepidopoda); both of these ferns are new additions to the GPP list.\n\nAutumn crocus Colchicum autumnale (LT)\n\nAs we push the Great Plant Pick list toward the 600-plant mark, we hope you will find many wonderful choices for your garden and see many plants that may already be doing well there. Be sure to check out the website, where you can read more about the plants noted above, as well as all the other choices from this and past years.\n\nAll selections in the Great Plant Picks have been chosen for their suitability in USDA hardiness zones 7 and 8, which covers most of the Pacific Northwest, west of the Cascades. In the list above, zone numbers in parentheses refer to Sunset zones (when available) in the latest Sunset Western Garden Book and have been provided as an aid for readers beyond the Northwest. Plants may not perform equally well in all of the Sunset zones noted.\n\nGolden-twig dogwood Cornus sericea 'Hedgerows Gold' (DM)\n\nGreat Plant Picks: An Educational Program of the Elisabeth Carey Miller Botanical Garden\n\nGreat Plant Picks is one of the Miller Garden's educational outreach programs. Under its auspices (and funded by the Pendleton and Elisabeth Miller Charitable Foundation), expert horticulturists from Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia (west of the Cascade and BC's Coast ranges) meet throughout the year to make their annual selections.\n\nVisit the Great Plant Picks website ( to learn more about the nearly 600 plants picked to date, with images and fact sheets that include culture and companion plants for each of the winners."

      "text": "Dangerous Trees\n\nDangerous Trees on private land\n\nThe Council will only deal with trees that are imminently dangerous and are risk of causing life-threatening injury.\n\nTrees can become imminently dangerous due to a singular event such as a storm, flood or vehicular damage in an accident, resulting in part, or all, of the tree presenting a danger to the public. Alternatively, a tree may reach a dangerous state by ongoing decay or disease, or may have grown in such a way as to be structurally unsound.\n\nThe Council will only investigate complaints if the tree is considered imminently dangerous . For example, a large broken hanging branch or severed roots allowing an entire tree to rock at soil level.\n\nThe Council will not deal with trees where there is a perceived danger, such as a tall tree, one close to a building or one that sways in the wind. These trees are not considered to be in a dangerous condition and pose no imminent danger. The Council will not consider the prospects of the future condition of the tree and will only consider its current condition.\n\nIf you consider a tree to be imminently dangerous and there is a risk of causing life threatening injury, then please report the matter to the Public Health and Protection Section on 01443 425001. At the time of making the report you must state why you think the tree is imminently dangerous and who it will affect if the whole tree or parts of the tree were to fall.\n\nThe council will not consider:-\n\nIssues surrounding lack of light\n\nTrees blocking view .\n\nIssues with overhanging branches – unless dangerous.\n\nFruit or leaf issues including slippery surfaces or blocking drains.\n\nSticky 'goo' on cars.\n\nSatellite/TV signal (It is up to the supplier to provide adequate signal, not the Council to prune or fell any healthy trees to allow a signal to be received)\n\nTrees affecting a Highway\n\nIf there is a dangerous tree adjacent to the Highway then the Highway Section will investigate this matter. To report a dangerous tree on Highway please contact 01443 425001 .\n\nHighways will deal with trees in the following circumstances:\n\nTrees obscuring vehicle sight line at junctions\n\nTrees within head/ eye height on/ over footways\n\nTrees fallen across the Highway/footpath\n\nDangereous Trees on Council Owned land\n\nDangerous trees on Council-owned land should be reported firstly to our Property Information Team on 01443 665710, they will then direct the query to the relevant Council department for them to deal with as appropriate.\n\nTree Preservation Order\n\nThe Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and associated Regulations enables us to protect trees in the interests of amenity, by making tree preservation orders (TPOs).\n\nThe making of an order, in general, makes it an offence to cut down, top, lop, uproot, wilfully damage or wilfully destroy a tree without our permission. The purpose of an order is to protect selected trees and woodlands if their removal would have a significant impact on the environment and its enjoyment by the public. We have a duty to make tree preservation orders, where appropriate, when granting planning permission.\n\nGovernment circular guidance advises that we need to be able to show that a reasonable degree of public benefit would accrue before orders are made or confirmed. The trees should therefore normally be visible from a public place such as a road or public footpath, although exceptionally, the inclusion of other trees may be justified. The benefit may be present or future (for example, when proposed development has taken place).\n\nContact Us\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nI have a tree growing in my garden. What are my responsibilities?\n\nIf you have freehold ownership of land upon which a tree grows you are responsible for it, unless you have leased the land to a third party who, through the terms of the lease, has accepted this responsibility. The owner of a tree owes a duty of care to all third parties and is at all times liable for any nuisance or damage the tree causes. Should the tree owner be aware of a defect in his/her tree and not address it, and damage subsequently results, he/she may be held liable for negligence. The duty of care extends even to persons who may trespass onto the tree owner's land.\n\nMy neighbours have planted a tree very close to our boundary. Can they do this?\n\nThere is no law preventing any person planting or growing a tree anywhere on his/her property. Neither is there any restriction upon the size to which they may grow it. However any person who plants a poisonous tree so close to a boundary that its branches grow over that boundary and are eaten by a neighbour's livestock, may be held liable for damages. If however a neighbour's livestock reach over to the tree owner's side of the boundary to eat the leaves, the tree owner will not be liable unless he/she has a legal responsibility to maintain the boundary.\n\nThe branches of my neighbour's tree extend over my property, what can I do?\n\nCommon law allows you to prune unprotected trees and hedges overhanging your land and the roots growing under your land up to your boundary without the consent of the owner, but you must not trespass on to your neighbour's land to do this. In addition you must offer to return the wood and any fruit attached or which has fallen on to your land. However you do have a duty of care for the tree and may be liable for damages if any work you do, or ask others to do for you, causes the tree to die or become dangerous. If the tree is protected this common law right is void and consent must be sought from the council's Tree Section before any work takes place.\n\nMy neighbour's tree is blocking my light. What can I do?\n\nThere is no prescriptive right to light. Any case in respect of loss of light must be proven in the Civil Court. If successful an injunction may be served by the Court requiring the offending trees to be reduced in height or restricting their further growth. The Council does have powers under High Hedge Legislation, however there is certain criteria that has to be met before the Council can act on this type of complaint.\n\nFurther information regarding this process can be found in the related information section of this page.\n\nMy neighbour's trees are blocking my view. What can I do?\n\nNothing except speak to your neighbour and ask him/her to remedy the situation. There is no right to a view.\n\nMy neighbour's tree roots are causing damage to my property. What can I do?\n\nIf you believe your property to be suffering direct or indirect damage by tree roots, you are best advised to consult an arboricultural consultant (tree care specialist) or a building surveyor. There will usually be evidence of damage such as deformation, bowing or cracking of walls, uneven surfacing or blocked drains. If this is the case you should notify your building insurer who may initiate further investigations and negotiate with the tree owner and their insurer. In cases where damage is proven, the tree owner is liable.These types of issues are private matters in which the Council cannot act.\n\nI believe my neighbour's tree to be dangerous. What can I do?\n\nThe definition of 'dangerous' is ambiguous. A tree is not dangerous because it is tall or has a wide, spreading crown. Before taking any action you should contact a specialist tree consultant of contractor. Once you are sure of your facts, you should notify your neighbour of your concerns and ask that he/she address the problem. If he/she does not and some damage accrues from this negligence then you may take action against the tree owner through the courts where it may be possible to obtain an injunction requiring the tree owner to take whatever action is necessary to remedy the problem.\n\nCan the Council deal with dangerous trees?\n\nThe Council has powers to deal with trees which are 'imminently dangerous' (i.e. diseased, dangerous branches, uprooted trees, fallen trees, etc). The Council cannot take action against a neighbour's tree or a tree on private land just because of the fear and apprehension the tree causes to you. The Council can require owners of trees deemed to be in a dangerous condition to take action to address the danger.\n\nThe following are typical examples of invalid interpretations of a dangerous tree:\n\nThe tree is too tall, too big, it has a broad crown:\n\nA tall tree and/or a broad spreading crown is not a dangerous tree. Trees will natural grow as their genetic codes of their species dictate, and depending on the presence of external influences such as adjacent structures, natural competition from other trees, soil type and fertility or microclimate.\n\nThe tree sways when its windy:\n\nA tree swaying in the wind is not a dangerous tree. Trees will naturally bend and sway in the wind, as the pliability in the branches is a natural mechanism which helps prevent fracture.\n\nThe tree has a lean:\n\nA tree which has grown with a lean is not a dangerous tree. The tree develops fatter growth rings on one side to make it stable.\n\nThere is a tree on neighboring land causing me problems but I do not know who owns it. How do I find out?\n\nThe Council cannot investigate land ownership. You should contact the Land Registry at:"

The acorns were roasted or boiled or otherwise treated before eating. You can see the references in the Native American Ethnobotany database from the University of Michigan-Dearborn. In general, acorns (nuts) are edible after tannins are leached or boiled out. Gather nuts during the fall from September to October. Only gather the ripe tan-to-brown acorns rather than the unripe green ones. To remove bitterness, shell the brown ripe acorns and remove any corky skin layers dice the meat and boil the chunks in water from 15 to 30 minutes until the water turns brown. Then pour off the water and repeat the process until the water clears indicating that the tannic acid has been removed. During the last boiling salt water can be added; then the acorns can be deep fried or mixed in a soup. Finely chopped acorn meats can be added to bread doughs and muffin batters. After the leaching process acorn meat can be frozen. To make flour place the flour into a cloth bag and boil to leach out bitterness. Leached acorns after they are roasted until brittle can be ground and used as a marginal coffee substitute. Warning: Acorns (seeds of nuts) and young leaves have low toxicity if eaten. Symptoms include stomach pain constipation and later bloody diarrhea excessive thirst and urination.\n\nMore Edible Plants QuestionsWill a chile pequin survive winters in Garden City, Kansas March 24, 2010 - Dear Mr. Smarty Pants,\nI am trying to determine if a chile pequin (Capsicum annuum) can survive Kansas winters.

Espaliered citrus can be very expensive if purchased ready made, but here's how you can make your own at a much lower cost:\n\nChoose bushy five-gallon dwarf trees and plant in containers (at least 14″-16″ in diameter) using a good potting mixture such as Kellog's Potting Soil.\n\nPlace a 3′x3′ trellis against the flatter side of the tree.\n\nGently spread the branches against the trellis and tie each one to the trellis with the green plastic tie tape (do NOT use metal twist ties).\n\nTrim any branches in the front of the trellis that won't lie flat. Be careful not to trim any with fruit on them.\n\nAs an option, plant the area below the trellis with cool season annuals such as pansies, violas, and calendulas, or perennials such as hybrid verbena, scaevola, lamium, or wire vine.\n\nFertilize when planting with Nurti-Pak for Fruit Trees. This will feed the plant when you forget for 3 years, and give you much faster and more vigorous growth.\n\nTop dress in March and August with Dr. Earth Fruit Tree Fertilizer with beneficial microbes for even more abundant fruit and faster growth.\n\nPlace your espalier on a balcony or against a blank wall, or use two to form an entrance on either side of a walkway.\n\nAdd potted holiday foliage around the base of the pots, such as crotons or mums, for the fall or poinsettias and cyclamen at Christmas.\n\nFor gift giving, add a bow, and it's ready to go — a gift that will last for years to come!"

      "text": "Your Home: Tree maintenance\n\nLast week on \"Your Home\" we gave you some tips to growing a nice healthy lawn this season. Today we address trees. Trees are often damaged after a winter of heavy snowfall, sometimes beyond repair. That certainly wasn't an issue this winter, but the health of the trees in your yard should still be addressed. It's especially important to know when to have a tree worked on or removed.\n\nTree Expert, Vince Walsh said, \"The main thing is hazards. If someone sees a hazard, the wind or ice damaged something in the tree or the tree itself came down and they want it removed. If limbs are over the roof, creating a lot of drip and the trees are blocking the sun so it keeps the roof wet. We prune those and get them away from the house.\"\n\nFor perspective buyers, Walsh recommends examining the yard and trees for damage just as you would the home itself. Even if it's new construction.\n\nWalsh said, \"It's best to walk 360 around the trees, even at a new site. The other thing is, what's on the western border? Our prevailing winds are form the west. If you have a lot of poplar trees there, they're prone to blow down as well as locust trees.\"\n\nIf you're moving into a home on a fairly barren lot and know you're going to be living there for some years to come, Walsh wants you to get proactive, plant some trees and do so with the environment in mind.\n\n\"Be eco-conscious. We recommend putting in hemlocks, pine or arborvitae on the west and north sides. That blocks the wind so you have less convective heat loss from your home. Also, for sunlight issues, you want some shade, so on the south side you'll put some deciduous trees. They won't get too big or too tall. They'll block the sun in the summer months and then lose their leaves in the fall allowing more sunlight to reach your house in the winter months,\" said Walsh.\n\nFor the do-it-yourself tree trimmer out there, Walsh recommends head-to-toe protection including chaps, gloves and eyewear. For major jobs, like removing an entire tree, leave that to the professionals."

Specific species attack specific trees, i.e. the erythrina gall wasp on Wili Wili trees in HI. Most known gall wasps, however, attack oak trees. The wasp lays its eggs in the plant tissue which creates a \"gall,\" or abnormal growth, where the eggs were deposited. The larvae live and feed inside the gall. Generally, the galls are more an eyesore than a threat to the tree. Galls can form on leaves, stems, twigs, buds and roots. One of the more common is the oak gall wasp which forms spherical galls on the leaves"

      "text": "Tree Preservation Orders\n\nIntroduction\n\nTree Preservation Orders or TPOs are used to protect selected trees if their removal would have a significant impact on the environment and its enjoyment by the public.\n\nIf you would like to carry out any works to a protected tree, including pruning, lopping, felling or any cutting of roots, you will need to apply to the council for permission.\n\nThe maximum penalty for carrying out works to tree preservation order trees without consent is £20,000. In serious cases a person may be committed for trial in the Crown Court and, if convicted, is liable to an unlimited fine.\n\nTree preservation orders are usually placed on trees that are considered to be under threat: for example, where development is proposed. Therefore, many mature trees in the borough may not be protected.\n\nOur priorities for making tree preservation orders are:\n1. Individual trees that are at risk and have visual impact on the public realm.\n2. Development sites subject to current planning applications.\n3. Re-surveys of sites following re-development.\n\nThe Department for Communities and Local Government provides a publication Protected trees: a guide to tree preservation procedures with further information on tree preservation orders.\n\nThe council's Arboricultural Services provide further information on tree maintenance issues for trees that are not protected by TPOs.\n\nTrees in conservation areas receive a similar level of protection to trees protected by tree preservation orders. If you wish to fell, lop or top or uproot trees within a conservation area, you must give us six weeks notice in writing. It is an offence to carry out the work within that period without our agreement.\n\nIf you want to know if a tree in Barking and Dagenham is protected by a tree preservation order (TPO) or if it is in a conservation area or if you are concerned that a tree is under threat please contact the Planning Policy Team at the address shown.\n\nIf you wish to carry out any works to a protected tree (this includes pruning, lopping, felling and any cutting of roots) or a tree in a conservation area you need to complete an application for tree works.\n\nAny applications to carry out work to protected trees which are alleged to be involved in damage to buildings and / or other structures such as drains, paths or walls need to be supported by technical evidence.\n\nExcept in an emergency, you should give the council at least five days notice before cutting down a protected tree which is dying, dead or dangerous or if you intend to remove dead dying or dangerous timber from an otherwise healthy tree.\n\nIn an emergency, where it is not possible to give the council five days notice, you are advised to provide photographic evidence and a report from a tree surgeon verifying that the tree was dangerous.\n\nThis is in your interests as you could be prosecuted if we believe you have carried out unauthorised work.\n\nPlease note that the landowner is under a duty to plant a replacement tree at the same place.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the safety of a protected tree or a highway tree please phone Barking and Dagenham Direct on 020 8215 3000.\n\nWhere planning permission has been granted, trees may be protected as a condition of that permission. Any works to such trees will require consent from the council and an application for a variation of the planning condition may be required.\n\nThe Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 makes it an offence to kill, injure, or take wild birds, their young, their eggs or nests. It is also an offence to disturb birds at the nest.\n\nIt is advisable to avoid carrying out any works to trees, hedges and dense shrubs between March and September. Where works are essential between March and September, a survey by a qualified ecologist should take place no more than five days before the planned works to determine if nesting birds are present.\n\nIf a nesting bird is discovered once works have started, work should cease immediately until the nesting season is over.\nBats are European Protected Species and are protected by the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).\n\nIt is an offence to kill, injure, or take, any bat. It is also an offence to interfere with places used by bats for shelter or protection, or to intentionally disturb bats occupying such places.\n\nBat roosts are protected regardless of whether they are occupied at the time of the intended works. Bats can make use of trees throughout the year: for maternity roosts in the summer (May to September); for mating roosts in the autumn (September to November); and for hibernation in the winter (November to April).\n\nThe presence of bats or bat roosts is not always obvious and it is recommended that you consult a qualified bat surveyor. The Bat Conservation Trust and the Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management can provide lists of suitable consultants.\n\nTrees identified for removal or for pruning should be surveyed by a qualified ecologist no more than five days before the planned works to determine if bats are present.\n\nIf a bat is discovered once works have started, work should cease immediately, and the licensed bat worker and Natural England called for advice.\n\nIf you would like the council to consider placing a tree preservation order (TPO) on a tree or trees please contact us with details of the tree(s), the location, why you consider a TPO is needed and your contact details.\n\nJoin Barking and Dagenham's Tree Wardens.\nBarking and Dagenham's Tree Wardens are a group of volunteers that are interested in actively working to improve the number and condition of trees in the borough. These include trees on roads, in parks, and on private lands. More information can be found on the Arboricultural Services web pages.\n\nNever employ house callers or leaflet droppers claiming to be professional tree surgeons. Use tree surgeons or tree consultants approved by the Arboricultural Association, (the professional body for the arboricultural industry) for pruning or felling trees. For more information contact:\nTelephone: 01242 522 152\nFax: 01242 577 766\nEmail: admin@trees.org.uk\nVisit: Arboricultural Association website\n\nFor general enquiries about trees or trees on council property (such as council houses, schools, highways) please contact tree services (Arboricultural Services). For enquiries about Tree Preservation Orders, please contact Planning Policy at the address shown.\n\nIf you have an urgent message about an immediately dangerous fallen or damaged tree, please contact Barking and Dagenham Direct on 020 8215 3000."

The inner soft bark, or bast, is produced by the vascular cambium; it consists of secondary phloem tissue whose innermost layer conveys food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. The outer bark, which is mostly dead tissue, is the product of the corkcambium (phellogen). Layered outer bark, containing cork and old, dead phloem, is known as rhytidome. The dead cork cells are lined with suberin, a fatty substance that makes them highly impermeable to gases and water. Gas exchange between the inner tissues of bark-covered roots and stems and their surroundings takes place through spongy areas (lenticels) in the cork.\n\nBark is usually thinner than the woody part of the stem or root. Both inner bark (secondary phloem) and wood (secondary xylem) are generated by the vascular cambium layer of cells: bark toward the outside where the oldest layers may slough off, and wood toward the inside where it accumulates as dead tissue"

      "text": "Growing nuts was once nearly as common as growing vegetables and fruits. Backyards and farms across Pennsylvania hosted trees bearing walnuts, hazelnuts, chestnuts, hickory nuts and others. But today, it's difficult to find a gardener growing these crops on purpose. In fact, many gardeners remove these nut-bearing treasures, touting them as messy or, in the case of walnuts, difficult to grow around (this is due to a toxic compound exuded by the walnut tree's roots). But, as you plan for the coming gardening season, consider including a few nut trees in your plans. Order them now and your shipment of bare-root trees will arrive at the ideal time for spring planting.\n\nMuch like a homegrown tomato, store-bought nuts just aren't the same. Many of them are imported and grown using large amounts of pesticides. Growing your own means more delicious, nutritious goodies for you and family. Many nut trees are easy to grow and inexpensive to purchase, and they'll continue to bear for generations to come.\n\nThough you won't be able to grow almonds, pecans, Brazil or macadamia nuts here in Western Pennsylvania, there are plenty of delicious, hardy, nut trees that are perfectly suited to our climate. And, now that many of these trees are grown via vegetative propagation versus being started from seed, you won't have to wait 10 years to get your first harvest. Yes, the squirrels and chipmunks may force you to share, but overall these trees are fun and easy to grow.\n\nTo grow nuts, you'll need a site that receives at least eight hours of full sun per day. There is no need to amend the planting area because most nuts grow easily in average soil. What you will need, however, is plenty of space. Some nut trees can reach 60 feet in height and girth, though not all do.\n\nGrowing nuts is fairly simple, but harvesting them can be a challenge. Large-scale growers use \"shakers\" to knock the nuts off the trees, but you'll have better luck simply picking up the fallen nuts as they come off the tree. With the exception of the chestnuts, which should be used immediately or stored in the refrigerator, all nuts are best dried in their shells.\n\nTo dry nuts, spread them out in a single layer on a screen in a cool, dry place. Allow the nuts to dry for several weeks. When they are dry, you can hear them rattle around inside the shell when you shake it. At that point, it is time to crack them open and enjoy their homegrown flavor — or store them in airtight containers in the freezer.\n\nIn next Saturday's column, I'll discuss several of the best nuts to grow in our area and offer you some sources for purchasing the"

      "text": "Fruit trees with no fruit\n\nThe Coastal Gardener\n\nJuly 02, 2010|Ron Vanderhoff\n\n(Page 3 of 3)\n\nThis is especially common with stone fruits like plums, pluots and apricots, but also with apples and pears. Fruiting trees require different pruning strategies than ornamental trees. Apples and apricots, for instance, bear fruit on the same spurs year after year. Pruning all the little dead-looking stubs off the tree in winter is a sure way to guarantee no fruit the following year. Peaches, lemons, pomegranates, avocados, oranges, figs, persimmons, etc. – they're all pruned differently.\n\nAsk Ron\n\nI need some suggestions for plant in rather deep shade. I've tried camellias, impatiens, azaleas and a few others, but they haven't done very well.\n\nLauren, Huntington Beach\n\nAnswer: If you have deep shade you will need to be very selective.

And is there a certain size tree that is best to purchase for greatest chance of survival?\n\nANSWER:\n\nThere was an old saying in Pennsylvania that you could plant trees in any month that has the letter \"r\" in it, so that would only exclude May, June, July and August (i.e. summer).\n\nHowever, that was before the days when a homeowner could drive to a local plant center, buy a pot grown tree and go home and plant it. These days you can plant a tree as long as you can find one in the nursery and the soil is not frozen.\n\nGenerally, the best time to plant is in the early fall. The air and soil are warm enough that the plant can get established (generate some root growth) and then fall into winter dormancy. Then it is ready for the stresses of the heat and drought of summer in the following season. However, if you are planting your Cercis canadensis (Eastern redbud) in an environment that mimics its native environment and not in the center of a lawn in a new development (full sun and compacted, nutrient poor soil) it will be fine if you plant it now.\n\nKeep it mulched and watered until it is established and follow the tips in our Step by Step Guide. It will bring you joy in late winter for many years to come.\n\nMore Trees QuestionsFast-growing evergreens for privacy in Center, TX March 30, 2010 - I live in East Texas and am looking for a fast growing evergreen for a privacy screen around my backyard.

However, today's concerns about rain forest resources have sparked an interest in finding unusual temperate-climate woods. Osage orange, a novel species with a bright yellowish-orange heartwood, is one of the finest examples of an exotic domestic, one that may actually grow in your own backyard. Osage orange was native to a small area of drought-ridden, windswept prairie in Texas and Arkansas. Today its range extends throughout much of the southern United States.\n\nOsage Indians, the wood's namesake, often carried hunting bows and clubs made from this species, which was an excellent choice given its outstanding bending strength and shock resistance. It is more than twice as hard as hard maple, offers better stability than black walnut, and weighs more than hickory and teak. Extreme hardness and density make the wood challenging to machine and glue, but sharp blades and epoxy resin overcome potential problems.\n\nUSES\nLike tropical exotics, Osage orange is often used for smaller projects and as an accent wood. It exceeds the bending strength and shock resistance of most other species. Settlers found its decay resistance was unequaled, especially as lumber for fence posts."

      "text": "rate this answer\n\nMonday - October 31, 2011\n\nQUESTION:\n\nIs there a paint that is safe to spray on a tree trunk without damaging/killing the tree? We have White Pines that have ~16\" spacing without limbs & would like to 'camouflage' the bare space. If paint/dye could be used, where would we purchase a can?\n\nANSWER:\n\nIt is hard to visualize the situation you are describing and to know if you are trying to camouflage to match the bark or the foliage, but I will try to answer your question.\n\nA spacing of 16 inches between branches is not unreasonable on a Pinus strobus (Eastern white pine) tree and when it is mature, the spacing will actually be much larger than that so that light and air can reach the inner part of the tree.\n\nIt would be helpful to know how big the trees are and what condition led to there being \"bare spaces\". Are there wounds where branches have died or been removed or are these bare spaces places where the bark has been removed to reveal the lighter heartwood? Trees have their own healing mechanisms and will slowly regenerate bark from the outside edges of the wound until the wound has healed over completely. In the past, the generally accepted practise was to paint these wounds with black, tarry wound paint, but research has indicated that actually inhibits the natural healing process. The bare, light patches will eventually fade to grey but if you can't wait, you can use a wood stain that does not contain any urethane or latex sealer. You don't want to inhibit the exchange of moisture and gasses, so paint (oil or latex) is not a good idea.\n\nI hope this answers your question ... if not, please feel free to post another question with a more detailed description of the situation.\n\nFrom the Image Gallery\n\nMore General Botany QuestionsHalf-life of the insecticide imidacloprid March 07, 2011 - How long do systemic insecticides such as imidacloprid (Merit)\nremain active in nursery grown plants?\nAsclepias curassavica (tropical milkweed)is frequently grown with imidacloprid to prevent... view the full question and answer\n\nSmarty Plants on Wildflowerology July 08, 2005 - I know there is a word for everything, but I can't find the offical word for the study of wildflowers.

He stayed here in a setting of lush greenery, away from the ceremonial of Versailles, surrounded by courtiers that he had hand-picked and who, according to the tradition, requested the honour of this invitation by asking \"Sire, Marly?\"\n\nThe Marly estate displayed the twofold talent of Jules Hardouin-Mansart as an architect and a gardener. The royal pavilion and the twelve small adjoining pavilions reserved for guests were set in a vast landscaped area enlivened by grand perspectives, spectacular ornamental lakes and statues by outstanding sculptors, leading contemporaries to call it \"the finest place in the world\".\n\nThe Marly estate was destroyed progressively during the 19th century, so that all that remains of it today is the outline of the park and the foundations of some pavilions.

      "text": "Delaware census: Street tree do's and don'ts\n\nTwo crews of six Delaware County Mas­ter Gar­dener Vol­un­teers are hit­ting the streets of Delaware weekly in this, the third year of the ongo­ing Delaware Tree Cen­sus. The teams have com­pleted the inven­tory in the cen­tral city and they are now work­ing in the newer devel­op­ments on the out­skirts of town. As they progress, they have noted many beau­ti­ful, healthy trees, while oth­ers are strug­gling. They even encounter trees that are dead or dying.\n\nAs a home­owner, there are some things that you can do to help your street trees live up to their best poten­tial. Accord­ing to Chuck Rex­ode, a retired USFS research ento­mol­o­gist and the city's con­tract forester for 22 years, the two most impor­tant things you can do are to water your trees dur­ing drought peri­ods like we have had this sum­mer, and to stop vol­cano mulching.\n\nMany trees are stressed from lack of rain­fall. Rex­ode noted that the sit­u­a­tion is dire for many young sugar maple trees with sun scald. This con­di­tion occurs when water evap­o­rates from the leaves faster than the roots take it up. Water­ing will help and may be enough to save the tree. Remem­ber when you water to give the ground under the tree canopy a good soak­ing so the water will pen­e­trate the ground for sev­eral inches.\n\nMany home­own­ers and land­scap­ers pile mulch around the trees. Accord­ing to Rex­ode, this is a bad prac­tice as excess mulch pro­motes fun­gal growth around tree trunks and then decay sets in. Also, a wet spring sea­son pro­motes root growth around the base of the tree in the mulch, but these roots dry out quickly later in the sea­son and the tree suf­fers since it depends on these newly formed feeder roots. The roots in the mulch can also grow around the tree trunk and end up stran­gling it. While you should keep mulch around a tree year-round, it should only be a cou­ple of inches deep. The mulch helps avoid string trim­mer and lawn mower dam­age, but it should be kept two to three inches away from the trunk to avoid encour­ag­ing fun­gal growth. Home­own­ers also should reg­u­larly remove suck­ers, which are small shoots that grow out from the base of the tree trunk.\n\nMany street trees need prun­ing. But, Rex­ode cau­tions, \"Don't prune unless you know how to do it prop­erly.\" The city's Shade Tree Com­mis­sion is seri­ously con­sid­er­ing launch­ing a new pro­gram to help the city prune its street trees. It would be staffed by groups of trained vol­un­teers that would prune their own street trees and/or street trees in their sub­di­vi­sion. This effort would be lim­ited to trees with branches that can be pruned man­u­ally, with­out the use of power tools and are close enough to the ground that they can be reached with­out the use of a ladder.\n\nSome­times trees are planted at an incor­rect depth and that can lead to pre­ma­ture decline or death. At the base of the tree where the trunk and the root sys­tem meet is the root col­lar, which has a slight flare. The flare needs to be exposed when the tree is planted. Accord­ing to Erik Draper from OSU Exten­sion, \"Plant 'em high — watch 'em die; Plant 'em low — never grow; Plant 'em right — sleep at night!\"\n\nLand­scap­ers or devel­op­ers fre­quently stake new trees to ensure they remain upright. Rex­ode said these stakes should remain around the trees for the entire war­ranty period of two years. While one year would be suf­fi­cient in most cases, devel­op­ers and land­scap­ers will not war­ranty the trees if the stakes have been removed. These stakes should not be exces­sively tight and should allow for some tree move­ment. After the war­ranty period, the stakes and guy wires should be removed. If left on per­ma­nently, the wires will even­tu­ally com­pletely gir­dle the tree, depriv­ing it of nutri­ents, includ­ing water, and the tree will decline or die.\n\nDelaware City is imple­ment­ing a new pro­gram to increase the diver­sity of the street trees. The city is also par­ing back, but not elim­i­nat­ing, plant­ing maple trees. Maples already rep­re­sent a large per­cent­age of Delaware's urban for­est. In addi­tion, maple trees are dis­posed to ver­ti­cil­lium wilt and more recently there has been the threat of the Asian Long­horned Bee­tle (ALB), which has been found in south­west Ohio. Since insect pests typ­i­cally attack one tree genus, or fam­ily, increased tree diver­sity will help avoid a sit­u­a­tion where the major­ity of the street trees in one com­mu­nity are destroyed.\n\nAs of early August 2012, Delaware County Mas­ter Gar­dener Vol­un­teers have com­pleted about two-thirds of the city's dis­tricts in the Tree Cen­sus, and they expect to com­plete the project in 2013. You may see a group of \"tree hug­gers\" in your neigh­bor­hood iden­ti­fy­ing and mea­sur­ing trees. Please don't hes­i­tate to say \"Hi\" or ask them a question."

      "text": "Pachysandra Leaf and Stem Blight\n\nLeaf and stem blight, a destructive disease of pachysandra, is caused by the fungus Volutellapachysandrae. Both the leaves and stems of pachysandra are attacked by this fungus. Brown blotches on the leaves are usually the first noticeable symptoms. The blotches gradually increase in size until the entire leaf turns brown or black and dies.\n\nIn severe infections, stem cankers (browning of the stem at the terminal, mid-stem or ground level) occur and will cause the plant to wither, turn brown or black and die. During wet weather, affected parts are often covered by pink masses of fungus spores. Further spread of the disease throughout the planting is by means of these spores. Plants die in patches, and the disease commonly produces a circular pattern in the bed.\n\nDisease spread is most rapid in dense overcrowded plantings and in plantings weakened by drought, winter injury or attacks by insects. Use of a damp, heavy mulch which provides excessive moisture also encourages disease development.\n\nRogue and destroy all severely diseased plants. Thin thick plantings to increase light and air circulation. Remaining plants may be protected with a fungicide such as chlorothalonil (Bravo, Daconil 2787) or mancozeb Dithane, Penncozeb). Spray the plants two or three times at 10 to 14 day intervals. If volutella blight has been a problem in the past, it may be necessary to protect plants with two or three fungicide applications beginning when new growth starts each year.\n\nAvoid heavy, thick mulches of materials, such as leaves or compost which hold moisture and favor the establishment of the disease.\n\nSince the disease spreads rapidly in stands that have been weakened by insects, make an attempt to control them. Scale insects, particularly euonymus scale, can be very destructive. For control of scale, prune badly infested plants. Spray with an insecticide such as malathion, carbaryl (Sevin) or acephate (Orthene) during the first week of June and repeat in early July.\n\nA horticultural oil can be applied in mid-April to early May. If coverage is good, excellent control can be achieved"

Is it possible to leave the tree out for the garbage truck and would it be charged to the landlord or is there a place we can take it for cheap/free to dispose of it properly? I grew up on the other side of the mountains where after the Christmas tree was done being in the house, we chopped up the wood and used it for various other things around the house for the next year so...after moving to the city, I'm not quite sure what to do with the tree because we can't do that anymore.\n\nrvhthelod, Rhetorical question: Could you chop/saw up the tree and save the wood for a bonfire at Golden Gardens in one of the beach fire rings--fun and this is a good time of year because of lack of crowds!

Removing the dying branches from your oleander will improve its appearance for a while, but this will not restore the plant's health. Your oleander will probably die in a few years if it has oleander leaf scorch. This fatal disease is caused by the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa. The bacteria grow inside and soon plug the plant's xylem tissue, which transports water from the roots to the leaves. The upper foliage initially turns yellow and may droop on one or more branches. Unfortunately, by the time these symptoms appear, the bacteria have already spread to other parts of the plant that appear healthy. As the disease progresses, more branches are affected and the plant eventually dies. All oleanders ...\n\nOver the past weeks, I visited with two good friends who were in town for the holidays.

Sunlight, water and carbon dioxide combine to make sugars so the plant can survive.\n\nOther colors are present in leaves, too, but as a tree makes food for itself the green chlorophyll dominates other colors, such as yellow or orange.\n\n\"As day length gets shorter and we start to get some cooler weather, chlorophyll will start breaking down and stop masking the other colors in the leaves,\" Farlee said.\n\nTrees prepare themselves for winter dormancy as the green fades and photosynthesis production stops. With decreased sunlight and water, the tree will rest and live off food stored during the summer.\n\nAnthocyanin remaining in the leaves after photosynthesis can cause a reddish tint. Tannin, a waste product stored in cells, causes a brown or golden color to show. Yellows and oranges are caused by carotenoids.\n\nLeaf coloration varies by tree species and the weather an area experiences late in the summer, Farlee said. Normal fall leaf colors include yellows, oranges and reds for maple trees; yellows for tuliptrees; yellows and golds for hickories; and browns or deep reds for oak trees.\n\nThe amount of sunlight trees receive also affects color intensity. More sunlight brings more intense colors.\n\n\"The best weather for colorful fall foliage is when we have bright, sunny days and cooler nights,\" Farlee said.\n\nTrees on the outside of woodlands typically are more colorful because they receive more direct sunlight.\n\n\"The best fall color can often be seen in trees on the edge,\" Farlee said. \"That's why trees along roads are more colorful and sometimes are the best way to view fall foliage.\"\n\nMore information on fall color is in the publication \"Why Leaves Change Color - the Physiological Basis\" at \n\nInformation provided on fall color is from Purdue University, first published in Sept. 2012"

The deciduous, shiny green leaves are five to nine inches long by four to five inches wide, with the terminal lobe much longer and narrower than the others. Leaves fall brown over an extended period of time in fall and winter. Some defoliation is noted during the summer in droughty years, but this is probably a drought-avoidance mechanism. No permanent damage appears to come from this. The dark brown to black bark is ridged and furrowed and resembles Cherry bark, to some extent. The half-inch-diameter acorns are popular with wildlife. The trunk normally grows straight with major branches well-spaced and strongly attached to the tree.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nMiddle-aged Quercus falcata: Southern Red Oak\n\n[Click thumbnail to enlarge.]\n\nGeneral Information\n\nScientific name: Quercus falcata\n\nPronunciation: KWERK-us fal-KAY-tuh\n\nCommon name(s): Southern Red Oak, Spanish Oak\n\nFamily: Fagaceae\n\nUSDA hardiness zones: 7A through 9B (Fig. 2)\n\nOrigin: native to North America\n\nInvasive potential: little invasive potential\n\nUses: specimen; shade; reclamation; street without sidewalk\n\nAvailability: somewhat available, may have to go out of the region to find the tree\n\nUse and Management\n\nNaturally found on poor upland soils, Southern Red Oak should be grown in full sun on well-drained soil, acid, sandy or loam (not clay). It is common on poor-quality, sandy ridges. It is well suited for planting in areas such as along roadsides where there is little maintenance after planting.

Although they are a natural component of the ecosystem—acting as \"thinning crews\" to remove dead plant material—in times of drought stress, their population swells and they may move into your healthy landscape trees.

It attacks blossoms, leaves, shoots, branches, fruits, and roots. This publication has some facts and methods to avoid and control the disease.\n\nPublication Full Text\n\nFireblight: Symptoms, Causes and Treatment\n\nFireblight is a destructive, highly infectious and widespread disease caused by the bacterium\nErwinia amylovora. Fireblight can be a problem in Georgia and is particularly prevalent in some\ncounties. Fire blight attacks blossoms, leaves, shoots, branches, fruits, and roots. In the following\nparagraphs are some facts and methods to avoid and control the disease.\n\nDisease Symptoms\n\nThe bark at the base of blighted twigs becomes water soaked, then dark, sunken and dry; cracks\nmay develop at the edge of the sunken area. Young twigs and branches die from the terminal end\nand appear burned or deep rust colored. Branches may be bent, resembling what is commonly\nreferred to as a \"shepherd's crook\" (Figure 1). Dead leaves and fruit remain on the branches.\n\nDisease Cycle\n\nInitially the disease often enters the tree through natural openings, especially flowers and\nwounds in the spring. Once established in the tree, fireblight quickly invades through the current\nseason's growth into older growth.\n\nFireblight can be spread from diseased to healthy plants by rain, wind, and pruning tools. The\nbacterium can survive the winter in sunken cankers on infected branches. In spring, the bacteria\nooze out of the cankers and attract bees and other insects. Insects also help spread the disease to\nhealthy plants. The bacteria spread rapidly through the plant tissue in warm temperatures (65\ndegrees F or higher) and humid weather.\n\nDisease Management\n\nDuring spring and summer, prune out infected branches 8 inches below the damage. Avoid\npruning when the plants are wet. Dip pruning tools in 70 percent isopropyl alcohol (rubbing\nalcohol) or 10 percent bleach solution (1 part bleach to 9 parts water solution) between each cut.\nWash and oil shears when you are finished. These practices avoid spreading the pathogen.\n\nAvoid heavy nitrogen fertilization, especially in summer, when succulent growth is most\nsusceptible to fireblight infection. Avoid splashing water. Chemical control is not always\neffective and needs to be applied preventively. Therefore, in years when warm, humid, wet\nweather coincides with flowering and leaf emergence, spray plants with a fungicide containing\nbasic copper sulfate (Kocide) or an antibiotic (Agrimycin) to reduce infection. Applications of\nAgrimycin need to begin at the start of blooming and continue every 3-4 days during the bloom\nperiod. Application of Kocide should begin at bloom and continue every 7 days during bloom.\nRe-application following rain may be needed.\n\nC 871 |\nThis publication was reviewed on\nMay 5, 2012"

Green.\n\nWilting and shoot dieback are common symptoms of Phytophthora disease as shown by this Rhododendron infected with Phytophthoracitricola.\n\nPhoto by M. Putnam.\n\nIt is difficult to determine whether a plant is infected with Phytophthora. Other factors—such as other plant pathogens, or drought or sunburn—can cause plant damage that looks like Phytophthora symptoms.\n\nIt is impossible to tell which species of Phytophthora are present based solely on plant symptoms. A correct diagnosis can be made only with the help of professional plant pathologists and laboratories.\n\nIn the field or greenhouse, you can begin the process of diagnosis by:\n\nDefining the problem in terms of symptoms and signs\n\nDefining the cause of the problem in terms of living or nonliving factors\n\nSymptoms are an indication of disease by reaction of the host, such as changes in the plant's growth or appearance. For example, the symptom of leaf spots on Rhododendron can be caused by various fungi, sunburn, too much fertilizer—or by Phytophthora.\n\nSigns are an indication of disease from direct observation of a pathogen, insect, or their parts. Signs can include fungal fruiting bodies, bacterial slime, or the presence of insects or mites. Remember that signs of a Phytophthora infection, such as spores, are not visible to the naked eye, but signs of other factors that damage plants often can be seen.\n\nDefine the Real Problem\nDetermine what the plant should look like at this time of year. For example, a typical Rhododendron generally has large, flat, leathery, dark green leaves that are held out from the stem to intercept sunlight.\n\nNext, examine the entire plant and surrounding plants, and determine what parts of the plant are affected.\n\nDescribe what the plant actually looks like; use symptoms\nand signs in your description. For example, leaves may be rolled,\ndrooping down, and appear \"off color\" or a faded green.\nWilting such as this may be due to rotted roots, a girdled trunk, or\nlack of water. A good examination of the diseased plant will help focus\nyour attention on the most important area(s). Also look for other\nindications of the cause(s) of the damage; for example, mechanical\ndamage, chemical residues, and records of extreme weather.\n\nLeaf spot symptoms caused by Phytophthora ramorum on Rhododendron.\n\nPhoto by N.

      "text": "Massachusetts Fruit Trees and Shade Trees\n\nMassachusetts is rich in American history that documents the dilemma of all the State's mature Elm shade trees dying. Leading up to the American Revolution, patriots would have to be careful where they assembled, because their punishment could be imprisonment or even death by the British. On August 14th 1765, a group of men were protesting the Stamp Act underneath a large upright Elm tree, and they lynched two tax collectors at the demonstration against the increased taxation. The Elm tree where the protest occurred became known as the \"Liberty Tree\" and once the other colonies heard about this they adopted their own \"Liberty Tree\" as safe havens to hold public meetings.\n\nThe State tree of Massachusetts is the Elm tree, which is a large growing shade tree, growing to be 90ft tall at full maturity. The cultivation of the Elm tree was extremely easy until the early 1900's when the Dutch Elm Disease threatened its very existence, but Ty Ty Nursery offers disease and insect resistant Elm trees for you.\n\nMassachusetts gardening can be difficult for some, since the size of the trees can be a concern. There are several techniques to help grow Massachusetts fruit trees . The size of the fruit tree all depends on the type of the root-stock on which the tree is grafted to. For example, a Golden Delicious Apple tree grafted onto a seedling root-stock will reach a mature height of 30ft, while a Red Delicious Apple tree grafted onto MM.111 will reach a mature height of 15ft. Choosing trees grafted onto a dwarf or semi-dwarf root stock will help all Massachusetts gardeners have better control over the size of their eventual fruit tree heights. Becoming very popular with apartment dwellers and small home owners is container fruit tree growing. Massachusetts fruit trees grown in containers will bear fruit, and if the trees are bought mature enough the fruit trees could bear the first year. Ty Ty Nursery has an extensive selection of bearing size fruit trees available to all Bay State garden fanatics.\n\nUSDA growing zones are 5, 6, and 7, the State of Massachusetts has established itself as a premier fruit orchard production State. Some of the favorite types of Massachusetts fruit trees are apple, pear, Asian pear and also peach trees. Planting a home orchard of fruit trees requires a great deal of time and patience. The friendly and knowledgeable staff at Ty Ty Nursery can help you choose which type of fruit trees will do best in your MA climate.\n\nFruit trees in MA are just one of the many, most popular types of trees grown, the others are shade trees and flowering trees. Massachusetts is known for it amazing knock out fall color and nut trees. The Silver and Sugar Maple are two native Massachusetts trees that will impress all plant and tree lovers. Other non-native trees that will make your yard stand out in the fall would be Tulip Poplar and Ginkgo. Another way to make a bold statement in your yard is to add beautiful, native, Massachusetts flowering trees. Dogwood, a native flowering tree, will grow and thrive in MA. One of the most popular flowering trees is the Kwanzan Japanese Flowering Cherry tree. Many patriotic gardener's want to duplicate the landscape that they see when visiting Washington, D.C. and then return home to add a couple of beautiful Flowering Cherry trees that will help accomplish this goal.\n\nTy Ty Nursery cultivates numerous types of specimen cold hardy palm trees. Your backyard garden in MA may not have that tropical get away feel you desire, but by adding a cold hardy, Chinese Windmill Palm or a Needle Palm you can have the feeling of being at the beach all year round. The Chinese Windmill Palm tree is cold tolerant in Massachusetts and has survived temperature of minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit and grows to a mature size of around 20ft. These MA cold hardy palms will survive your subfreezing temperatures year after year and are a must to have around any Massachusetts pool."

      "text": "Our springtime star dogwood isn't the only variety worth planting\n\nWhen we hear of dogwood, most of us think of our native flowering dogwood tree (Cornus florida). But truth be told, there are many different types of dogwood, about 30-50 species!<0x00A0>Most are deciduous shrubs and trees; some species are herbaceous perennial plants; and a few of the woody species are evergreen. Such variety provides plenty of choices for a showy dogwood in your landscape each season of the year.\n\nWinter\n\nJapanese Cornel Dogwood is underused in the landscape, and it is a beautiful winter-flowering tree. Cornus officinalis usually grows as a large, spreading, multi-stemmed, deciduous shrub to a small tree up to 15-25 feet tall. In late January into February, small but showy clusters of yellow flowers bloom. These blooms are followed by fruit that develops throughout summer and ripens to red in the fall. The variable fall foliage colors range from pale yellow to reddish-purple. I think the exfoliating bark is colorful with rich grays, browns and oranges. It is a truly unique feature of this dogwood. Two great cultivars are \"Sunsphere\" which flowers earlier than others in the species, and \"Kintoki\" which produces a heavier bloom. Another winter-flowering dogwood which resembles the Japanese Cornel Dogwood is the Cornelian Cherry Dogwood (Cornus mas). It too produces clusters of showy yellow flowers which bloom in late winter and red edible fruit in summer. \"Golden Moss\" is a heavy blooming selection.\n\nSpring\n\nThe familiar Flowering Dogwood, Cornus florida, is probably the most prized of all dogwoods due to its large and showy spring blooms. Commonly seen in the wild throughout Tennessee, it is a small, deciduous tree which typically grows 15-30 feet tall with a low-branching, broadly pyramidal but somewhat flat-topped habit. Many cultivars exist ranging in flower color of white, blush pink, deep pink to rosy red. In autumn, foliage turns to various shades of burgundy to scarlet red. Bright red fruits (poisonous to humans, but loved by birds) mature in early fall and persist until the middle of December. Flowering Dogwood is quite susceptible to anthracnose and powdery mildew diseases but improved resistant cultivars include \"Appalachian Spring,\" \"Jean's Appalachian Snow,\" \"Karen's Appalachian Blush\" and \"Kay's Appalachian Mist.\"\n\nA lesser-known species but equally beautiful is the Kousa Dogwood, sometimes called the Chinese or Japanese Dogwood. Cornus kousa is an exceptional small landscape tree which produces a multitude of showy, long-lasting, flowers in late spring, typically just after the Flowering Dogwood is done blooming. It is multi-branched, growing to about 20 feet tall and just as wide. Older trees have a very decorative, mottled bark. As the Kousa's blooms fade in the spring, green fruits appear and turn to pink, then dull red in September, resembling large solitary upright raspberries. Fall foliage can be a dark red or chartreuse, depending on the amount of sunlight received throughout the season. One standout feature of Kousa Dogwood is its incredible resistance to the diseases that plague the Flowering Dogwood. Great selections include \"Milky Way\" which has abundant white flowers with heavy fruit set; Pink flowering \"Beni Fuji\"; \"Blue Shadow\" has white flowers with rich blue-green color foliage in the summer turning purple for the fall.\n\nSummer\n\nCornus alternifolia, or the Pagoda Dogwood, is especially striking in early summer when its layered branches are covered in mass with small, creamy white flowers which are fragrant. Small, round fruits ripen to a deep blue-purple in late summer. Variegated selections such as \"Golden Shadow\" and \"Variegata\" (Syn . \"Argentea\") make quite a show as well with their colorful foliage. It typically grows to 30 feet tall and just as wide.\n\nCornus controversa, the Wedding Cake Tree or Giant Dogwood, is a similar tree but can grow to 45 feet tall and 30 feet wide. It covers itself in early summer with flat topped clusters of white flowers which can often exceed 6inches in diameter. There are a variety of variegated selections of Flowering Dogwood and Kousa Dogwood that can really brighten the landscape after their spring bloom. Cornus florida \"Cherokee Daybreak\" has leaves margined deep yellow tinged with pink when young; \"Pink Flame\" foliage has a green center with creamy white outside, edged with pink margins and flushed with yellow in summer; \"Rainbow\" has leaves margined deep yellow tinged with pink when young.\n\nMost species of dogwood have showy fall foliage but one group of the Cornus genus that is especially colorful starting in fall and lasting through winter are the twig dogwood shrubs. As they lose their autumn foliage, these shrub dogwoods start to put on a garden show with their striking red bark. And red is not the only color these deciduous shrubs strut anymore. Some hybrids have bark colors of yellow, orange, and bronze. You can find these brilliantly colored stems in the following three species of dogwood: Red Twig Dogwood (Cornus alba); Red Osier Dogwood (Cornus sericea or Cornus stolonifera), and Bloodtwig Dogwood (Cornus sanguinea). All of these dogwoods are fast-growing shrubs that form a loose, rounded multi-stemmed plant. They average 4-10 feet, tall depending on cultivar, with a similar spread and can be pruned in the spring if shorter, more compact plants are desired. They produce small, white flowers in late spring but the colorful stems are what really makes a show in the landscape.\n\nSue Hamilton is the director of the University of Tennessee Gardens and a freelance contributor to the News Sentinel.\n\nComments » 1\n\nInteresting and informative article.

This healthy\nDouglas-fir is one of the moon seedlings planted across the United\nStates in 1976.\n\nForestry Extension agents\nare used to fielding odd requests, but this one had Scott\nLeavengood stumped. A man in Phoenix, Arizona, named Michael\nSimon had heard there was a \"moon tree\" growing somewhere\non the grounds of the OSU College of Forestry. Could he get\ncuttings?\nLeavengood, an OSU Forest\nProducts Extension agent in Washington County, asked a few\nquestions. No, said Simon, it was not a tree grown on the\nmoon, but a tree planted from seeds that had orbited the moon\nin 1971 with astronaut Stuart Roosa of the Apollo 14 team.\nSimon was trying to get his 16-year-old daughter interested\nin science, and he thought propagating a moon tree would be\na good father-daughter project.\nLeavengood did some\ninvestigating. Stuart Roosa had been a smokejumper in his\nyouth, and he and Forest Service officials arranged the seeds'\nflight to the moon.\nAfterward, the seeds were\ngerminated, and in 1975 and 1976 some 450 seedlings were given\nto state forestry organizations throughout the country to\nbe planted as part of the nation's bicentennial celebration.\n\nLeavengood discovered\nthat one of the moon trees, a Douglas-fir seedling, had been\nplanted on the east lawn of Peavy Hall in 1976. Today the\ntree is a healthy 40-foot-tall specimen, apparently none the\nworse for its wanderings as a seed. Leavengood took cuttings\nand cones from the tree and sent them to Simon.\nThe project did not have\nthe hoped-for effect on Simon's daughter. \"She didn't find\nmoon trees exciting at all,\" he confesses. But Simon went\nahead anyway, trying unsuccessfully to get the cuttings to\nroot.

They're now consider an invasive species because they actually produce so much fruit it's kind of a mess. The red ones stain. I have three in my back yard, love them!!\n\nYes, dip them in some rooting hormone if possible, but they're not crucial, then stick it into some moist potting mix. Keep the plant in light shade and put a plastic bag over the plant to keep humidity in, but you want to also snip some holes so that some humidity is allowed to escape for heat regulation and to prevent too much water from collecting on the plastic.\n\nThe largest mulberry tree I've ever seen by an order of magnitude is in my parent's backyard. It produces several hundred if not thousands of pounds of berries every year.\n\nThe stems will give you a stomach ache if you eat a ton of them. It's ok to eat some, but if you're going to stand there and eat hundreds, pull the fruit off the stem with your teeth before you eat it. Cooking with them can be a bit of work if you don't find an easy method of stem removal.\n\nNever seen a white mulberry before, but those look exactly the same as the black ones we had, except for the color.\n\nI've always had red/purple mulberries, after I moved from my childhood home I found a white mulberry tree near by where I lived next. In my opinion the white mulberry is much sweeter, And it was amazing. The only one i've seen of it's kind. I'm hoping to get both kinds for my homestead when I finally get it.\n\nhaha! you're funny. i've just been looking it up, it might have originated in Korea, or another Asian country seeing how thats where the tree is from. i'd be interested in trying it, but i've never seen it up here in Massachusetts. hmm maybe i'll try to make my own.\n\nThis is a confusing subject- white mulberry trees (morus alba) generally produce black fruits. The white berries are a strain that was originally spread to deter birds from eating them, but the white colored fruit has less flavor than red berries.\n\nMost of the wild type trees are M. alba, introduced from Asia, mixed with native Morus rubra genetics..\n\nAll parts of white mulberry, except for the ripe fruit, contain a milky sap (latex) that is toxic to humans. Although humans may consume ripe mulberry fruit, ingestion of unripe fruit can result in stomach upset, stimulation of the nervous system and hallucinations.\n\nAs everyone else has all ready pointed out, those are Mulberries. They're delicious. They make excellent jam as well. I have a line of red and white mulberries behind my house. My wife harvests them all summer and makes all sorts of goodies with them. Mulberry-Raspberry-Blackberry-Strawberry icecream is fucking awesome.\n\nif you are interested in some cuttings or berries from my tree please email me at Xnard14@gmail.com. i'm trying to raise money for a missions trip to mexico so it would be awesome to make a little money! :D"

      "text": "Site planting\n\nFig 1. Street trees enhance the city street and provide shade in summer.\n\nSite planting is the use of plants of various types on a site to perform a range of functions. These functions are not merely ornamental, although this is an important aspect. Plants may stabilise slopes, intercept water flows, filter pollution (water and air borne), provide shade to site users in hot conditions or shelter in windy conditions. They may provide a surface for different uses, reduce glare and heat reflection, reduce building energy demands and mitigate sound and visual pollution. In addition they may form part of a wider green infrastructure in an urban area and help local wildlife by providing a range of habitats.\n\nThe use of plants, given the range of potential benefits described above, should be a major consideration in any development but should not be considered an 'afterthought' or a merely decorative element to be added once the built structures are designed or constructed. You should always ask yourself whether a solution involving plants can be used instead of hard or engineered solutions. Thus the use of plants should be considered an integral part of the development and appropriate specialist skills of a landscape architect should always be sought – the landscape architect is as important a member of the team as a structural engineer.\n\nExcept in the smallest spaces around buildings in a very difficult environment, there are always going to be possibilities to integrate site planting into a design and to improve the architectural aspects. Planting can provide an important setting for a building or be used to provide a range of benefits as described above both for the building and the users, which may be cheaper and more attractive than by using constructed solutions.\n\nThere are many different types of plants which fulfil different requirements: height variations (trees, shrubs, ground covers), seasonal benefits (evergreen, deciduous), aesthetic values (form, textures, colours, scents). However, some plants can also cause problems such as damage to foundations or perceived loitering places for criminals, so that expert guidance is always needed.\n\nKey points:\n\nConsider how trees can be used for helping to compose the setting of the building, for providing shade and shelter and for intercepting pollution. The key aspect is the eventual mature height, the suitability for the conditions, the tree form and its effectiveness at capturing particulate pollution. (see figure 2.)\n\nConsider how lower level plants (at around eye level or slightly taller) such as shrubs can enclose space, screen areas from views, provide shelter and look attractive at all seasons without providing loitering places or causing an accumulation of rubbish. (see figure 3.)\n\nConsider how ground covers such as grasses, low shrubs or herbaceous plants can be used to stabilise slopes, to provide surfaces for different uses, to keep storm water infiltration functioning into the soil and for sustainable urban drainage. (see figure 4.)\n\nConsider the use of climbers on blank walls of buildings.\n\nConsider how to link site planting with vegetation outside the site, so integrating it into the urban green infrastructure and to improve its value functionally, socially and ecologically.\n\nEnsure that long term maintenance and management of the vegetation is built into planning for the after care of the building.\n\nRemember that plants start small and grow bigger, so that the completed project construction is only the start of the development of the landscape.\n\nFig 2.\n\nFig 3.\n\nFig 4.\n\nDesign procedure:\n\nStep 1: Build on from the design procedure discussed in the strategy on landscape design – urban by considering all the roles plants could play in the development instead of built structures or hard surfaces.\n\nStep 2: Plants need growing conditions of suitable rooting medium (soil or soil substitute), water (not too little and not too much), light (some are shade tolerant, others need full sunlight) and nutrients, so check what the environmental conditions of the site are or will be after construction. Protect any plants t be retained on the site during construction so that roots are not disturbed.\n\nStep 3: Select the appropriate plants according to the overall site design, by type (trees, tall shrubs, low shrubs, hedges, ground covers, grass, aquatic etc), by species/variety (suitable for the environmental conditions and for the function).\n\nStep 4: Prepare a site plan showing which plants should be planted where and prepare any special details such as tree pits with special drainage and watering facilities or the areas where soil will be built up behind retaining structures or any water features which require linings etc.\n\nStep 5: Prepare a specification for the types of plants and the way they will be delivered from the nursery and planted together with their immediate aftercare. This is a very specialised aspect, which needs professional guidance.\n\nStep 6: Ensure that a plan for maintenance and management of the plants is properly prepared for the short and long term, with allowances for replacement of failures in the year after planting."

      "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Florida Maple - Acer barbatum ( Acer saccharum var. floridum ) - is considered by some taxonomists to be a separate species. The correct taxonomic nomenclature appears to depend on which botanist, horticulturist, etc., you rely upon as your \"expert\". It reaches 50 to 60 feet in height but is often smaller. Displaying muted yellow or orange fall leaf color, Florida Maple is ideal for use as a specimen or park tree, or for use in woodland areas and is much preferred over Sugar Maple in USDA hardiness zones 8b through 9. The edges of the leaves turn under slightly giving them a distinct appearance. The trunk on older specimens resembles that on the northern Sugar Maple, which is an attractive gray with longitudinal ribs. The round to oval growth habit makes it an ideal shade or street tree.\n\nUse and Management\n\n`Caddo' Southern Sugar Maple is a hard-wooded tree with a moderate to slow growth rate. It grows about 1 foot each year in most soils but is sensitive to reflected heat, and to drought, turning the leaves brown (scorch) along their edges. Leaf scorch from dry soil is often evident in areas where the root system is restricted to a small soil area, such as a street tree planting. It is more drought-tolerant in open areas where the roots can proliferate into a large soil space.\n\nThe dense, well-branched crown creates dense shade, and along with many surface roots will prevent good lawn growth. Branches are usually well-attached to trunks resulting in a low branch failure rate. The tree transplants fairly easily but may develop girdling roots which can reduce growth, or in extreme cases kill the tree. Remove roots which appear to be growing around the trunk as soon as they are recognized.\n\nThe limbs of Sugar Maple are usually strong and not susceptible to wind damage. The bark forms attractive bright gray plates which stand out especially during the winter. Roots are often shallow and reach the surface at an early age, even in sandy soil. Plant in an area where grass below it will not need to be mowed so the roots will not be damaged by the mower. A variety of birds use the tree for food, nesting and cover and the fruits are especially popular with squirrels.\n\nGrowing in full sun or shade, Sugar Maple will tolerate a wide variety of soil types (except compacted soil) but is not salt-tolerant. Established trees look better when given some irrigation during dry weather, particularly in the south. In the south, many leaves remain in the central portion of the canopy for much of the winter, giving the tree a somewhat unkempt appearance. Sugar Maples are not recommended for the Dallas area, in many cases due to alkaline soils causing chlorosis. Sensitivity to compaction, heat, drought and road salt limit usage of Sugar Maple for urban street plantings, but it is still recommended for parks and other areas away from roads where soil is loose and well-drained. Acer nigrum , a similar species, is more tolerant of heat and drought.\n\nPropagation is by seeds or cuttings.\n\nPests\n\nDiseases\n\nFlorida Maple can be susceptible to a wilt disease.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1.\n\nThis document is ENH167"

      "text": "Erosion Control and Bank Stabilization\n\nHow can I stabilize and plant my steep hillside?\nThe best strategy is to use a mosaic of plants that root at different depths, to encourage a dense web of roots to hold up your hill. A variety of native plants are suitable for this purpose, but choose carefully to be sure that you don't plant lots of flammable species right next to your house! Also be careful with irrigation! Too much can undo all your efforts. Until the plants get established, it is often a good idea to install jute netting (available at local hardware stores in 50-100 foot rolls). Be sure to secure the netting well, at least every 2-3 feet with either soil staples or soil nails. For extra steep slopes, erosion control blankets might work better. There are a number of varieties that are made of coconut fibers that decompose after 5 years. Check out the web or the examples at the RCDSMM library for more details on distributors and costs.\n\nHow can I stabilize trees on my slope whose roots are exposed and eroded? The best way to stabilize the tree will depend on the particular site characteristics, but some ideas to consider include: cabling the tree to an upslope area, installing either jute netting or an erosion control blanket to prevent further erosion, installing railroad ties, rock wall or other structure underneath the roots to stabilize them. For more information, contact local landscape contractors.\n\nWhat can I do if my streambank is collapsing? Any work on the bank or within a creek needs a permit from the CA Department of Fish and Game. There are a variety of solutions, from simple rock placement to more elaborate gabion walls that can be used to stabilize your banks. Whatever you do, remember that by armoring your bank, you may be changing the flow dynamics downstream. Think carefully and check both upstream and down to see how your solution might fit into the creek. For more details, stop by the RCDSMM library."

I am seeing many maples throughout the North Shore with this problem. The disease gets its name from the resemblence of the black spots to tar.\n\nTar spot alone is generally not serious enough to threaten the health of a tree, although it can be very unsightly when there are many spots. Heavy infections will cause the leaves to drop early, as you see on your tree.\n\nThe fungi that cause tar spot overwinter on infected leaves that fall to the ground. Spores produced by the overwintering fungi are carried by wind to a susceptible maple host and infect new leaves as they are unfolding in spring, starting a new disease cycle.\n\nSanitation is the most important step you can take to deal with tar spot, as with many diseases that affect the foliage of plants. Rake up and dispose of the infected leaves as they fall now and as more fall this autumn. This will reduce the amount of overwintering fungi that can infect trees again in spring. Leaves from infected trees nearby also should be cleaned up.\n\nApplying fungicides to prevent this disease generally is not recommended. If you want to explore options and feasibility of treatment for your particular situation, contact a professional arborist.\n\nIf disease problems continue in future years, you may want to consider removing your Norway maple and replacing with a shade tree of a different species. Norway maple is considered an invasive species in the Chicago area, meaning it reproduces so prolifically that its seedlings disrupt the habitat of natural areas such as forest preserves. It also is difficult to grow other plants under Norway maples because of their dense shade and their competitive root system."

      "text": "Do Trees Talk?\n\nIt looks like a fairy tale story copied from \"Lord of the rings\" or from a science fiction story, but scientists proved that trees do communicate.\n\nOne chemist made an experiment: he investigated how willows react when attacked by a caterpillar, so he assigned them to two lots: one which he invaded with caterpillars and another as a witness, leaving it \"untouched\".\n\nAfter 14 days,\n\nhe picked up leaves from the two plots to feed in the lab some other caterpillars. He found that the larvae that ate small amounts of leaves were growing very slowly. But what was more puzzling is that leaves from both plots were equally \"unpleasant\" for the caterpillars.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nBoth willow groups filled their leaves with a chemical that proved to be repulsive for the insects.\n\nA similar experiment was made on poplars. On similar plots, one was doused with chemicals contained by insects eating on the trees. Both groups of poplars developed repulsive compounds, but when the two plots of young trees were separated in different rooms, only the doused plot synthesized the chemicals.\n\nIn both experiments, the tress in different plots did not communicate through their roots or other organs, the only conclusion being that they communicated with each other by air, employing warning pheromones. Thus, plants are not passive, at the mercy of natural phenomena and attackers.\n\nOther experiments also showed that plants can contra-attack in group, and this is done using vegetable pheromones. When informed about an occurring attack, till 50 % of the compounds synthesized by a tree can be defense products, like tannins, alkaloids and peptides, mostly in leaves, their most vulnerable organ.\n\nBut trees were found to communicate not only for defense, but also to time their blooming. In fact, blooming at the same time can also be a defense mechanism, as the consumers will not have enough time to eat too many flowers, as it would happen if trees bloomed one after another.\n\nRecently, parasite plants were even found to sniff their host-plants, selecting the preferred ones! Some corn varieties defend themselves against the root worm (Diabrotica virgifera) emitting chemicals that attract minute nematode worms that kill the root worms, which are in fact the larvae of a beetle.\n\nREADER COMMENTS:\n\nIsaiah 55:12 For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.\n\nComment #1.1 by: Skeptic on 24 Sep 2010, 21:13 GMT\n\nRather an odd comment.

Smooth, grey to brown bark, bright green, pinnately compound, 8 to 12-inch-long leaflets, and a strikingly beautiful display of white, fragrant blossoms make Yellowwood a wonderful choice for multiple landscape uses.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nYoung Cladrastis kentukea: American Yellowwood\n\n[Click thumbnail to enlarge.]\n\nGeneral Information\n\nScientific name: Cladrastis kentukea\n\nPronunciation: kluh-DRASS-tiss ken-TUCK-ee-uh\n\nCommon name(s): American Yellowwood, Virgilia\n\nFamily: Leguminosae\n\nUSDA hardiness zones: 4A through 8B (Fig. 2)\n\nOrigin: native to North America\n\nInvasive potential: little invasive potential\n\nUses: specimen; shade; street without sidewalk; highway median\n\nAvailability: somewhat available, may have to go out of the region to find the tree\n\nFigure 2.\n\nRange\n\n[Click thumbnail to enlarge.]\n\nDescription\n\nHeight: 30 to 50 feet\n\nSpread: 40 to 50 feet\n\nCrown uniformity: irregular\n\nCrown shape: round, vase\n\nCrown density: moderate\n\nGrowth rate: moderate\n\nTexture: medium\n\nFoliage\n\nLeaf arrangement: alternate (Fig. 3)\n\nLeaf type: odd-pinnately compound\n\nLeaf margin: entire\n\nLeaf shape: elliptic (oval), ovate\n\nLeaf venation: brachidodrome, pinnate\n\nLeaf type and persistence: deciduous\n\nLeaf blade length: 2 to 4 inches\n\nLeaf color: green\n\nFall color: copper, yellow\n\nFall characteristic: not showy\n\nFlower\n\nFlower color: white/cream/gray\n\nFlower characteristics: very showy\n\nFruit\n\nFruit shape: elongated\n\nFruit length: 1 to 3 inches, 3 to 6 inches\n\nFruit covering: dry or hard\n\nFruit color: white/gray\n\nFruit characteristics: does not attract wildlife; showy; fruit/leaves not a litter problem\n\nUse and Management\n\nThe one-inch-wide, fragrant flowers appear in dense, showy, pendulous, terminal panicles, 12 to 14 inches long, in early summer and are set off nicely against the lush foliage. Flowers are visited by a large number of bees. Trees may not flower until they are 10-years-old and then seem to give outstanding displays only in cycles of every two to five years but the gorgeous display is well worth the wait. The flowers are followed by showy, three to four-inch-long, whitish-grey pods which persist through the winter.\n\nUnpruned trees fall apart in 30 to 40 years. Yellowwood should be pruned when young to develop branches having a wide angle with the trunk and a `U'-shaped crotch. These should be pruned back so that they are not allowed to grow larger than half the diameter of the trunk. Develop 7 to 10 major lateral limbs spaced along the trunk, not clustered together. Good luck! This will help them develop strong attachments to the trunk and provide for a longer-lived tree than one which is not pruned in this way. Weakly-attached branches with embedded bark are susceptible to breakage and may be a problem as the tree grows older. Any pruning should be done in summertime because excess bleeding may occur if done in the winter or spring. It could be used as street tree if properly pruned to avoid weak crotches. It is often planted as a specimen or shade tree for smaller properties due to its flowers and medium size.\n\nYellowwood grows slowly in full sun on moist, well-drained soils but growth may be more rapid if provided with some shade in the southern part of its range and in the plains states. It grows slowly on poor soil but looks fine, responding to better soil with moderate growth. It tolerates alkaline (it is native to dry limestone outcroppings as well as along stream banks) or acidic soil and urban conditions. It performs well with only occasional irrigation once established, even in poor, compacted soils. It adapts to wet soils by growing a shallow root system. There are several very large, coarsely-branched roots dominating the root system which makes care following transplanting very crucial. But planting from containers is no problem.\n\nThe cultivar `Rosea' has pinkish flowers.\n\nPropagation is by seed or cuttings.\n\nPests and Diseases\n\nNo pests or diseases are of major concern. Verticillium wilt may occasionally be a problem.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1.\n\nThis document is ENH329"

      "text": "can't I get my apple trees to bear?\n\nI planted 2 apple trees 6 years ago and have yet to eat one apple. I admit, I have not been able to figure out how to prune a tree well from books. So I have done a hodge podge job at best. I would like a good apple crop for dehydrating.\n\nHow did you start the tree? A seed from an apple will usually not bear fruit, as is the case with most fruits. I don't know why. A grafted seed will bear fruit. Or if you bought a tree already in the growing stages, it should probably bear fruit, too.\n\nFirst, apples need a cross pollinator (ie different variety). So if you got two of the exact same species, instead of two different varieties, they won't have a cross pollinator. Crab apple trees will also work as a cross pollinator. In a mixed orchard it isn't a problem because the varieties all just cross pollinate each other.\n\nDo you get blossoms, then no apples, or have they never blossomed? Do you know what varieties you have, I could even give you more specific information.\n\nApples also need to be pollinated by bees or other natural pollinators to bear fruit.\n\nThe basic principle for the pruning is to open it up to light, it's not rocket science, although some different varieties do better when pruned in different ways.\n\nAlso, some varieties bear fruit on 2nd year and older wood, meaning you need some parts you didn't prune each year, if all the growth is new and you have one of those varieties, if there's no 2year old or older branches, there's no fruit.\n\nIf you don't get blossoms at all, maybe it's getting too much nitrogen.\n\nSo let me know the blossom situation, and any other details, varieties, etc., and I'm sure we can get the buggers to bear fruit. Also if you've been doing anything else for care.\n\nBeanie, tomato plants are self pollinating, don't require any pollinators. On rare occasion they can get cross pollinated, but in general, each flower pollinates itself.\n\nThree things come to mind immediately - are they getting really full strong light, or are they shaded by an upper balcony, your balcony railing, etc... Tomatos need the full sun, unobstructed. The other thing that comes to mind is on occasion if plants get too much nitrogen, they will emphasize their growth into green leaves and not flowers. Was there any purple tinge to the leaves, that would indicate a deficiency in phosphorus. Did you have flowers then no tomatoes, or no flowers.\n\nFinally, the third thing is were they a variety suited to growing in pots. You can check around, and find varieties especially suited to growing in pots on patios, etc. Most often they are a cherry tomato, with a plant form that suits that type of growing. Also were the pots big enough? Did the pots get too hot.\n\nJust some ideas for you, but no, tomatoes do not need cross pollinators"

Here are some tips to keep your cut Christmas tree fresh and safe throughout the holidays:\n\nIf you cannot set it up within\n24 hours, keep it fresh by putting it in a bucket of water outdoors, out\nof direct sun or drying winds, or in a cool place indoors.\n\nBefore you bring your tree\ninside, check it for insect egg cases and remove them. Praying mantis egg cases look like globs\nof brown Styrofoam attached to twigs, and bagworm cases look like small\ntwiggy pine cones hanging from branches.\nYou can put the mantis egg cases outside in a protected location, but\ndestroy the bagworm cases, since they are harmful to trees.\n\nWhen you set your tree up, make\na fresh cut straight across the stem, not at an angle or into a V-shape,\nabout an inch above the existing cut. Keep the cut as clean as\npossible. A smooth, clean cut will\nhelp water absorption.\n\nUse a stand that is large\nenough to hold your tree and to hold enough water for the tree. A general rule of thumb is 1 quart of\nwater for each inch of trunk diameter.\n\nDo not whittle down the sides\nof the trunk to fit the stand.\nThose outer layers of wood are the best at taking up water. Holes drilled into the center or sides\nof the trunk do not improve water uptake.\n\nCheck the water in the tree\nstand's reservoir twice a day. The\ntree can take up a tremendous amount of water. The base of the stem must not dry out,\nso be sure that the water level stays above the bottom of the tree trunk.\n\nAdd water daily as needed. The temperature of the water is not\nimportant. Just use plain tap water\n– do not add any anything like sugar, bleach, aspirin, floral\npreservatives, or water-holding gels.\nKeeping fresh water in the stand is the best thing you can do to\nkeep your tree fresh!\n\nApplying anti-transpirants or\nflame retardants to the tree does not reduce the rate of moisture loss and\nusually does not help to maintain tree freshness.\n\nKeep your tree away from heat\nsources – fireplaces, heaters, heat vents, direct sunlight. Keeping the room cooler will also help\nto keep your tree fresh. Use\nminiature lights that produce less heat and reduce the drying effect on\nthe tree.\n\nIf the tree dries out (needles\nare falling off and twigs snap instead of bend), take it out of the house."

      "text": "Maple Tree Care and Diseases\n\nThere are approximately 125 different maple tree varieties. Maple trees are popular in the northern regions of the United States. Maples are deciduous trees, characterized by opposite leaf arrangement and spectacular fall color. Their flowers are upright and green, yellow or red in color depending on species. Fruit appears in winged clusters which hold the seeds of the lovely, self-pollinating maple tree.\n\nEach variety of maple has different characteristics and site requirements. Red maple trees, for example, are true to their name with red blossoms in the spring, red fruit in summer, scarlet leaves in the fall and crimson bark and twigs in winter. The Red maple tree also thrives in wet soil, so has therefore been dubbed Swamp Maple.\n\nAnother variety of maple tree is the Sugar maple, which celebrates autumn with leaves turning shades of yellow, orange and bright red. It has a gray bark and a sensitive root system. Japanese maple is a lovely ornamental that is smaller in size, has interesting branching structure, and displays bright color and year round interest. Maple trees, with their splendid, dense crown, can provide a lifetime of beauty and shade to your landscape.\n\nSize of Tree: Varies greatly based on species, but can grow anywhere from 18 to 80 feet.\n\nMaple Tree Care\n\nMaple trees have shallow root systems, which can lift walkways and driveways as they mature, so be sure to plant them appropriately. Prune, water and fertilize maple trees regularly to maintain optimal health.\n\nMature and established trees benefit from fertilizer feedings of organic-based macro and micronutrients for the nutrition necessary to sustain their health.\n\nMaple Tree Pruning\n\nPruning is recommended to maintain desired size and to preserve or improve maple tree structure, vigor and life-span.\n\nPruning can reduce specific defects or structural problems in a maple tree to greatly lessen the risk of failure. Broken, diseased, or dead branches are typically removed in order to prevent decay-producing fungi from infecting other areas of the tree.\n\nRemoval of live branches is occasionally necessary to allow increased exposure to sunlight and circulation of air within the canopy. This assists in reduction of certain diseases. We also advocate the removal of branch stubs to promote successful and proper healing of wounds.\n\nMaple Tree Diseases, Pests & Signs\n\nThere are several damaging maple tree diseases and pests. Some of the most common are:\n\nVerticillium Wilt – Also called maple wilt, this fungus is a common and serious problem that can kill trees. This infection starts in the root system and works its way up the maple tree, resulting in cankers and dieback. Signs of maple wilt include scorched-looking leaves and diseased branches with unhealthy leaves. Occasionally olive-colored streaks can be found in the sapwood.\n\nAnthracnose – This disease results in extensive defoliation, shoot dieback, and twig death. Often confused with frost damage, signs of anthracnose include brown areas on leaves, canker on the trunk and main branches, and purplish-brown areas along the veins of the leaves.\n\nTar Spot – This disease affects several maple species and causes large, tar-like spots on the leaves.\n\nAsian Longhorned Beetle – This insect damages the sapwood beneath the bark layer, preventing the tree from properly transporting nutrients and water. Once a tree has an Asian longhorned beetle infestation, it will generally die within 1 to 2 years. Learn more about the Asian longhorned beetle.\n\nOther maple tree diseases and pests include:\n\nRoot rot\n\nGall mites\n\nCankerworms\n\nAphids\n\nCottony scale\n\nPetiole borers\n\nLeafhoppers\n\nBoxelder bugs birch tree care experts can help protect your trees and keep your landscape beautiful.\n\nIf you'd like to establish maple tree varieties in your landscape, we can connect you with a pre-vetted landscape expert that can help you purchase and plant new maple trees.

It should not kill the tree or harm the fruit. The best treatment is preventative. Fruit trees should be sprayed with a fungicide when dormant in the winter MONTEREY HORTICULTURE OIL AND LIQUICOP blended together will help prevent disease. A foliar spray containing kelp extract is helpful in spring to maintain the health of the new leaves. Try our MAXSEA KELP FERTILIZER if you get the \"curl\" Peach leaf curl only affects peaches and nectarines-curled leaves on other fruit trees is usually a sign of insect damage. Right now you can fertilize with DR. EARTH ALL PURPOSE FERTILIZER or DR.EARTH FRUIT TREE FERTILIZER .Both are available at the nursery.\n\nThere are little worms hanging from my oak tree! They are eating everything.\n\nYou have \"fruit tree leaf rollers\" commonly know as Oak worms. They arrive in spring and hang around by their silk just a few weeks. The best treatment is to spray the tree and surrounding plants with Bt. Bacillus thuringiensis, is a safe, organic insecticide that will just kill worms. A more natural treatment is to place Western Blue bird boxes in your yard and let the bluebirds (not blue jays) eat them for you. Blue birds have a huge appetite for worms and are very active at this time feeding their young. Use SAFER BT or CATERPILLER CLOBBER on your plants to stop the worms. You can also spray your petunias and geraniums to stop the budworms and on tomatoes to stop the hornworms.\n\nWhy do I have ants in my plants? The leaves are sticky and shiny.\n\nAnts and aphids go hand in hand. The ants eat the honeydew secretions left by the aphids, and the aphids are eating your tender buds and leaves. Get rid of the ants and your aphid problem will not be so bad. Placing a band of TANGLE FOOT at the base of your plants will prevent the ants from climbing up the plant. A strong blast of water will knock the aphids off. MONTEREY TAKE DOWN GARDEN SPRAY or BUG BUSTER, both Earth Friendly products, will take care of both buggers. Ant traps placed at the base of the plant will eliminate the ants too. We carry TERRO ant traps (filled w boric acid) that will wipe out the entire colony safely. Releasing ladybugs will help control the aphids.\n\nI have \"alligator looking\" bugs on my plants. Are they good guys or bad?\n\nThe larval or juvenile stage of ladybugs look like little alligators. These good guys eat more aphids than their adult counterparts. Provide an insecticide free area to keep your good bugs happy.\n\nMy plants have new growth but look \"tired and yellow\", should I feed them. Why?\n\nAfter our long, wet winters, plants need a shot of fertilizer to get growing in the spring. We recommend feeding most of your plants with or DR. EARTH ALL PURPOSE in late March/early April. For plants that require more acidity, we reccommend DR. EARTH CAMELLIA, AZALEA, AND RHODODENDRON FERTLIZER. Try to feed before a rain to wash that fertilizer into the soil. Do not feed too early, you do not want to encourage new growth until danger of frost has passed. OSMOCOTE slow release fertilizer is a great solution for people who are busy and forget to feed their plants!\n\nMany people wonder why we need to feed plants in our yard when plants growing along the freeway or in the forest are not fed. In nature, Mother Nature takes care of feeding by allowing leave litter, animal manure, and dead plants to break down and slowly put nutrients back into the soil. In our yard, we clean up leaf litter and therefore this process does not occur. Plants along the freeway look great at 65 MPH, a closer look will show that they too are hungry. Healthy plants are more apt to ward off disease and insect problems.\n\nWhat should I do to my lawn now? It looks good, but by summer-it looks terrible.\n\nCheck out our \"Honey Do\" list for the spring to see what type of fertilizer you need to use. Spring is a great time to aerate your lawn, reseed, and add some compost. Aerating is important to help air and water movement to your lawns roots. After aerating, rake up the cores, apply a thin layer of KELLOGG'S ORGANIC SOIL BUILDING COMPOST, and reseed. A healthy lawn will withstand the heat of summer better. Lawns should not be watered daily and no watering after 3pm. See our article on lawn care for more help. DR. EARTH LAWN FOOD,GB ORGANIC LAWN FOOD, and PROHIBIT FERTILIZER/PRE EMERGENT are in stock now.\n\nIf pre-emergent is used on the lawn in spring-wait until fall to reseed.\n\nThe general rule of thumb is you can plant you veggies when you can sit your bare bottom on your soil for 20 minutes. Planting too soon will not give you veggies sooner. Plants need warm soil to grow new roots and absorb nutrients. You can plant veggies through Memorial Day! Plant tomatoes, peppers, squash, beans, melons, eggplant, cucumbers, corn.\n\nDo not forget to plant herbs too! Use DR. EARTH VEGETABLE FERTILIZER to get your plants growing.\n\nHelp, I have bugs on my fruits and veggies? I have ants and spiders! What can I spray that is safe and Eco-Friendly?\n\nThere are many new safer/eco friendly pesticides and chemicals on the market. The \"Green\" trend is good for the Earth and environment. Here are a few new products.\n\nMONTEREY TAKE DOWN GARDEN SPRAY will kill all stages of insects including eggs. It can be used during the dormant and growing season. It is Pyrethrin based in canola oil.\n\nMONTEREY BUG BUSTER is a spray to prevent spiders, ants, caterpillars, grasshoppers. It synthetic and can be used on lawns, around plants, fruits and veggies and as a perimeter spray.\n\nSAFER DIATOMACEOUS EARTH contains diatomaceous earth and will help control all crawling insects-like ants, beetles, and roaches. It is also Eco Friendly\n\nMany plants can be treated with systemic chemicals, such as BAYER ALL IN ONE ROSE AND FLOWER CARE or BAYER TREE AND SHRUB to prevent insects. Systemic chemicals are safer for the environment and last longer. \"Systemic\" means it is absorbed through the plants vascular system and works from the inside out.\n\nWhat is happening to my evergreen trees? They are losing lots of leaves.\n\nMost evergreen trees drop the majority of their \"old\" leaves in early spring. Magnolias. Redwoods, and Camphors are a few. You should see new growth at the branch tips. Feed your plants DR.EARTH ALL PURPOSE FERTILIZER and add the fallen leaves to your compost pile.\n\nHow do I start a compost pile? What can I put in it?\n\nLate fall/early spring are great times to create compost piles. You can add grass clippings, leaves, weeds (that have not produced seeds yet), kitchen waste, and manure from herbivores. Adding newspaper will give your pile the needed \"brown\" matter and bring earthworms . Do not add meat/dairy products, diseased plant material, or animal droppings from carnivores. See our article on composting on the web page for more info.\n\nWe now have COMPOST SACKS in stock for those who want to compost and need a convenient composter that is easy to use and portable.\n\nFor more information please contact the nursery or visit our links page."

What should I be aware of before I plant? — Aedan G.\n\nA: The first step to planting anything is to make sure it is well-suited to your specific climate. Your climate zone and microclimate will determine which plants will grow well in your garden.\n\nThe avocado tree originated in the tropical climates of South America and may not be well-suited to some cool coastal climates. If possible, purchase your tree in the spring, after the last chance of frost, to give your tree a good head start.\n\nThe avocado tree requires delicate treatment during planting. Make sure the hole is as deep as the root ball and twice the diameter. Once planted, the tree ball should rest about 1 inch above the surrounding ground to prevent excess moisture from reaching the trunk. Irrigate your new tree immediately after planting.\n\nBotanically, the avocado flower is unique. Each flower has a female portion that opens for a few hours on one day. On the second day, the flower sheds pollen and acts as a male flower.\n\nHoneybees transfer pollen from male-stage flowers to female-stage flowers. Pollination activities and fruit set are improved when more than one tree is planted within close proximity."

Each spring over 3,000 trees are planted in public locations City-wide. These are replacements for trees that have succumbed to Dutch Elm Disease, vandalism, storms and other threats. We need your help in keeping these new trees green and healthy. Here are some tips on taking care of small trees. Thanks for all your help!\n\nMPRB Forestry crews mulch newly planted trees each year for five years, as needed. Mulch is helpful to the tree by holding moisture, reducing weeds, and preventing damage from weed whips and lawn mowers. You can help preserve root health by applying mulch as a tree continues to grow.\n\nIt is best to maintain a 4\" - 6\" layer of mulch around your trees.\n\nShredded bark or wood chips are good mulch materials. The coarser the mulch, the better. Using finely shredded mulch can almost act as a soil layer and can bury your tree base, possibly causing death.\n\nDo not heap the mulch around the tree trunk. Keep the mulch a few inches away from the trunk of the tree. This will help prevent damage to your tree from excessive moisture and rodent damage.\n\nAs the tree grows older, the mulched area should expand with the tree. On older trees, a mulched area with a diameter of 12 feet is effective and attractive.\n\nWeeds can be unsightly and can compete with your tree for essential moisture. Remove weeds from the mulched area by hand, not with herbicide, and try to keep the mulch from mixing with the surrounding soil."

      "text": "Why Fruit Trees Fail to Bear\n\nGuide H-308\n\nCollege of Agriculture, Consumer and Environmental Sciences New Mexico State University\n\nThis publication is scheduled to be updated and reissued 8/99.\n\nFruit trees normally begin to bear fruit soon after they are old enough to flower. Nevertheless, the health of the tree, its environment, its fruiting habits, and the cultural practices you use influence its ability to produce fruit. Adequate pollination is essential to fruit yield.\n\nOne unfavorable condition may reduce yields or prevent the bearing of any fruit. You can control some of the factors contributing to fruit production.\n\nBearing Age\n\nMost fruit trees are propagated by grafting or budding the variety on a root stock. When you purchase nursery-grown trees, their tops will be one to two years old while the roots may be one or two years older. The age (from planting) when trees can be expected to bear fruit depends on the type of fruit you are growing: apple, apricot and sour cherry (three to five years), peach (two to four), pear and plum (four to six), quince and sweet cherry (five to seven). Dwarf fruit trees may begin to bear one to two years earlier than standard sized trees.\n\nTree Health\n\nTrees must be healthy to produce good quality fruit. Weak or diseased trees produce either poor quality fruit or no fruit at all. The first step is to keep trees free from insects and diseases.\n\nClimate and Weather\n\nFlowers and young fruits of trees in New Mexico frequently are injured by late spring frosts. Injured flowers may appear to be normal, but if the pistils (center parts of the flower) are killed no fruit will be produced.\n\nTime of bloom varies with species. The earliest to bloom is the almond, followed by Japanese plums and apricots. Peaches are next, followed by sweet cherries, pears, European plums, sour cherries, and apples. Varieties also vary in time of flowering. Make your selections from varieties that are late blooming and that are recommended for New Mexico.\n\nIn some areas, although the tree may grow, fruit may not mature because the frost-free season is not long enough. Most commercial pecan varieties can only be grown in southern New Mexico. Pecan varieties grown in the northern part of the U.S., such as 'Major' and 'Peruque', may be better adapted to northern New Mexico.\n\nPollination\n\nFlowers of fruit trees must be pollinated to pro.duce fruit. Without sufficient pollination, they may blossom abundantly but will not bear fruit.\n\nVarieties that bear fruit from pollination among their own flowers are said to be \"self fruitful.\" How.ever, many varieties cannot produce fruit from their own pollen. Those requiring pollen from another var.iety are called \"self unfruitful.\" Some trees. like pecans, have separate male and female flowers on the same tree. If the male pollen is shed before the female flower is receptive, fruit-set becomes a problem.\n\nSome species of fruit trees do not fit conveniently into either category. Pistachios have male trees that produce pollen and female trees that produce fruit. To grow them successfully, it is necessary to plant at least one male tree for every eight female pistachio trees.\n\nMost apple trees are self unfruitful. Plant at least two varieties near one another. 'Golden Delicious', a self fruitful variety, and 'Jonathan' are the most common pollinators used.\n\nIn general, a pollinator should be considered for all pear varieties, even though 'Kieffer' and 'Duchess' set good crops without pollinators. Most pear varieties, especially 'Bartlett', are susceptible to fireblight dis.ease; 'Moon Glow' and 'Kieffer Starking Delicious' are resistant.\n\nMost peach varieties are self fruitful. However, if you are planting 'J. H. Hale', 'Stark Honeydew Hale', or 'Stark Hale Berta Giant', you need to plant another variety to assure adequate pollination.\n\nThe lack of fuzz on the fruit is the main difference between a nectarine and a peach. Nectarines are usually smaller and have a distinctive sub-acid flavor. Nectarines do not need pollinators. Nectarine flowers are more susceptible to frost injury than peaches and the fruit is frequently scarred from injury by insects.\n\nLeading varieties of apricot trees are self fruitful. However, a pollinator will increase production. 'Goldrich' and 'Perfection' varieties must be polli.nated to bear fruit.\nJapanese plums bloom earlier than European plums, and for this reason they will not usually pollinate each other. 'Stanley', the number one European type, is self fruitful. 'Bluefre' and 'Stanley' are the most common pollinizers for European plums. 'Redheart' is one of the best pollinators for Japanese plums. 'Santa Rosa', one of the most widely planted Japanese plum, and 'Methley' are self fruitful.\n\nWith the exception of 'Stella' and 'Compact Stella', all sweet cherries need a pollinator to bear well. As a general rule of thumb, dark colored varieties will pollinate dark varieties, and light colored varieties are recommended to pollinate other light ones.\n\nMost sour (pie) cherries bear heavily without a pollinator. They are hardier and bloom later than the sweet cherries.\n\nOccasionally, fruit trees bear heavily one year and sparsely the next. This is called \"biennial bearing.\" The spring-flowering buds of most hardy fruit trees are formed during the previous spring or summer. Therefore, an especially heavy crop one year may prevent adequate bud formation for the following year or may seriously weaken the tree.\n\nBiennial bearing of apples is difficult to alter or correct. Sometimes by chemical or hand thinning, when fruit-set is extra heavy, you can induce a return to normal yearly fruit production. Thinning should be done early, soon after fruit-set, before flower buds for next season are initiated. Thin fruits to approximately three to five inches apart.\n\nCultural Practices\n\nFruit trees need good cultural practices during the season to maintain an adequate number of good leaves for quality fruit production. About 30 to 40 good-sized, healthy leaves are needed to produce one good-quality apple.\n\nTrees need full sunlight for best production. Inadequate sunlight delays the beginning of fruit bearing and may reduce the amount of fruit. Avoid placing fruit trees where they will be shaded by build.ings or by other trees.\n\nYour trees will grow more vigorously and bear better if they have adequate space to develop their root systems. Do not plant them where roots of forest or shade trees will compete with them. To reduce competition from weeds or grass, cultivate, mulch, or apply weed killer.\n\nPrune young trees to train them to systems suitable for the species. Strong branches are needed to sup.port the weight of a heavy crop. Severe pruning may stimulate excessive upright growth, which delays flower production and reduces yields.\n\nNew Mexico State University is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer and educator.

This fungal disease can cause severe leaf blighting and deformation, but in many cases the damage to the plant health is not severe. The most common symptoms include irregular browning patches along the veins. The fungus spreads from infected tissue in spring to new growth. Applications of fungicides are used for control. Fungicide injections are available also.\n\nApple Scab\n\nRead More\n\nApple scab is a fungus and occurs on apple and crabapple trees. In late fall to early spring round black dots appear primarily on infected leaves from the previous year. Spores are released from these spots in the spring and blown by wind or splashing rain to new growth on nearby trees. The fungus infects leaves, fruit, petioles, and blossoms of the tree. Symptoms on infected leaves initially appear as velvety brown to olive colored spots then turning black. Heavy defoliation may occur, causing trees to be less attractive, reduce growth and yield, and increases susceptibility to winter injury. Fungicide applications or injections may be necessary to control apple scab.\n\nDiplodia TipLeaf Spot\n\nRead More\n\nSEASON: Spring to fall.\n\nAPPEARANCE: The most obvious symptom of this disease is elongated circular spots on the grass blades. These spots have a brown or straw-colored center with black to purplish borders.\n\nFAVORABLE CONDITIONS: Cool (50º to 70º F), moist conditions are most favorable for the growth of leaf spot. The spots first appear on grass in shady areas of the lawn. They occur most commonly during wet, humid weather or in lawns that are often lightly sprinkled or mowed too closely.\n\nNeedle Cast\n\nRead More\n\nRhizosphaera is a fungus disease and typically affects blue spruce trees. Symptoms of the disease are discoloration of the needles, needle drop, and eventually turn brown. Infection takes place in the spring, but symptoms are not visible until the following spring and summer. Infected needles turn a reddish-purple color. The disease is spread primarily by rain water splashing the spores from infected needles to newly emerging needles. A fungicide is used to help control and prevent the spread of this disease.\n\nPowdery Mildew\n\nRead More\n\nMany landscape plants are susceptible to powdery mildew fungi. This fungus usually appears as a grayish or white powdery growth on the leaves and other tissue. Most powdery mildews are unlikely to seriously harm certain plants but may cause leaves and shoots to become distorted and infected leaves to drop prematurely.\n\nOak Wilt\n\nRead More\n\nOak wilt is a fungus that moves from tree to tree by insects or transporting it underground through the roots. Most new tree infections occur as a result of the fungus moving from an infected tree to a nearby healthy tree through connected root systems. The symptoms vary depending on the variety of oak but usually include leaf discoloration and wilting. This disease shows symptoms and cause death in a very short period of time.\n\nDutch Elm Disease\n\nRead More\n\nDutch elm disease is a fungal disease in elm trees that is spread by the elm bark beetle. The symptoms are the result of a fungus infecting the vascular system of the tree. This infection clogs the vascular tissues, preventing water movement to the crown and causing the tree to wilt and die. The leaves begin by wilting and proceed to yellowing and browning. The most effective means of preventing the disease is to control the population of the insects that transmit the fungus. Fungicides are used to halt the fungus once it has infected a tree\n\nIron Chlorosis\n\nRead More\n\nIron deficiency causes new foliage to be undersized and pale. Fading appears first around leaf margins, then spreads inward until only the veins are green. Brown spots between leaf veins can also develop and leaves may later dry and drop prematurely. Iron is present in most soils; however, if the soil is alkaline iron is less available. The plants are unable to absorb iron under these conditions. Different methods are used to correct this deficiency depending on plant type and size.\n\nJuniper TwigRichters Beautification does an awesome job, they will tell you what you need in order for your lawn to look its best.

The area originally was the site of one of the Arboretum's nurseries. The nursery was cleared in the late 1940s and this collection started in 1950 as the Low Shrub Group.\n\nToday, with so many people living in urban spaces, plantable green space is often limited. As a result, there is demand for smaller sized plants to better fit such compact gardens and landscapes. This collection is a valuable resource that contains examples of trees, shrubs, evergreens, and woody perennials that retain their small stature throughout their lifetime. These dwarf, woody plants are well-suited for smaller green spaces, whether it be for a city townhome or a ranch in the suburbs.\n\nThe collection covers only about 1 acre but it contains 127 different kinds of low-growing trees and shrubs. Some of the more notable plants are lavender Twist® redbud (Cercis canadensis 'Covey'), compact white fir (Abies concolor 'Compacta'), and autumn cascades black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica 'Autumn Cascades')."

However, it's advisable to apply pruning paint to susceptible oaks whenever you prune. The insects that transmit the disease are not active right now in January, but since our weather is as unpredictable as our insects, if you're pruning an oak, the best advice is to always cover any cuts with pruning paint.\n\nOn other trees, you don't need to apply pruning paint. It does inhibit the natural healing process that occurs when you prune in the proper place on the tree. So normally you would not apply pruning paint of any sort."

Facts are that if a bonsai is suitably cared for, -given sufficient sources of nutrients, air, light and water- it could and probably should out live a tree of the same species grown in nature. Another unjustified myth is that bonsai is cruel, that it harms the tree. The practice of bonsai is no more cruel, or harmful, than pruning your shrubs or trees in your own landscape.\n\nAlthough most any small leafed plant can be used, in Japanese style bonsai, azalea, bamboo, camellia and various pines are some of the most favorable plants. No special hybrids or dwarf trees are required as commonplace plants, which might grow in the wild, are appropriate. You must remember that bonsai are the same plants that are grown outdoors and that they are not indoor plants, with the exception of plants that are suited and trained to grow indoors.\n\nArticle comments\n\n1 -\nJewels\n\nSep 10, 2005 at 7:19 am\n\nInformative read on the art of bonsai.

Creation of the water garden within their personal gardening spaces was to bring more aspects of nature into one space. Even developing the colorful strains of the Koi, fish of many colors used in the water ponds, were developed in a similar manner as the bonsai trees, spawned to be colorful, decorative. They also kept mosquito population out of the ponds.\n\nI have read some species of bonsai to be decades old.

      "text": "SOUTH SHAFTSBURY -- Poet Robert Frost loved trees, wrote about trees, and planted trees -- by the thousand.\n\nNow, thanks to the Friends of Robert Frost, lovers of his poetry can partake in his other passion, by growing a Frost apple tree in their own yards.\n\nAll of the apples presented for sale April 24 and 25 will be varieties Frost grew, either here or on his farm in Ripton, though not all will be direct descendants of those specific trees. The trees Frost planted at the Homer Noble farm went wild after his death, said Carole Thompson, director of the Robert Frost Stone House Museum. Cuttings of those varieties came from the heirloom gardens at the Kipling farm in Brattleboro.\n\n\"The snow apple is a direct scion of a Frost tree grown right on this property,\" Thompson said. \"The others are more like cousins!\" They have the same general DNA as the apples Frost grew himself, but come from other sources.\n\nMuseum director Carole Thompson says, \"We planted 20 trees in the museum's south pasture as a new display orchard from the first batch in 2008. Frost had almost one thousand apple trees at the Stone House, but his original orchard is in ruin. We thought it would be fun to propagate the old trees on the property by grafting. It's a tricky procedure, so we had the trees made at a nursery. The Frost Snow apple has been the most popular variety, especially since Frost wrote \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\" here at the Stone House, she said.\n\nThis year's sale will be the Friends' second. Plans for last year had to be scuttled when a storm destroyed nearly the entire crop at the Pennsylvania nursery where the new trees were propagatedApple trees need six hours of sunlight and like neutral soil. Basically, New England is a great place to grow apples. Of course, as Frost said, \"Something has to be left to God.\"\n\nThere are five varieties of Frost apple trees offered this year.\n\n* Snow Apple is taken from cuttings at the Stone House. The Snow apple, a parent of the Macintosh, originated in France in the 1600s. The fruit is glossy green with red stripes that mature into a deeper red, with pure white flesh. It is a dessert apple that ripens early.\n\nFrost planted an orchard outside his cabin in Ripton in 1958, at the age of 83. He knew that apple trees take five years to bear, and he may never have tasted the fruit of these trees. He wrote, \"There's nothing I like to think about more than apple trees!\" There are seven surviving trees at the cabin, although they have gone wild. Thankfully the DNA of apples remains true to the variety, even though these were not propagated from the wild trees at Ripton. They are a marvelous group that exhibits all the things Frost loved about apples: horticulture, history, geography and humanity, yes humanity, including biblical references. The cuttings for the Homer Noble varieties came from the Rudyard Kipling estate in Brattleboro, so they have a dual literary history.\n\n* Red Astrakan: This is a very early apple that originated in Russia. It is not a good keeper, but the burst of flavor in early August is sensational! Fruit medium size, skin yellow, flushed crimson. Flesh firm, coarse, greenish-white, quite tart. Makes flavorful dried apples, and August is a good time for drying. Some old-timers rate this best for pie. Frost also grew this apple at the Stone House. It was one of the \"thousand apple trees of some unforbidden variety.\"\n\n* Gravenstein: This apple was found in Italy in the 1600s by Duke Augustenberg of Castle Graefenstein in Germany, who took it home to propagate. It is an oblong fruit having bright yellow skin with a pinkish-orange flush and light red striping. The creamy yellow flesh is tender, crisp, juicy, and aromatic. Ripens early in most areas and is not a good keeper.\n\n* Sops-of-Wine (Sopsevine) is an ancient English culinary and cider apple. Fruit medium to large, slightly conical, with greenish-yellow skin covered with dark red faint red striping. Flesh is yellow and often stained with pink, tender, aromatic, and not very juicy. There is archival evidence that Frost was concerned about John's Gospel of the Last Supper that mentions the \"sop of wine\" given to Judas. This is a good example of the apple embedded in religion, not to mention the apple in the Garden of Eden.\n\n* Duchess of Oldenburg: Known as the \"King of the Ironclads\" for its extreme winter hardiness, this is one of many fine old apples of Russian origin. It arose around the upper Volga region of Russia and was introduced into England around 1817. Very popular as a fine-cooking and fresh-eating apple, Duchess is a medium to large fruit with smooth yellow skin overlaid with a red wash, sometimes completely red when fully exposed to the sun. The whitish flesh is tender, crisp and juicy with a tangy flavor. Ripens August to September and is only a fair keeper. Duchess is a renowned, award-winning pie appleThompson described the sales, which raise funds for the Friends, as \"a lot of fun,\" saying she has stayed in touch with the people who have Frost's trees.\n\nWhen the Friends bought the Stone House property, Thompson said, they knew there was an orchard back of it somewhere, but most of the orchard was in ruins, having been left without maintenance, and parts of it having been sold off in subdivisions. \"Last winter, I found three of Frost's original trees out in the woods,\" she said. \"I bushwacked my way in there. I cut some branches to make walking sticks. We're going to have walking sticks from some of Frost's original trees.\"\n\nThompson said the walking sticks will not be ready at the time of the tree sale, because the wood was cut only this winter, and needs time to dry out. \"Frost was famous for walking, and there are pictures of him at Ripton, with walking sticks,\" she said. He was known for speaking of the \"crooked straightness\" of a good walking stick, comparing it to the same feature in a good poem.\n\nThe second semi-annual Robert Frost Apple Tree Sale will take place on Saturday and Sunday, April 24 and 25 at the Robert Frost Stone House Museum located on Route 7A in Shaftsbury. The fundraising event starts at 10 a.m. and runs through 4 p.m. Quantities are limited, but buyers may purchase as many as desired. The trees are bare-rooted and dormant, standing approximately 4-to-5-feet tall.\n\nThe museum opens to the public for the season on May 1. At some point this summer, there will be an exhibit titled, \"The Poetry of Trees,\" tying in both to Frost's apple trees and the 1,000 red pine trees he planted on the site. Some of those trees, 90 years old now, are being harvested, and used -- just as Frost intended"

      "text": "In The Diggings: wind the enemy of many\n\nBy\nMurray Flitcroft\n\nSept. 21, 2012, midnight\n\nIF wind is a worry in your garden there are things you can and should do. Apart from blowing away blossoms, wind can dry our your garden plants and soil. Combined with heavy rain and damp soil wind can be very destructive blowing and toppling trees that aren't well anchored.\n\nStrong winds also break branches and tear leaves increasing the effect of either cold or hot temperatures. Make time this weekend to check all your plants to make sure they are solid in the ground. Grab them around the trunk or a substantial branch and just give them a shake. If the trunk and root zone don't move around in the ground your plant should be okay.\n\nIf you notice any movement or rocking, install some substantial tree stakes with mesh webbing ties. The ties should be firm but allow some movement. If ties are put on too tight they can damage the trunk and also weaken the roots.\n\nEach year around this time we are asked to look at plantings of trees that have a problem and have either blown over or are at risk of blowing over. Encourage trees to form deep roots. If you water a tree frequently and lightly, the roots grow close to the surface. If you water the tree less often but thoroughly soak it, the water penetrates deep into the soil, encouraging roots deeper in search of water.\n\nWind damages many trees that could have been protected by proper preparation. A young tree that has grown considerably during the summer may need to be thinned before strong winter and spring winds blow. By removing several branches you can create a more open canopy that the wind can blow through. While you're training trees, prune them to develop strong crotches that can withstand wind. Consult a qualified arborist for help with this.\n\nWindbreaks can help slow the wind for a distance that is about six times the height of the windbreak. For best effect make sure they are permeable, to allow some air to pass through. The force of the wind is like a wave of water hitting a barrier. If its solid, the wave breaks over the top. If the barrier has openings, the force of the wave diffuses.\n\nIf you love your garden but never have enough time give us a call on 5330 1071 or email via our website"

George Washington and Pierre L'Enfant masterful design strategy provides breathtaking open public landscape painted with a mosaic of warm toned shades of orange and gold to purple and scarlet. Autumn's crisp chill and diminishing length of daylight induce trees to shed their green leaves. Temperature, sunlight, and soil moisture greatly influence the quality of the fall foliage display.\n\nBefore leaves fall in the autumn they pass key nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorous, back into the main body of the tree or plant. Species with brighter autumn leaves appear to retain more nutrients than duller-coloured ones. Two pigments play a vital role in this process: Anthocyanins and Carotenoids. Anthocyanins are water-soluble red, rarely blue, pigments found in both the young and old leaves of many plants, while Carotenoids are highly unsaturated fat-soluble yellow-red pigments produced by plants and fungi."

      "text": "To reduce future disease problems, rake up and dispose of leaves and prune out branches with cankers.\n\nTimely fungicide application can prevent severe outbreaks.\n\nFoliage diseases can reduce the aesthetic value of aspen and cottonwood. Occasionally, a severe disease outbreak causes premature defoliation or dieback of parts of the tree.\n\nIf a tree loses its leaves early in the season, it may grow new ones and its health is not seriously affected. If it loses them in midsummer, however, growing new leaves may prevent the tree from fully hardening off before cold weather or reduce the amount of stored food. This leads to increased danger of frost damage, reduced growth, and predisposition to other diseases or Insects. If it loses its leaves late in the season, it will not grow new ones or lose much vigor.\n\nMarssonina Leaf Spot\n\nFigure 1: Marssonina leaf spot on cottonwood.\n\nFigure 2: Marssonina leaf spot on aspen, late symptoms.\n\nThe fungus Marssonina causes the most common foliage disease on aspen\nand cottonwoods in urban and forested areas of Colorado.\n\nMarssonina leaf spots are dark brown flecks, often with yellow halos (Figure 1). Immature spots characteristically have a white center. On severely infected leaves, in wet weather, several spots may fuse to form large black dead patches (Figure 2). Spots also may develop on leaf petioles and succulent new shoots.\n\nMarssonina survives the winter on fallen leaves that were infected the previous year (Figure 9). With spring and warmer, wet weather, the fungus produces microscopic \"seeds\" or spores that are carried by the wind and infect emerging leaves. Early infections are rarely serious, but if the weather remains favorable, spores\nfrom these infections can cause a widespread secondary infection. Heavy secondary infections become visible later in the growing season and cause premature leaf loss on infected trees.\n\nFigure 3: Septoria leaf spot showing tan circular spots.\n\nFigure 4: Septoria leaf spot showing irregular brown to black spots.\n\nSeptoria Leaf Spot\n\nThe fungus Septoria causes a common foliar disease mainly on cottonwoods and occasionally aspen in urban areas of Colorado.\n\nThe appearance of Septoria leaf spots varies considerably between tree species and with time. Symptoms include a distinct tan circular spot with black margins and small black pimples in the center (Figure 3), and irregular brown to black spots that coalesce into large areas (Figure 4).\n\nThe disease is rarely a problem on plains and eastern cottonwoods but can cause considerable damage on lanceleaf cottonwoods. In wetter climates, the fungus also causes cankers on twigs and main stems.\n\nSeptoria survives the winter on fallen leaves that were infected the previous year (Figure 9). With spring and warmer, wet weather (70 to 75 degrees F), the fungus produces microscopic spores that are carried by the wind and infect emerging leaves. Early infections are rarely serious. If the weather remains favorable, spores from these infections can cause a widespread secondary infection. Heavy secondary infections become visible later in the growing season and cause premature leaf loss on infected trees.\n\nFigure 5: Ink spot disease on aspen in early summer.\n\nFigure 6: Ink spot disease on aspen in midsummer.\n\nInk Spot of Aspen\n\nThe fungus Ciborinia causes a leaf disease of aspen commonly known as ink spot. It is found mainly in the mountains of Colorado.\n\nThe first symptoms of ink spot appear in late spring to early summer as tan to brown areas on the upper leaf surfaces. Concentric, discolored ring patterns may become visible as the fungus advances through the leaf (Figure 5). These concentric patterns can be confused with leafminer attacks. Infected leaves may be totally brown by midsummer, while adjacent uninfected leaves remain green. Raised black bodies begin to appear on affected brown leaves. These hard masses of fungal material are oval and nearly 1/4 inch long. These are the \"ink spots\" that give the disease its common name (Figure 6). In late summer, these spots fall out, leaving a characteristic \"shot hole\" effect on leaves that remain on the tree. This disease is especially prevalent in dense aspen stands. Early defoliation may reduce growth.\n\nThe hard fungal tissue masses that fall from infected leaves are the overwintering stage of the fungus. Wet spring weather stimulates spore production. Spores are blown and splashed from the ground to developing leaves.\n\nFigure 7: Shoot blight on aspen showing black and curled stem.\n\nLeaf and Shoot Blight\n\nLeaf and shoot blight, caused by the fungus Venturia, is a disease affecting young aspen and cottonwood tissue primarily in the mountains.\n\nIn the spring, symptoms first become visible on leaves near shoots infected the previous season. Brown to blackened, irregularly shaped areas spread through the leaves, causing them to dry and become distorted. Typically, the fungus spreads down through the succulent new shoot, causing cankers that blacken and curl the stem tip until it resembles a shepherd's crook (Figure 7). Death of new shoots causes distorted, shrubby growth.\n\nThe leaf and shoot blight fungus survives the winter mainly on shoots infected the previous season. Spores are windblown early in the season and infect newly expanding leaves and shoots. As the season progresses, uninfected tissue becomes more resistant to the disease.\n\nLeaf Rusts\n\nA rust disease caused by the fungus Melampsora is often seen on aspen and cottonwood. Though common, this disease rarely causes serious problems.\n\nFigure 8: Leaf rust.\n\nThe disease is easily recognized by small, yellow-orange pustules that are scattered on the lower leaf surfaces (Figure 8). These orange pustules are most visible in late summer and early fall.\n\nThe life cycle of this fungus requires two different tree hosts. During wet spring weather, spores are released from the fungus, which has overwintered on fallen cottonwood or aspen leaves. These spores infect evergreen needles, such as Douglas-fir, pine, fir or spruce, where they cause little damage. After two to three weeks, spores are produced on these evergreen hosts and are blown to aspen or cottonwood leaves. Once the rust is established on aspen or cottonwood hosts, it can multiply rapidly under favorable wet conditions throughout the summer. Several years of heavy infections can cause some growth losses, especially on younger trees. Fallen infected leaves shelter the fungus until the next year's disease cycle.\n\nDisease Management\n\nTree resistance is the best way to prevent foliar diseases. Several poplar hybrids or species are resistant to one or more of these diseases. Ask your local nursery for a resistant variety. Some aspens are resistant to leaf spots, but aspen production methods make it difficult to select trees for resistance.\n\nSanitation is an effective control for some foliar diseases. Fall removal of infected leaves, twigs and branches can reduce the amount of disease the next spring. Raking and destroying infected leaves can reduce Marssonina leaf spot, ink spot and leaf rust. The shoot blight fungus overwinters in diseased stems and twigs, so it can be pruned out to reduce new infections.\n\nKeep leaves as dry as possible to reduce the incidence of leaf spots:\n\nWater in early morning so leaves can dry out.\n\nKeep sprinkler patterns adjusted so leaves don't stay wet.\n\nSpace trees apart to reduce humidity to help prevent leaf diseases.\n\nFungicides, if applied early enough, can prevent foliage diseases. Spraying\nwill prevent only new infections; it will not cure leaves already infected.\nIf an infection is developing on particularly valuable trees, or if there\nis good reason to believe an infection is imminent, the trees can be sprayed\nwith fungicides. Trees that perennially have foliar diseases should be\nsprayed at bud break and then two or three times during the growing season\nat 12- to 14-day intervals. Fungicides currently labeled include mancozeb\nchlorothalonil and basic cupric sulfate. Please follow label rates and\ndirections when applying. Check with your Colorado State University Cooperative\nExtension county office or Colorado State Forest Service district forester\nfor specific fungicide recommendations.\n\nColorado State University, U.S. Department of Agriculture and Colorado\ncounties cooperating.

Their blossoms will delight your senses and set your garden apart.\n\nBy Marty Ross\n\n|||||\n\nSASSAFRAS S. albidum\n30-60 ft\n\nThe clusters of tiny yellow flowers on sassafras trees light up woodland edges and native landscapes in early spring, before the dogwoods bloom. Guy Sternberg, director of Starhill Forest Arboretum of Illinois College in Petersburg, especially likes the combination of sassafras flowers with redbud blooms: \"like lemon-raspberry sherbet.\" Sassafras is native to North America and a host plant for the larvae of spicebush swallowtail butterfly and other butterflies and moths. Stephen Kress, vice president for bird conservation at the National Audubon Society, considers sassafras an excellent tree for attracting birds because of the high fat content of its fruit, which turns from green to dark purple in late summer; the fruit is consumed quickly and eagerly by resident and migrating birds. Sassafras trees have a willowy habit and grow quite tall, 30 to 60 feet, in sun or shade. Their leaves are rounded and mitten shaped, and turn brilliant scarlet or orange in early fall. They are difficult to transplant; start with seedlings or look for small specimens at garden shops. Hardy in USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 4 to 9."

On each visit I see something that I had not noticed before, and last week it was the placement of all the typical Japanese garden plant species in the context of the native big trees of Oregon that really struck me. How brilliantly this was designed by Professor Takuma Tono! In his words, The use of a small piece of ground is characteristic of the Japanese garden. Although the garden itself is not so large, if the scenery behind is fortunate enough of a beautiful forest or a mountain, we utilize this outside scenery as a part of the particular garden structure, presenting an expansive appearance including those background features.\n\nThis is the concept of borrowed view, or shakkei. In addition, with the use of such huge trees, the Garden employs the element of ikedori, captured alive, in preseving the Douglas Firs and Western Red Cedars that frame this view of the bridge. It enhances the experience of shifts of perspective and scale that happen so frequently in a Japanese garden. That sense of shifting views is meant to allow us to have the same interior experience, not so much of awe, but of quiet reflection. The deep shade created by these enormous trees keeps the Garden cool, restful, and meditative. In the last few weeks I have seen many species of giant trees in the wild--it was deeply satisfying to see them in a large city, providing the backbone and soul of such a masterpiece. Read more about the Garden in Bruce Taylor Hamilton's excellent book Human Nature: The Japanese Garden of Portland, Oregon."

They were planted in compacted limestone and the hole was only as big as the root ball. Should I have added something to the soil to help my plants?\n\nO.G., West Kendall\n\nWelcome to south Florida and our unique soils!\n\nWhen planting any type of plant, whether it's a begonia or a live oak, the planting hole should be shallow and at least two to three times the diameter of the rootball. All too often people dig a deep hole thinking it's beneficial for the plant, but studies show the opposite. In fact, the hole should be a couple inches shallower than the rootball so that when the plant is planted, the uppermost major roots at the base of the plant are a couple inches above the level of the surrounding soil.\n\nFor trees and shrubs, it's not recommended to add anything to the soil when planting. Use only the soil left over from digging the hole. Avoid adding fertilizer until three to six months after planting.\n\nThe plant gets no benefit from adding potting soil, bagged topsoil, peat moss, or compost when putting trees in the ground. These amendments can actually cause problems since the roots are less likely to establish in the surrounding soil. Instead, they circle around and around in the original hole.\n\nAvoid packing the soil when planting. If the trees are falling over easily, try staking them. Just remember to remove the tree stakes in one year.\n\nFor additional information on proper tree planting techniques and how often to water after planting, please read this UF Extension publication:"

      "text": "I always look to my garden when it comes time to decorate for a special party or celebrating the holidays.\n\nI particularly like decorating with holly foliage because it has fruit or holly berries. Depending on the cultivar or variety, small round and red fruits are found all along the stems, giving us the perfect traditional color combination of red and green.\n\nTop two hollies Two hollies are both the most common large varieties for planting in the garden and for their use of the foliage in holiday decorations: Ilex opaca, American holly, and Ilex x attenuata #2, Foster holly.\n\nAmerican holly grows 30 to 40 feet tall in most urban garden situations, and can be quite wide with a full skirt of 20 to 25 feet or more in width. A full skirt is what we call the drape of the lower branches as they descend to the ground. The American hollies are at their most beautiful when allowed to remain fully branched to the ground or to have a full skirt. This skirt is not as obvious when the American holly is young, but as it matures it develops a beautiful flair or drape just before ground level. When American hollies are planted in areas that are too small for them to grow into their natural shape, they are often pruned in unusual ways or into tree form. Many would say that having to prune a beautiful American holly into an odd shape or tree form is a crime, and would rather see them taken out and something more appropriately sized replanted.\n\nThe hybrid Foster holly has both a smaller leaf and an overall smaller habit. Growing 20 to 25 feet tall and more conical, the Foster holly typically does not form a full skirt like American holly, and therefore is a much more appropriate selection when space is limited and pruning may be necessary. Foster holly can also be planted in a hedge row and pruned to form a formal hedge with great success. The fruit production on Foster holly is much more reliable in urban environments where male pollinators are sparse, and I find the foliage easier to handle and decorate with than American holly foliage.\n\nPollination a must It is important to know that all hollies are dioecious. This means that male and female flower parts are found on separate flowers and on separate plants. The plants with female flowers produce the beautiful fruits or berries, and the plants with male flowers produce only pollen and no fruit. So if you want a holly that will have fruit, make sure you get a female cultivar and that there is a male cultivar in the area to pollinate the female holly.\n\nAny holly can pollinate any other holly as long as the bloom sequence crosses. Can a shrub like Japanese holly pollinate a tree like American holly, or can an American holly pollinate a deciduous holly? Yes, as long as they are flowering at the same time and are generally located in the same area. In fact, this type of inter-species pollination occurs all the time. Several times I have seen a single American holly in full glorious fruit and not another American holly in sight, but there has to be a male holly of some variety nearby.\n\nWater, water, water Either holly will grow very well in full sun to part shade, and they prefer a moist acidic soil. When planting either of these hollies, watering them very well for a period of three months after planting is a must. Because they are typically branched to the ground, it is important to not rely on a sprinkler or Mother Nature only to water. Always water them by hand at least once a week to ensure that the soil ball that was in the container previously is receiving water and is moist until the roots can grow out into the existing soil.\n\nASK THE GARDENER by Angie McManus\n\nWhen is the best time to cut back cherry laurels and holly bushes?\n\nBoth cherry laurels, Prunus laurocerasus, and holly, Ilex, are considered broad-leafed evergreens. They should only need to be pruned to shape them or to remove broken branches, usually due to severe weather. Pruning for this reason can be done at any time of year.\n\nIf you are pruning them because they are too large for the space they were planted in or because they are meant to be a more formal aspect of the garden, they should be pruned during the late winter or early spring before they break dormancy. To reduce the chance of spreading disease, it is always best to use clean, rust-free gardening tools.\n\nIf you need specific pruning instructions, go on the Web to the University of Kentucky College of Agriculture at  and type \"Pruning Landscape Trees\" in the search box to locate the online file or downloadable PDF."

While there are plenty of good-looking aspen around the region, it also is the most common problem tree discussed in calls or samples brought to Colorado State University Cooperative Extension's Plant Diagnostic Clinic...\nAspen trees are short-lived trees, as expected from their role in forest ecology. In the urban landscape, even properly cared-for aspen may not reach 20 years. Life spans can be shortened further by one or more of several insects or diseases that attack aspen. Fungal diseases, such as Cytospora or other cankers which attack the trunk, are common, as are diseases of the foliage such as rusts, or leaf spots. Of the many insects that attack urban plantings of aspen, oystershell scale, aphids and aspen twiggall fly are most prevalent.\"\nRemember that aspens are very sensitive to many environmental problems and are host to more than five hundred species of parasites, berbivores, diseases, and other harmfull agents. Aspen has been a disapointment to many when planted in the landscape."

      "text": "Mature trees add \"curb appeal\" to a property and can make a home more energy efficient. Planted at the edges of a building, a tree's broad canopy of leaves softens the hard lines of architecture and offers shade. Trees absorb light reflected from the roof and decrease the air temperature surrounding your home through evaporation of moisture.\n\nThe positioning of trees and shrubs around your home has a significant effect on how much you'll be paying to heat and cool your house each month. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, even one strategically placed tree can reduce your heating and cooling bill up to 25 percent. In general, deciduous trees planted on the south and west sides of the house keep the home cool during the summer and allow low-angle sun into the home during the winter. If you live on a windy hill or coastal bluff, planting evergreen trees or shrubs on the north and west sides of your structure will help protect your home from winter gusts and storms"

      "text": "ochronology.\n\nRegeneration\n\nStumps (both those on the ground and stumps of removed branches) are sometimes able to regenerate into new trees. Often, a deciduous tree that has been cut will re-sprout in multiple places around the edge of the stump or from the roots. Depending on whether the tree is being removed permanently or whether the forest is expected to recover, this can be either desirable or undesirable. Stump sprouts can grow very quickly and sometimes become viable trees themselves either for aesthetics or timber, due to the existing root structure; however, the cut portion of the trunk may weaken the sprouts and introduce disease into the newly forming tree(s).\n\nThe process of deliberately cutting stumps to regenerate into smaller trees is known as coppicing.\n\nStump removal\n\nTree stumps can be very difficult to remove from the ground. They can be dug out, shredded with a stump grinder, cut away with special chemicals or burnt."

It tolerates heat well too.\n\nThe common name, Gold Calico Cloth Maple, refers to colorful patterns on the foliage as it changes through the seasons. Leaves start out brick red, almost black, in spring, and change to green burnished with red-bronze in summer. Fall changes them again into a patchwork of gold-orange-red, all of them decorated with fine, green venation. In winter, the slow-growing tree shows off its attractive branching and wide, spreading crown.\n\nLike 'Shishigashira', the female Lion's Head Japanese Maple, this cultivar, named for the mythological male lion of Japanese drama, displays short branches loaded with small, densely packed, rich green leaves. They produce a sculptural quality that seems to develop features, so when the foliage turns burnt-orange-gold in fall, a lion's head and mane are easy to imagine. Use this superb cultivar for small areas and for bonsai culture.\n\nSpectacular color, highly dissected foliage and an elegant, cascading habit distinguish 'Omure yama' as one of the best of the Japanese Maples. The leaves are nearly as divided as laceleaf cultivars, and the fall display of reds and golds is as dramatic as any. The noteworthy ornamental tree will command attention in gardens large and small. Full to filtered sun produces the best look.\n\nUnusual and infrequently found in the trade, this Japanese Maple cultivar offers both unique form and color. Its upright habit produces a large shrub or a small tree, either of which boasts bright green bark.

Limited Availability\n\nBroader growing than the standard 'Osakazuki', this selection shares the same sturdy stature and amazing fall color of the standard. Leaves are olive-orange in spring and change to green as they mature.\n\nBright, orange-red, spring foliage softens into green with bronzed reddish overtones in summer. In fall, the medium-sized leaves become brick red and then luminescent scarlet. This mid-sized, upright maple is well-branched with a spreading canopy.\n\n'Purple Ghost' is a recent introduction from Buchholz & Buchholz Nursery, Gaston, Oregon. In spring, red leaves display reticulated variegation in a multitude of colors. Prominent venation on new growth creates a ruffled look that softens as leaves mature. Brilliant purple-red or deep purple develops with more sun, and the tree shows good sun tolerance for a variegated Japanese Maple. Fall colors range from orange to red. Limited Availability\n\n'Red Pygmy' is an exceptional red Japanese Maple from Holland that has distinctive, narrow leaves. They arrive maroon in spring and hold their color through early summer, then darken as summer winds down. The slow-growing, compact tree develops a broad, spherical shape, especially when compared with other linear types.\n\nAn outstanding new dwarf selection, this upright tree boasts very dense, compact branching, which yields a round-to-ovate outline. It has mid-size, palmate leaves with a bright red, spring flush that darkens as leaves mature. Fall foliage is outstanding orange to red, and in winter, dark red stems add drama to the scene. From Rhode Island Nurseries, Middletown, Rhode Island.\n\nThe foliage of this delightful maple keeps interest high with constantly changing colors. The initial flush is bright red-pink; as leaves mature in summer, they fade to greenish purple. The successive new growth is the same intense color as that in the spring, which makes the tree appear to be in bloom. Bright red continues the spectacular show in fall. Introduced by Vern Palmateer of Ruslyn Nursery, New Paltz, New York.\n\nWidely known as the Coral Bark Maple, this cultivar is popular for its flaming, coral-red bark that stands out against drifts of snow in winter. The leaves emerge in spring with a flush of bright, yellow-orange and change to soft green for summer, which provides a sharp contrast to the glowing, coral bark. Bright golden fall color is a flashy effect too.\n\nFound as a witch's broom on 'Bloodgood,' this dense, bushy palmatum puts on a cool palette of lipstick colors from spring to fall: pink-red to sunset-red, even cool red in the heat of summer. Trees grow more vigorously in youth, then mature at a slower pace. Combine with a draping blue dwarf conifer in the courtyard bed or patio container for a dramatic, formal look.\n\nThis naturally compact seedling selection from Jimmy Sharp, Boring, Oregon, is an outstanding miniature maple. The dense, rounded shrub is covered with small, green, palmate leaves with coarse margins from spring through summer; in fall, dramatic red leaves give way to a great branch structure for winter. Site this beauty where it can be seen \"up-close and personal\"; in the container, the courtyard or patio bed, or for bonsai culture.\n\nDistinctive branching gives this small garden tree a strong, formal look, and good heat tolerance keeps its red foliage red from spring through summer. In fall, leaves go reddish green first, then brighten to cherry red as the season progresses. Trees broaden with maturity to develop a rounded silhouette, which provides good winter interest, especially combined with bark that has distinctive silver striations. A seedling selected from 'Burgundy Lace' and developed by Will Curtis, Sherwood, Oregon.\n\nThe astonishing spring color of this small, dense tree starts out intensely dark, fuchsia-pink and changes to brilliant crimson-scarlet. In mid-summer, the color calms to pleasing green with red-orange margins. Then fall extends the colorful show with a blend of orange and yellow. A classic form provides handsome winter stature.\n\nThe Japanese name means \"pearl\" and perhaps refers to the tree's fall color that possesses a quasi-iridescent quality. As if reflected light is producing glimmers of different colors, the fall foliage seems to shimmer with a display of pastels and apricot. Unusual and dramatic, the medium-sized, upright tree bears green, palmate foliage in summer and maintains an attractive silhouette in winter. Limited Availability\n\nThis distinctive Lion's Head Japanese maple, also known as 'Meijishi', the name for the mythological female lion of Japanese drama, has upright branches that are thickly covered with dense layers of foliage. The small, green, heavily textured leaves coat the tree's outward spreading branches, and in fall, brilliant oranges and yellows arrive very late, which extends the season's dramatic color display. Aristocratic stature carries the show in winter.\n\nA broad, upright habit, even when young, supports the dense, green canopy of this Japanese Maple from spring through summer. In fall, the foliage bursts into an unsurpassed show of brilliant colors that starts on the lower branches and advances up the tree. Gold appears first and changes to orange, then scarlet until all three colors are on display at once. Finally, they all go completely scarlet. This special garden tree was selected by and named for our production manager, Milt Tobie, in the fall of 1982.\n\nThe deep red-black, dark-chocolate foliage of this small tree holds its surprising color all summer, when the star-shaped leaves change to scarlet before they drop. A rare form of Japanese Maple, it produces green seed set as well as green venation, petioles, and bark, all of which contribute to a dramatic color contrast.\n\nIn spring, the soft, pendant chartreuse leaves on this small, rounded tree sport dramatic edges of persimmon red, an effect that looks like many dainty leaf-hands with brightly painted \"nails\", In summer, the foliage continues to demand attention as it develops wide, deep-red margins and light-cream centers. The late Jean Iseli had a fondness for this tree.\n\nThis vigorous, upright, red tree develops an unusually columnar habit that fits into a smaller space than forms with broad canopies. Leaves maintain their dramatic red color all season long, and after they drop, the branches continue the colorful display. They darken to a deep, warm red that stands out against the grays and whites of winter. Found by Ken Twombly, Twombly Nursery, Monroe, Connecticut.\n\nKnown as the Floating Cloud Maple, this highly variegated cultivar displays striking colors on deeply cut foliage throughout the seasons. In spring, pastel green and pink leaves are decorated with spots, splashes and highlights of bright white variegation. In fall, leaves take on shades that range from apricot to fiery red. Elegant, low branching produces roughly equal height and width, making this an excellent choice for night lighting. The soft colors benefit from partial shade.\n\nThe delicate beauty of this tree's spidery, thin foliage is enchanting. The very narrow leaves emerge reddish-green in spring, mature to green with red overtones in summer and turn golden-orange in autumn. A compact, mounding form assures that the cultivar will maintain its perfect size for courtyard, entry or large container.\n\nThis beautiful, small tree boasts leaves with a unique color and firm texture. The unusual burnt-orange/ bronzy-gold shade is strongest with lots of sun, more yellow-green where shaded. Outstanding fall color–rich orange and red–creates a spectacular show. Use the multi-branched tree with angular branching and a striking winter form as a specimen or focal point. In areas of intense sun, protect it from scorching summer exposure. Limited Availability\n\nThis large, vigorous tree has substantial, deeply cut, bright-red leaves with a slight bronze cast. They hold their color well through the summer and fall. Erect red seeds that show through the foliage and green bark on older shoots create a superb display on this chance seedling selection that was discovered at the Esveld Aceretum, Boskoop, Netherlands.\n\nThis rare species, native to Manchuria and Korea, is a small, hardy tree with subtle beauty reminiscent of Acer griseum. Its foliage changes from green to an outstanding combination of yellows and reds in fall. In winter, its beautiful, exfoliating bark shows off colors ranging from tan to cinnamon-brown.

They started falling several weeks ago, and two neighbors also have this problem. What is wrong, and what can I do about it?\n\nTwo of my three mophead hydrangeas have no flowers. I pruned all of them to the ground this spring like the nursery told me when I bought my Blushing Bride hydrangea. Now only the Blushing Bride has blooms. Are the other two getting too old to bloom?\n\nOur cherry tree was oozing sap all over and had dark dead patches on the trunk and branches. The tree service said it had a fungal root rot and we had to cut it down. Can we plant another fruit tree or a vegetable garden when that fungus is in the soil? Will it sicken us?\n\nMy grass has tiny orange raised bumps on the blades. It started about the beginning of fall. It seems worst where there is more shade and the ground stays moist longer. Will it kill the grass? Numerous blades are completely covered. I fertilize a few times a year, using the recommended amount for my bluegrass.\n\nMoths have ruined all the wool clothes in my closet. They aren't the kind that fly around lights at night. They're tiny, and sometimes I only see larvae. I used a trap, which killed some. I also tried cedar balls, blocks and hangers. I bought a bomb, too, but it's so toxic I'm afraid to use it. I saw a commercial for something that plugs into an outlet and sends out a frequency to drive them away. What should I do next?"

      "text": "Buying High Quality Trees\n\n04/27/2012\nBy Amy Dorn\n\nBUYING HIGH QUALITY TREES\n\nWhen you buy a high-quality tree, plant it correctly, and treat it properly. You and your tree will benefit greatly in many ways or many years. When you buy a low-quality tree, you and your tree will have many costly problems even if you take great care in planting and maintenance.\n\nWhat Determines Tree Quality?\n\nA High-Quality Tree Has:\n\n1. An adequate-sized root ball. If possible, check to ensure there are enough sound roots to support healthy growth.\n\n2. A trunk free of mechanical wounds and wounds from incorrect pruning.\n\n3. A strong form with well-spaced, firmly attached branches.\n\nA Low-Quality Tree Has:\n\n1. Crushed or circling roots in a small root ball or small container.\n\n2. A trunk with wounds from menchanical impacts or incorrect pruning.\n\n3. A weak form where multiple stems squeeze against each other or where branches squeeze against the trunk.\n\nAny of these problems alone or in combination with the others will greatly reduce the tree's chances for a long, attractive, healthy and productive life. When buying a tree, inspect it carefully to make certain it does not have problems with roots, injuries or form. (Remember \"R.I.F.\" - it will help you remember Roots, Injuries and Form)\n\nHere are some details on potential problems and some other consideration that you should be aware of when buying a tree.\n\nRoot Problems\n\nRoots on trees for sale are in the three categories:\n\n1. Bare roots, no soil; usually on small trees.\n\n2. Roots in soil held in place by burlap or some other fabric. The root ball may be in a wire basket.\n\n3. Roots and soil in a container.\n\nBare Root Stock\n\nBare roots should not be crushed or torn. The ends of the roots should be clean cut. If a few roots are crushed, recut them to remove the injured portions. Use sharp tools. Make straight cuts. Do not paint the ends. The cuts should be made immediately before and watering.\n\nRoot Ball Stock\n\nYou should be able to see the basal trunk flare. The flare is the spreading trunk base that connects with the roots. Root balls should be flat on top. Roots in soil in round bags often have many major woody roots cut or torn during the bagging process.\n\nThe diameter of the root ball should be at least ten to twelve times the diameter of the trunk as measured 6\" above the trunk flare.\n\nRoots should not be crushed or torn. After placing the root ball in the planting site, cut the cords and carefully pull away the burlap or other fabric. Examine any roots that protrude from the soil. If many roots are obviously crushed or torn, the tree will have severe growth problems. If only a few roots are injured, cut away only the injured portions. Use a sharp tool. Use care not to break the soil ball above the roots.\n\nCut the wire on wire baskets. Place the basket into the planting site. Cut away at least the top two wires without disturning the root ball. Inspect exposed roots for injuries. If many roots injured, the tree may have serious growth problems.\n\nContainer Stock\n\nRoots should not twist or circle in the container. Remove the root ball from the container. Inspect the exposed larger roots carefully to see if they are twisting or turning in circles. Circling roots often girdle and kill other roots. If only a few roots are circling, cut them away with a sharp tool.\n\nTrunk flare should be obvious. Be on alert for trees planted too deeply in containers or trees \"buried\" in fabric bags. As the root balled stock, you should be able to see the basal trunk flare with container grown plants.\n\nInjuries\n\nBeware of injuries beneath trunk wraps. Trunk wraps may hide wounds, incorrect pruning cuts, and insect injuries. Never buy a tree without thoroughly checking the trunk. If the tree is wrapped, remove the wrap, inspect the trunk for wounds, incorrect pruning cuts and insect injuries. Wrap can be used to protect the trunk during transit, but should be removed after planting.\n\nIncorrect pruning cuts are major problems. Incorrect pruning cuts that remove or injure the swollen collar at the base of branches can start many serious tree problems - cankers, decay and cracks. Incorrect pruning cuts that leave branch and leader stubs also start disease and defect problems. Do not leave stubs. A correct pruning cut removes the branch just outside of the collar. A ring or \"doughnut\" of sound tissues then grows around the cut. Do not make cuts flush to trunk. The closing tissues may form only to the sides of the flush cuts. Trunk tissues above the below flush cut branches often die. When the heat of the sun or the cold of frost occur, cracks or long dead streaks may develop above and below the dead spots.\n\nForm\n\nGood, strong form, or architecture, starts with branches evenly spaced along the trunk. The branches will have firm, strong attachments with the trunk.\n\nSqueezed branches signal problems. Weak branch unions where the branch and trunk squeeze together. As the squeezing increases during diameter growth, dead spots or cracks often begin to form below where the branch is attached to the trunk. Once this problem starts, the weak branch attachment could lead to branches cracking or breaking during mild to moderate storms. When several branches are in the same position on the trunk, the likelihood of weak attachments and cracks increases greatly. As the branches grow larger and tighter together, the chances of splitting increase.\n\nAvoid trees with two or more stems squeezing together. As stems squeeze together, cracks often form down the trunk. The cracks could start from squeezed multiple leader stems, or where the two trunks come together. If you desire a tree with multiple trunks, such as a birch clump, make certain that the trunks are well separated at the ground line. Remember, trunks do expand in diameter as they grow. Two trunks may be slightly separarted when small, but as they grow in girth, the trunks will squeeze together.\n\nLook for early signs of vertical trunk cracks. Examine branch union carefully for small cracks could be present for many years before a fracture of branches and trunks. The small cracks could be present for many years before a fracture happens. Always keep a close watch for vertical cracks below squeezed branches and squeezed trunks.\n\nCorrective pruning helps. If your tree has only a few minor problems, corrective pruning may help. Start corrective pruning one year after planting. Space the pruning over several years. Remove broken or torn branches at the time of planting. After a year, start corrective pruning by removing the branches that died after planting.\n\nTrees Have Dignity Too\n\nMost numerous produce high-quality trees. When you start with a high-quality tree, you are giving that tree a chance to express its dignity for many years.

      "text": "The Adirondack style celebrates the honesty of all-natural, local materials such as wood, twig, stone, and bark. Adirondack furniture typically uses every bit of the tree, from root and burl to bark and branch, with amazing and beautiful results. We can emulate the Adirondack style in our own gardens creating a bit of rustic simplicity with a log planter. Find a new use for a favorite fallen tree or branch, and with the right tools you can create a beautiful naturalistic planter.\n\nDirections:\n\n1. Select a log about 18-24\" tall for your planter, and position it so that it rests stably without rolling.\n\n2. Outline the opening for your planter by tracing the edge of your container onto the log.\n\n3. Determine the desired depth of your planter and mark the depth on your Forstener bit with a piece of tape (using the bit extension, as needed).\n\n4. Put on your safety glasses and then begin to drill a series of closely placed holes (to the tape mark), first along the perimeter and then throughout the remaining section, removing the bulk of the wood. Don't overwork your drill by using more than moderate pressure while drilling. Also, for safety, it's important to check the speed ratings of Forstener bits and don't exceed them.\n\n5. Use a chisel or gouge to remove the remaining wood, and clean out the cavity.\n\n6. Using a long drill bit, create a few drainage holes running through the entire length of the log.\n\n7. If you want a bare wood look, remove the bark carefully with a sharp chisel or utility knife. Sand the exterior lightly and then coat all the open dry wood with varnish (deck seal, polyurethane, or epoxy).\n\n8. Plant the insert-pot as you would any other planter, although you may want to choose forest plants to continue the Adirondack theme, and place in log.\n\n9. Let your planter weather naturally, or consider resealing every few seasons to extend its lifetime."

Like much of pruning,\nit goes counter to people's natural inclinations, which are, in this case,\nto cut off all the stuff that sticks up too far. The goal is to make\nthe plant more uniform in appearance by modifying the top which is all\nstraight branches, and the bottom which has all pretty curving branches.\nStep 1: Thin up a portion of the skirt that touches the ground.\nStep 2: Take out some of the nicest curving branches from the lower portion\n(I know this is hard to do since these are often the prettiest).\nStep 3: Then modify the top portion of mostly straight branches. Remove\na few of the longest, most upsetting branches, but leave the vast majority\nin place. You may head back some branches to a promising bud, cut\nsome off inside the shrub where they join a stem, and remove some stems\nat ground level. In this fashion, the shrub becomes more uniform\nin appearance (uniformly uglier), but it seems to calm the homeowner long\nenough for all the shoots or branches to age, arch out and assume\nthe characteristic pleasing habit of the plant. One cannot force\nbranches to become more arching and beautiful. Only the aging\nprocess does that."

      "text": "Browse by Service:\n\nTree FAQ\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nI have a protected tree, what should I do? You must get our written consent before you carry out any work to a tree that is covered by a Tree Preservation Order. Failure to obtain consent could result in prosecution and a fine of up to £20,000.\n\nThe exception to this is where the entire tree or part of the tree is dead, dying or dangerous. In this case, consent is not needed to remove the dead wood or to fell the tree. You will need proof to demonstrate that the tree was dead, dying or dangerous. Ideally the Council Tree officer should be consulted prior to any works occurring in order to verify if the tree or part is dead, dying or dangerous. See more info in our Tree Preservation Order section. Tree Officer : Tel 01495 355 546\n\nA Council owned tree is causing a problem, what should I do? Fill out the Tree Enquiry Form.This is automatically sent to the Councils Tree Officer who will review the problem and arrange an inspection if necessary.\n\nPlease note that work is only usually undertaken for reasons of safety and not issues such as loss of light or satellite reception. See the section entitled 'What work we will and will not do'.\n\nIf a tree is in serious danger of collapsing and causing injury or damage to property then please call the Tree Officer : Tel 01495 355 546.\nIf the tree is associated with social housing this is now the responsibility of Tai Calon and residents should call 0300 303 1717 or email info@taicalon.org.\n\nMy neighbours trees are too tall what should I do? Trees are not necessarily dangerous just because they're big or tall or because they are situated within falling distance of buildings and roads . Trees in general do not collapse because of their height alone. It is usually because the trees are dead or dying or have a root or basal issue that is liable to pre-dispose the tree to fail. In addition there is no legal requirement about cutting back the height or spread of roots and branches, except for trees growing next to the highway.\n\nThus there is little that a neighbour can do within law, to reduce the height of a tree in a garden next to their property without the tree owner's permission.\nIf safety is an issue, then this must be brought to the attention of the tree owner. The owner of a tree has by a competent person and undertaking any appropriate safety works identified.\n\nWe can supply a list of tree consultants and contractors used by the council who can undertake a health and safety inspection of the tree/s and provide a written quotation for any appropriate works. A list of Tree Contractor and Consultants local to the area is provided on these pages for your information or take a look on the Arboriculture Association website which contains details of Arboriculture Association Approved Contractors.\n\nMy neighbours trees are blocking out sunlight to our property, what should I do? There is no legal obligation to a property owner to prune or remove their trees for reasons of light loss to an adjoining / neighbouring property. A 'right to light' is difficult to prove and only refers to buildings and light, not to gardens and sunlight. This should not be confused with the High Hedges Legislation which deals with the 'nuisance' of privately-owned hedges.\n\nTree roots/overhanging branches/ nuisance from neighbours trees, what can I do? There is no legal requirement about cutting back the height or spread of roots and branches, except for trees growing next to the highway.\nThe owner of a tree, does however, have.\n\nGenerally, for a 'legal nuisance' to occur damage must be caused to a third party and he/she must be put to unreasonable inconvenience. This is sometimes known as an 'actionable nuisance' or a nuisance that gives cause for legal action. An exception to this rule is the 'common law nuisance' of tree roots and branches that cross boundaries but may not necessarily be causing any damage. In these instances, (with the exception of protected trees i.e. trees included in a Tree Preservation Order or situated within a Conservation Area), a neighbour may cut back any overhanging branches or encroaching roots without the tree owner's consent. The prunings remain the property of the tree owner and should be tactfully offered back to them. They don't have to accept the prunings from you. You may have to dispose of them yourself. While carrying out the pruning, don't cross the boundary line, either in person or with any equipment, as this could be seen as trespass.\n\nWhilst you may have the Common Law right to cut back any trespassing roots, the difficulty being is that you may render the tree unsafe by doing so as it may affect the health and stability of the tree. Whilst this does not prevent you exercising your Common Law right, it would certainly be prudent to advise the tree owner what you are doing as to avoid any possible claims, particularly from third-parties if the tree were to fall as a result of your actions. If it is proven that the roots have caused damage to your property i.e. tree-related subsidence damage, then the tree owner may be liable for the cost of putting the matter right. This type of damage is usually referred to the property owner's insurer for the matter to be taken up by the tree owner's property insurer. If the parties are unable to agree, the matter of liability for the damage will be determined by the Courts.\n\nMy neighbours trees are blocking our satellite/television reception, what can I do? There is no legal obligation for a tree owner to prune or remove their trees for reasons of loss of satellite or television reception experienced by an adjoining or neighbouring property. Whilst a television licence allows you to legally receive television signals, it does not guarantee reception or quality of the broadcast signal.\n\nIf you have experienced a sudden loss of television reception or satellite signal, it may be that either your television aerial/satellite dish or 'set top box' is faulty. In these instances please refer to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nWhere tree/s or vegetation on a neighbouring property are blocking satellite signals or television reception, the best solution would be for the property owner to re-position their television aerial or satellite dish away from the obstructing vegetation. You could also consider the use of television aerial /satellite signal reception 'boosters'. Further advice regarding potential solutions can be obtained using the services of either your equipment supplier or contacting a local independent television aerial/satellite engineer.\n\nWith reference to protected trees i.e. tree/s included in a Tree Preservation Order and council managed trees, we do not consider loss (or inability) to receive a satellite signal/television reception a valid reason to undertake work to otherwise healthy and sound trees."

      "text": "At the November 2003 meeting I was\nextolling the virtues of Japanese Maples as trees which cast a\nrelatively light shade, and are ideal as a cover for many types of\ngardens especially Rhododendron gardens. The contrasting leaf shapes\nand their colour changes over the seasons add grace to the more\nponderous foliage of the average Rhododendron.\n\nThere is a problem with maple seeds -\nthey usually donít come up. There is a real art in getting them to\ngerminate, but mostly it involves patience.\n\nSo you plant maple seeds and they\ndonít come up and you think ĎStupid seedsí. Rather than cursing the\nseeds think instead of what their problems are. Look at it from the\nseedís point of view. The seeds are normally shed in the fall when\nthere are still some nice warm and damp days ó ideal for a seed to\nsprout. Letís say they do sprout in autumn - the delicate seedlings\nthen face a winter of frost damage, crushing snow, uprooting by floods\nand frostó heaving, predation by mice, birds, insects, eelworms, fungi\nyou get the message. In other words a maple seed would have to be crazy\nto germinate as soon as it hits a warm damp seedbed. The same problems\nare faced by a wide range of temperate region wild plants.\n\nSo what do they do? For one thing the\nparent plant can provide a tough outer layer (pericarp) which holds the\nseed in a protective cocoon until the coat rots or softens. However,\nmost seeds contain a germination inhibition system, which is chemical\nand physiological in nature. These systems work through a hormone\ncascade system acting on the ribosomes which produce the enzymes to\nconvert the starch in the seed into sugars. Then the seed sprouts.\nGibberellic acid can be used to hasten this process in most seeds\nalthough I have not tried it on maples.\n\nLetís get back to the point of view\nof the maple. They have a very sensible system which keeps them dormant\nover the cool, damp winter season. Should they then all germinate at\nthe first spring zephyr? Probably a bad idea. There might be a late\nspring frost,\n\nan attack of damping off fungus, a\nnest of mice or whatever. Better save some seeds to germinate later in\nthe season or next year, or the year after that. So we have staggered\ngermination. My own experience is that I have often had no germination\nthe first spring, a good batch come up the second year and a lesser\nnumber in the third year.\n\nYet another problem - parthenocarpy.\nThis sounds like a Greek temple and the words are related in that the\nParthenon (started in 447 BC and still standing) is an abbreviation for\nAthene Parthenos (Athene the virgin), and parthenocarpy means Ďvirgin\nfruití. What happens in maples is that some of the fruits develop\nwithout any seeds in them and are called parthenocarpic. I have read\ninstructions about floating the seeds in water - the good seeds are\nsupposed to sink and the hollow ones float. My advice - donít bother.\nJust sow the lot, if they donít have an embryo they wonít sprout.\n\nSo the trick to germinating Japanese\nMaple seeds is really long stratification. Donít believe talk about\nthrowing the packet into the fridge or freezer for a couple of weeks-\nit wonít work. These seeds need sowing in the fall as soon as they are\nripe and keeping cool, say outside, in a covered pot over winter and\nthen, and this is the bad news, probably over another winter, or two.\nThe seed is not dead, it just sleeps very soundly. You can also use\nyour refr4geratorís vegetable crisper for additional cold\nstratification.\n\nThe Good News is that when I\ncollected seeds from Hatley Park, with the permission of the head\ngardener David Rutherford, I put them into Ziploc bags with a little\ndamp Perlite, and they have been in my fridge ever since. So they have\nhad their first winter of stratification already. These are on the\ncurrent seed list and with a lot of luck they may germinate this year.\nI should add that some of the other maple species other than the\nJapanese are sometimes a little less picky.\n\nSowing Instructions: Use a\nmixture of about equal parts Perlite and peat. Cover the seeds with\nabout 2cm of sand. This is no problem for the seedlings and they clean\nthemselves pushing through."

      "text": "Bonsai: The art of the cut\n\nFor bonsai artist Ernie Carlomagno, bonsai is a living art, and a piece is never finished. [More Photos]\n\nThe ancient Chinese and Japanese art of bonsai (\"bon\" means tray and \"sai\" means little tree) is designed to evoke a peaceful sense of nature. Bonsai (pronounced bon-sigh) is is the art of shaping and developing a tree or shrub into a miniature work of art while maintaining its natural form. According to bonsai artist Ernie Carlomagno of Edgartown, it is a living art as it continues growing, sometimes realigning, \"and is never considered a stagnant art.\" He adds, \"In some cases it can change in a week.\"\n\nMr. Carlomagno has been working with bonsai for more than 30 years, beginning when he was 15, and bought a bonsai Juniper tree at the local mall. He became an avid student of the art, attending classes at Brooklyn Botanical Gardens in New York and participating in classes with a well-known bonsai artist in Pennsylvania. After high school, he studied horticulture at Cook College and at Rutgers. His work was featured in the first National Bonsai Exhibit held in Rochester, New York in 2008, and included in the annual \"Book of Bonsai.\"\n\nMr. Carlomagno says the most challenging part of the art is the continuous styling that is required. \"As it is a living art, you could have a bonsai tree for 50 years and constantly be trying to get it right. In the spring you will have it just where it needs to be, every branch where it is supposed to be, every bud pinched off. If it is an azalea it will be in full bloom but then by the middle of summer you are back to where you were. It is constant pruning to keep it at the level you want.\"\n\nHis mistakes taught him that good bonsai artists learn the rules and guidelines so that they can break them. He says, \"You have to view the tree from all sides. The negative spaces are as important as where the branches are placed,\" and explains that a bonsai artist must give the illusion of maturity to a young plant, provide a fluid arrangement of branches without leaving any awkward gaps, and ensure that the entire tree is of equal proportions to how it is found in nature.\n\n\"Picture a tree 60-feet tall up against a blue sky,\" he says. \"Now picture it 12 inches tall. That's what you are trying to do.\"\n\nAccomplishing this requires both horticultural experience and an artist eye, although the balance between each is debated among the artists.\n\nHe says, \"One without the other will give you one of only two results, a beautiful tree for a very short amount of time or a very long-lived tree that is very horticulturally sound but not a very attractive tree to the eye.\"\n\nMr. Carlomagno lends his creative experience to his job as manager of the nursery at Donaroma's Nursery and Landscaping in Edgartown. Mr. Carlomagno's bonsai art is displayed Donaroma's Bonsai House.\n\n\"With the support of Michael, Janice, and Jeffrey Donaroma, we are able to have a fine gallery of finished bonsai trees for viewing and sale, along with a stock of starter trees. For those artists creating at the various levels, it is very inspiring and helpful to have finished trees in front of you for reference. Some people are very visual and we can talk about the art, but it helps if I can put a finished tree in front of them as a reference and say, 'Make your tree look similar to this one.'\"\n\nHe says, \"Every tree is different, so the pruning style changes.\" And he adds, \"There are special tools, and you can go crazy with tools, or just get a nice pair of small pruning shears.\"\n\nThose interested in the art of bonsai can sign up for Mr. Carlomagno's class at Donaroma's Nursery or join his Bonsai Club. The club, whose members have different levels of experience, meets in summer at Donaroma's, and off-season at Polly Hill Arboretum. Meetings are the second Tuesday of the month at 7 pm. For more information on classes or the club, contact Mr. Carlomagno at 508-627-3036."

      "text": "Tree Surgeon\n\nTree surgeons are arguable some of the bravest people you will ever come across. Once you fully understand the extent of the demand of their everyday lives, you will come to appreciate the sacrifices they make and the cause they serve.\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nTree surgeons, for lack of a better explanation, actually perform surgery on trees. Their whole goal is to protect and preserve trees so when there is a disease, weather damage or insect infestation, these are the people who arrive to make sure that the tree does not have to be cut down. Tree surgeons are environmentalists of the truest kind. Not only do they tend to trees that need attention, they also plant new trees, lead conservation projects, and provide information to others who are concerned about the state of their own trees.\n\nThey are also divided into different categories depending on what they do; some are planters, some are ground workers, and the actual surgeons are the climbers. The climbers are responsible for the more invasive work that has to be done on the trees.\n\nWhat are Their Work Conditions?\n\nTree surgeons must work where there are trees; this means that they are always outdoors and can be found just about anywhere from public parks to woodland areas. Their job is also incredibly dangerous since they work at major heights and are constantly using dangerous equipment. Generally, tree surgeons are strapped in a harness with their chainsaw attached to them as they climb the tree. They are required to possess an immense amount of physical strength and stamina in order to aptly climb trees and manage their task at increasing heights.\n\nOften, tree surgeons are required to work in inclement weather which means they must be prepared to climb trees in rain, snow, or excessive heat. Of course these things only increase the dangers involved in the job, which leads one to believe that these people are a rare kind of fearless.\n\nThe Big Question; How Much Do They Make?\n\nBecause of the dangers involved, the skills required, and the fact that no just anyone can perform this job, you would actually suspect that tree surgeons make more than they do. According to the most recent reports, the average annual salary of a tree surgeon ranged from £14,000 to £23,000. Of course this will vary greatly depending on where you work, what your skill level is, and the company that you work for.\n\nOne thing about tree surgeons is that their job offers great potential for extra work, overtime, and bonuses. Since emergencies do happen, they are often called in to work late at night or on weekends. If a project takes longer than planned, they are expected to stay late until it is complete. While this may be hard on their personal lives, it does have significant financial perks.\n\nHow Would I Begin?\n\nThere are several different avenues one can take to become a tree surgeon, but the first and most important thing is to consider whether this job is right for you. There is significant danger involved as well as a physical demand unheard of in almost any other line of work. It would be a shame to waste your time and money training for this job if you will end up hating it.\n\nFirst thing, you will want to decide whether to enrol in college and get your training that way, or if you are going to seek out on the job training. Either is sufficient but they are completely different. If you are not absolutely sure that this is the path for you, on the job training is probably the best choice. Tree surgeons put their lives at risk for the cause they serve and it's something that just anyone can or should do."

      "text": "Broomfield Enterprise Gardening March 17: Right tree choice makes all the difference in Colorado\n\nMike McNulty\n\nCSU Master Gardener\n\nbroomfieldenterprise.com/\n\nPosted:\n03/17/2013 12:00:00 AM MDT\n\nStress is a part of life, and people under stress tend to be more susceptible to everything from colds to heart problems. Stress also affects plants and our landscapes. While plants do not have colds or heart problems, they do become susceptible to insects, diseases and environmental problems when under stress. The best tactic for controlling stress in both humans and plants is to take a proactive approach to prevent or mitigate factors that can cause stress in the first place.\n\nIn Colorado we have a number of environmental conditions that are plant stressors — drought; wind; low humidity; tight, clay soils. Soil is vital to plant health; it is often cited as being responsible for up to 80 percent of plant problems. An example of this would be selecting the right tree for a clayey site.\n\nClay soil tends to hold onto iron, and some trees are not able to absorb the amount iron needed for their health because of this clay-iron affinity. One solution is to select a tree that requires less iron for its metabolic processes. Some trees that do well in clay soils include green ash, white ash, bur oak, English oak, tartarian maple and big tooth maple. Most of the other maples, along with flowering dogwoods, crabapples, boxelders and pin oaks tend to suffer from some level of iron chlorosis, or yellowing of leaves, caused by iron-deficiency stress.\n\nSupplementing or amending the soil with a chelated iron product is an option. This might reduce the effects, but is an ongoing and long-term process to maintain plant health. Chelated or stabilized iron products can be obtained from any number of local nurseries and greenhouses. It is applied around the tree's root zone via small holes, following package directions. Foliar applications of iron also can be used, but need to be applied multiple times during the growing season. These sprays can stain sidewalks and other surfaces and could harm some plants. It is impractical to use this method on large trees using small home sprayers.\n\nBroomfield forester Tom Wells will discuss basic tree selection and care at 9 a.m. Saturday as part of Broomfield's Gardening, Recycling, Energy, Environment, Nature Program Series. All talks in the series will be at the Broomfield Recycling Center, 225 Commerce St. The program is free. For more information on the GREEN series, contact Shirley Garcia at 303-438-6329"

      "text": "rate this answer\n\nSunday - August 03, 2008\n\nQUESTION:\n\nWe have a 4 year old Weeping Willow, 12+/- ft. tall and this week the leaves are starting to become yellow.\nThis willow is full and robust in appearance, best it's ever looked.\nWe have 2 other Weeping Willows, not as large, but attractive trees, 100ft. north and 100 ft. east.\nThey show no sign of yellow.\nCould you please advise me? Is this common and should it effect the remaining willows?\n\nANSWER:\n\nIf it's not No. 1, \"What's wrong with my weeping willow?\" is right up there close to the top of most frequently asked questions to Mr. Smarty Plants. On today's slate, alone, there are three questions. If you search on \"weeping willow\" in the Ask Mr. Smarty Plants section, you get ten possibilities. The problem is, the question is the wrong question asked at the wrong time. We wish that gardeners would ask \"Should I plant a weeping willow?\" BEFORE they purchase and plant it. Non See this University of Florida Extension website on Weeping Willows for more information. Also, in case you think we're exaggerating, see this Q&A from North Dakota State University Extension on weeping willows.\n\nThe Genus Salix is considered to have intermediate tolerance for flooding around its roots, especially in the growing season. The water on the trunk and roots over an extended period of time can lead to yellowing of the leaves (chlorosis), defoliation, and reduced leaf size. Young trees may be more intolerant of flooding than more mature trees. Chlorosis is also caused by inaccessibility of trace elements in the soil, especially iron, to the roots. This is sometimes caused by poor drainage, meaning too much water is around the roots, or impacted soil from foot traffic or construction. If the two trees that continue to do well are in a more neutral or acidic soil, they are probably able to access the trace elements in their soil. If the tree you are concerned about either has poor drainage or too much water over its roots or is in a more alkaline soil, the lack of trace elements could explain the yellowing leaves. We picked up this information from the University of Florida website referenced above: Rust causes yellow spots on the lower surfaces of leaves and, if severe, defoliation. Rake up and destroy leaves from diseased trees. The North Dakota State website had several references to poplar borers as being a possible cause of yellow leaves.\n\nMost to be hoped for would be that the problem is being caused by poor drainage, etc. preventing the access of iron in the soil. Getting some compost or other organic material into the soil, and even putting some iron tablets into the soil would be the easiest fix. The other possibilities are not something we can diagnose from a distance. If there are borers, you should be seeing some small holes, possibly with a red stain draining from them. If survival of your willows is important enough to you, even after we've given you all the downsides, we suggest you have a trained arborist look at the tree. If some pesticide is called for, the arborist should be licensed to do so in Arkansas. Since Springdale is in two counties, you could also contact the University of Arkansas Extension office at Washington County, or Benton CountyIdentification of yellow fruit with many fingers December 24, 2012 - This is a yellow lemon smelling fruit with many fingers.

      "text": "How to Grow and Care for Desert Willow\n\nBy Heidi Green\n, last updated March 22, 2011\n\nIf you live in a hot, arid climate, but still want a beautiful, flowering tree for your landscape - then you should look into how to grow and care for the Desert Willow. The Desert Willow is low maintenance and adaptable to the desert climate.\n\nGeneral Information\n\nThe Desert Willow, known for its showy, garish flowers and long, slim leaves actually isn't a Willow tree at all, but rather a deciduous tree belonging to the bignonia family. Its scientific name is Chilopsis linearis, and it is native to the southwestern United States. The Desert Willow is typically on the smaller size, and if it does not manifest as a shrub, it is a small tree that does not grow too terribly tall - never over thirty feet, at least.\n\nBesides its flowers, the Desert Willow is also known for its unique trunk, which often grows in an arch close to the ground, and has a weathered, gnarled appearance, even when relatively young. Because of this graceful appearance and attractive flowers, the Desert Willow is a common and popular choice for landscaping purposes in desert areas, and can be seen lining roads and stream beds, and is often used as a focal point in yards. The flower will often attract hummingbirds, and it is common to see other wild birds congregate in its branches. If all of these factors have convinced you to grow a Desert Willow on your property, use the following information to properly grow and care for this desert beauty.\n\nPlanting a Desert Willow\n\nIf you are extra industrious, you can collect the seeds for the Desert Willow yourself, as they are quite abundant after the seed pods start releasing individual seeds during the Fall. If you have a nursery or home and garden store nearby, however, you will have a better idea of the planting outcome, since the seeds cultivated in a controlled environment generally perform better. When you prepare the soil area for planting, look for a spot that is sandy and well drained. The Desert Willow is a \"desert\" plant, after all, and it will not do well in an environment with standing water puddles or thick, heavy soil.\n\nYou should dig the planting rows eight inches or so apart, and about a quarter of an inch deep. You will also want to ensure that the soil itself is adequately warm, about 65 degrees Fahrenheit, or the seeds run the risk of not germinating and rotting. Water the seeds regularly, but again, avoid fostering standing water to ensure optimum growth conditions. Once the seedlings have sprouted, and emerge from the surface, it is best to stop watering and let nature take over. Young Desert Willows are susceptible to rot, especially in the very first growth stages, so you may want to consider applying an anti-fungus treatment to the soil as a preventative measure.\n\nIf the conditions are right, the seedlings will grow quite quickly, but you should wait two years after the initial planting before you pot or transplant your Desert WIllow. After that point, the Desert Willow will probably be too large and have too extensive of a root system to make potting or transplanting feasible. \"Layering\" is also an option for Desert Willow propagation. If you bury a branch from a mature Desert Willow in moist soil, it will begin to form roots and grow.\n\nCaring for a Desert Willow\n\nEven though the Desert Willow is particularly easy to maintain, drought resistant and adaptable to the hostile desert climate, you will still need to ensure that it is properly cared for and maintained. One of the very first things you should do, when planting a Desert Willow, is ensure that it is located in a very open, shade free spot. The Desert Willow requires direct and full sunlight, and planting a seedling in a shaded area will deprive the young plant from a pivotal growth element. Make sure that you plant away from other trees or large buildings that will block the sapling from a full on exposure to the sun.\n\nEven though the Desert Willow is extremely drought resistant, it still needs an adequate supply of water to grow to its full, healthy potential. It is a good idea to plant or transplant a Desert Willow close to a stream, or even near the side of a road where rainfall runoff collects. Also consider planting near the bottom of hills or slopes. If you should ever desire to prune or shape a Desert Willow, it responds well to regular trimming, and you can stake and tie off its trunk to achieve a straighter trunk growth."

What is\nmy problem? Fran, Tulsa\n\nA: There are hundreds of holly\nspecies, both evergreen and deciduous,\nand they are important\nassets of our landscapes. The berry-\nproducing hollies are female,\nand most varieties require a male\npollinator in order to produce\nberries.\n\nWinterberry hollies definitely\nneed both a male pollinator and\ninsects to carry the pollen, but\nNellie Stevens are parthenocarpic,\nmeaning they can produce\nberries without pollination.\n\nHowever, most parthenocarpic\nplants, such as Nellie Stevens\nhollies, will produce more berries\nif pollen is available.\n\nIf there are no male hollies in\nthe area, Winterberry will not\nhave berries, and this may be the\nproblem in your case. It can be\nsolved by planting one of the several\nmale varieties, such as Southern\nGentleman. Your nursery staff\nmay have some recommendations\nfor other male plants.\n\nThere are other things to\nconsider when a berry-producing\nholly variety is barren. An often\noverlooked aspect of plants, especially\nthose raised from seed, is\ntheir need to mature before they\ncan reproduce. This could be a\nfactor in your case: It simply may\nstill be in plant adolescence and\nbe too young to make berries.\n\nAnother consideration is that\nof the extreme heat we had recently.\n\nWinterberries need plenty\nof water — their normal habitat\nis low-lying, moist areas — and\nwith the heat and drought this\npast summer, the plant may have\ndecided to put all its resources\ninto surviving rather than trying\nto reproduce by making berries.\n\nConsider planting a male\npollinator and bearing another\nsummer such as our last two, you\nshould have all bases covered.\n\nQ: Can azaleas be transplanted now?\nL.S., Tulsa\n\nA: Winter is not a good time\nto transplant an evergreen plant\nsuch as azaleas. These plants have very superficial, netlike\nroots, many of which\nwill be lost, which limits the\namount of water the plant\ncan absorb.\n\nWe generally have winds\nand low humidity in the\nwinter that cause a significant\nloss of water from\nevergreen plants. This, coupled\nwith a damaged root\nsystem from the transplanting\nprocedure, lessens the\nazaleas' chance of survival.\n\nWait to transplant any\nevergreen plant until the\nground warms and hopefully\nrains come in early\nspring.\nOriginal Print Headline: Some hollies need male plant to make berries\nIf you have a garden-related question\nfor the Master Gardeners to answer\nin a column, call 918-746-3701.\n\nAssociated Images:\n\nMany holly species need a male pollinator tree for the female trees to produceberries.

Maples grow in various soils and at varying altitudes but prefer deep, moist, fertile soils. They are a major constituent of eastern deciduous forests. Sugar, black, silver, red and striped maples (A. saccharum, A. nigrum, A. saccharinum, A. rubrum and A. pennsylvanicum respectively) are found in the East; mountain maple (A. spicatum) occurs eastwards from Manitoba; Manitoba maple (A. negundo) in Saskatchewan and Manitoba; bigleaf, Douglas and vine maples ( A. macrophyllum, A. glabrum and A. circinatum respectively) in BC.\n\nDescription\n\nThe tree may be large, medium-sized or small, depending on the species. The leaves are opposite, usually simple and lobed, and have 3-9 veins. The paired, winged fruits are a food source for birds and small mammals; deer and moose eat young twigs and leaves.\n\nCultural Importance\n\nThe great commercial value of the hard, durable maple wood is overshadowed by the worldwide fame of MAPLE SUGAR and syrup. The maple leaf has long been considered an appropriate emblem for Canada. Maple leaves were used in coats of arms granted in 1868 to Ontario and Québec and the Canadian coat of arms granted in 1921. The leaf was used on regimental badges in WWI and WWII and was confirmed as an official national symbol in 1965 with the proclamation of the national flag. The maple was finally recognized as Canada's arboreal emblem in 1996.\n\nMaple Tree Comfort Maple: the oldest maple tree in Canada, 400 years old, in the Niagara area (photo by Linda Bramble).\n\nLinks to Other Sites Symb"

Desert willow trees are native to the\nsouthwestern US and Mexico growing along ephemeral washes. They are not a\ntrue willow and can withstand periods of drought. Desert willow\n(Chilopsis linearis) has large showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in colors\nranging from light pink to deep rose. They are deciduous, meaning they\nlose their leaves during the winter.\n\nI'm wondering if you have Australian Willow (Acacia salicina)?? This is a\nlovely evergreen tree from Australia that has a graceful, weeping\nappearance with drooping branches. Cream puffball flowers appear in the\nspring and intermittently throughout the warm months.\n\nIf you are sure you have the Desert Willow, then your tree may be affected\nby galls. Several things can cause galls, including insects and bacteria.\nFasciation may be another possibility. This is rapid cell growth that\nforms elaborately contorted tissue whose cause is generally unknown but\nmay be bacterial, chemical or from tiny insects like mites. To be sure\nwhy not take a sample to the nearest U of A Extension office? The Master\nGardeners staff four satellite offices in the metro Phoenix. Here's a\nlink to the addresses and hours that they are open.\n\ni have two desert willows (theme trees) and four desert sages in my front\nyard. this year, the trees grew one-half fine and the other half morphed\ninto something with fuzzy balls on the ends (only one-half flowered - but\nvery late in the season); oddly, two of the desert sage in the vicinity of\nthe trees, did the same thing; wierd fuzzy tips. no pests, no issues we\ncan find. any thoughts? can plants actually turn into something else? i\nworry as this might be something that could affect the neighboring homes\n... we all have the same theme plants and everyone else's look fine!!!"

Think about the overall shape you would like the plant to have, as well as how far apart you want the branches to be—this will obviously effect how many you will remove later.\n\n2. Begin carving into the plant, using shears and secateurs to rough out the beginnings of a hidden shape. For a fully dense shape, you might not remove any branches at all, but treat the whole plant as one continuous surface. For a more open look, think out any branches that are too close together. Later that year, or after the next growing season, go back over your plant with a pair of shears or topiary clippers to consolidate the new growth.\n\n1. Choose a young shrub. As its trunk will be young and malleable, you may wish to either train the leader using a cane, or gradually introduce bends or kinks into the trunk using stakes. if desired.\n\n2. Remove any unwanted branches and train down the remaining ones with twine if necessary.\n\n3. Continue to train new branches down and begin to consolidate the lower ones through pruning. Clipping with hand-held topiary clippers will soon thicken up the foliage on the branches, and decisions about branch shape can then be made. Forming the head, the final tier of the tree, involves cutting the leader and training down its side branches the whole way around the stem, creating a parachute effect. This is then treated like any other side branch and gradually clipped into shape.\n\nA popular technique in Japan is clipped trees, or tamazukuri. Zukuri translates as style, and tama as round, so it loosely covers a wide range of trees and shapes, from the small Ilex crenata cloud trees that are exported to Europe from Japan (but are noticeably absent from many gardens in Japan) right up to the enormous clipped junipers and podocarps. These kinds of trees are quicker to produce, easier to maintain and cheaper than pines, so they tend to be used more in private gardens, often as screens in front of the house.\n\nThe terms tamazukuri does not describe in enough detail all the possible varieties of shapes and sizes one sees in Japan. Trunks can be straight or curved, branches trained or untrained, trees clipped into balls, blobs, flat tops and flat bottoms. Branches can be long or short, and tightly spaced so the tree is almost solid, or well spaced so that the outline of each branch is clear. Evergreens and conifers are both commonly used here, deciduous ones only rarely…"

In Austin soils, pecan trees should probably be sprayed with zinc sulfate every 2 to 4 weeks during the spring and early summer.\n\nPecans are pollinated by the wind and both male and female flowers are on the same tree; therefore, you need only plant one tree. They occur naturally along larger streams and rivers in Texas and are cultivated throughout much of the Southern U.S. Since you probably are not planning to grow your Austin pecan along a large river, you should know that they require 1 to 2 inches a week of rain during the growing season, so you need irrigation.\n\nThe pecan is a slow-growing tree that takes 15 to 20 years before it starts bearing and requires a frost-free period of 6 to 9 months for its fruit to mature. Best production occurs on trees 75 to 225 years old.\n\nPecan cultivars usually are grafted onto seedlings of vigorous strains grown specifically for the purpose. Most nurseries sell pecan trees that have 2-3 year old roots and one year old scions.

      "text": "Description: Amur maple is a small deciduous tree in the maple family (Aceraceae) that reaches to approximately 25 feet in height and 15 to 28 feet in width. Bark is grayish brown, smooth with darker striation furrows with age. Typically it is multi-stemmed with a spreading umbrella-shaped crown. Opposite, simple leaves with 3 lobes grow 2 to 4 inches in length and have a bright green color turning yellow to scarlet red in fall. Panicle of fragrant, long-stemmed, pale yellow or creamy, tall flower clusters appear in early spring when leaves are also present. Paired winged seeds are 3/4 to 1 inches long, hanging at very tight angles or nearly parallel and are dispersed to the wind when seeds ripen in early fall.\n\nHabitat: This is one of the hardiest of the maple species. It can grow in full sun or partial shade and prefers moist, well drained soils, but also tolerates dryness and soil pH of 6.1 to 7.5. It is salt tolerant and hardy in zones 3 to 8.\n\nDistribution: This species is reported from states shaded on Plants Database map. It is reported invasive in CT, IL, MA, MO, NY, VT, and WI.\n\nEcological Impacts: This species has been planted because for its hardiness and brilliant red, scarlet or orange fall foliage; however it has escaped cultivation. It is an invasive species in the Eastern Region. It has the potential to displace native shrubs and under story trees in open forests, and shades out native species in prairie habitats.\n\nControl and Management: • Manual- Hand pulling, cutting, prescribed burning • Chemical- It can be effectively controlled using any of several readily available general use herbicides such as Glyphosate. Follow label and state requirements.\n\nDistribution Map\n\nInvasive Species on National Forests / Invasive Plants The United States has about 2,000 non-native invasive plant species, which are concentrated in California, Florida, and Hawaii (Mitchell 2000). On non-croplands in the midwestern states, one Forest Service researcher estimates that 14 percent of the plant species are non-native invasive plants. Trend data from the 19th century to the present indicates a significant escalation in the percentages of non-native invasive plants in the last half of the 20th century (Mitchell 2000). An estimated 3.5 million acres of National Forest System lands are infested with invasive weeds, according to the 2000 RPA assessment, which summarized local estimates from individual national forests(USDA Forest Service 2001). However, local estimates vary widely, and the agency lacks a comprehensive inventory for either terrestrial (land) or aquatic areas infested with invasive species. The Framework for Invasive Species calls for expanding inventory and monitoring activities to identify more invasive insects, pathogens and plants (Forest Service 2003). Some species of particular concern to Forest Service managers are leafy spurge, knapweeds and starthistles, saltcedar, non-indigenous thistles, purple loosestrife, and cheatgrass in the West and garlic mustard, kudzu, Japanese knotweed, Tree-of-heaven, and purple loosestrife and hydrilla in the East (Mitchell 2000).\n\nInsect Damage and Disease Insect damage and plant disease are natural disturbances that are part of a healthy, functioning ecosystem, along with fire and wind damage. However, both native and non-native insects and diseases have caused above normal mortality rates on forested lands in the United States. Some 58 million acres or 8 percent of forested land are at risk for mortality rates that exceed the norm by 25 percent or more (USDA Forest Service 2001). High mortality rates can accelerate the development of high fuel-loading in fire-dependent forests, effectively remove important ecosystem elements, and reduce private property values. The highest profile exotic insects and diseases include Asian Longhorn Beetle, Emerald ash borer, Dutch elm disease, chestnut blight, white pine blister rust, Port-Orford cedar root disease, European gypsy moth, hemlock wooly adelgid, and beech bark disease. Aside from the potential economic loss from timber volume, many wildlife and fish species are dependent on the ecosystems affected by these invasive insects and diseases (USDA Forest Service, 2001).\n\nInternational context Invasive species negatively affect natural ecosystems throughout the world by out-competing native flora and fauna for resources and growing space. Because there are often no biological controls on their growth, invasive species spread quickly and negatively impact threatened and endangered species. At least 4,500 nonnative plant, animal, and microbe species were established in the United States during the 19th century, and about 15 percent of these are considered harmful (Eav 1999).\n\nMany invasive species arrive in the United States through international trade. Therefore, the Forest Service must work with international partners to (1) stem the flow of invasive species into the country, (2) discern and apply biological controls for invasives that have already established and spread, and (3) protect island ecosystems, which are especially vulnerable due to their high percentage of unique species and evolutionary isolation. -- From the USDA Forest Service, Forest Health Staff, Newtown Square, PA.

      "text": "rate this answer\n\nTuesday - August 31, 2010\n\nQUESTION:\n\nI planted three flaming sumacs last fall and all leafed out this spring. Then, early this month all the leaves turned brown on one and it appears to have died. Today I noticed that a second one is doing the same. But this time I noticed at the base of the trunk weeping brown spots, possibly caused by an insect. I'm wondering what type of natural treatment I can use on the remaining tree.\n\nANSWER:\n\nOur Native Plant Database does not have a sumac with the common name \"flaming sumac\" so we are betting that Rhus lanceolata (prairie sumac) which also has the common name \"flameleaf sumac\" was sold to you with the trade name 'Flaming Sumac.' Sumacs are difficult to transplant because they are a suckering plant and making sure you get some roots along with the sucker is sometimes a problem.\n\nIn terms of what is causing the decline of your trees, the first thing that comes to mind is transplant shock. You transplanted them at the right time, and they leafed out in the Spring, but sometimes transplant shock can show up as much as 3 years later. If you purchased the plant in a pot from a nursery, it may not have been properly placed in the pot, with damage to the roots, or even have been in the pot too long and become rootbound, which would mean as the tree developed in the Spring, it needed to put roots out into the native soil around it, but the roots were running round and round in the root ball and could not break out. In our research, we learned that too much irrigation or fertilization can lead to plant decline. As with most native plants, the members of the Rhus genus do not need fertilization. The sumac does, however, need some deep watering the first year it is in place, if there are not regular rains.\n\nOn the subject of disease, we found one reference to fusarium wilt in sumacs, but when we researched fusarium wilt, we discovered that it is mostly tomatoes that are affected by this, and that cotton root rot is also a fusarium wilt. But we also found a reference to verticillium wilt in sumacs, and then found several research articles on that. It sounds much more plausible that this is the problem, considering the description of symptoms that you cited. From the USDA Forest Service on Rhus Copallina (closely related) we extracted this rather depressing quotation:\n\n\"Verticillium wilt causes wilting of individual stems, followed by death of the foliage. Eventually the entire plant dies. Prune out infected branches. Do not replant in the same spot with sumac or other susceptible plants.\"\n\nVerticillium wilt is a soil-borne disease, and treatments for it are few and chancy. Usually the recommendation is to get those plants out and destroy them, and then be careful not to plant another woody plant which can also be susceptible in the same area, Here are two websites with lists of susceptible and not-so-susceptible woody plants when you are considering replacement:\n\nWe are sorry we couldn't give you better news. We are not plant pathologists and can only guess, based on our research, what the real problem is. For some more information, we would suggest you contact the Texas A&M AgriLIFE Extension Office for Hays County.\n\nMore Transplants Questions"

      "text": "When should we prune our spring blooming plants? Should we fertilize them?\n\nThe key to pruning is understanding how your plants grow and how pruning affects them.\n\nMost trees should be pruned in winter. But if your deciduous tree struggled in 2011's heat and drought, and you were waiting until they leafed out to see which areas were truly dead, you can go ahead and prune out any obviously dead growth now. Be sure to use pruning paint on any oaks that aresusceptible to oak wilt that you need to prune. Generally, we want to prune them between July 1 and February.\n\nShrubs, especially those that require hedging, should be pruned now, before temperatures really heat up. Be sure to use sharp shears when pruning hedges, so that you make a clean cut-you don't want the tops to have torn leaf edges that not only look unsightly, but also heal less quickly and serve as an open door for disease pathogens to move right in.\n\nNow is the time prune spring-flowering shrubs, and roses to lightly shape them. Avoid severe pruning right now. Pruning encourages new growth which the plant may not be able to handle in hot weather and low rainfall.\n\nIf your spring flowering perennials have finished flowering, go ahead and clean those up a bit to encourage them to put on a flush of new growth, and perhaps even flower again, depending on each plant. As we head into heat, avoid dramatic pruning that will stress the plants. Simply cut back a few inches to shape.\n\nAnd if you have any plants that bloom all summer but have started to slow down a bit in the heat, a little dead-heading, to remove spent blooms, will encourage new blooms to form faster.\n\nIt's also a great idea to give a light dose of fertilizer to plants that have just finished blooming. Flowering and forming seeds takes a lot of energy, and replenishing some of a plants nutrients, so that it can rebuild its own body after having given so much of its precious energy to the next generation, is a good idea.\n\nBut just a light dose. We're coming in to the heat of summer now, and you don't want to encourage your plants to grow too much at such a stressful time of year."

      "text": "Firewood piles containing elm wood, with its bark still intact, is one method of spreading the Dutch elm disease. City ordinances do not allow people to keep elm wood that still has bark. (John M. Steiner / The Sun)\n\nSeveral elm trees around Jamestown are spray-painted with orange spots. That means Dutch elm disease has taken hold in those trees.\n\nSo far this year 115 elms have been marked with the disease, which has wiped out thousands of trees here in the past three decades.\n\nThe good news is that number is down from this time last year when the number was 130. The mild winter and recent warm weather mean the effects have also been detected earlier.\n\n\"The symptoms develop quicker in hot, dry weather so we're going to see more whether it's a result of more disease or not, probably not,\" said Jim Walla, forest pathologist in the plant pathology department at North Dakota State University.\n\nA number of factors can lead to when Dutch elm shows up in trees. Some include the weather, the tree variety's natural resistance, and removal of infected trees, Walla said.\n\n\"Usually with a lower number the first thing I think about is somebody did a good job of sanitation,\" he said.\n\nThat's why certain trees are marked in orange. The mark means the property owner has 30 days to remove the tree. If not removed the city will remove the tree and assess the cost on the owner's property taxes.\n\nOnly trees that line city streets and boulevards that are a hazard because of DED are tagged.\n\nDutch elm disease is a fungus that latches onto borer beetles. When the female beetle bores into an elm it lays its eggs and they hatch outward, Jamestown City Forester Vern Quam said. This is why elms that show the disease show it on the outer parts of the trees first.\n\nAccording to Quam, a diseased tree has the potential to produce 100,000 borer beetles that could carry the disease. Of those, 25,000 have the chance to infect other elm trees in the area as the other beetles will likely die or not carry DED.\n\nQuam estimates there are 4,000 elms left in Jamestown, along streets, in yards or near water bodies.\n\n\"A lot of the spread we see in town comes from this, the delay of getting rid of some major trees,\" he said.\n\nAnother main way the disease spreads when elm firewood is not debarked as the bark beetle that carries the disease resides under the bark.\n\n\"If a homeowner finds a dead elm tree and cuts it down and brings the wood into town to burn in his fire place, and if that would was infected with DED, that can result in a big flare up of Dutch elm disease in that community where the wood was brought into,\" Walla said.\n\nCertain weaknesses can also leave elms more susceptible to DED.\n\nMost elms have some form of wet wood, which causes the tree to expand from the inside out at certain spots. Quam said most trees can live with that, but older ones with wet wood are more likely to contract DED.\n\nA few elm trees were hit by lightning last year and that weakened them, which allowed DED to move faster. Drought stress can also take a toll along with native elm wilts, which cause leaves to be flaccid and droopy.\n\nThe warm early weather also allowed Quam more time to find infected trees. He started in May and plans to continue through the summer.\n\n\"I expected it. I just didn't suspect it in the middle of May — the middle of June perhaps,\" Quam said.\n\nSimilar conditions have led to the same results in Fargo, according to Walla.\n\n\"It's my understanding that it's also slightly down, but I'm hearing that they're finding it's developing a little more severely this year and there contributing that to the drought,\" Walla said.\n\nWhile DED moves fast Walla expects area elms could get infected late in the season and the disease's effects could go unnoticed until next spring. An indicator could be an 8- to 10-foot die-off spread in the upper branches.\n\n\"Moving 8 to 10 feet is still fast moving for a tree disease, but a lot of times it's difficult to detect,\" he said.\n\nAnyone that suspects Dutch elm disease should contact a forester or a county extension agent.\n\nSun reporter Ben Rodgers can be reached at 701-952-8455 or by email at brodgers@jamestownsun.com"

      "text": "In his 1970 FAO report, Chapot mentioned that a relatively\nlarge number of trees were declining and showed dieback. In 1987,\nBové encountered the same problem in all the citrus areas\nvisited, on mandarin (Fig. 215) as well as on sweet orange trees\n(Fig. 216). Thus it appears that the decline affecting citrus is\nnot new, even though it may appear so when it affects young trees\nthat grew well at first, and that begin to show symptoms only\nafter three or four years. This is the case in the Sahiwal\nHorticultural Research Station (SHRS). Four-year-old Bloodred\n(Figs 216 and 217) and Musambi sweet orange trees, planted in the\nfield in 1982-83, began to show decline after the winter of\n1985-86.\n\nSymptoms of decline included: overall pale green-yellowish\ncolour of foliage; mature leaf drop and replacement of\nnormal-sized leaves by small ones; a high proportion of small\nleaves, at least at some periods of the year (compare left and\nright halves of the tree in Figure 217); upright position of\nsmall leaves along shoots; zinc-deficiency symptoms on the small\nleaves but without green islands on an overall yellow blade; mild\nleaf mottle on old leaves; dieback; and stunting. The above trees\nwere four years old at the time of examination. Older trees at\nSHRS showed the same decline. The disease is in no way restricted\nto local varieties such as Bloodred and Musambi sweet oranges, as\nsymptoms were observed, for instance, on Sanguinelli trees\nintroduced from California to SHRS in 1977.\n\nCases of decline with similar symptoms, i.e. greening-like\nsymptoms, were also observed in commercial orchards in the\nSahiwal-Okara district. In one orchard, Pineapple sweet orange\ntrees on rough lemon planted in 1979 presented the typical\ndecline syndrome: leaf drop resulting in many small, but few\nnormal-sized, leaves. In this orchard, Catara noticed\ngreening-like trees in January 1987 and was able to detect, by\nelectron microscopy, greening organisms in the fruit axis of a\nMaltese (Vaniglia) sweet orange (Grimaldi and Catara, personal\ncommunication).\n\nSevere decline was also noticed in the Renala Kurd district on\nten-year-old Valencia late sweet orange trees on rough lemon\nrootstock. Trees with many small leaves were again seen. The\ndeclining trees in this orchard looked, more than anywhere else,\nlike greening-affected trees, even though leaf mottle was not\nmuch more pronounced than elsewhere. However, one of the\ndeclining trees showed severe inverse stem pitting and bark\npinholing. In this orchard, there were many empty spaces\nindicating that several trees had died. From the age of the\nremaining normal or declining trees it was evident that the trees\nhad reached a fair development before they became affected.\n\nMany cases of declining sweet orange trees have been observed\nat the Tarnab Agricultural Research Institute near Peshawar,\nNWFP. It was in this experiment station that, in 1976, Cochran\nnoticed symptoms of greening in the variety collection. He also\nfound many nursery trees infected. In the meantime, in 1981, a\nnew collection of 25 sweet orange varieties on sour orange\nrootstock was planted with material from SHRS. Most of the trees\nare stunted and in a severe state of decline. As these trees are\non sour orange, CTV may be involved in the decline. Indeed, CTV\nwas detected by electron microscopy in samples of a Vaniglia\nsweet orange tree. The greening organism was not detected in this\ntree, but was positively identified by electron microscopy in two\nsour orange seedlings. These results clearly indicate that\ngreening is present in the Peshawar area, as is D. citri, the\npsyllid vector of the greening bacterium (Fig. 210). Cochran\n(1976) had also noticed that D. citri was abundant in the\nvariety orchard, in the nursery and on ornamental sour orange\nhedges.\n\nNot only sweet orange, but also mandarin trees are affected by\nthe decline problem. At the Tarnab Agricultural Research\nInstitute, both Kinnow and Feutrell's early mandarin trees were\naffected. The symptoms are similar to those on sweet orange\ntrees: leaf drop, small-sized leaves, some zinc deficiency and\nleaf mottle, and dieback. Similar declining Kinnow mandarin trees\nwere seen at the Faisalabad Agricultural Research Station. Too\nmuch irrigation by flooding and excessive ploughing for clean\ncultivation could be part of the decline problem, but greening is\nmost likely to be the principal cause. Indeed, Catara was able to\ndetect the greening organism at the Faisalabad Research Station\nin samples of rough lemon leaves with yellow midveins (Grimaldi\nand Catara, personal communication). The seriousness of the\ndecline problem on mandarin trees is best illustrated by Figure\n215, showing a commercial Kinnow mandarin orchard near Lahore\nwith many declining, dieback-affected, greening-like trees.\n\nFinally, there were declining grapefruit trees on rough lemon\nrootstock, which were planted in 1977, at SHRS. They began to\nshow symptoms of decline in 1984, two years before the sweet\norange trees. The symptoms were stubborn-, or greening-like:\nsmall, cupped leaves, with some mottle and small fruit with\naborted seeds. One tree (Marsh JBC 430, sample 19) was found to\nbe infected with CTV.\n\nCause of decline (dieback) in Pakistan\n\nArguments for greening as the cause of citrus decline in\nPakistan.\n\nArguments based on symptomatology and symptom development. Both\nthe symptoms of decline and their development in sweet orange and\nmandarin trees in Pakistan are similar to those of citrus\ngreening disease, i.e. dieback, in India. In 1976, Cochran\ndiagnosed greening on the basis of the following symptoms and\nfacts:\n\nLeaf drop of mature leaves followed by growth of upright\ntwigs with small leaves.\n\nSparse foliage, especially at the top of the tree.\n\nZinc-deficiency patterns, some leaf mottle.\n\nDieback.\n\nFruits with aborted, dark-coloured seeds.\n\nStunting and reduction of growth.\n\nYoung trees in sweet orange blocks grow well for a few\nyears and start showing symptoms only after three to five\nyears. Symptoms appear first in only a few trees and, in\nearly stages of the disease, are restricted to one part\nof the tree (Fig. 217).\n\nCitrus decline in Pakistan is not a new disease.\nSimilarly, greening has been present in India for many\nyears. Chapot (1970) reported the dieback problem as\nearly as 1970, although he attributed the disease to such\ncauses as lack of drainage, iron chlorosis or salt\ndamage. In the Peshawar district, the author was told\nthat citrus trees have suffered from stunting and dieback\nsince 1960.\n\nThe greening BLO has been detected in Pakistan in mottled\nleaves from sour orange seedlings in the Peshawar\ndistrict. It was also found by Grimaldi and Catara\n(personal communication) in the fruit axis of a Maltese\n(Vaniglia) sweet orange fruit from the Okara district, as\nwell as in the leaf midvein of a rough lemon tree from\nthe Faisalabad Research Station. The greening BLO has\ntherefore been found in NWFP and the Punjab.\n\nD. citri, the psyllid vector of the greening BLO, is\npresent in Pakistan throughout the citrus-growing areas of the\nNWFP and the Punjab. The psyllid population peaks in March and\nApril after the spring flush of growth, with a second peak in the\nautumn.\n\nThe sour orange leaves in which the greening BLO was detected\nby electron microscopy came from seedling plants. Since the\ngreening BLO is not transmitted through seeds, infection of these\nsour orange seedlings must have been by the psyllid vector.\nNumerous D. citri psyllids were seen feeding on citrus and\nsour orange leaves when the leaves were collected for electron\nmicroscopy.\n\nThe greening BLO and its vector D. citri are both\npresent in the Indian provinces bordering Pakistan, so it is not\nsurprising that they are present in the latter country. Greening\nis very widespread in India (see Table 42), and the citrus\npsyllid is very common in almost all parts of the country,\nbecoming a serious pest of citrus during spring and early summer\nin western and central India and some parts of the north.\nPopulations decline with the onset of the hot season and the\nmonsoon, but reappear during autumn flushes. Populations are low\nduring winter months in northern India (Raychaudhuri, Nariani and\nAhlawat, 1977).\n\nArguments against greening being the cause of citrus\ndecline.\n\nLeaf symptoms. The consultant did not see strong,\ntypical symptoms of leaf mottle, though this may have been on\naccount of the time of year when the survey was carried out\n(April). Leaf mottle is often seen on mature leaves and, as\nmentioned several times above, at the time of the survey affected\ntrees had few mature leaves as these had fallen off.\n\nEven though leaves of affected trees showed zinc-deficiency\nsymptoms, the type of symptom related to zinc deficiency - dark\ngreen spots on a yellow leaf - was rare.\n\nDifficulty in detecting the greening BLO. The greening\nBLO could only be detected in sour orange leaves in the Peshawar\ndistrict. Many other leaf samples from NWFP and the Punjab were\nexamined by electron microscopy, but no greening organisms could\nbe seen, in spite of the large number of sections scanned.\nSimilarly, Grimaldi and Catara (personal communication) also\nstate that \"the number of affected samples was rather low\nand only one or two adjacent phloematic sieve tubes appeared\ninfected\".\n\nThe difficulty in detecting the greening BLO could be due to\nthe lack of adequate plant material at the time of the survey. As\nstated above, leaves with typical mottle or with green spots on\nyellow leaf blades were rare and these are the leaves in which\nthe greening BLO is best detected by electron microscopy. Also,\nin April most of the fruit had already been picked. Fruit axes,\nwhich are very good samples for detection of the greening BLO,\nwere therefore unavailable.\n\nConclusion. The greening BLO is present in\nPakistan, and decline of citrus in Pakistan is probably due to\nthe greening BLO.\n\nThe results of this survey, as well as those of Grimaldi and\nCatara (personal communication), prove that citrus greening\ndisease is present in Pakistan, as is the psyllid vector, D. citri.\nDoes this mean that greening is responsible for the\ngeneral decline of citrus in Pakistan? The answer to this\nquestion would be an unambiguous \"yes\", if the greening\nBLO had been detected more frequently in samples from affected\ntrees. Since this is not the case, the answer, at this time, can\nonly be \"probably yes\". In other words, it is very\nlikely that the decline of citrus in Pakistan is essentially due\nto greening. The arguments in favour of this conclusion have more\nweight in the author's opinion than those against. However,\nadditional work must be done to show more consistently the\npresence of the greening BLO in decline-affected trees.\n\nAdditional causes of decline. Even if greening\nis probably the major cause of citrus decline in Pakistan, other\ncauses can also result in decline and dieback of citrus.\n\nCTV infection results in the decline of citrus (sweet\norange, grapefruit, mandarin, etc.) grafted on sour\norange rootstock. This seems to be the case at the Tarnab\nAgricultural Research Institute where the trees in the\nsweet orange collection are grafted on sour orange. Most\nof these trees are in a severe state of decline. Here,\nCTV is probably involved since one of the declining trees\n(Vaniglia sweet orange) was found to be infected with\nCTV.\n\nCTV infection is however not the cause of decline in the case\nof sweet orange trees grafted on rough lemon, since this\nrootstock is tolerant of CTV. In such cases, and in spite of CTV\ninfection, greening is the most probable reason for decline. This\nsituation is similar to that in India, where tristeza is\nwidespread and was once wrongly thought to cause decline.\n\nExocortis viroid infection causes severe stunting of\ntrees grafted on susceptible rootstocks such as P. trifoliata,\ncitrange or Rangpur lime. Cases of severe\nstunting due to exocortis were seen at the Tarnab\nAgricultural Research Institute on Bloodred sweet orange\ntrees on Troyer citrange rootstock (Fig. 87) and at the\nSagodha Horticultural Research Substation on Valencia\nlate sweet orange on Carrizo citrange rootstock. At the\nSHRS, Valencia late sweet orange trees on rootstock of\nvarious citranges were also affected by exocortis.\n\nPhytophthora gummosis resulting from poor horticultural\npractices can also result in decline and dieback.\n\nBud-union crease is seen quite often, but not always,\nwith sweet orange trees on rough lemon rootstock. Such\ntrees show various degrees of decline. Several cases of\nbud-union crease were encountered during the survey (Fig.\n133) with Blood-red, Musambi, Valencia late and Pineapple\nsweet orange trees. In India, a similar situation exists,\nbut it is apparently restricted to Bloodred and Musambi\nsweet orange trees (Bhutan), Bakhshi and Knorr, 1972).\n\nFungi associated with shoots dying back are well known as\ninvaders of moribund or weakened tissues. Most often\nthese fungi are not the direct cause of decline, but they\naccelerate it. In India such fungi have been isolated\nfrom dieback-affected citrus trees (Raychaudhari, Nariani\nand Ahlawat, 1977) but their role has probably been\noveremphasized, since greening in itself is enough to\ninduce decline and dieback.\n\nSahiwal Horticultural Research Station (SHRS).\nTypical symptoms of vein clearing (Fig. 128) were seen on leaves\nof a large, small-fruited acid (Kagzi) lime tree on rough lemon\nrootstock. Vein clearing of lime leaves is specific to CTV\ninfection and, indeed, the presence of the virus in this tree was\nconfirmed by ELISA and electron microscopy. The tree had been\npropagated by grafting a bud from a lime seedling on a rough\nlemon rootstock seedling. As CTV is not transmitted through\nseeds, infection must be the result of insect transmission of the\nvirus. Indeed, aphid vectors of CTV are known to be present in\nPakistan (see below). If so, other trees, including mandarin,\nsweet orange and grapefruit, at SHRS must also be infected,\nthough if they are grafted on CTV-tolerant rootstocks (rough\nlemon, citranges, etc.) their infection can only be detected by\nindexing on Kagzi lime indicator plants, by ELISA or by electron\nmicroscopy. Bundles of CTV virions were indeed seen by electron\nmicroscopy in leaves of a Marsh JBC 430 grapefruit tree. This\ntree showed no stem pitting, suggesting that the strain of CTV\ninvolved is one of those milder strains that do not induce stem\npitting symptoms on grapefruit.\n\nSimilarly, the above CTV-infected lime tree showed no stem\npitting. The lack of this symptom, as well as the large size of\nthe tree, suggests that infection with CTV is either relatively\nrecent or that the strain of CTV involved is mild.\n\nOkara district (northeast of Sahiwal - Mian\nMuhammad Shafi citrus orchards, Burj Jiwe Khan). A declining,\ngreening-like Bloodred sweet orange tree, examined by electron\nmicroscopy for the presence of the greening BLO, was found to be\ninfected with CTV.\n\nSimilarly, in the same orchard, Grimaldi and Catara (personal\ncommunication) observed CTV virions in a fruit axis from a\ndeclining Pineapple sweet orange tree on rough lemon rootstock.\nIn spite of their infection with CTV, these trees do not decline\nbecause of CTV since sweet orange trees on rough lemon rootstock\nare tolerant to CTV. Greening is probably the cause of the\ndecline. Many more trees in this orchard may be infected with\nCTV.\n\nPeshawar district (Tarnab Agricultural Research\nInstitute). Many of the trees in the sweet orange collection,\nwhich are grafted on sour orange rootstock and were planted in\n1981, are stunted. A stunted Vaniglia sweet orange tree was\nchosen as a representative tree and electron microscopy showed it\nto be infected with CTV. Since sour orange is a CTV-susceptible\nrootstock, infection by CTV of the Vaniglia sweet orange tree,\nand probably of other trees in the collection, explains the\nstunted condition of these trees. The trees in the collection\nwere propagated with plant material from SHRS. Since CTV is now\nknown to be present at SHRS, CTV-infection of the above Vaniglia\ntree (and probably of other sweet orange trees) could be due to\nthe use of CTV-infected buds from Sahiwal.\n\nHowever, there is also the possibility that the tree(s) in the\nTarnab collection became infected by insect transmission of CTV.\nIndeed, another tree was found to be infected with CTV, namely a\nsour orange tree growing along a roadside. This tree is probably\nan ungrafted seedling tree and, if so, infection of the tree with\nCTV must have been through insect transmission.\n\nAt the time of writing, tristeza is not known to be present in\nthe Peshawar district, where sour orange is the only rootstock\nused. It is urgent that the CTV-susceptible sour orange rootstock\nbe replaced by CTV-tolerant stocks, such as rough lemon.\n\nInsect vectors of CTV in Pakistan\n\nToxoptera citricida, the black tropical citrus aphid\nand the most efficient vector of CTV, is not present in the NWFP\nor the Punjab. However other aphid vectors of CTV are present. Aphis\ngossypii, the cotton aphid, is an efficient vector of several\nstrains of CTV, but is usually not abundant on citrus. Toxoptera\naurantii, also present in Pakistan and abundant on citrus, is\nable to transmit CTV under experimental conditions, but is\nprobably not a significant vector. Myzus persicae occurs\nas well, and is a vector in India.\n\nCTV and its vectors in India\n\nTable 42 shows that CTV is widespread in almost all the\ncitrus-growing areas of India. In several provinces severe\nstrains of CTV are present. These strains are defined by Ahlawat\nand Raychaudhuri (1988) as those which induce vein clearing as\nwell as stem pitting in Kagzi (Mexican) lime indicator seedlings.\nMild strains cause only vein clearing. Some strains produce\nstunting and chlorosis in seedlings of sour orange, acid lemon or\ngrapefruit.\n\nThis reaction, called seedling yellows, is used experimentally\nto detect severe isolates of the virus. As shown in Table 42,\ncertain citrus regions of India possess CTV strains that cause\nseedling yellows (Ahlawat and Ray-chaudhuri, 1988).\n\nThe presence of severe strains of CTV as well as of strains\nproducing seedling yellows is related to the presence of T. citricida\n(see Table 42).\n\nAhlawat and Raychaudhuri (1988) have shown that severe strains\nof CTV and seedling yellows strains are restricted to places\nwhere T. citricida occurs. Elsewhere, A. gossypii,\nAphis craccivora, M. persicae and Dactynotus jaceae are\nthe vectors, but they are less efficient.\n\nAs shown in Table 42, the Indian provinces that border\nPakistan are free of T. citricida, as well as of seedling\nyellows and severe strains of CTV.\n\nThe same situation seems to be true in Pakistan, where T. citricida\ndoes not occur and where no stem pitting was seen on\nCTV-infected Kagzi lime and grapefruit trees, suggesting that the\nCTV strains involved in these cases were mild. However, more work\nmust be done to identify the type of CTV strains present in\nPakistan.\n\nConclusion\n\nCTV is present in NWFP and the Punjab. From the absence of T. citricida,\nit can be deduced that probably only relatively mild strains\nof CTV occur and the absence of stem pitting on CTV-infected\nKagzi lime and grapefruit trees supports this conclusion. The\nmild strains present in Pakistan are, however, capable of\ninducing decline of citrus trees (except lemon) when grafted on\nsour orange rootstock, as shown by the stunted, CTV-infected,\nVaniglia sweet orange tree and probably many other trees in the\ncollection block of the Tarnab Agricultural Research Institute.\nTherefore, sour orange must be replaced by CTV-tolerant\nrootstocks such as rough lemon.\n\nDuring his survey, the author examined many Kagzi (Mexican)\nlime trees for symptoms of CTV infection (vein clearing and stem\npitting). Vein clearing was seen on only one occasion -at SHRS\n(see Fig. 128). This suggests that aphid vector transmission of\nCTV is still rare. The results of the survey have shown that CTV\nwas discovered in three of 20 trees that were examined, not\nbecause tristeza was suspected but because greening was thought\nto be involved. This is quite a high percentage (15 percent) of\ninfection. More randomly selected trees must be analysed to\ndetermine more precisely the percentage of CTV infection. In any\ncase, the number of CTV-infected trees appears higher than first\nthought. The origin of the infection probably derives from the\npropagation of CTV-infected buds, rather than active aphid\ntransmission (see above).\n\nThe commercial citrus species (sweet orange, mandarin,\ngrapefruit and lemon) do not show symptoms of exocortis. They are\nsymptomless carriers of the exacortis agent, a complex of various\nviroids. Hence, when grafted on exocortis-susceptible rootstocks\nsuch as P. trifoliata, citranges, Rangpur lime, sweet lime\nor citron, they infect these rootstocks which, after a period of\ntime, show symptoms of exocortis, namely, bark scaling (see Figs\n83 to 87) and/or stunting.\n\nSour orange and rough lemon are also symptomless carriers of\nthe exacortis viroids, so, contrary to the above susceptible\nrootstocks, do not show symptoms of the disease. Therefore,\nexocortis infection cannot be detected by visual examination of\nscion-rootstock combinations such as sweet orange, mandarin or\ngrapefruit on sour orange or rough lemon rootstock. Indexing is\nrequired to diagnose exocortis in these symptomless trees. The\nindicator plant for exocortis indexing is Etrog citron selection\n861-51 (see Fig. 90).\n\nIn Pakistan, sour orange in the NWFP and rough lemon in the\nPunjab are the major rootstocks - hence no symptoms of exocortis\ncould be seen in commercial orchards. It is, however, highly\nprobable that many sweet orange, mandarin, grapefruit and lemon\ncultivars carry the exocortis agent. Indeed, in citrus experiment\nstations where exocortis-susceptible rootstocks have been tried,\nexacortis disease is frequently observed in rootstock experiments\nin which scion varieties of unknown health status have been used.\n\nThis is precisely the case in three of the four research\nstations visited. At the Tarnab Agricultural Research Institute\n(Peshawar district) the seven-year-old Bloodred sweet orange\ntrees on Troyer citrange in the high density block are very small\nfor their age and show severe symptoms of exocortis (bark\nscaling) on the citrange rootstock (Fig. 87). At the Sargodha\nHorticultural Research Substation, severe symptoms of exocortis\nwere seen on the rootstock of Valencia late sweet orange trees on\nCarrizo citrange in the rootstock block. It is probably the same\nValencia late sweet orange variety that has induced exocortis\nsymptoms on Troyer, Carrizo and Yuma citranges in the block of\nValencia late sweet orange trees on various rootstocks at SHRS.\nThese results show that the Bloodred and Valencia late sweet\norange scions used in these experiments were infected with the\nexocortis viroid(s) and probably with other pathogens too.\n\nRootstock and other experiments must only be carried out with\nbudwood that has been shown by indexing to be free of\nviruses, viroids and virus-like agents. As stated above, visual\nexamination of a candidate tree selected for budwood collection\nis totally inadequate as a means of establishing health status -\ngood-looking, symptomless trees may be symptomless carriers of\nseveral infectious agents such as exocortis, cachexia, tristeza,\netc.\n\nThe importance of these considerations is related to the\nproblem of CTV. Control of tristeza implies, in particular, the\nreplacement of the sour orange rootstock by CTV-tolerant\nrootstocks such as rough lemon, P. trifoliata, citranges,\ncitrumellos, Rangpur lime and sweet orange. As indicated above,\nsome of these are susceptible to exocortis (and/or cachexia). To\nreiterate, it is therefore imperative that citrus cultivars to be\nbudded on these rootstocks be free of the agents of exocortis,\ncachexia and, preferably, all other citrus diseases. They must be\nindexed to determine their true health status.\n\nThe symptoms of gummy bark are seen on sweet orange and\nconsist of gummy deposits in the bark. When the bark is scraped,\ncircumferential reddish-brown, gum-impregnated streaks are\nvisible (see Figs 60, 61 and 63). These symptoms are similar to\nthose induced by the cachexia viroid in mandarin. In mild cases\nor early stages of gummy bark, the discoloration is near the\nbud-union. In severe cases or later stages, it can extend upwards\nfor a metre or more. In addition to gum impregnation of the bark,\nthe sweet orange wood can show some stem pitting (see Fig. 64)\nwith corresponding pegs (see Fig. 65) on the cambial face of the\nbark.\n\nGummy bark-infected sweet orange trees on rough lemon\nrootstock develop bud-union constriction or crease. There are,\nhowever, cases of bud-union crease on rough lemon which are not\ndue to the gummy bark agent.\n\nThe author has seen severe cases of gummy bark in the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran, Iraq, Oman, Saudi Arabia, the Syrian Arab\nRepublic, Turkey and southern Yemen. In Yemen, gummy\nbark-affected sweet orange trees on rough lemon rootstock showed\nnot only sweet orange bark gumming and bud-union crease, but\nalso, sometimes, severe stem pitting and bark pegging on the\nrootstock.\n\nTwo mild but clear-cut cases of gummy bark were found in\nPakistan. At the Tarnab Agricultural Research Institute, gummy\nbark was seen on two sweet orange varieties, Akay Sekeri and\nTrablus, both of Turkish origin. Similarly, at SHRS, gummy bark\naffected two sweet orange varieties of Turkish origin, Kozan and,\nagain, Trablus.\n\nThe cambial side of a piece of bark removed across the\nbud-union of a declining Kinnow mandarin tree (Sargodha district)\nshowed mild pegging on the mandarin bark, and severe pegging on\nthe rootstock bark. The tree indexed negatively for CTV. The\nrootstock is probably rough lemon (rough lemon sprouts occurred\non neighbouring trees). The pegging on the rootstock bark is\nsimilar to that observed in Yemen on rough lemon rootstocks of\ngummy bark-affected sweet orange trees. Whether or not this\npegging is due to the gummy bark agent should be further\ninvestigated by graft-transmission experiments. The mild pegging\non the mandarin bark (see Fig. 55) suggests cachexia. Similar\nsymptoms were noticed on several other Kinnow mandarin trees in\nthe same orchard (Sargodha district, village 26 Nb, Nasar Ullah\nKhan Orchard), as well as on a Feutrell's early mandarin tree at\nthe Faisalabad Research Station. In all of these cases, there\nwere no gum deposits in the mandarin bark. The absence of such\nbark gumming makes it difficult to conclude unequivocally that\nthe mild bark pegging (and the corresponding stem pitting) is due\nto cachexia. Graft-transmission experiments to Parson's Special\nmandarin, a variety highly susceptible to the cachexia viroid, or\nanalysis using sPAGE (see Table 13, p. 47) are required to\nconfirm the presence of cachexia.\n\nAt SHRS the cambial face of a piece of bark removed across the\nbud-union of a Palestine sweet lime tree on rough lemon rootstock\nshowed conoid pegs on the sweet lime bark, with corresponding\npits in the scion stem. These symptoms correspond to those first\ndescribed by Reichert and Perlberger (1934) under the name\nxyloporosis on sweet lime used as rootstock or as unbudded\nseedling. It now appears that cachexia and xyloporosis are not\nsynonymous and that the disease in sweet lime (xyloporosis) is\nprobably not caused by the cachexia viroid (Roistacher, 1988).\n\nIn conclusion, gummy bark of sweet orange is of only minor\nimportance in Pakistan. Interestingly, no typical symptoms of\ncachexia were seen on the many Kinnow and Feutrell's early\nmandarins examined. As can be seen from Table 41, cachexia does\nnot seem to have been reported from India.\n\nSweet orange, grapefruit or lemon trees on sour orange or\nrough lemon rootstock are symptomless carriers of the cachexia\npathogen. It is more than likely that old-line cultivars of these\nvarieties are infected with the cachexia viroid. Indeed, at SHRS,\nin the Musambi sweet orange block on various rootstocks, trees on\nSylhet mandarin showed cachexia-like symptoms on the rootstock.\nMandarins are susceptible to the cachexia viroid. Indexing on\nParson's Special mandarin is required to confirm the presence of\nthe cachexia agent in the Musambi sweet orange cultivar.\n\nOnly cachexia viroid-free cultivars should be propagated,\nespecially if cachexia viroid-susceptible rootstocks such as\nRangpur lime or tangelos are to be used.\n\nSeveral cases of bud-union crease were noticed on Bloodred,\nMusambi, Valencia late and Pineapple sweet orange trees on rough\nlemon rootstock. In the case of Bloodred and Musambi sweet\noranges the symptoms correspond to those described by Nour-Eldin\n(1959) for Blood orange on rough lemon in Egypt, and by Bhutani,\nBakhshi and Knorr (1972) for Bloodred and Musambi sweet oranges\nin India in old trees. The bud-union shows a pronounced bulge or\nprotrusion with a rough, uneven surface, forming a prominent\ncollar or fissure of eruptive bark encircling the trunk(Fig.\n133).\n\nWith Valencia late and Pineapple sweet oranges, an irregular\nand almost continuous ring of gum-impregnated projections is\npresent on the cambial face of the bark at the bud-union line,\nwhich fits in the crease in the wood. Bark breaks easily at the\nconstricted bud-union line, revealing gum deposits at the union\n(Fig. 133).\n\nAccording to McClean (1974), the symptoms shown by Bloodred\nand Musambi sweet oranges correspond to a severe form of the\ndisease, while those seen on the other two sweet oranges\nrepresent a milder form. This author has provided evidence that\nthe bud-union crease of sweet orange trees on rough lemon\nrootstock is caused by a graft-transmissible pathogen. The\ndisease is controlled by using new-line sweet orange on rough\nlemon where old lines are found to make abnormal unions.\n\nFigures 119 to 122 illustrate the symptoms of yellow vein\nclearing of lemon leaves in Pakistan. These are best seen with\ntransmitted light. Under such conditions, parts of the lateral\nveins let the light pass through and appear as translucent yellow\nflecks or lines of varying length, though generally not involving\nthe entire vein. The yellow flecks may extend laterally into the\ntissue adjacent to the veins. The midveins show little clearing\neven on leaves with severely affected lateral veins (Figs 120 and\n121). These symptoms are markedly different from those of citrus\nyellow vein disease as described in California (Weathers, 1960,\n1961), where the first symptom to appear is a bright yellowing of\nmain veins and yellowing is usually continuous along the petiole,\nmidrib and main lateral veins. Lemon develops much less severe\nCalifornia yellow vein symptoms than does West Indian lime\n-symptoms are generally restricted to an occasional young leaf.\nFor these reasons, yellow vein clearing in Pakistan seems to be\ndifferent from citrus yellow vein in California.\n\nSymptoms of yellow vein clearing on lemon leaves somewhat\nresemble CTV-induced vein-clearing of acid lime leaves, but the\nvein clearing symptoms on lemon are yellow and much more\npronounced than those due to CTV on lime (compare Figs 120 and\n128). However, lemon is tolerant to CTV and, inversely, yellow\nvein clearing has never been seen on acid lime. The two diseases\nthus appear to be different.\n\nCitrus ringspot, as described by Wallace and Drake (1968) and\nDesjardins, Drake and French (1969), on lemon, grapefruit, sour\norange, etc. is characterized by strong symptoms of ringspot,\nwith the ring effect sometimes extending along the veins. At\ntimes the first symptom to appear (especially on sour orange) is\na distinct tristeza-type vein clearing which, however, later\ndisappears or develops into rings or blotches. Ringspots have not\nbeen observed by the author in the case of yellow vein clearing.\n\nSometimes lemon leaves with yellow vein clearing are crinkled\n(Fig. 122). In the Peshawar district, many sour orange seedlings,\nplanted closely together in a row to form a hedge, showed yellow\nvein clearing and, in addition, many leaves were crinkled, warped\nand bumpy with wavy edges. Citrus crinkly leaf virus (Fawcett and\nKlotz, 1939; Fraser, 1961) also induces leaf warping, pocketing,\nblistering and crinkling on lemon. Irregular, small, narrow\nleaves with chlorotic, variegated areas varying in degree of\nchlorosis are additional symptoms of the more severe infectious\nvariegation strain. A virus resembling citrus crinkly leaf virus\nhas been reported in India (Ahlawat and Sardar, 1976a; see also\nTables 41 and 42). However, the infectious variegation-crinkly\nleaf virus does not seem to be involved in yellow vein clearing\nof lemon in Pakistan, as serum against the former virus did not\nreact in ELISA with yellow vein clearing-affected lemon leaves\n(Catara, personal communication).\n\nYellow vein clearing seems to be widespread in Pakistan. The\ndisorder was observed on sour orange near the Tarnab Agricultural\nResearch Institute; in Sihala on lemon of an unidentified\nvariety; in the Faisalabad Research Station and Renala Kurd on\nEureka lemon; and on the following lemon varieties or selections\nat SHRS: Allen, Cascade and Cook Eureka; Frost Eureka; Frost\nLisbon; and Foothill and Limoneira 8A Lisbon. This list is not\nexhaustive. The following additional lemon varieties have shown\nyellow vein clearing in Islamabad at the National Agricultural\nResearch Centre (NARC): Corona Eureka; Caver's old line, Caver's\nnew line, Monachello new line and Molla Mehmet (Catara, personal\ncommunication).\n\nCatara further notes that lemon seedlings grown from seeds of\na tree showing yellow vein clearing are symptomless. This\nobservation indicates that yellow vein clearing is not a genetic\ndisorder, but probably an infectious disease that is not\nseed-transmitted. In Islamabad (NARC), only one of three trees of\nthe following lemon varieties showed symptoms: Frost Eureka,\nCaver's new line, Lisbon and Monachello new line; only one of two\nMolla Mehmet lemon trees had symptoms. Since the symptomatic and\nthe symptomless trees grow side by side, yellow vein clearing\ncannot be the result of some special soil or environmental\ncondition. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that\nrecently introduced nucellar varieties of lemon growing close to\naffected trees are symptomless. More generally, it seems quite\nreasonable to assume that all the Lisbon, Eureka and other lemon\nvarieties and selections mentioned above, introduced from\nCalifornia to Pakistan, were free of yellow vein clearing when\nthey arrived in Pakistan. Indeed, yellow vein clearing has never\nbeen seen in California lemon orchards, nor probably in other\nparts of the world. It thus seems that the lemon trees of\nCalifornian origin became infected in Pakistan. How this happened\n(by mechanical or insect transmission), the source of the initial\ninoculum, etc. remain to be discovered.\n\nHost range studies have not yet been made. At present, only\nlemon and sour orange are known to be susceptible. Rough lemon is\nprobably not, as rough lemon rootstock suckers from affected\nlemon trees are symptomless.\n\nNear the Tarnab Agricultural Research Institute at Peshawar,\nalong the roadside, there is a hedge of more than 100 sour orange\nseedlings, 30 of which are affected. These seedlings are not\nuniformly distributed along the hedge. Twenty affected seedlings\nare adjacent to each other (one group of 20); in addition, there\nare three groups of two, and one group of three affected\nseedlings; only one affected seedling was single. This pattern of\ndistribution suggests plant-to-plant transmission. Mechanical\ntransmission during pruning of the hedge would account for such a\npattern. The high percentage of affected lemon trees in\ncommercial orchards could also be explained partly, at least, by\nmechanical transmission during pruning operations, usually more\nsevere with lemon than with other citrus species. However,\npropagation of the disorder by buds from infected trees is most\nprobably the major means of dissemination in the nursery.\nFinally, the absence of symptoms on sweet orange and mandarin\ntrees growing in blocks next to symptomatic blocks of lemon trees\nmight indicate that these varieties are tolerant or immune. In\nany case, the nature of the disorder, whether graft-transmissible\nor not' the susceptibility' tolerance or immunity of citrus\nspecies to the putative pathogen' the host range of the eventual\npathogen, its transmission by mechanical means or by insects,\nremain to be experimentally studied.\n\nAt SHRS there is a block of Musambi sweet orange trees on\nvarious rootstocks, planted in 1982-83. Some trees on sour orange\n(Seville Kimb.) are severely stunted in comparison with trees on\nrough lemon. This suggests involvement of CTV. However, when\none stunted tree was analysed for the presence of CTV by\nELISA, no CTV was detected. When a piece of bark from this tree\nwas removed from the trunk across the bud-union, the following\nsymptoms were found: conspicuous stem pitting on the sour orange\nrootstock with brownish, gum-like material in some pits (Fig.\n260); the scion stem was smooth and normal. The cambial face of\nthe removed piece of bark showed pegging, pinholing and staining\nwith gum-like material (Fig. 261) only on the rootstock bark. Two\nother stunted Musambi sweet orange trees on sour orange rootstock\nshowed the same symptoms. Three normal-sized trees were also\nexamined. Two had no symptoms, but one presented stem pitting and\nbark pegging on the rootstock similar to that of the stunted\ntrees.\n\nStunting of the Musambi sweet orange tree on sour orange\nrootstock is probably related to the symptoms shown by the\nrootstock, even though one tree with such symptoms is not (yet)\nstunted. However, the cause of these symptoms is unclear. It is\nnot CTV, for two reasons: ELISA for CTV was negative and the\nsymptoms shown by the rootstock are not those of CTV on sour\norange. In severe cases of CTV, the sour orange rootstock shows,\nbelow the bud-union, inverse stem pitting with corresponding bark\npinholing, but no stem pitting, bark pegging or bark gumming. In\nfact, such symptoms have never been described on sour orange. The\nonly agent known to induce stem pitting on sour orange is that of\ncristacortis. However, cristacortis stem pitting on sour orange\nis very different from the type shown in Figure 52. Therefore, if\nthe symptomatic rootstock is sour orange, the agent responsible\nfor the symptoms appears to be new. There is another possibility\nhowever, namely that mislabelling has occurred and the rootstock\nused is not sour orange. From symptoms shown, a\ncachexia-susceptible rootstock might be involved.\n\nTypical witches' brooms were seen on several calamondin trees\nin Lahore.\n\nA serious disease known as witches' broom disease of lime\ntrees has recently been described in Oman (Bové et al., 19X8;\nand above). Mycoplasma-like organisms (MLOs) are involved. The\ndisease kills the affected trees in a few years and the causal\nagent is apparently transmitted by insect vectors. It was\ntherefore important to examine leaves from the calamondin\nwitches' broom by electron microscopy for the presence of MLOs.\nFortunately, no MLOs were seen.\n\nWitches' brooms are also formed on galls owing to infection by\nthe fungus Sphaeropsis tumefaciens Pledges. However, no\nobvious galls or knots were seen on the above calamondin trees.\nWitches' brooms have also been described in the southern parts of\nAfrica in relation to multiple sprouting disease (Schwarz, 1970).\nFinally, witches' brooms may be due to genetic factors.\nExperiments are needed to determine if the calamondin disorder is\ngraft-transmissible.\n\nThe survey undertaken did not include citrus canker. However,\nas expected, the disease was found throughout the districts\nvisited: on acid lime at Sargodha, Faisalabad and Sahiwal; on\nsweet orange at Tarnab, Faisalabad and Okara; and on grapefruit\nat Faisalabad.\n\nExportation of citrus from a country where citrus canker is\npresent to citrus-growing countries free of citrus canker is\nprohibited.\n\nAs in many other countries, trees are often budded too low and\nthey are planted too deep, with the bud-union line too close to\nthe soil, if not buried. These inadequate practices favour the\ndevelopment of phytophthora gummosis or footrot.\n\nIn Pakistan, the practice of growing winter fodder such as\nEgyptian clover (Trifolium alexandrium) in citrus orchards\nand the subsequent irrigation required by such crops also favour\nphytophthora gummosis. Even in the absence of such crops, citrus\nseems to be over-irrigated.\n\nIn addition, clean cultivation is often presented as the ne\nplus ultra technique of soil management, and is often\nobtained by heavy discing. Such operations destroy the surface\nroots and result in compaction of the soil in the zone below the\ncultivated area. For these reasons, intensive cultivation is, in\ngeneral, a destructive practice. It could be a contributory\nfactor in the greening-induced decline of citrus."

In spite of the 60-degree weather, the lake was still frozen and we took advantage of the situation to finish some winter pruning.\n\nThe arborists, equipped with the proper safety equipment, are busy pruning the small willow branches.\n\nThough this willow pruning appears very intense, even harsh, it provides airflow into the tree and gives young branches more room to grow. Some of the large, more upright branches are left to provide height. From an aesthetic point of view, this pruning gives the tree significantly more texture, creating clumps that flow into thin weeping branches. As willows can become quite large, pruning also prevents the tree from becoming disproportionately so.\n\nBenjamin Carroll stands on the ice to prune and provide direction to the arborists.\n\nFor the past four years, Benjamin Carroll, the senior horticulturist who maintains the Japanese Garden, has been working with arborists from the area to shape up his trees to give them a more traditional appearance. This style first emerged in Japan.\n\nSeba on the Kisokaido by Utagawa Hiroshige shows the style we are trying to emulate.\n\nBefore this style of pruning was implemented, the willows were pruned to appear mounded. For the first three years of this pruning style, many large branches were cut to drastically change the appearance of the trees. This past year we were able to focus on smaller branches.\n\nA willow looks different before it was pruned this year.\n\nJanuary is the best time for us to do this because the trees are dormant and the sheet of ice on the lake is fairly thick. Tree dormancy is very important when pruning because nutrient flow is minimal and the wounds made by winter pruning will heal quickly in the spring.\n\nWhile the arborists cut branches with pole saws and chainsaws, I moved branches off the ice.\n\nThe thickness of the ice is also helpful to us because it simplifies cleanup.\n\nAfter the branches are moved to shore, they're loaded onto a club car and taken to the mulch pile.\n\nCleanliness is very important to us because it not only keeps the Garden looking its best but it also reduces debris that could cause disease problems in the future.\n\nThough we look fairly confident walking on the ice, it is important to remember that ice is always dangerous. We always have seasoned professionals and the proper safety equipment nearby.\n\nShare this:\n\nMike Kwiatek\n\nMike is the newest Assistant Horticulturist at the Chicago Botanic Garden, taking care of the William Pullman Plant Evaluation Garden and the Outdoor Children's Classroom.

Thoughts of pine beetle deforestation come to mind.\n\nBut the Colorado State Forest Service Cañon City District office is telling us not to worry, that most of the evergreen trees along the southern Front Range with are going through a natural shedding process, and are not infested by bark beetles or tree disease.\n\n\"It's fall now, which means we're in peak needle-drop season,\" said District Forester John Grieve. \"The yellow, dying needles people are seeing on their pine and fir trees are simply part of a natural cycle.\"\n\nAccording to Grieve, every autumn, many Colorado evergreen tree species shed some of their older, interior needles as part of an annual growth cycle. Needles on the lower portion of the crowns or closest to the trunk are most commonly shed, but trees stressed due to drought or root damage may shed more needles to keep the tree in balance with its root system. Soon-to-be shed needles typically turn yellow first, then a reddish-brown color before dropping off; very small branches with few needles on them also may die."

No matter how hard I try to avoid it, Iím always looking right at that upper branch when it falls. I get stabbed and scratched and sometimes bruised, too.\n\nWinter pruning is different in every region. Here in California, itís traditional to begin these tasks after the holidays when trees and shrubs have had time to become wholly dormant. They donít remain that way for long here, so pruning in a timely fashion is essential. Obviously the pruning season will be far different in Minnesota than it is in Florida, so adjust your time accordingly for local conditions.\n\nFor everyone starting into the fruit-growing world, winter is an active time. Pruning removes the unwanted growth that helps a young tree achieve greater strength. This is important in the early years since the structure you create is essential to the ability to hold a heavy load of fruit or a full canopy under windy conditions."

I mention pears and Asian pears, because they're similar in culture to apples and also store well for long periods.\n\nI have seven apple, two Asian pear and one pear tree in a 4-by-30-foot strip. My mini-orchard produces enough fruit to stow for eating fresh throughout the winter, some to dry and plenty to make into applesauce and pear jam.\n\nThe trick for a large bounty of luscious fruit in a small area is picking trees on the right rootstock. All fruit trees are grafted [3]on to dwarfing or nematode-resistant or extra hardy roots from another cultivar, developed for their specific qualities.\n\nThe grafting process can be complicated. The desired variety or cultivar is attached to the rootstock (cambium, xylem and phloem layers are matched) and the union is sealed with wax and tape and then planted in bed or large container to grow. I readily admit that I am all thumbs and cannot graft. Luckily, there are plenty of mail order nurseries that specialize in fruit trees on various rootstocks.\n\nLe Nain Vert is a gentically dwarf pear tree that is barely five feet tall and tidy in spread. Fruit is firm and delicious!\n\nAfter you pick your trees, they will arrive bare root, meaning the roots are not in dirt. They'll be shipped to you at the right time to plant, when the ground has thawed and warmed a bit. Soak the roots in a bucket of water overnight, at least, or up to three days, before planting. Dig a large hole so that roots can be spread. Position the tree so that the graft union (the bumpy spot on the trunk) is at least three inches above the soil line. Otherwise, the rootstock will grow and over take the grafted cultivar.\n\nThis Wealthy apple tree, grafted on to M27 rootstock, is only four feet tall. It fits easily in a flower bed.\n\nThe right dwarf rootstock\n\nHere is a rundown of the best rootstocks to seek when purchasing trees. There's one for every climate, just as there are apple cultivars for everywhere. Even in the hottest climate a tasty apple like Anna will grow on the right rootstock"

Other times include when they are growing into power lines or pose a serious threat to life or property, otherwise trees can be left alone for wildlife habitat, conservation and beautification for all to enjoy. It is best to take the tree down entirely if views, solar collection or fewer trees are wanted, because the health and life span of tree will be greatly reduced from improper pruning\n\nthe tree, such as topping. Topping creates disease, starvation, weaker limbs and economic loss to the property from eventual tree removal and lower property values. Here are a few thoughts on proper tree size reduction with tree pruning.\n\nWhen a decision is made to reduce the size of an older tree, it can a be topped, or it can be pruned properly. Although the speed and nature of re-growth will depend on species and local factors, any comparison between irresponsible topping and competent pruning will be dramatic. Qualified Arborists use 'crown reduction' to control height when necessary. Selected limbs are removed at their junction with the trunk or a limb at least 1/3 the diameter of the removed limb.\n\nYear 1: The topped tree is an ugly stub and a remnant of a once lovely tree. If pruned properly, the tree's size is reduced but form and beauty are retained.\n\nYear 3: Vigorous sprouts have sprung out of the topped tree in large numbers and are growing with abnormal rapidity. The pruned tree adds growth, but it does so more slowly and distributes it more normally.\n\nYear 6: In a relatively short time, the topped tree is as tall – and far bushier and more dangerous – than it was to begin with. The properly pruned tree is safer, more beautiful, and its size is better controlled.\n\nFor more information and materials on \"Proper Tree Size Reduction\" please contact RobertHawk at 586-4009 or 488-3848 or email him at \"robert_hawk@ncsu.edu\""

      "text": "High Hedges\n\nWhat is a High Hedge?\n\nThe High Hedges Act (Northern Ireland) 2011 provides a legal basis for taking action over a problem high hedge. Antrim Borough Council has a duty to enforce the legislation and will investigate any complaints brought under the Act. A 'high hedge' is a line of two or more evergreen or semi-evergreen shrubs or trees more than two metres above ground level, with no significant gaps and therefore forming a barrier to light.\n\nCriteria for Complaints\n\nThere are a number of criteria that a hedge needs to meet to come under the High Hedges Act. If you own a hedge, you need to consider the following questions:\n\n• Is it (or the portion that is causing problems) made up of a line of two or more trees or shrubs?\n• Is it mostly evergreen or semi-evergreen? (Semi-evergreen means that it retains some live foliage throughout the year).\n• Is it more than two metres above ground level?\n• Even if there are gaps in the foliage or between trees, is the hedge still capable of obstructing light?\n\nThe Act introduces a formal complaints system that is operated by councils, but it should be used as a last resort as neighbours are encouraged to resolve the problem themselves. The Council will not negotiate between neighbours, it will only intervene if a complaint is made and even then, each case will be determined on its own merits. You must provide evidence that you have taken reasonable steps to try and resolve the issue BEFORE a complaint is made to the council.\n\nComplainants will incur a £360 fee from the Council for administering the high hedge complaint. If your complaint is justified, this fee will be refunded and the £360 fee will be charged to the hedge owner upon service of a remedial notice. A remedial notice served on the hedge owner will specify what needs to be done to manage the hedge and the date by which this should be done.\n\nIt is an offence not to comply with the terms of a remedial notice. The penalty for not complying with a remedial notice will be a fine of up to £1,000 with the possibility of further fines for continued non-compliance."

      "text": "Getting it right\n\nIndustry horticulturists offer tips on how to achieve consistent cropping.\n\nGeraldine Warner\n\nOne of the most common mistakes in crop management of apples is underestimating the crop load, says Kevin Larson, horticulturist with Roche Fruit Company, Yakima, Washington. When the fruit is around 12 millimeters (half an inch) in diameter at thinning time, the crop load probably doesn't look as heavy as it actually is, Larson explained. \"We tend to back off on the chemical thinner a little, and then, around the time we're hand thinning, we're wondering why we're spending $800 per acre for hand thinning and fruit size is small.\"\n\nSpeaking during a panel discussion at the Washington State Horticultural Association's annual meeting, Larson said another common problem is to let trees carry too heavy a crop in the third leaf so that they never reach their full growth potential. It might be hard to forego those early crops, but it's necessary if plantings are going to yield 70 to 80 bins per acre at maturity.\n\nBrett Drescher, orchard manager at Auvil Fruit Company, Orondo, Washington, said growers have five or six tools they can use to manage crop load, but often limit themselves to one or two. \"A common mistake is to not look at the end result and the greatest possibility you can get out of the crop—the greatest dollar return to you—and not use all the tools available to you to get there,\" he said. However, he's also seen people make the mistake of putting too much money into a block of the wrong variety, and overestimating what they will get out of it. Detail pruning is an important element of Drescher's crop management program. \"You can spend very little money and accomplish a lot,\" he said.\n\nThis is followed up with very aggressive thinning practices as early as possible. With certain high-value varieties, where he wants to guarantee a full crop every year, he resorts to hand thinning of blossoms.\n\nAdvantages of blossom thinning are good return bloom, bigger fruit, and maximized packouts, resulting in better returns. And the results are 100 percent guaranteed—unlike with other thinning strategies. Sometimes, with high-value fruit, a grower might chemical thin and then wish they had better-sized fruit and didn't have to hand thin, he said. \"You're looking at $200 to $300 a bin difference between that and what was blossom thinned and reached the full potential it could get to.\" Blossom thinning also helps to assure return bloom to avoid the ­biennial bearing that many Fuji growers struggle with, he added.\n\nMike Robinson, production manager with Double Diamond Fruit in Quincy, Washington, said there are times and places where it makes sense to do blossom thinning, particularly if it's a high-value crop and you can't take the chance of not thinning adequately, but he feels that the chemical thinning tools available now are good enough that he can generally use chemical thinning and save $2,000 to $3,000 per acre on hand blossom thinning. However, he's excited about the potential for mechanical bloom thinning.\n\nLarson said there's a place for blossom thinning, as trees tend to crop better when the crop is removed early, but a grower can't just decide on the spur of the moment to do it because it will require different pruning the ­season before and different nutrient strategies.\n\n\"I think there's a place for it,\" he said. \"There's some blocks where you can get more fruit in the target range and it can pay for itself, but if the block is going to peak on 80s and 88s with chemical thinning, I don't think you can justify the extra expense.\"\n\nNutrition\n\nLarson said he pays close attention to nutrition in all of the blocks. In the past, growers tended to cut back on the nitrogen in an attempt to produce redder fruit. \"Eventually, the tree runs out of nutrition, and we get into just horrible alternate-bearing blocks that would be off for two years in a row,\" he said. \"Nutrition is something we pay strict attention to, and we have some good results coming from that.\"\n\nHarold Ostenson, organic program manager with Stemilt Growers, Inc., Wenatchee, Washington, said that over the past 15 years, a range of thinners has become available that work well, but timing the applications correctly for various weather conditions is tricky. A mistake he sees is not taking action soon enough. \"You keep waiting to evaluate, and by the time you're done evaluating, you have too many fruit. The quicker you get the excess off, the bigger and more colored the fruit that's left.\"\n\nHe hopes that a model that Virginia Tech scientist Dr. Keith Yoder is developing to help growers time their thinning applications will make results more consistent. The key is to target the narrow window between having the fruit set you want and having too much. To target that window, Ostenson monitors sample trees and uses a spreadsheet to record the number of king blooms and clusters each day. As the blossoms open up, he removes the side blooms. When the flowers reach the right number to produce the desired crop load, a thinner is applied, after allowing time for fruit set to take place. Ostenson said it doesn't take long to count the blossoms, because he only counts king blooms.\n\n\"This is the way to do it, rather than guessing how much fruit is out there,\" he said.\n\nLarson has parameters for each variety. For example, he tends to thin Gala harder because it tends to produce small fruit. He considers how much pollen is in the block and looks at the history of the block to see if it has been easy or hard to thin. That will influence the rates and ­timing somewhat.\n\nDrescher said the history of the block and variety play big roles in his choice of thinning program, as does orchard elevation, but his general philosophy is, \"be early, be aggressive, and don't look back.\"\n\nRobinson said the fertilizer ammonium thiosulfate works well for Red Delicious, but he doesn't see the same benefit with other varieties. Lime sulfur and fish oil is hard to beat for Gala, he said, but he has concerns about applying that combination on Fuji at 80 percent bloom timing because of the risk of fruit marking. On Fuji, he tends to use just lime sulfur.\n\nOstenson said fish oil and lime sulfur provides benefits in addition to fruit thinning. Research has shown that it is effective also against fireblight when applied during bloom. Moderator Tory Schmidt, horticultural associate with the Washington Tree Fruit Research Commission, said it's also effective against mildew. Larson said he uses ATS on blocks that are easy to thin, and lime sulfur on others where more thinning is needed. He doesn't use fish oil because of the fear of marking fruit"

      "text": "Just as we have families, there are also families of plants. And like us, some have a large family and others are small. Each family of plants is unique in some way—such as its shape, height, fruit, or flowers—and plants are quickly separated into groups depending on whether the foliage is evergreen or deciduous. Not all members of every plant family have the same genus or botanical name, although some do.\n\nIt is always fun to see the common human characteristics that have seeped into the plant world for centuries. The classification and naming of plants was the responsibility of early botanists, or scientists, who specialized in the structure, growth, and classification of plant species. As a horticulturist, it is my responsibility to take this science of plants and turn it into an art form, and to cultivate this art form into what is collectively called a garden.\n\nLacebark pine One plant family that is loved by many is Pinaceae, or the family of pines. Members of this family can be found growing all over the world. There are pines of all sorts of shapes and sizes, but most are tree-like. The diverse range and characteristics of the pinaceae family are what make them so identifiable. Most evergreen trees, like pine, spruce, and hemlock, are cone-bearing. We generally refer to all of these cones as \"pine cones\" even though that may not be their true origin.\n\nWhat winter garden would be complete without a few evergreen plants? One of my favorites is the lacebark pine, Pinus bungeana. Not as common as white pine, but certainly more versatile, it has beautiful bark. We don't tend to give the beauty of the bark much attention when selecting plants for our garden, but it can be a characteristic that has an incredible impact, especially as a plant matures.\n\nLacebark pine has a lot more going for it than just pretty bark. It is also an excellent choice for many gardens, large or small. The common white pine is used so heavily that it seems to be planted everywhere. It grows 50 to 80 feet tall and 25 to 40 feet wide—this is big! In comparison, lacebark pine grows much smaller, 30 to 50 feet tall and only 15 to 25 feet wide, making it more suitable for the medium to small garden, but it can also be used in any large garden space. It can be planted singly or in small groups, as well as making a great hedge or screen.\n\nThe foliage, or needles, of lacebark pine are a nice dark green and can be found in bundles of three. The 3- to 4-inch-long needles are quite stiff. It also holds three to four years of its growth of needles, making it appear more lush in the winter than some pines. White pine, as an example, has longer needles—4 to 5 inches long—but only holds two years of its needles, dropping one year of needle growth in the fall, making it more open or thin in the winter.\n\nGrowing conditions As with most pines, lacebark pines prefer to grow in full sun. The soil should be acidic, rich, and moist but well-drained. Pines perform poorly in heavy, compact soils that are low in soil oxygen and typically extremely dry or constantly soggy. As a rule, I try to avoid planting pines in newly constructed sites, in a landscape berm, in areas where all the topsoil has been removed, where there has been any major soil moving, or where large equipment has been used.\n\nDecorative bark Pines are not typically known for having beautiful bark, which makes seeing a lacebark pine even more exciting. Once the trunk or stems grow to 2 inches in diameter or so, the bark begins to exfoliate naturally, showing whitish to brownish areas. Because of the decorative bark, it is not uncommon to see the lower branches removed to expose the beauty underneath. In a smaller garden, removing the lower branches allows you to grow large plants in a smaller space, opening up the garden area below. Of course, you will have to garden in the shade that will be cast as the tree matures.\n\nBeautiful year-round, the lacebark pine is an excellent choice when you are considering a member of the pine family. Its slower growing habit also makes it an excellent choice when a faster growing selection would quickly take over the space.\n\nI am always amazed and grateful for my garden in winter. When the temperature drops and we dream of spring, it is great to look out our windows and enjoy all the plants that remain evergreen. They stand out on a backdrop of brown and gray and prove to us that our gardens are alive and beautiful even in the dead of winter."

Plus, you get 10 PG points for planting a tree!\n\nHow to do it? Call your local nursery and you will likely find a source nearby. More practical advice from Don Tapio, Master Gardener, in the Washington State Chinook Observer:\n\nAlthough digging up a tree sounds reasonable, in most cases it will prove to be unsuccessful…. A far better option for obtaining a live Christmas tree is to visit a local nursery or garden center and choose a potted tree or ornamental conifer that has a growth habit suitable for inclusion in your landscape. These plants are most often sold as 'balled and burlapped' or in containers. In both instances, the plant root systems have been sufficiently pruned during the growing process to allow for successful transplanting.\n\nAs soon as you get the tree home, water it immediately. From this time on, until the tree is transplanted, it is essential that the soil be kept moist. Do not overwater!\n\nThe sooner after Christmas you can move the tree back into a cooler location, the better off the tree will be. If the temperatures outside are freezing, delay transplanting until warmer conditions prevail.\n\nWhen you plant your tree, be sure to plant it at the same depth it was grown at the nursery and be sure to remove the tree from the container or burlap prior to planting. Loosen and re-direct outside roots, which may have wrapped around the soil mix, so they will grow out away from the tree. Adding a three-inch layer of mulch around the tree will help keep the soil and roots moist. With proper care, your live Christmas tree should become a valuable addition to your landscape.\n\nHave you ever stopped to think about the environmental impact of the estimated 32 million Christmas trees sold in America each year? Dying trees release greenhouse gasses when they decompose and overcrowd our landfills. Most of California's cut trees are trucked in from Oregon or Washington which also wastes fuel and emits CO2.\n\nWould you like for your family to share the fragrant smell and festive look of a live tree in your living room–without feeling guilty?

      "text": "About Annona Flowers\n\nMale and female flowers occur on the same tree at different stages of sexual maturity. In nature, insects handle the pollination. When hand pollination is practiced the pollen is moved from one flower to another by a person. The male flower in the photo is ready to shed pollen and is almost wide open. The flower on the left is in its female stage and just slightly open. Female flowers are generaly most receptive in the morning. The pollen is usually collected from males and stored overnight in the refrigerator. The following day a female flower is pollinated with the stored pollen. Do this by inserting a fine artist brush with pollen into the female flower. Sometimes it is done on the same afternoon. Seems to be very effective after a rainstorm. Lisa and Geffner can set fruit without hand pollination. Insects take care of the pollination for the most part. Yields will always be higher and fruit will be larger and better shaped when hand pollinated, especially with cross pollination from a different variety.\n\nAtemoya Trees\n\nThe Atemoya tree is a hybrid of Cherimoya and Sweetsop. This tree is hardier and is well suited for South Florida and mature trees can be grown in areas of Florida with temperatures as low as 26 degrees. Several varieties are available and some are still being evaluated. Improved cultivars include Geffner and Lisa. Lisa is a result of the work of Mr. Gary Zill and Har Mahdeem.\n\nAtemoya Lisa\n\nLisa aka: 48-26 produces grayish red colored fruits that are sweet and delicious! Atemoya Lisa is described as hyper- productive and will set fruit quiet heavily. Be sure to remove small mis-shaped fruits and fruit at branch tips. Leave fruit at the base of branches. Fruit growing at the base of branches will taste better and be less likely to cause limb breakage.\n\nMost nurseries that graft trees, generally graft onto Sugar Apple or Custard Apple. Grafting onto Cherimoya produces a superior tree that is more cold tolerant and will have a longer lifespan. All our Atemoya trees are on Cherimoya rootstocks. Trees can produce fruit from August to January.\n\nPruning your Atemoya Tree\n\nYoung trees should be pruned in March as buds break, just before new leaves begin to grow.\n\nAtemoya also benefits from a June pruning. Pruning in June stimulates additional flowering and fruit production. Do not prune the trees in the winter months. Atemoya trees can be kept between 8 - 10 feet high.\n\nANNONACEAE (Anon) Cherimoya(Annona Cherimola) This tree produces white fleshed custard like fruit that is sweet and delicious. This tree is not suited for Florida and grows best in California, Santa Barbara. The lower humidity and sufficient chill hours per year available in California make this tree, from the valleys of Peru and Ecuador feel right at home.\n\nSo what can we grow here in Florida? How about these relatives!\n\nCustard Apple (Annona Reticulata) This trees fruit is considered the ugly duckling of the Annonas. The fruit shape varies considerably from round to heart shaped and even oblong. This fast growing tree is well suited for South Florida. The flavor is sweet but not as delicious as its relatives. The custard apple is heavily attacked by the chalcid fly. Many if not all of the fruits on a tree may be mummified before maturity. Growing this tree can cause an increased population of chalcid flies to damage your other annona species. We don't grow this tree and recommend you don't either! Sweetsop (Annona Squamosa) or sugar apple is a relative of Cherimoya usually grown from seed and well adapted to South Florida. Most seeds are true to type. The trees average 15 ft high. Not hardy below 29 degrees f. This fruit is sweeter and knobbier than Cherimoya but not as creamy. Sugar Apple trees are very drought tolerant and should not be over watered. High humidity around the trees leaves is beneficial but heavy rains can cause fruit to split on the tree. Pick mature fruit and allow it to soften on your kitchen counter before eating. Soursopis another Cherimoya relative (Annona Muricata).This tree averages about 20 feet in height. The fruit is the largest of the annonas and can weigh more than 5 pounds. The fruit is considered to be one of the finest for making sherberts because of its delicious flavor. Some people describe the flavor as a blend of pineapple and mango. This tree is propagated by seed and occasionally grafted varieties are available. Trees propagated from seed produce fruit in about two years. One of the best varieties is called Fiberless Cuban. The tree is also called Guanabana by most Cubans, Puerto Ricans, South and Central Americans. In other parts of the Caribbean like Jamaica it is known as Graviola.Soursop can be grown in South Florida but young trees must be protected from the cold. Trees are damaged by temperatures near 42 degrees and they will not tolerate freezing! Plant near the south side of a property and provide some additional wind protection. Pepe's Factoid # 1\n\nMany studies are being conducted on using the extracts of Soursop to treat cancer and other less serious health issues. Some people swear it's a miraculous fruit!\n\nCaution: Seeds can be toxic don't eat them or blend them into shakes or smoothies!!\n\nAnnona Diversifolia\n\nIlama (e lama) is the common name of this amazing fruit. The flavor is unique. I have tasted them several times and find them sweet with a rich complex flavor. This tree is for the more experienced grower. You probably won't see many of these trees for one main reason. Even as great tasting as it is, the fruit has one major drawback. The fruit splits on the tree when ready to eat. To the average person this is an unsightly reason to stay away from the fruit. Well as far as I am concerned that just means more fruit for the more adventurous fruit lover.\n\nSoursop\n\n(Anon) Tips: These trees are deciduous, this means they loose leaves in winter. Do not water your trees when they have lost leaves! Trees in the Annona family are not tolerant of flooded soil and saline conditions.\n\nAmazing Pepe's Factoid # 2\n\nAnnona Glabra (Pond Apple) To all of you familiar with the Florida Everglades and it's habitat I offer you this.... Pond apple is an ecologically important Florida native that is also related to Cherimoyas. The tree grows in the water of the everglades and some people say the fruit is edible. Well, I (Pepe) tasted one and did not like it at all. YUCK! \"Friends don't let friends eat Pond Apples, instead, real friends will offer you sweet delicious sugar apples!\" Pepe's Factoids are brought to you by Pepe of Pepe's Plants.\n\nGeneral Fertilizer Recommendations for Anon Trees in the landscape.\n\nAnon trees in the landscape are fertilized with either an 6-6-6-3 or you could use 8-3-9-3 or similar.\n\nYoung trees: 1/4 lb every 2 months\n\nMature trees: 1-3 lbs is applied 4 times per year. Maximum of 15 lbs per year. Do not fertilize in winter!"

      "text": "The best time to prune apple and pear trees, together with some of the soft fruit canes and bushes, is after the sap has stopped rising in autumn.\n\nWith all pruning make sure you have sharp secateurs or pruning knife in order to ensure a clean cut is made. Always cut the stem at a slight angle to allow any water to drip off.\n\nSoft fruit\nIf you have not yet cut back your summer fruiting raspberries then now is the time to do so. Cut back the canes that have fruited and keep the healthiest looking of the remaining canes and tie them to their wires. They will need to be cut back again in February.\n\nFor blackberries, loganberries and tayberries, autumn is the time to cut back the old fruiting stems – again the new growth is tied onto the training wires. Pull out any new growth that is too far away from the wires and plant it along another row.\n\nBlackcurrants should be left until November to prune but plants under three years old should not be touched. Cut out any dead wood and if any branches are rubbing against each other then cut out the weaker of these branches.\n\nSome people cut out any branches that are over four years old but unless your bush is getting rather sparse then, personally, I wouldn't worry about this.\n\nGooseberry bushes are the fiddliest of the soft fruits to prune and these too should be left until November to do. Cut back any new growth by about a half. Then if there are any side shoots coming from the new growth that is left, cut these back by about half too. Finally if there is any dead wood or branches that are rubbing each other these must come out.\n\nApples and pears\nWith apple and pear trees there is an old gardeners' saying that a tree is only properly pruned when there is enough space between the branches to throw a hat.\n\nAll apple and pear trees, but not espaliers and fans, etc, should be pruned when the leaves have fallen and the sap stopped rising. Pruning of two and three year old trees is normally left until December.\n\nFor the older, established trees, cut back any dead or diseased wood and also take out any branches that have begun to rub together. Any branches that are encroaching into the centre of the tree should be removed. Take back any branches that are too high to their healthiest branch.\n\nWith the tip bearing varieties, if the new growth is over about a foot long then cut it back to the first healthy bud, otherwise leave it alone unless it is causing an overcrowding problem. With spur bearing trees, reduce these new growths by about a third, again removing any that are causing overcrowding.\n\nMulberries and quinces\nBoth of these should only be pruned if absolutely necessary in late autumn. Only dead and diseased wood should be removed along with any branches that are rubbing together."

The number to call is (904) 359-4199. Readers outside the Jacksonville area can call (800) 472-6397 and ask for extension 4199. Their articles appear in Saturday's Life section.\n\nThis is one of our most common questions this time of year. The recommended start of the fertilizing season for citrus plants in Northeast Florida is March. So, now would be the perfect time to give your citrus a nutrient boost.\n\nSpecially formulated citrus fertilizers would be a good choice, but you can also use an all-purpose fertilizer such as a 6-6-6 or 8-8-8. Young citrus trees have different fertilizing requirements than that of more mature trees. For a table of recommended fertilizing schedules go to ufl.edu and do a search for the article \"Citrus Culture in the Home Landscape.\" This article also provides general recommendations for the care of your citrus. Keep in mind that these fertilizing recommendations are suggestions.\n\nIn my personal experience, I have generally followed the recommendations for young citrus trees (under 5 years). As these trees mature, especially 10 years and beyond, they seem to thrive and produce well with minimal fertilization. Let your own experience and successes help guide you.\n\nI planted several varieties of citrus trees 5-6 years ago. The only one that hasn't produced fruit is a grapefruit. What could be wrong?\n\nFrom your description, it sounds like your trees are planted in the right place with plenty of sun, that they are properly watered and fertilized and otherwise healthy. The only other thing I might recommend is patience. It is not uncommon for grapefruit trees to take longer than orange trees and other citrus that bear smaller fruit to reach the size and maturity to carry a load of fruit. It can take as long as 7 to 12 years for grapefruit trees to reach good production mode. Once they start producing, you should find that you have more than your family can use — a good thing for your neighbors.\n\nWhere can I get my soil tested and how much does it cost?\n\nThe Duval County Agricultural Extension office, 1010 N. McDuff Ave., Jacksonville, FL 32254, provides a free soil testing analysis — for Duval County residents — to give you a reading of the pH level of the soil in your lawn and landscape areas. It even provides step-by-step instructions of how to properly take soil samples. Go to their website: duval.ifas.ufl.edu and type in the search box: how to take a soil sample. Follow the steps in the listed publication, label your samples, and bring them into the office. It usually takes 7-10 business days to receive the results.\n\nFor residents outside Duval County, please contact the extension office in your county for soil testing. For a more extensive soil analysis, the extension office offers instructional kits (they have a limited number) that you take home, gather your sample, and send to officials at the University of Florida in Gainesville. There is a nominal fee for the more extensive test. You can also download the form and mail your sample on your own. Go to ufl.edu and do a search for: Extension Soil Testing Laboratory. (If you are interested in a last-minute road trip, the University of Florida/IFAS Extension in Gainesville is hosting a Landscape and Garden Soils Open House, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday, March 16 at the IFAS Soil Testing Lab, 631 Wallace Building. For more information go to fyn.ifas.ufl.edu/pdf/garden-soil-open-house-flyer.pdf.\n\nI have some muscadine grape vines that need some care. Is it too late to prune them now? How about fertilizing them and what formulation of fertilizer?\n\nThe University of Florida publication \"The Muscadine Grape\" states that the time to prune your vines is mid-January to mid-March. I would say you are still safe to prune your vines. Fertilize them in March and again in June or July. You might look for a fertilizer that is specifically formulated for fruit trees.\n\nFor the grapes, specifically, many growers use a 12-4-8 or similar content to promote better growth and fruiting. If you already have some 8-8-8 or 10-10-10 on hand and/or don't want to buy specialized fertilizer, it would be fine to use it on your muscadines and other fruit trees. For other care tips, including planting, trellising, training and irrigation, you can find an online publication at solutionsforyourlife.com.\n\nCan you give me some tips on growing gardenias?\n\nThe highly fragranced gardenia is a favorite of Southern gardeners. It is semi-tropical, so here in North Florida, they can be damaged by a hard freeze. Soil pH is an important consideration and should be between 5.0 and 6.5.\n\nFor maximum flowering, plant in full sun or light shade. Plant gardenias away from concrete driveways, house foundations, or similar structures as these tend to lend alkaline properties to surrounding soils. They grow best when planted in well-drained soil that has been amended with compost, peat moss, or manures to help improve nutrient and moisture retaining.\n\nGardenias are well-suited to container growing as this allows you to more easily control its growing requirements. These are the basics. For more information, go to ufl.edu and do a search for the publication, Growing Gardenias in Florida.\n\nPaula Lamb is a master gardener with the Duval County Extension Service and the University of Florida/IFAS"

      "text": "Conifers provide a\nwide range of colours, shapes, sizes and textures and can make\nyour garden visually attractive all year round.\nWith such a wide selection to choose from you are sure to find\nthe perfect type for your garden.\n\nThe word 'conifer' is Latin for\n'cone bearing'. Conifers are woody plants and many are trees.\nThey can be used in flower arrangements, in borders, rock\ngardens and on slopes. Use them as ground cover or hedges, or\nsimply on their own for a wonderful display.\n\nIn our eco system conifers are of\nextreme importance as they are a good source of timber. A lot of\ntimber that we use will have come from conifers. The wood from\nconifers is also used for paper and fibres. There are ongoing\ninvasions of conifer sites and this is causing us to look at\nmore sustainable and viable options for our everyday uses of the\nwood. Our beloved Christmas tree is a conifer and there are many\nother species being used for food and medication.\n\nThe size\nof a conifer can be between 1 metre to over 100 metres. The\ntallest is a Coast Redwood, and the largest is the Giant\nSequoia. The oldest conifer recorded is a Great Basin\nBristlecone Pine at 4,7000 years old.\n\nThe leaves of conifers differs\nbetween species with some being thin and long while others are\nflat and of different shapes. The seeds of conifers develop in a\nprotective outer shell. This protective cone varies in size and\nthe time it takes to reach maturity. In some conifers the seeds\nare released when the cone opens, in other species the cone\ndisintegrates. Birds help out seeds from some conifers and\nothers need fire to be released.\n\nDwarf\nconifers\n\nDwarf conifers are widely used in small gardens grown in pots,\ncontainers and small beds and they are extremely easy to care\nfor. Dwarf conifers may be mound forming or erect, they may have\nspikes, be pyramid like or look feathery. When buying dwarf\nconifers it is absolutely paramount that you pick up the correct\nspecies. They should be clearly labelled dwarf, if you do not\nsee a label or it does not say dwarf on it it may be a slow\ngrowing variety. If you attempt to plant this in a small space\nit will one day get very big and will swamp the area it is in,\nso it is always best to ask for advice. Use dwarf conifers in\nyour garden around existing plants, or as ground cover. They can\nbe planted in groups or singly. Use in containers or in your\nrock gardens for a truly magnificent display. Plant them\nappropriately so that their colours reflect the seasons, choose\nsilvery-blues for winter and red-oranges for summer.\n\nTrees\nare planted for their great stature and longevity. When planting\na tree bear in mind it will probably be there for decades and\ntherefore deserves the very best conditions in which to grow.\nWhen planting take into account the type of soil, climate and\nhow much light and shelter is available. Select a tree suitable\nfor the rainfall level, average temperature and humidity in\nwhich it will be surrounded. Protect infant trees that are not\nhardy from frost until they are established. Ensure levels of\nboth shade and sunlight so try not to plant next to a wall or\nbuilding as this will give permanent shade on one side. Conifer\ntrees can be bought root-balled or container grown in all\ndegrees of maturity. Ensure whatever you but has strong top\ngrowth and roots and is healthy with no sign of disease and\npests. Container grown trees should have an established root\nball in order to have better chances of transplanting into your\ngarden. Do not buy if the roots are protruding from the bottom\nof the pot or if the compost does not cling to the root ball as\nthis means that the roots have not established properly.\nRoot-balled plants are taken from the ground in which they\nstarted and have their roots wrapped in netting. Buy and plant\nin autumn as they will be dormant, following the same buying\ntips as when purchasing conifers for containers.\n\nPlanting\nwith annuals\n\nPlanting\nannuals next to or in between conifers is extremely effective.\nThe annuals can be changed as the seasons pass and colours can\nbe chosen to complement the existing conifers. Match up the\nheights you would like a try to create a sweeping effect with\nthe plants. Any gaps that appear because of plant failure can be\neasily filled. Use climbing annuals as a backdrop to show off\nyour conifers, ensure to use colours that will not draw\nattention away from them but rather accentuate them. Plant\nconifers in containers to create centrepieces that can be\nsurrounded by annuals for added splashes of colour. Use tall\nconifers in pots as replacements for statues in gardens. Choose\nattractive varieties that still have an effect when their\nflowers have gone. Many varieties have lovely foliage with\ndegrees of colourings and shapes. Planting certain conifers in\npots may be beneficial to those that may not thrive in the soil\nin your garden.\n\nPlanting\nwith alpines\n\nConifers\ncan be effective when planted with alpines in rock gardens,\ntroughs and containers. Use small conifers and dwarf trees to\nframe existing plants. Add miniature shrubs to display altering\nheights and colours that last all year. Plant striking conifers\nin the centre of pots and containers and surround with alpines\nto brighten up any patio or paved area.\n\nHedges\n\nHedges\nare generally used to set boundaries whether its between two\ngardens or simply to section of areas in your own garden. Using\nplants instead of wooden fencing is ideal for framing planting\nthat you wish to have sectioned off. There are all manner of\nstyles of hedging from formal to informal, from solid to clipped\nand to provide shade but there is no reason why these practical\nuses can not be done with style and elegance. Maintained\ncorrectly, once established, these hedges will give long lasting\ncolour and texture. Choose which sort of hedge you are\nhoping to achieve and choose plants accordingly. Pay attention\nto the height they will reach, the spread if any and how quickly\nthey will grow. Hedges may take a couple of years to grow to the\nsize that you would like. If you are aiming for a uniformed\nheight you must choose plants that have dense growth and you\nmust prune regularly to promote even growth. For informal hedges\nchoose plants that only need pruning annually. Plant accordingly\ntoo, for informal hedges plant in single rows with spaces of\n1-2ft apart. For formal hedges plant 3ft apart in double\nstaggered rows.\n\nConifer\ncare\n\nDuring\nwinter infant conifers need protection from the elements.\nEvergreen plants, trees and shrubs lose their water continuously\nwhich they replenish through their roots. Water throughout any\ndry spells and protect them from the wind using a windbreak.\nConifers are prone to wind scorch which is damaging to\nthem. An open sunny position is usually suitable for most\nconifers, however do check when you buy in case they require\ncertain positioning. Fungal diseases should be kept at bay by\nhaving good ventilation. When growing in pots ensure good\ndrainage and frequent watering to avoid them from dying back.\nSoil depends on the species but generally they prefer slightly\nacid soils. Fertiliser is usually not needed, simply use a\ncontrolled release one. Pruning relies entirely on the species\nand the purpose you are growing them for."

      "text": "The pounding of rain or hail, the fury of wind and the weight of snow and ice test the strength of a tree's limbs, trunk and root system. The care you give your trees before and after a storm can be the key to their survival and keeping them from falling on your home, car or other valuable property.\n\nPlanting and Pruning\n\nCarefully choose your trees and consider their location when you landscape. Know how large a young tree can be expected to grow to at maturity, and avoid planting it near wires, too close to a building, or in spots where it will be in danger of blowing over. Planting trees in groups, or planting species with naturally deep root systems can also help prevent trees from being blown down.\n\nChoose species that are not prone to breakage and ones that are appropriate for local conditions. For example, in an area that frequently experiences early winter ice storms, a tree that holds its leaves until late in the season probably would not be a good choice.\n\nTo prevent weakness, trees should be pruned when they are young. As they grow, pruning dead or weakened limbs annually and thinning excess branches from the crown will help keep them strong. The goal is to produce a well-shaped tree with the center of gravity squarely over its trunk.\n\nA professional arborist can strengthen tree crowns by installing flexible cabling, rigid bracing and/or lip-bolt through a weak or split crotch. This will allow the tree to function more as a single unit, with major limbs supporting each other. Water, fertilize and protect the soil from compaction to keep trees and roots healthy and vigorous.\n\nAfter a Storm\n\nThe confusion following a major storm can result in removal of trees that could be saved or the improper weakening of a tree that can reduce its healthy life. Home owners can lose money as well as the beauty and practical benefits of their shade trees with poor advice and the services of fly-by-night tree \"experts.\"\n\nTree work can be extremely dangerous. A professional tree care company should be used when:\n\na tree is large and requires high climbing or the use of a chain saw;\n\na tree is leaning on a structure or entangled with another tree;\n\nwires are involved or structures are endangered;\n\nmajor repair of the tree is necessary;\n\na large limb is split or broken but still attached to the tree;\n\nwhen you do not have the proper tools, knowledge or health to do tree work.\n\nIt is wise to get more than one estimate. When removals are necessary, have a clear understanding about who removes the limbs and debris from the property, and whether or not the price includes stump removal and clean-up. Your tree will have value as firewood or chips that should be considered in the estimate.\n\nHiring contractors to work on your home, your largest investment, is a big decision and should not be taken lightly. The Home Buildes Association of Greenville exists to promote sound business practices in the home building, remodeling, and home improvement industry. Consider hiring a member of the Home Builders Association of Greenville to build your next home or for the next home-improvement project. Visit  for more information."

      "text": "Sunday - February 20, 2011\n\nQUESTION:\n\nWe need to plant a FAST-growing, non-deciduous TREE with a non-invasive root system. Where can we buy one?\n\nANSWER:\n\nIt's not so much a question of where you can buy one, as whether such a tree even exists. A fast-growing tree is often short-lived and susceptible to breakage and disease. There are not nearly as many evergreen trees as there are deciduous, and every tree is going to have a root system at least as far-reaching as its crown and usually much more. Since we don't know what kind of soil you have, whether you are planning on providing shade or privacy or what with your tree, that makes our recommendations even more difficult. You would have more luck controlling the invasiveness of the roots if you chose a shrub instead of a tree. There are shrubs that will grow fairly quickly but not get as big as a standard tree. You wouldn't get much shade from that, but you would get some amount of privacy. And there is no such thing as a truly evergreen shrub or tree-all plants will shed some leaves, twigs, seeds and so forth throughout the year.\n\nNext we need to determine what plant native to North America and California will come closest to satisfying your requirements. El Dorado County appears to be in USDA Hardiness Zone 6b, with narrow bands of warmer climate to the west of your area. We are going to go to our Recommended Species section and click on Northern California on the map. On the sidebar on the right side of the Recommended Species for Northern California page we will select \"Tree\" under General Appearance, and click on Narrow Your Search. You can repeat this search indicating your soil moisture and the amount of sun available in the area where you wish to plant, as well as to try \"Shrub\" in the General Appearance selection. From the resulting lists, follow each plant link to our page on that plant to determine its expected size, speed of growth and whether it is deciduous or evergreen. We will look at a few samples of each, check to see if our selections are native in your area, and you can take it from there.\n\nWhen you have located some trees and/or shrubs that most closely fit what you are looking for, go to our National Suppliers Directory, type your town and state in the \"Enter Search Location\" box and you will get a list of native plant nurseries, seed suppliers and landscape consultants in your general area. All have contact information so you can check on availability and growing requirements"

Growing in a pyramidal to narrowly conical form, it is very\npopular in formal plantings and often seen lining roads or walkways.\n\nWidely used in parks and landscaping, the\nIncense Cedar is probably the most well-known of the Pacific northwest\nnative false cedars.\n\nGrowing in\na pyramidal to narrowly conical form, it is very popular in formal plantings and\noften seen lining roads or walkways. Unlike the other native false cedars, the\nIncense Cedar prefers drier, even drought prone areas. In drier areas, the thick\ngreen foliage creates a lush backdrop that may be harder to achieve with other\ntrees.\n\nSimilar in stature to the Western Red Cedar, the\nIncense Cedar grows to 100'-150', and 500 years\nold. The trunk creates the\nfamiliar wide base of weathered gray bark, tapering up to a narrowly\nconical crown. The reddish\nbark (that weathers gray) grows thick and fibrous, and may be irregularly\nfurrowed up to four inches deep. The lower limbs drape gracefully towards the ground, clothed\nin thick green foliage.\n\nThe\nscale-like leaves are a dark blue-green with no white markings underneath,\nand are easy to differentiate from other false cedars by the longer scales\nthat resemble the shape of a long-stemmed wine glass. The lush foliage has a pungent, spicy odor when\ncrushed. Male flowers are small and golden-yellow in color, while the\ncones resemble one-inch long green urns that open into a brown \"open\nduck's bill.\"\n\nHabitat and Range:One of the principal trees of the California forest, the natural\nhabitat of Calocedrus decurrens begins in the north on the dry southeast\nslope of Mt. Hood, south through the Cascades of Oregon into California,\nwhere it stretches west to the ocean, east to Nevada and south to Baja.\nAlthough Incense Cedar prefers drier areas for its native habitat, this\nextremely adaptable tree also grows well in damper places.\n\nOrnamental Values:The lush foliage of this drought resistant and adaptable tree speaks\nfor its ornamental value.\n\nTrees\ngrown in open areas will form perfect narrow pyramids and are widely seen\nin domestic landscaping. Grown\nin a group, the dense foliage makes an excellent windbreak.\n\nIncense Cedar is well adapted to extreme temperatures, grows well\nin shade or sun, tolerates poor soil, prefers slightly acidic soil, and\nwhile it will grow well in clay, this tree prefers sandy loam.\n\nHardy in Sunset zones 1-12 and 14-24, there are not many places\nwhere this tree cannot be grown. One\nthing to keep in mind: although drought tolerant, young Incense Cedars\nshould be watered throughout the first four to five dry seasons.\n\nNative Plant Gardening/Wildlife Habitat\n\n:\nLike most conifers, the primary wildlife value of the Incense Cedar is as winter\nshelter, cover from predators, and as a nesting site in the spring.\n\nYoung stands of Incense Cedar that make a thick grove\nare sometimes used as cover by deer and other larger mammals. In older trees,\nthe deeply furrowed bark makes good habitat for crevice dwellers like bats and\nbrown creepers.\n\nRestoration and Mitigation Values:With adaptability to extreme conditions and temperatures, incense\ncedar is a natural for restoration in more difficult, dry areas, as well as\ndamper more hospitable locations.\n\nCalocedrus decurrens has been planted with success to control erosion in\nmountainous areas, and in Los Angeles County it has been successfully used on\nroad fills, and along streams from 2,000'-6,000.'\n\nHistorical and Cultural Uses:As with the other native false-cedars of the west coast, all parts\nof Calocedrus decurrens were used for some purpose by indigenous peoples.\n\nThe Cahuilla of southern California used the bark to make temporary shelters,\nand the wood to construct permanent dwellings. Boughs were often used as\nbrooms, lending an aromatic bonus when sweeping. Many tribes used various parts of the tree, roots and bark for\nexample, in basketry and other weaving. The Washo people from near Lake Tahoe used small limbs of the\nIncense Cedar for bows. In\nmore modern times, when the supply of eastern red cedar ran short, Incense\nCedar made up almost the entire supply of pencil wood in the United\nStates.\n\nEdible and Medicinal\nUses\n\n:\n\nThe Klamath Native Americans\nof southern Oregon used branches and\n\ntwigs\nin an herbal steam for sweat baths. Some\ntribes took a decoction of Incense Cedar leaves for\nstomach illness, and an infusion of leaves steam\n\nwas\ninhaled for cold remedy by the Paiute. Dense leaflets were\nalso used by\nsome tribes in California to spice or flavor acorn meal.\n\nNOTE: Please use caution when preparing or eating any\nparts of a plant. Identification of the species and knowledge of a plant's\ntoxicity are both essential before using any plant species medicinally or\notherwise. Please consult with a health professional before attempting to treat\nany ailment.\n\nIncense Cedar (Calocedrus decurrens) foliage and cones. Photo by Walter\nSiegmund. It was taken in Grants Pass, Oregon on October 22, 2005\n\nPropagation Techniques:Cuttings and seeds both work well for propagation of Calocedrus\ndecurrens.\n\nSeeds – Collect the cones from trees after they have turned from\ngreen to brown, but before they open. Then dry on a plastic sheet for several days until the cones dry\nand open. Shake the seeds\nloose from the cones, and separate the seeds from the chaff with a light\nfanning. Do not de-wing the seeds. Cold stratification is\nrecommended as it generally doubles germination. In the spring sow at a depth of 0.5 cm in moist\nsoil. Shade partially for the first year, and keep soil moist.\n\nCuttings – Incense Cedar can be propagated by cuttings in a\ngreenhouse or cold frame. Take\ncuttings of same year's growth in mid-autumn and root in a cold frame.\n\nCommon Diseases:\nThe most common disease in Incense Cedar is a dry pocket rot that\ngenerally only affects the quality of the wood harvested from the tree,\nand is of negligible importance to gardeners.\n\nMost fungi only affect very old trees, although occasionally a root\nfungus, Heterobasidion annosum, will cause enough damage to result in blow\ndown.\n\nBeetles occasionally feed on the cambium, but rarely become\nnumerous enough to seriously damage a tree, and parasitic mistletoe will\ngrow on Incense Cedar, but is also of negligible concern."

      "text": "Young trees are usually conical, with whorls of horizontal branches; older trees may have round, flat, or spreading crowns. Most species have thick, rough, furrowed bark. Pine trees can tolerate drought but require full sunlight and clean air for good growth and reproduction.\n\nPines have two types of branches, long shoots and short shoots, and three types of leaves, primordial, scale, and adult. Seedling plants bear the lance-shaped, spirally arranged primordial leaves; the triangular-scale leaves, also lance-shaped, are borne on the long shoots of older trees. Both long and short shoots develop in the axils of the deciduous scale leaves. The needlelike, photosynthetic adult leaves, with two or more resin canals, are borne in fascicles (bundles) of two to five (rarely, up to eight or solitary) at the tip of each short shoot; they remain on the tree 2 to 17 years.\n\nPollen-bearing \"male\" cones are covered with many fertile scales, each of which bears two pollen sacs. Ovule-bearing \"female\" cones, borne on the same tree, have several spirally arranged bracts (modified leaves), each of which is located below a scale with two ovules (potential seeds). In spring or early summer the pollen sacs release pollen through longitudinal slits; each grain has two air bladders for wind dispersal. The scales on the female cones open to receive the pollen and then close; actual fertilization takes place late the following spring. After fertilization, the woody female cone develops over a two- to three-year period. In some species, the cones open at maturity and the seeds are released; in others the cones remain closed for several years until opened by rotting, by food-seeking animals, or by fire. In some pines the scale bearing the nutlike seed may be expanded to form a wing for airborne dispersal.\n\nPines are softwoods, but commercially they may be designated as soft pines or hard pines. Soft pines, such as white, sugar, and piñon pines, have relatively soft timber, needles in bundles of five (less commonly, one to four), stalked cones with scales lacking prickles, and little resin. Their wood is close-grained, with thin, nearly white sapwood; the sheaths of the leaf clusters are deciduous, and the leaves contain a single fibrovascular bundle. Hard pines, such as Scots, Corsican, and loblolly pines, have relatively hard timber, needles in bundles of two or three (rarely, five to eight), cone scales with prickles, and large amounts of resin. Their wood is coarse-grained and usually dark-coloured, with pale, often thick sapwood; the sheaths of the leaf clusters are persistent, and the leaves have two fibrovascular bundles.\n\nThe chief value of pines is in the construction and paper-products industries, but they are also sources of turpentine, rosin, oils, and wood tars (naval stores); longleaf, slash, cluster, and Chir pines are cut for these materials. Charcoal, lampblack, and fuel gases are distillation by-products. Pine-leaf oil, used medicinally, is a distillation product of the leaves. Edible pine seeds are sold commercially as pine nuts, piñons, or pignons, produced by stone, Armand, Siberian, piñon, Torrey, Coulter, and digger pines. Many species of pines are cultivated as ornamentals, including black, white, Himalayan, and stone pines; others, such as Scots, Corsican, cluster, and knobcone pines, are planted in reforestation projects or for windbreaks.\n\nPines are susceptible to several fungal diseases, among them white-pine blister rust, and are attacked by many insects, such as sawflies, weevils, bark beetles, and tip moths. Some pines are also susceptible to nematode infections and infestations by dwarf mistletoes (Arceuthobium, a genus of parasitic flowering plants). Pine forests often suffer severe fire damage, being very combustible because of their high resin content.\n\nMany botanists consider the genus Pinus to contain two subgenera. Haploxylon, or soft, pines have one fibrovascular bundle; Diploxylon, or hard, pines have two.\n\nMany pines have both lumber trade names and several common names. Numerous trees commonly called pines are not true pines but belong to other genera in the family Pinaceae or to other families of conifers.\n\nMajor Eurasian pines\n\nThe Scots pine (P. sylvestris) of northern Europe, when grown under optimum conditions, attains a height of 20 to 40 metres (70 to 130 feet). It is conical in youth, acquiring a mushroom crown in maturity, and has a straight trunk as much as a metre in diameter, fiery red-brown bark, and gnarled, twisted boughs densely clothed with blue-green foliage at the extremities. P. sylvestris occurs in varying abundance from Finland and Sweden to the mountains of Spain and the higher slopes of Mount Etna and, longitudinally, from the shores of the North Sea to Siberia. Abundant in the Scandinavian peninsula, it is the fir (fur, fura) of the old Norsemen and still retains that name in Great Britain, although it is a true pine. Economically it is valued for timber but also for turpentine and tar.\n\nClosely allied to the Scots pine—and perhaps to be regarded as a mere alpine form of that species—is the dwarf P. pumilio, a recumbent bush, generally only a metre or two high, but with long zig-zag stems that root occasionally at the kneelike bends where they rest upon the ground. It abounds in the Bavarian and Tirolese Alps.\n\nP. laricio, the Corsican pine, grows to a height of 30 or even 45 metres, with a straight trunk and branches in regular whorls, forming in a large tree a pyramidal head. This pine abounds in Corsica and is also found in Spain, southern France, and Greece..\n\nThe cluster, or pinaster (P. pinaster), a vigorous grower in coastal sand, has been cultivated extensively for the purpose of stabilizing sand drifts, especially on the dunes of the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean. Growing to a height of from 12 to 24 metres, the deeply furrowed trunk occasionally reaches a diameter of a metre or more at the base. Forests of pinaster, apart from the production of timber, have great economic value as a source of turpentine.\n\nP. pinea is the stone pine of Italy. Its spreading, rounded canopy of light green foliage, supported on a tall and often branchless trunk, forms a striking feature of the landscape of Italy, as well as of some other Mediterranean lands. The cones have been prized from the ancient days of Rome for their edible seeds (pignons), which are still used for food.\n\nSimilar to P. pinea is P. griffithi, the Himalayan, or blue, pine, which differs chiefly in its longer cones and drooping, glaucous foliage. It grows in Kumaeon and Bhutan and on some of the Nepal ranges, where it attains large dimensions.\n\nThe Eurasian stone pine (P. cembra) abounds on the Alps, the Carpathians, and the Siberian ranges. The oily seeds, like those of P. pinea, are eaten by the inhabitants of the Alps and Siberia and yield a fine oil used for food. The wood is remarkably even-grained and is used by Swiss woodcarvers"

By 1990 some\nof the trees showing the yellow foliage were dead and adjacent trees were showing\nthe symptoms. Other eucalypts in the region were also showing symptoms, particularly\nalong roads in and around the towns of Keith and Bordertown.\n\nA 1992-93 survey of the health of hundreds of eucalypts in the Keith-Bordertown\narea (Paton & Eldridge 1994; Paton et al. 1999) showed that trees showing symptoms\nof Mundulla Yellows (patches of yellow foliage on one or more branches or sub-branches\nwith inter-veinal chlorosis of the leaves) were largely found along roadways\nor waterways. A survey of sections of roadside vegetation between 1994 and 1999\nshowed that of 477 eucalypts examined, none recovered over the five-year period.\nWhile some were about the same, most had deteriorated and a reasonable proportion\nhad died (Table 1).\n\nThe conclusion from these figures is that once a plant shows symptoms of Mundulla\nYellows its condition deteriorates and death is inevitable, although it may\ntake 10 or more years. It is likely that all of these trees will be dead within 10-20 years. Furthermore, the only eucalypt seedling to establish\nalong these roadsides over the last five years also contracted Mundulla Yellows,\nseverely dampening any thoughts of ever being able to re-tree these areas. A\nrange of possible treatments was tried, involving injecting infected trees with\neither phosphorous acid, tetracycline, rogor or aquasol nutrient solution. No\nobvious recovery was found, although the ability to record a response was limited\nbecause the local council pruned many of the test trees. It was also found that\nthe numbers and types of birds using the trees declined as the trees lost vigour\n(Paton et al. 1999).\n\nTable 1.

Recent reconnaissance surveys reveal that\nplants expressing the symptoms are now widespread in SA, not to mention being\nreported from Western Australia, New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and the\nNorthern Territory as well. If left unchecked, Mundulla Yellows has the potential\nto devastate the native vegetation of SA, significantly reduce biodiversity,\ncontribute to problems of increased dryland salinisation and lead to substantial\nreductions in agricultural productivity, including threatening agro-forestry,\nsince commonly planted eucalypts, like E. globulus, are susceptible to\nMundulla Yellows. Mundulla Yellows will also affect amenity plantings in urban\nareas and detract from tourism. Furthermore, Mundulla Yellows attacks trees\nand shrubs of all ages including seedlings and saplings in revegetation programs\nand so threatens much of the work initiated under Natural Heritage Trust revegetation\nprograms.\n\nAt present the likely causal agent appears to be a phytoplasma (an organism\nthat lives inside plant cells), possibly transmitted by sap-sucking insects.\nPhytoplasmas have caused similar yellowing symptoms and mortality in other plants\nincluding native cabbage trees in New Zealand, and they have recently been isolated\nfrom eucalypt tissue showing the symptoms of Mundulla Yellows, but considerably\nmore work is required to demonstrate that a phytoplasma is the causal agent.\nFunds have recently been allocated by Environment Australia for plant pathologists\nlike Professor John Randles to determine if phytoplasmas or some other biotic\nagent(s) are involved and to develop a diagnostic test for Mundulla Yellows.\nUntil the causal agent(s) and method of dispersal are identified and appropriate\nremedial action found, untold and irreparable damage to the Australian environment\nwill occur.\n\nReferences\n\nPaton, D.C. & Eldridge, S. 1994.

      "text": "Cryptomeria Gardening Guide\n\nBy: Jenney Cheever\n\nJapanese cryptomeria is a beautiful evergreen with an attractive pyramid shape and feathery, bluish-green foliage that sometimes turns bronze in the winter. It is sometimes called Japanese Cedar, which is a misnomer, as it is not actually a cedar at all.\n\nMost cryptomeria trees will reach heights of 60 feet or more, with a spread of 25 to 30 feet, although there are smaller cultivars available. For all of its beauty, it is a relatively easy-to-grow tree. It thrives in a wide range of soil types, tolerates moderate winds and tends to grow quickly. Here are some tips for growing cryptomeria in your yard.\n\nChoosing a Location Cryptomeria trees prefer a sunny location, but they can handle some shade. They grow best in an area with moist, rich soil, although they will tolerate other types of soil as well. Since your cryptomeria will grow to be quite large, be sure to allow plenty of clearance near buildings, power lines and other trees. When planted in rows, cryptomeria make an unusual and attractive privacy screen or tall hedge.\n\nPlanting Begin by digging a hole in your desired location at least twice the size of your tree's root ball. Before placing your tree in the hole, carefully loosen the roots with your fingers. Backfill with soil, and water deeply. Place a good layer of mulch around the tree, to help retain moisture and control weeds.\n\nMaintenance and Care As your tree's root system is getting established, you will need to keep it watered very well. Once it is established, it will still need supplemental water in times of drought or whenever conditions are very dry. You can fertilize you tree every couple of years, but be sure to apply fertilizer early in the growing season. Crytomeria does require regular pruning, both for shaping and to keep the tree healthy by allowing light and air to circulate through the inner branches. This type of regular pruning can help your tree avoid fungal and pest problems.\n\nCryptomeria is an attractive alternative to more common types of evergreens. With very little care, it will add lovely color and interest to your landscape year round."

If you are willing to wait and have a long term garden, beech can be clipped into the most wonderful deciduous hedge. The native species is rarely used and several cultivated forms are grown. The foliage varies from golden, variegated, through to the deep purple 'copper beech' (Fagus sylvatica 'Purpurea' and 'Riversii'). The American beech (Fagus grandifolia) can be seen in parks and large gardens. To maintain true characteristics, shoots are usually grafted on to rootstocks. Though, they can be grown from stratified seed. These trees are easily grown and tolerate most soils, though do not do well in coastal conditions. They are hardy to a surprising -30 degrees Celsius.\n\nCopper Beech\n\nThe southern beeches (Nothofagus), are closely related species from the Southern hemisphere and have both deciduous and evergreen varieties. They are natives of the southern parts of the southern continents, what was once part of a vast landmass known as Gondwanaland. In their native environments, they form forest in South East Australia, New Zealand, Chile and even the highlands of Papua/New Guinea. They flower in May and have similar three-sided nuts enclosed in a scaly cup.\nThe Mountain Beech (Nothofagussolandri), is a native of the mountains of both the North and South Islands of New Zealand and grows up to 20m high. It has small, untoothed, rounded leaves, 1cm long. The Black Beech has larger, flat leaves and the Silver Beech (Nothofageusmenziesii) has toothed leaves. The best choice for gardens would be Nothofagusfusca because of its bronze toned foliage. The southern beeches are less hardy, only to -15 degrees Celsius, usually raised from seed but can be propagated from semi ripe tip cuttings taken in late summer and autumn."

The onset of the fall and winter seasons also brings an opportunity to easily find woody invasive plants. Many of these invaders turn distinctive colors or stay green longer than native species, allowing for easy identification.\n\nAlso, with the cooler temperatures, the disappearance of ticks and chiggers, and the senescence of poison ivy, it is a great time to be out in the woods. As the leaves fall on the trees in our forests, you can see a long distance through the woods and find invasive plants that otherwise would be hard to find.\n\nEven in winter, when the leaves are gone from the invaders, you can still use characteristics like bark color and texture, plant growth habit, stem arrangement, and even fruit to correctly identify these plants.\n\nThis article, summarizing a November 2012 IFA webinar on \"Dealing with Invasive Species in Fall and Winter\", will discuss the characteristics used to identify several common invasive plants in the dormant season as well as give recommendations for control methods.\n\nFor more details on this subject, a recording of the full webinar can be found at \n\nIt is important to be sure of your identification in the dormant season before conducting control applications. Misidentification could lead to accidentally controlling a desirable native species. Try to make sure at least three different characteristics check out to verify identification.\n\nBush Honeysuckle\n\nThe yellowing leaves of bush honeysuckle and the bright red berries make this plant stand out in the fall.\n\n \n\nPerhaps the greatest invasive plant threat to forests in Illinois is bush honeysuckle. This invader is actually a complex of several species, all of which look similar and have comparable impacts.\n\nBush honeysuckle is a tardily deciduous plant, meaning that it holds on to its leaves longer than most shrubs and trees in Illinois. You can commonly see bush honeysuckle with leaves still hanging on into early winter.\n\nBush honeysuckle bark is light tan and looks stringy\n\nThe normally dark green leaves typically turn a distinctive yellow-green color in fall. This leaf color, along with bright red (orange-colored in some bush honeysuckle species) berries usually occur in pairs or fours make fall identification extremely easy.\n\n Leaves are opposite on bush honeysuckle. If all the leaves have fallen off, then the buds or arrangement of small branches will also be opposite.\n\nBush honeysuckle also has very distinctive bark, light tan in color and somewhat stringy looking\nOnce a suspected bush honeysuckle plant is found, a great way to verify its identification is to cut open a small stem. Honeysuckle stems have hollow piths.\n\nBush honeysuckle twigs will have hollow piths, easily seen by cutting open a stem\n\nAutumn Olive\n\nAutumn olive is one of the most common invasive plants in Illinois. Most landowners can easily identify this plant in the growing season by the silvery underside of the leaves. Luckily, autumn olive usually retains at least some of its leaves well into the dormant season. Additionally, the rusty red berries often hang on into winter.\n\nAutumn olive is usually a multistemmed bush with younger stems being light tan to gray in color and smooth with the older stems becoming more gray and rougher.\n\nAutumn olive is usually a multi-stemmed bush\n\nTwigs of autumn olive are covered in lenticels and are rough to the touch (photo by Robert Vidéki, Bugwood.org)\n\nThe twigs of autumn olive are covered in lenticels, small dots, which give the twigs a rough texture. Often just running a twig through your figures is enough to verify identification. Thorn-like small branches may be present on autumn olive but is also often missing.\n\nOriental Bittersweet\n\nOriental bittersweet is a woody vine that can drastically impact forests. Bittersweet has a somewhat patchy distribution across the state, with some areas being overrun and other areas having no bittersweet. Bittersweet looses it leaves somewhat early in the fall, but does turn a distinctive lime-green to yellow color before fading.\n\nFruit on female Oriental bittersweet vines have an orange-yellow covering that splits to reveal scarlet berries. Oriental bittersweet can wrap tightly around a tree or coil around itself and it recognizable by the light-gray bark with prominent lenticels\n\nThe berries can remain on the female plants late into winter. These berries are bright red under an orangish-yellow capsule that peels back. These berries occur along the stems in the axils as compared to American bittersweet which would only have berries at the end of the branches.\n\nThe bark of Oriental bittersweet is very distinctive and, since often the leaves and fruit occur high in the trees, is a good characteristic to learn! Unlike grapevines, which have dark bark, or trumpeter creeper and Japanese honeysuckle, which have papery bark, bittersweet has a light-gray bark with diamond-shaped lenticels, becoming more flaky as the vines age.\n\nMultiflora Rose\n\nMultiflora rose has stiffed, curved thorns that usually are in pairs and break off easily\n\nMultiflora rose has long been a thorn in the side of Illinois landowners. This invader is better known for its damage to fields and pastures but also can be a problem in woods.\n\nWhile this plant doesn't turn a noticeable color, it does usually retain a few green leaves into late fall. The stiff, curved thorns occur along the stem usually in pairs that break off easily.\n\nThe stems of multiflora rose are round (compared to the square stems of blackberries) with the smaller stems being green or sometimes reddish with the larger stems having brownish rough bark.\n\nManagement\n\nWhile there are many more invasive species that can be identified in the fall, the species listed above are four of the biggest threats to forests in Illinois.\n\nControlling these, and other woody invasive plants, in the fall or winter is often best done using either a cut stump or basal bark application of herbicide.\n\nThere are some times when you can apply the herbicides to the foliage and some non-chemical methods of control (both of which are discussed in the webinar listed at the beginning of this article).\n\nThe advantage of using a cut stump or basal bark treatment is that the method and herbicides recommended works for all of these species, giving a landowner the option of treating more than one species without needed to change equipment or remix herbicides.\n\nFor any herbicide application, it is required that the entire label be read and followed including what type of safety equipment is needed to mix or apply.\n\nCut Stump\n\nTypically, cut stump treatments of woody invasive plants utilize either glyphosate- or triclopyr- based herbicides. Examples of a glyphosate-based herbicide would be RoundUp, though there are many generics available as well. Examples of triclopyr-based herbicides are Garlon (both 3a and 4), Crossroad (mixed with 2,4-d), and Ortho Brush-B-Gone.\n\nSince these herbicides come in many different formulations and strengths, it is crucial that the label be consulted for the specific herbicide used to determine the correct mixing rates and instructions before use.\n\nA ready-to-use premixed formulation of triclopyr, called Pathfinder II, is effective both for cut stump and basal bark and does not need mixing (though shouldn't be used in temperatures below 30 degrees).\n\nCut stump treatments are basically just what they sound like. Cut down the plant near the ground (within 6 inches, but not so close that dirt gets on the cut surface) and treat the cut surface with herbicide.\n\nTypical rates would be a 50% solution of glyphosate mixed with water or a 20% solution of triclopyr mixed with water (for amine formulations like Garlin 3a) or oil (for ester formulations like Garlon 4). Oil used can be a commercially available basal oil (like Bark Oil Blue or AX-IT) or a seed or crop oil.\n\nAdding some herbicide dye into the mixture will help you keep track of what has been treated and avoid misses.\n\nIt is important to treat the stumps soon after cutting (ideally within 15 minutes) for best results.\n\nFor small stems (less than 2-inch diameter) then treat the entire cut surface just to the point that the herbicide is starting to run down the sides. For larger stems, only the out one inch of the cut surface needs to be treated.\n\nA simple hand-pump spray bottle is a great tool to use when conducting cut stump treatments\n\nIf you are using a solution mixed with water, only use this method if temperatures are above freezing. Cold temperature can freeze the mixture and prevent it from working. Oil-based solutions can be utilized anytime throughout the fall and winter up until the plants start breaking buds in late winter /early spring.\n\nA simple hand-pump spray bottle works great for cut stump treatments but the herbicide can also be applied with a sponge or paint brush.\n\nBasal Bark\n\nIt is recommended that an ester-based triclopyr herbicide (for example – Garlon 4 or Crossroad) in oil is used for basal bark treatments. Typical rates would be a 20% solution, though be sure to check label information for the herbicide to be used for specific recommendations. Water-based herbicide mixtures are not effective using this method.\n\nAs with cut stump, Pathfinder II is a ready-to-use formulation of triclopyr that can be used for this method. Basal bark is similar to cut stump, but removes the necessity of cutting down the plant first.\n\nInstead, the herbicide is applied directly to the all sides of the bark of the plant from ground level to 12-16 inches high. For multi-stemmed shrubs, all of the stems need to be treated.\n\nThis method does use somewhat more herbicide than cut stump but is quicker to apply.\n\nMulti-stemmed shrubs need to have all stems treated for a basal bark application to be effective (photo courtesy of Dow Agrosciences)\n\nBecause of the higher volume of herbicide needed, a backpack sprayer is the ideal equipment for this method. Hand-carried pressure sprayers or ATV or vehicle-mounted spray rigs can also be used if access allows. As with cut stump, mixing in herbicide dye is a good idea to track treatments.\n\nBasal bark can be used throughout the fall and winter. Heavy snow cover seems to reduce effectiveness as do wet – or silt-covered stems.\n\nDon't be alarmed if the plants treated in the dormant season using basal bark leaf out in the spring. This sometimes happens but usually the leaves will wilt and the plant will then die. Just keep an eye on the treated plants and be prepared to retreat if necessary.\n\nUtilizing these tips for identifying and controlling woody invasive plants will hopefully allow landowners to better address invasive plants in their woods. Don't expect to get rid of all of the invasives with just one round of treatments. Plan on eradication taking 3-5 years with the most of the work occurring in the first two years.\n\nFor information on invasive plants and management can be found in the Invasive Plant section of the IFA website and on \n\nMay 2012\n\nFollow us\n\nGoals\n\nThe goal of May 2012 Illinois Invasive Species Awareness Month (ISAM) is to provide resources and opportunities to help stop the spread of invasive species in Illlinois - each and every person can make a difference, including you!"

      "text": "Money from Trees — Save on Utility Bills and Heal the Atmosphere\n\nWouldn't you just love to pick your house up, turn it this way and that way on the lot, and figure out where it really makes the most sense? The spot where it catches the prevailing breeze, has shade in the summer, sun in the winter, and energy savings year-round?\n\nThat's how houses were placed before air-conditioning, when a family's comfort inside depended on how well the house functioned. But today, we live in tidy rows on uniform blocks that line up in a way that makes more sense for real estate than anything else. The decision as to which way our doors and windows face was most likely made by a developer putting down dozens of homes at once; the placement of our driveways and patios followed suit.\n\nAnd if the sun bakes us in the summer, or if our living room is freezing in the winter, we tend to focus on things we can do inside the house to mitigate the problem. We turn the thermostat up or down; we dig out the blankets in winter or the fans in summer.\n\nAnd we pay for all of it, in comfort and utility bills.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nTackle the problem from the outside as well. Plant trees.\n\nDeciduous trees – those that lose their leaves in the fall – will shade a home in the summer and let the sun through in the winter, reducing both cooling and heating costs. Evergreen trees will block a cold wind or shade an air-conditioner year-round.\n\n\"Planting trees to save energy costs makes sense,\" said Misha Sarkovich, Program Manager of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District's Shade Tree Program. In addition, \"you improve the air quality, improve the property values and beautify the community,\" he said.\n\nThe Town of Addison takes pride in being a leader in greening of its urban areas. The Town endeavors to pursue the \"Urban Forest\" concept of increasing the number of trees planted in our community through coordinated urban beautification. The Town recognizes the economic, aesthetic, and environmental importance of street trees.\n\n(Photo: The Town of Addison)\n\nAnd the trees do more than provide shade. In essence, each tree creates its own micro climate – in photosynthesis, water vapor escapes through the leaves, creating a minuscule mist – and can reduce the temperature surrounding it by several degrees.\n\nThe Addison Arbor Foundation has two main goals. One is to increase the number of trees within the Town of Addison, and create a tree canopy that will become the Town's trademark in the D-FW Metroplex. The other goal is to plant 50 trees each year for the next 20 years, along street medians, parks and greenbelts.\n\nAddison is one of 70 Texas cities recognized as a Tree City USA, a program sponsored by the Arbor Day Foundation. With the USDA Forest Service and the National Association of State Foresters, the program supports and recognizes communities that are improving their own \"urban forests.\" To qualify, a city must have a tree board or department, a tree care ordinance, a community forestry program that spends at least $2 per capita, and an Arbor Day observance.\n\nDon't Be A Sap, Plant Correctly\n\nSo now that you've decided to add trees to your property, how do you go about choosing and siting your trees? How can you be sure that the trees you plant will grow where they'll be most helpful?\n\nThere are a few guidelines that will help almost everyone:\n\nDeciduous trees are best-placed on the side of the house that receives the most sun exposure, especially the west and southwest.\n\nEvergreen trees are best-placed where you need a windbreak or where you want shade all year around.\n\nTake into consideration which windows in the house bring in the most solar heating. Those are the windows you want to shade, especially during the hours of 3-7 p.m. in the summer.\n\nPlan for when the tree is mature: Where will its canopy throw its circle of shade? Are you planting close enough to the house to take advantage of this, without being so close that the mature tree would affect walls, sidewalks, patios or driveways? Ideally, the canopy of the tree will shade part of the roof in 5 to 10 years.\n\nIf you can, plant a tree (or tall shrubbery) to shade your air-conditioning unit, which will keep it from having to work so hard.\n\nKnow your hardiness zone. A Hardiness Zone map shows the lowest temperature that can be expected each year in each zone. Nursery catalogs and online nurseries tell you the zones that each tree will withstand.\n\nChoose trees that are well-adapted to this region. Native trees will be more resistant to local pests and diseases, and will thrive where others might not. The Texas Forest Service offers this helpful guide.\n\nIf you're planting multiple trees, be sure to leave enough room between them for the future, when their canopies grow to maturity\n\nBe sure to avoid planting directly beneath power lines and above buried cables.\n\nEstimates differ regarding how money you can save by planting well-placed trees. The California Energy Commission's Consumer Energy Center says the right type of tree can reduce your summer cooling costs by 20 to 40 percent. The United States Department of Energy says that shading an air-conditioning unit can save as much as 10% of the costs of running it. And the many variables – type of tree, where you plant it, the climate and humidity where you live, and the efficiency of your home's heating and air-conditioning units – all affect the bottom line.\n\nTo figure out just how much power your trees can help save, check this Tree Benefit Estimator, an online tool that allows a home or business owner to input details and calculate savings.\n\nTo use the estimator, a property owner needs to know their average summer and winter KWH cost in dollars (it will be a decimal-point number, such as 0.105 to represent 10½ cents), the type and number of trees they plan to plant, the tree's age or diameter, what side of the house it will be planted on, and so on.\n\nAs an example, using 0.105 as our KWH cost, and specifying that we live in Addison and plan to plant three Valley Oak trees on the west side of the house within 15 feet of the house, the calculator tells us that when the trees are 5 years old we can expect $388 worth of benefits in the annual cooling of the house. The estimator also tells how many KWH we saved (in this case, 3,474) and, in both kilograms and pounds, how much carbon dioxide has been reduced.\n\nTo illustrate the power of orientation, if we change the estimator and plant those trees on the southeast side of the house, the summer cooling benefits fall to $234. Change them again, to the northeast side, for instance, and the benefit falls to $105. Make it one tree and the benefits can fall to $25.\n\n(A note: In the calculations chart, there is also a column for \"Total Winter Heating Penalty.\" This represents the extra dollars you will have to pay in the winter if you plant new trees, because even after the leaves fall, a mature trunk and branches do create some shade. For instance, in the above examples, the winter heating penalties ranged from $3 to $9. You must subtract this number from the summer cooling benefit to arrive at a final total.)\n\nThe savings also represents how much less electricity your utility company has to provide. It's easy to see why, over time, the trees pay off in a big way. Even a savings of $25 a year adds up when you multiply it by thousands of trees"

      "text": "Planting Trees and Shrubs\n\nPlant a tree or shrub correctly, and you give it a head start on a healthy and productive life. But before you get the shovel out, look at your intended planting site and choose a species that fits the site and your needs. After you bring the ideal plant home, keep it watered and in a sheltered area until you are ready to plant.\n\nThere's an old saying that it's better to put a 10-cent plant in a dollar hole than a dollar plant in a 10-cent hole. In most cases, you should dig a hole that is twice as wide but no deeper than the root ball. One exception: When planting in heavy clay or compacted soil, dig a hole three to four times wider than the root ball to loosen the soil and encourage roots to spread out.\n\nTo determine the correct size hole for your plant, lay a shovel handle across the top of the root ball (Photo A). Then measure from the bottom of the root ball to the shovel handle; the measurement is the depth of the hole you should dig.\n\nPhoto B\n\nCarefully lift the plant into the hole, then lay the measuring stick across the top of the root ball to ensure it is at ground level (Photo B). Once the root ball is at the correct depth, position the plant so its most attractive side faces your primary viewpoint.\n\nPhoto C\n\nSome B&B stock will have a metal basket surrounding the root ball. Remove the basket if you can do so without disturbing the root ball. Otherwise, use wire cutters to snip off the top two rungs. Plastic burlap should be removed, but burlap made of natural fibers can be left on the root ball if the sides are pulled down as far as possible (Photo C). This allows the roots to spread without waiting for the burlap to disintegrate and is especially important if you're dealing with treated burlap. In any case, always untie the rope that holds the burlap in place. Don't allow any portion of the burlap to remain above ground, as the fabric will wick moisture out of the planting hole.\n\nPhoto D\n\nWhen backfilling the hole, use the same soil you removed. Resist the urge to amend the soil, an old practice that is no longer recommended. Amending the backfill encourages the roots to remain in that \"comfort\" zone rather than seeking moisture and nutrients elsewhere. Amended soil may also collect too much moisture from the surrounding ground.\n\nFill the hole two-thirds of the way to the top, then add water to settle the soil (Photo D) before you fill the remainder of the hole.\n\nPhoto E\n\nHold the tree or shrub upright while firming the soil around the base with your foot (Photo E). Leave a saucer-shape basin of soil at the base of the plant to collect water.\n\nPhoto F\n\nTop the soil off with 3-4 inches of seasoned wood chips or shredded bark mulch (Photo F). Cover a wide area around the tree base to reduce competition from weeds and grass and to conserve moisture, but don't allow the mulch to pile up against the trunk. During the first growing season, water the tree or shrub every seven to 10 days if rainfall is lacking."

      "text": "The Homeowners Column\n\nTree Conditions That May Appear Serious But Are Not Life Threatening\n\nJune 26, 1999\n\nI have great respect for trees. They have a tenacity to continue to live and even thrive under less than ideal conditions. They suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous people–baseball bats, garage sale flyers, and the occasional misguided car. Trees also have their share of diseases. Fortunately some are not as serious as they appear.\n\nEach year we see some spotting and browning of leaves, buds and sometimes stems of ash, maple, oak, elm, walnut and other tree species. Often the cause is a fungal disease called anthracnose. It attacks developing leaves during cool wet weather.\n\nSycamore have succumbed once again to anthracnose fungal disease. According to Nancy Pataky at the U of I Plant Clinic sycamores are experiencing their usual bout of anthracnose this year. The fungus can kill the first set of leaves so sycamores appear to leaf out late. Fortunately sycamores will produce another set of leaves. Even though sycamores seem to get anthracnose to some degree each year, they continue to thrive.\n\nAnthracnose can also infect ash trees. Often ash trees appear healthy but not as full of leaves, or it can cause the first set of leaves to drop. To determine if branches have the ability to leaf out again, look for live buds on the twigs. Live buds should appear green and plump. Also try scratching the new growth. It should look green and moist. If the buds and branches are dead, the tree may have a more serious problem.\n\nOaks can also get a fungal disease called oak leaf blister. The leaves are distorted and blister-like growths appear on the leaves. The leaves often appear thickened and almost crisp. Leaves turn downward and inward and may become red or purple. Another oak leaf problem, oak tatters or \"bare bones\" has also been seen at the plant clinic recently. On the leaves only the veins and a bit of the leaf blade around the veins is present. The edges are often brown or thickened. The leaves appear to have been attacked by zillions of hungry insects. The cause of oak tatters is not certain, but appears to be the result of cold injury when leaves were in bud.\n\nKeep in mind not all problems with trees are caused by infectious diseases or insects. When new leaves are damaged by cold and high wind, they can appear to be suffering from insect damage. With weather-damaged leaves, there is no pattern to the damage and the holes in the leaves are jagged. Leaves with wind damage may also have straight line rips in the tissue. If leaves are damaged while still in the bud, a uniform pattern may appear as they unfurl. Maples often show a great deal of leaf tatter.\n\nIf you are not sure the cause of the problem, samples can be taken to the U of I Plant Clinic, 1401 St Mary's Road, Urbana 61802 ($12.50 fee) or to nearest Master Gardener office.\n\nGenerally the best management option is to promote good tree health; water during drought periods; remove dead or dying branches; and fertilize if necessary in fall. For antrhacnose and oak blister, fungicide sprays are not effective once symptoms appear. In addition both diseases are not life threatening. The bottom line is the infected trees will probably outlive us all despite their not-so-perfect leaves.\n\nMahomet Garden Walk Sunday, June 27, 11am-5pm Tour six beautiful Mahomet area gardens.

The Pickwick Belle, however, offers cruises on its paddlewheeler (complete with observation deck on top) from Tennessee's Pickwick Landing State Park.\n\n\"The fall foliage cruises are our most popular of the whole year,\" said Tanya Irwin, marketing director for the Pickwick Belle. \"We have two-hour, white-tablecloth lunch cruises and 90-minute sightseeing cruises on our paddlewheel riverboat.\" Prices, she added, range from about $10 to $33.\n\nEvery fall different\n\nEach year, shorter days trigger trees to prepare for winter. When they slow down photosynthesis - the production of the chlorophyll that keeps them green - other chemicals that have been there all along become visible. Anthocyanins create the red hues, while carotenoids produce yellow.\n\nAs beautiful as fall can be here, autumns in the Mid-South rarely have the picture-postcard vistas for which northern states are famous.\n\nPerhaps the biggest reason is the species difference. Some sources assert that about 10 percent of trees in temperature zones produce anthocyanins, while in parts of New England, it's more like 70 percent.\n\n\"In the Great Lakes and New England, there's much more brilliant fall color,\" said Andy Londo, extension professor of forestry at Mississippi State University, noting the maples, birches and poplars that dominate hardwood forests in those regions. \"Here we have a lot of oaks: If oaks turn red at all, you're doing well, but they quickly move to brown.\"\n\nThe species mix, topography and length of season all make for the difference. Northern regions' fewer but brighter species are often splayed en masse across whole hillsides while the Southern landscape has a far greater variety of trees, only some of which show much color.\n\nIn our pine- and oak-dominant forests, the showiest trees tend to be individuals or small groups.\n\n\"Cottonwood, sweetgum, and the gingkos we see planted in our towns and yellow poplar are some of the most colorful species in Mississippi, turning a bright yellow,\" Londo said. \"Dogwoods, on the other hand, turn a purplish red, and red maples will turn a bright, vivid red. Oaks turn red, brown or russet while hickories turn a golden bronze.\"\n\nRight now, wildflowers - perennial sunflowers and several species of goldenrod, particularly - add their own charm to the Northeast Mississippi countryside. It's hard to appreciate at 55 miles per hour, but for hikers and bikers, even poison ivy - safely viewed from several feet away - can offer a splash of brilliant red.\n\nAbundant summer rainfall and cool but above-freezing days and nights create the best conditions for autumnal splendor. This year, a dry summer and fall has stressed trees, pushing some into early leaf shed. Others may not have their normal brilliance.\n\n\"Last year we had a pretty color show, but we had good rainfall last summer,\" Londo said. \"I don't expect us to have quite as nice a fall this year.\""

Cool-season vegetables that can be direct-seeded include: the root crops of beets, carrots, radishes, parsnips and turnips; the leaf crops of chard, loose-leaf lettuces, spinach, mesclun mix, mustard and collard greens, and kale. Plant small transplants of asparagus, early potatoes, broccoli, cabbage, lettuce, radish, mustard, onions, peas, rhubarb, spinach, turnips, cauliflower, carrots and all other cool-season crops as weather permits.\n\nPlant cool-season annuals that tolerate a light frost can be planted early in the month after being hardened off. These include snapdragons, sweet peas, cape daisies, pansies and violets.\n\nFertilize spring-flowering bulbs with a granular 5-10-5 or 10-10-10 mix as new green growth emerges or when they finish flowering. Remove spent flowers but allow foliage to wither completely before removing.\n\nMow lawn at 2-2.5 inches, Leave grass clippings on the lawn to return nutrients to the soil, or add them to compost heap. If necessary, apply a second application of lawn fertilizer, and spot treat with broadleaf weed control.\n\nMonitor plantings to minimize damage from pests and diseases. Succulent new green growth is particularly susceptible to aphid attack. Monitor newly planted trees, shrubs and perennials for signs of aphids — curled, distorted tip growth. Spray strong stream of water on damaged foliage to remove pests. Don't use strong chemicals if ladybugs are present since they are predators of aphids.\n\nContinue planting new trees and shrubs.\n\nContinue pruning spring-flowering shrubs after they flower and small evergreens, such as boxwood or yew, can be lightly pruned after the new growth fills in. Prune spent flower heads from shrubs, perennials and annuals to encourage growth and continued bloom.\n\nFertilize roses monthly and watch for disease and insects. Deadhead roses as flowers fade. Many shrub roses are self-cleaning and don't require deadheading; when in doubt, lightly prune old blossoms to keep plant looking attractive.\n\nPinch mums and asters till early July.\n\nAllow bulb foliage to ripen and whither before removal.\n\nFertilizer annual flowers and vegetables\n\nMulch vegetable garden with straw to retain moisture.\n\nStake or cage tomatoes as they begin to grow. Harvest peas, raspberries and all cool-season lettuces and vegetables as they ripen. Sow seeds of pumpkins corn, bush beans and cabbage for an early fall harvest.\n\nPlant dill or fennel to attract swallowtail butterflies to lay their eggs. Watch for tiny eggs to develop into plump caterpillars that will feed on the foliage before pupating into butterflies.\n\nPinch new top growth of herbs to keep them from flowering; this will intensify the oils and flavor in the foliage. Snip or cut off sprigs of herbs to use in cooking. Portions of fresh herbs can be cut, frozen or dried during summer to encourage plant to produce more growth.\n\nSeed bare areas of lawn with appropriate grass seed mix and starter fertilizer. Keep area moist until seeds germinate. Do not mow for several weeks as new grass thickens up.\n\nMonitor lawn for weeds. Mow lawn at 2-2.5 inches, Leave grass clippings on the lawn to return nutrients to the soil, or add them to the compost. Water lawns, if necessary and avoid watering midday or on windy days. Grass can go dormant for several weeks in intense heat and requires only 1 inch of water per week to remain alive.\n\nJuly\n\nGarden Tours\n\nMonitor plantings to minimize damage from pests and diseases. Avoid strong pesticides until insects are correctly identified. Many, like aphids, will go away with a strong stream of water from a hose. Additionally, aphids have many natural enemies and are rarely cause for harsh pesticides.\n\nPrune hedges and summer flowering shrubs after flowering. Renovate overgrown shrubs including redtwig dogwood, lilac and forsythia by removing one-third of the oldest canes. Prune out weak, green but very fast-growing water sprouts that grow vertically from branches of fruit and ornamental trees.\n\nFertilize roses for the final time at the end of the month; do not fertilize after August 1. Continue to deadhead roses by cutting flowers back to the first set of five leaflets.\n\nEnjoy cut garden flowers from the garden; some of the flowers can be dried. To promote a second, late-summer flower show, cut back, shear or remove flower spikes from the following early blooming perennials: catmint, geraniums, salvia and delphiniums.\n\nStake taller perennials, if necessary.\n\nAnnualContinue to harvest herbs to use fresh or dry for later use. Pinch off developing flowers to retain essential oils and flavor in the plants' foliage.\n\nMonitor tomatoes during hot weather. Tomatoes appreciate an even supply of moisture rather than a heavy soaking and then a drought. Straw mulch is helpful in these beds.\n\nSeeds for fall crops may be sown toward the end of the month. These include beans, broccoli, spinach, cool-season lettuce crops and cabbages.\n\nMonitor all plants for insects; hand-remove large insects such as tomato hornworms and caterpillars.\n\nHarvest onions and garlic as they are ready and begin the drying process.\n\nKeep the lawn well watered during times of heat or drought and raise mower height to 3-4\" during dry weather.\n\nDo not fertilize lawns in summer. Early fall is the best time to apply a 3-1-2 ratio fertilizer. During drought or times of water conservation, turf will go dormant, but the grass plants' crowns will remain alive with only 1 inch of water per week. Mow grass higher, at 2.5-3\", in hot summer. Grass clippings can be left on the lawn and raked to avoid clumping. Avoid using herbicides in hot weather. Always read directions carefully. Pull out annual weeds, such as crabgrass, before they go to seed.\n\nMonitor plantings to minimize damage from pests and diseases. Succulent new growth is often the first area to be attacked by insects. Aphids can easily be hosed off foliage. Many sucking, piercing and chewing insects will finish feeding this month, leaving cosmetic damage but nothing serious enough to warrant chemical control.\n\nWater plantings as needed during times of extreme heat or drought. AnnualPruning is generally not advised this month, with the exception of shrubs that have just finished flowering which are pruned immediately following flowering.\n\nContinue to harvest herbs to use fresh or dry for later use. Pinch off developing flowers to retain essential oils and flavor in the plants' foliage.\n\nPlant colorful chrysanthemum, aster, ornamental cabbage, kale, pansy or other fall-flowering plants to provide fall color. Often greenhouse-grown mums are not hardy and will not survive the winter; however, the earlier a mum is planted in your garden, the greater the chance of survival over winter. Mulch newly planted perennials immediately.\n\nDuring the first week of August, plant short-season snap beans, broccoli, cabbages, cauliflower, carrots, mustard greens, spinach and radishes for fall harvesting. Lettuces, mesclun mixes and greens can also be planted this month.\n\nAnnual white grub damage will begin to show up this month as browned-out areas of turf that pull back easily \"like a carpet.\" Grubs chew grass roots, resulting in turf that lifts up. Minor damage is usually not cause for treatment. Pull back turf and count grubs (white C-shaped larvae with black heads); 10 to 12 per square foot is considered enough to treat. Try to avoid using strong insecticides if damage is light but, if necessary, treat only the affected areas rather than entire lawn.\n\nWater lawn as needed but, remember in times of drought or excessive heat, grass can go dormant. The grass will turn yellow but the crown of the plants will remain alive with just one-half inch of water over several weeks. Grass will green up as soon as normal rainfall returns.\n\nSeptember\n\nLuthy Botanical Garden Events: School Programs, Garden Tours\n\nMonitor plantings to minimize damage from pests and diseases.\n\nContinue weeding beds and plantings.\n\nWater plantings as needed during times of extreme heat or drought.\n\nSeptember is a good time to begin a compost pile. Begin to layer grass clippings, dried leaves, soil, a handful of fertilizer and a little moisture.\n\nDivide and move perennials, working in compost, bone meal and soil amendments.\n\nTransplant/divide daylily, peony and iris, amending soil with bone meal, early this month. Water well to encourage healthy root development. Peonies should be planted so that the buds or eyes are no deeper than 2 inches below soil level. If planted too deeply, they will fail to flower.\n\nToward the end of the month, start planting bulbs, using bone meal or bulb food. Mulch area after planting. If rodents, deer or rabbits have been a problem in the past, consider planting varieties of the following pest-resistant bulbs: ornamental onion, grape hyacinth, fritillary, narcissus, windflower, winter aconite.\n\nCuttings from favorite or unusual varieties of annuals such as geraniums, coleus, begonias and impatiens can be taken this month, potted up and brought inside to a south-facing window.\n\nAmaryllis bulbs that have summered outdoors must begin their dormant period. Stop watering at the end of summer and allow the bulb to dry out and go dormant for at least 2-3 months before repotting. Place the pot in a cool (50 degrees), dark location. In January, replacing the old soil with fresh potting mix, repot and locate the pot where it receives several hours of direct or bright indirect light each day. To best initiate growth of a flower stalk, place the pot in a warm location 70-80 degrees. Water well at planting time and sparingly till the leaves or buds start to emerge.\n\nContinue to harvest vegetables as they ripen. Warm-season crops like peppers and tomatoes must be picked as soon as possible. If an early frost threatens, cover these plants with baskets or light blankets. Begin to harvest late-season squash and early pumpkins. Full-sized pumpkins need to remain on the vine as long as possible to achieve their maximum size. Continue to snip herbs to use fresh, to dry or to freeze. If herbs have gone to flower or seed, discontinue harvesting, since the flavor has then left the foliage.\n\nAllow collards, kale and Brussels sprouts to be hit with frost before harvesting. This improves their flavor.\n\nMaintain good sanitation throughout the vegetable garden. Remove diseased plants immediately as well as those that have finished for the year. Compost only healthy plant material.\n\nBegin fall grass seeding, incorporating seed starter fertilizer. To overseed an entire lawn, consider hiring a professional or renting a slit-seeding machine that drops seed into the small slits, providing adequate soil contact with the seed. You might also consider core-aeration of lawn; it is recommended to help resolve compacted soil, heavy thatch accumulation and poor drainage.\n\nTransplant dormant trees and shrubs. When trees and shrubs drop their leaves or undergo color change, they are entering dormancy and will not suffer as much transplant shock when moved. Certain trees are better planted in spring, among them magnolia, redbud, Japanese maple, dogwood, and any other woody plants considered marginally hard.\n\nContinue to water newly planted trees and shrubs, especially evergreens, up until ground freezes. Milder temperatures can fool gardeners into thinking woody plants don't require as much moisture in fall as they do in summer. Evergreens continue to lose moisture through their needles throughout winter and must have adequate water in their root zones to avoid winter burn or desiccated needles.\n\nApply fertilizer to trees or shrubs that have not received any this year and/or have demonstrated a need, e.g., stunted growth, failure to fully flower or leaf out, undersized fruit, off-color foliage or recovery from disease.\n\nCut perennials to 2-3\" to clean up beds and prevent disease. Let those that provide winter interest remain until early spring. Waiting after a few heavy frosts will often eliminate much of your labor, as foliage can be gently pulled from the crown or raked off without pruning (i.e. hosta or daylily). Protect valued flowers and vegetables against early frost; cover tender plants from light freezes at night by covering them with sheets, plastic, buckets or bushel baskets.\n\nContinue to harvest vegetables. If hard frost threatens, pick all tomatoes, including the unripe ones and store in cardboard boxes or paper bags in basement. Apply heavy mulch over leeks, carrots, beets and turnips to continue harvest into early winter. Cut back any remaining herbs and bring indoors to use fresh or dry.\n\nIf rabbits, rodents or deer have been a problem in past winters, take precautions now. Protect shade trees, ornamentals and fruit trees from trunk damage with tree wrap or tree guards. It may be necessary to protect shrubs with wire fencingWinter is an excellent time to prune most tees and shrubs to improve shape and vigor. Deciduous trees are easier to prune when the leaves are off and the branch structure is clearly visible.\n\nContinue to keep the garden tidy by removing any broken or fallen branches from the yard. If small plants have heaved out of the ground, gently press them back with your hands.\n\nMinimize the use of salt by using sand or ashes and keep salt away from planting beds.\n\nOrder seed, bulb and nursery catalogs to assist in planning your garden for the upcoming yearRevise garden and perennial border layouts.\n\nFeed birds and, if possible, provide water and cover for them.\n\nTrees for Urban Areas\n\nTrees, especially in urban/suburban settings, make important contributions to society. They have environmental, social, aesthetic and economic values. Trees are major capital assets in cities across the United States. Just as streets, sidewalks, public buildings and recreational facilities are a part of a community's infrastructure, so are trees. It is important to remember that those trees and, collectively, the urban forest are important assets that require care and maintenance the same as other public property. Trees are on the job 24 hours every day working for all of us to improve our environment and quality of life.\n\nTrees reduce air pollution by absorbing gaseous pollutants and filtering dust, ash and smoke. For instance they absorb CO2 and other dangerous gasses and, in turn, replenish the atmosphere with oxygen. By helping to settle out, trap and hold particle pollutants (dust, ash, pollen and smoke) that can damage human lungs, they provide incredible health benefits. A dense grove of trees about 50 feet wide reduces apparent loudness of noise by as much as 50 percent.\n\nTrees buffer glare caused by lights and the sun, provide wind protection and cool the air. Trees provide a cooling effect sorely needed in urban areas where urban temperatures average seven to nine degrees higher than surrounding areas because of buildings and paving. With properly placed trees, homeowners can attain a savings up to 58 percent on their daytime air conditioning, while a windbreak of trees and shrubs, in rural or suburban settings, can save as much as 20 to 40 percent in energy costs. If applied nationwide to buildings not now benefiting from trees, we could reduce our nation's consumption of oil by 500,000 barrels of oil/day, a huge step toward a healthy environment and energy independence. Additionally, one benefits economically with lower energy usage in this era of ever-increasing energy costs.\n\nTrees provide habitat for wildlife, bringing birds, mammals and insects to the garden. This has the potential to strengthen the ecosystem by enhancing populations and providing diversity.\n\nTrees certainly improve the quality of our lives, and there can be no disputing the beauty trees bring to our lives. Take a moment to consider their brilliant colors in fall, the sight of Waxwings dining on the jeweled fruit of the hawthorn or the weathered character of a centuries-old Bur Oak. The presence of trees reduces stress, and trees have long been seen to benefit the health and well being of urban dwellers. The aesthetic value of urban forests and street trees is difficult to measure, but trees have been found to increase the value of property. The value of a lot with trees averages five to seven percent higher than a lot without trees. The increase in value can be as much as 20 percent, and lots with trees often sell faster than lots without them.\n\nRunoff and erosion from storms is reduced because leaves slow water allowing it to soak into the soil. This reduces runoff by about seven percent and reduces the need for erosion control structures. Smaller drainage pipes may be sufficient, thus saving money on materials, installation, and maintenance. Additionally, less sediment and pollution collects in stream bottoms and flows into the Illinois River.\n\nI have included a list of trees considered dependable for a broad range of conditions, but specifically in difficult urban settings. I hope you will brighten our future and consider planting a few trees. See you in the garden.\n\n\"I think that I shall never see\nA poem lovely as a tree.\" Alfred Joyce Kilmer, 1913"

      "text": "How to Tap a Maple Tree with Arnold Coombs from Coombs Family Farms To tap a maple, you'll need a spout, a hammer, a bucket, a drill, and your parent's permission. Then, find a sugar maple. So, if you want to make a maple syrup at your house, you go out and find a sugar maple like this one. What we're looking for is a sugar maple that has kind of a shaggy bark and you can look at a book and see how a leaf is and such. But the sugar maple gives us the best sap. The roots of the tree stores starch over the winter and it gets converted into sugars. So, the sap is going up through like water. We're going to take a little bit of it out. But there's really thousands of gallons going up through a tree over the course of a year. And we're taking 10 gallons so it doesn't hurt the tree. This is a typical sugar maple. This one's probably a 130 to 150 years old. And in tapping this, we'd walk up to it, just try to get—maybe on the south side, you can see the sun is down in this direction. Look for a big root. There's a couple of good ones on this tree. Find a spot like here, nice and clean. What you'll do is you'd take a bit and you'll tap the tree, you're going about an inch and a half, like the size of my little finger. And I'll do that right now. Let's pick a spot like that. Slightly uphill, so the sap runs down. You can see the sap dripping there, coming out of the tree. Take a metal spout like that with a hook. You put it right into the hole and just tap it in with a hammer within snout not too far. And the sap will bit dam up behind that spout and eventually it'll running out there. Here it comes and catch it with a bucket. Hang the bucket around the hook or if you have a milk jug, put that there. And then slide the cover on. Collect a little bit. Boil it down and then you have pancakes."

      "text": "The Tree with Red Mittens\n\nsassafras in the same high regard as the spices of Araby. Such reverence stemmed from an old belief that strong fumes had curative powers. During the bubonic plague, physicians wore nose beaks of potent spices, such as sassafras, to ward off the disease. Sassafras also was popular as a drink and, in the past, shops on London street corners served up \"saloop,\" a drink made of sassafras tea laced with hot milk.\n\nThe scientific name for the sassafras tree is Sassafras albidum. The tree is also called saxifrax, sassafrac, gumbo filé, green stick, cinnamon wood and golden elm. Sassafras belongs to the laurel family and is one of the few species of trees that has more than one kind of leaf on the same plant. On old boughs, the leaves are small and either boat- or trident-shaped; on the young trees where vigorous growth occurs, the leaves take on their familiar mitten shape with one \"thumb\" lobe blending into a larger terminal lobe. This leaf is unique among flora and can be mistaken for nothing else, except perhaps the mulberry leaf. But in comparison, the mulberry's mittens are thin, dull green and many-toothed.\n\nIn early spring, the tree produces rather inconspicuous yellow blossoms; leafing out is late. In the fall, the waxy green leaves of summer give way to a mixed pallet of blood orange, vermillion and salmon. When the leaves are at their most beautiful, sassafras trees produce deep blue berries called drupes that are relished by bluebirds, robins, bobwhite, red-eyed vireos and pileated woodpeckers.\n\nThe sassafras tree never depended on dense forest land, a fact that has allowed it to increase its range. In fact, it is most at home along fence rows and in old pastures. It spreads by putting out underground runners that allow clumps of trees to spring up seemingly overnight. Many an Ozark farmer has shaken his head in dismay at a spritely column of sassafras trees marching along a fence row he cleared only a season or two ago.\n\nIn the north, sassafras is a small tree, clinging to life as a mere shrub on the shifting dunes along Lake Michigan. In the Ozarks, it grows to heights of 15 to 20 feet or more, with a life span of 30 to 60 years. Further south, sassafras can grow to heights of 80 feet or more, with trunks up to 6 feet thick. Today, the world's largest sassafras tree is in Owensboro, Ky. With a circumference of 21 feet, this giant is thought to be between 250 and 300 years old.\n\nIt was not until the 1950s that the superstitions surrounding sassafras began to lose their hold. Rumor had it that sassafras tea could make you sick. Then in 1960, the Food and Drug Administration made it official. Safrole, the major chemical in sassafras oil, was hepatocarcinogenic, meaning studies in lab animals confirmed it caused liver cancer. In 1976, the FDA officially banned the sale of sassafras tea, its roots and the oil. Only filé powder, made from the safrole-free leaves and used as a seasoning in Creole cooking, would be allowed to stay on the market. People were warned that it was not possible to make a safrole-free product at home. An age-old custom was relegated to our long American past.\n\nSo now we know Grandma's sassafras tea wasn't good for us, and we must give it up because we have learned new things about it.\n\nWe can endure without it. After all, it wasn't so much Grandma's sassafras tea that revived us after a long, Ozark winter, it, was really the miracle of another spring brewing in the sleeping woods\n\nOther Content You May Like\n\nLong considered a source for medicinal tea, sassafras should not be consumed anymore—by humans at least. This tree, with its aromatic oval, mitten- and trident-shaped leaves, supplies the perfect food for the larvae of a host of spectacular butterflies and moths"

      "text": "Street Trees\n\nWhat is a street tree? In the City of Lancaster, trees are generally located in either the public right of way (i.e., street tree) or on private property. Street trees are typically located along sidewalks adjacent to streets.\n\nWhy are street trees so important? Trees are one important component in the City's overall green infrastructure plan. Tree canopies reduce the amount and rate at which rainwater strikes the ground, thereby reducing erosion and stormwater management costs. While stormwater benefits vary by species, size, etc., it is estimated that a single tree can manage about 3,440 gallons of stormwater annually. Multiple that by 6,000 street trees (which doesn't include all the trees on private property) and more than 20 million gallons of stormwater is being intercepted by trees instead of going into the combined sewer system!\n\nWell-maintained trees in residential neighborhoods also can significantly increase the value of homes and property by creating a sense of privacy and adding to the beauty of the landscape. Commercial areas benefit too, as studies have shown how tree lined store-fronts increase the likelihood of shoppers, increase the length of time people shop, and increase the amount shoppers are willing to pay for goods. These economic values increase the amount of property and other taxes available to the City.\n\nCooling and heating costs can be reduced by strategically placing trees around buildings and roads. This shading and cooling provided by community trees helps to reduce energy needs and bills.\n\nTrees are known to provide many mental and physical health benefits to people. They help filter particulates out of the air, absorb carbon dioxide, and emit oxygen. Street and park trees offer mental and emotional restorative properties to people by helping to mitigate noise, providing a contrast to hard concrete surfaces, by establishing a connection to the natural world, and importantly, by reducing stress. All these benefits not only make people healthier, but also reduce health care costs.\n\nWho is responsible for maintaining street trees? You as the property owner are responsible for maintaining and caring for your street tree; including watering and feeding; trimming, pruning and spraying; and removal of the tree in the event of its death.\n\nI want to prune, trim, remove (or anything else!) my tree, but I was told I need a permit. Is this true? Yes, if it is a street tree. You need to obtain a written permit from the City of Lancaster Arborist Jim Bower and the City's Shade Tree Commission (717-291-4841) essentially before you do anything to your street tree including pruning, trimming or removing. A permit will be issued from the City of Lancaster's Bureau of Parks and Public Property. You will be required to complete the work within a specified time period, not to exceed three months.\n\nFor trees on private property, you do not need a permit. However, if you have questions about your trees – public or private – the City Arborist is available to answer questions and refer you to additional resources.\n\nI want to plant a tree, but I was told I need a permit. Is this true? Yes, if it is a street tree. You need to obtain a written permit from The City of Lancaster Arborist Jim Bower (717-291-4841) before planting. The City of Lancaster has a recommended street tree planting list and can help with sourcing and planting of the tree.\n\nNo, not if you are planting a tree on private property. However you should keep in mind several factors when selecting a planting locations: proximity to power and cable lines overhead, underground utilities, and foundation of your home.\n\nWhy can I only plant certain types of trees? The City of Lancaster Street Tree Planting List offers tree varieties that are well suited to urban environments. They are tolerant of soil compaction, heat, drought, sun, shade, and pollutants such as road salt. Also, certain trees root systems are especially prone to damaging sidewalks. Selecting a tree from the City's list will help alleviate the potential for sidewalk damage.\n\nI'm concerned about future sidewalk damage. Do I have to plant a tree? Please consult with City Arborist Jim Bower about your site and personal concerns. Future sidewalk damage can be avoided by choosing a tree variety that best suits each situation.\n\nA street tree was recently removed in front of my home. How long do I have to replace it? All trees removed must be replaced within one year of the removal unless exemption is granted by the Shade Tree Commission.\n\nI got a letter saying I needed to trim/prune my tree. Who do I call and what kinds of questions do I need to ask a potential contractor? If you have questions about pruning and maintenance please contact City of Lancaster Arborist Jim Bower (717-291-4841). The City of Lancaster maintains a list of Registered Tree Contractors that are insured to do business in the city. (Please note that this list is not an endorsement of these contractors.) You'll also want to be sure they have experience removing trees in an urban environment.\n\nI have an empty tree well in front of my property. I want to fill it in with concrete. Is this allowable? You'll need a permit. Please contact City of Lancaster Arborist Jim Bower (717-291-4841) who will review your request. Generally speaking, the City is disinclined to allow the removal of a street tree well. However there are exceptions.\n\nIf you do not get a permit and fill in a tree well and do it anyway, you will be required to pay for a street tree to be planted elsewhere in the City.\n\nI want to add a tree well in front of my property.

The Shade Tree Commission, works in conjunction with the City Arborist, to maximize the benefit derived from public shade trees by establishing policies for the planting, removal, maintenance and protections of trees along City streets and sidewalks. The Commission meets as necessary, usually the third Tuesday of each month, at 8:00 AM in Southern Market Center, 100 South Queen Street. Call 717-291-4846 for more information.\n\nDuring the summer of 2011 the Shade Tree Commission in partnership with LIVE Green and the City of Lancaster undertook a comprehensive Tree Inventory. An accurate street tree inventory provides the foundation for which annual work plans and budgets are based. Knowledge of the community forest species composition, condition, and age helps to create a prioritized maintenance plan for annual tree pruning, removal, and planting. for all street trees in the City of Lancaster. We currently have 5,483 trees with 77 different varieties identified."

Apply a two- to three-inch layer of organic matter or chipped tree trimmings; be sure to keep it several inches away from the trunks of the plant to prevent rot. Don't practice \"wall-to-wall\" mulching; remember those bees that nest in the ground.\n\nControl earwigs, which feed on soft plants and can cause significant damage. They feed at night and hide in moist, tight spaces during the day. Trap them by setting out moistened,tightly rolled newspaper at night and then discard it in the morning.\n\nFire blight shows up in the spring. It causes blackened branches and twigs that look as if they have been scorched. It often affects fruit trees such as apple, pear and loquat, as well as toyons, hawthorns and crab apples. It is spread by insects, rain and pruning; if left unattended, it can kill the tree. Prune the infected branch about 8-12 inches below the visible damage. Sanitize pruners between cuts.\n\nPrevent rust on snapdragons, sunflowers,sweet peas and pansies by avoiding overhead watering and practicing good sanitation. Rusts are easily identified by the dry, brown, orange or yellowish spores that form on lower leaf surfaces. Upper leaf surfaces of heavily infected plants can become spotted or turn yellow or brown. Remove and destroy affected plants or plant parts as soon as they appear. Fungicides, such as neem oil, can be applied at the first signs of infection."

      "text": "How to Prune Crepe Myrtle Bushes\n\nBy Jean D\n, last updated February 18, 2011\n\nPruning a crepe myrtle is a relatively easy process. You don't need any special tools or skill to do the job properly. You do need to ensure that you tackle this job at the right time of year, however. Unlike the other plants in your garden, your crepe myrtle should be pruned in the spring or early summer. Pruning in the fall or winter leaves your plant exposed to cold temperatures that can kill it. You will likely need sharp garden shears as well as large loppers to complete the pruning job. Also wear thick gardening gloves to protect your hands from sharp stems. If your tools are sharp, the job will go quicker.\n\nMany varieties of crepe myrtle are susceptible to powdery mildew. By removing dense materials from the center of your plant, you will increase air circulation and reduce the risk of mildew. Begin by looking inside your plant for dead limbs and remove them as close to the trunk as you can. Next, look for branches that cross one another or rub together and remove them. Finally, remove branches that turn inward and remove them. All branches should point outward. Leave the thick, heavy stalks as they are, but trim away any sucker branches that are growing from the roots.\n\nIf your crepe myrtle has been neglected for several years, you may have more work to do. Determine how tall you want your crepemyrtle to be, and cut branches back to that size, as close to a bud as you can get. This sort of trimming will force the plant to grow thicker branches, although you may not have as many blossoms in the year in which you do a severe pruning. This is, again, another reason to prune your plants in the spring, when the buds have formed, as it will be easier for you to tell where to make your cuts."

      "text": "Have you ever stopped to wonder what a particular place looked like a generation or so ago?\n\nI for one, until relatively recently, had been guilty of not giving much thought to the plants that came before the ones I saw in front of me in the Walsingham nature reserves (more commonly known as Tom Moore's Jungle). It came as quite a surprise to learn that Walsingham looked very different just a few decades ago!\n\nTake a walk through the Walsingham reserves today and the dominant (most common) plant there is Surinam cherry, Eugenia uniflora, with tunnel-like paths formed by the cherry branches meeting overhead.\n\nSurinam cherry is native to tropical America and was introduced to Bermuda. It may have been the \"cherries\" and \"sherries\" mentioned by Governor Hamilton in 1790, but it was definitely here by 1840 since it was mentioned in an inventory of the estate at Orange Valley in Devonshire in 1840.\n\nSo what grew there in Walsingham before the cherry trees? Originally there would have been a forest of native and endemic plants dominated by cedar, but also including palmetto, olivewood, hackberry, Lamark's trema and white stopper as well as numerous other smaller plants. (For an inkling of what that pre-colonial forest might have looked like, visit the decades old restoration area in the Idwal Hughes Reserve but watch out for poison ivy!)\n\nAccording to Dr David Wingate, the scale epidemic killed virtually every cedar in Walsingham and it was then that the simple-leaved jasmine vine became dominant, growing, like a mat over everything giving the area its other name of Tom Moore's Jungle.\n\nToday, you have to look quite hard to find simple-leaved jasmine. The biggest change there in Wingate's memory \"has been the gradual shading out of the jasmine by the spreading thickets of Surinam cherry, and a gradual increase in fiddlewood, allspice and Chinese fan palm, but the latter two are still uncommon there, relatively speaking, being more recent invaders. Only in the last 10 to 15 years have I noticed a new wave of change in the Walsingham flora and this is the aggressive invasion by Indian laurel and Australian umbrella tree which is going to make the canopy even taller and more deeply shaded. The former poses the gravest threat of all to the relic native flora there.\"\n\nSo, go for a walk through Tom Moore's Jungle. Really look at the plants there. See the Surinam Cherry forest, identify the fiddlewood trees, look for the Indian laurels growing as strangler figs (often in cedars), count the allspice trees and Chinese fan palms.\n\nMake memories and promise yourself or your companions to go back in a decade and then another decade to see what changes have occurred.\n\nBermuda's nature reserves change rapidly over"

      "text": "An Orchard Snapshot\n\nBy Bill Klein\n\nVirtually all fruit\ntrees including both tart and sweet cherry are grafted at a nursery and\ngrown into small trees before they are purchased by the orchardist. The\ngrafting and growing process at the nursery generally takes two seasons.\nIn year one, a small tree is planted in the nursery that has the desirable\ncharacteristics for a \"rootstock.\" This tree vigorously grows, then in\nAugust a bud from the variety of the fruit that is desired is attached\nnear the base of the \"rootstock tree\" through the process called \"budding.\"\nIn the spring of year two, the tree is cut off just above the bud. It is\nthis bud that grows very rapidly the second season into a small tree which\nis removed from the nursery and shipped to the orchardist.\n\nTrees in Nursery courtesy\nHilltop Nursery\n\nThe tree arrives from the\nnursery as a bare root tree with a minimal number of branches. This tree\nis then planted into a prepared orchard site in the early spring and will\ndevelop quite rapidly during the next 3-4 years. Cherry orchards are generally\nplanted at 110 - 135 trees/acre.\n\nPhoto Courtesy\nGillison's Variety Fabrication\n\nDuring the first several\nyears of the orchard, the trees must be well taken care of to provide optimum\nconditions for growth. Weed control, irrigation application, proper nutrition\n(fertilizers), training and pruning of the limbs as well as disease, insect,\nand deer control are all components which need to be carefully administered\nto maximize growth in the young orchard. We can expect to get the first\nfruit production from tart cherries the 5th year after planting.\n\n4 Year old Tart Cherry Orchard\nat the NW Michigan Horticultural Research Station\n\nOnce the trees are established,\nthey continue to need to be pruned. This pruning consists of proper limb\nplacement, thinning cuts as well as the removal of dead or diseased limbs.\nMuch of this pruning is done during the winter when the trees are dormant.\n\nWinter Orchard Pruning\n\nIntegrated Pest Management\n(IPM) practices are now commonly used by growers to help manage pests while\nutilizing less pesticides. This is accomplished by placing various traps\nin the orchard to monitor pest populations, scouting orchard for various\ninsect pests and predators, weeds and disease pests and monitoring weather\nand other environmental variables to make sure that these pest outbreaks\ndo not exceed the \"economic injury thresholds\" for the various pests.\n\nSpraying for insect and disease\nproblems is important not only for producing a quality fruit for the consumer,\nbut also for keeping the orchard healthy and able to produce crops in subsequent\nyears. Technology has enhanced the methods which we use to deliver fungicides\nand insecticides to the orchard. Most sprayers today utilize air to carry\nthe water and spray material to the tree. Tower sprayers, as seen in this\nphoto, are a new and very effective means of spraying orchards.\n\nModern cherry harvest is\ntypically done mechanically with a machine called a shaker. The cherry\nshaker became widely adopted by the cherry industry by the late l960's.\nPrior to that time, both tart and sweet cherries were hand picked. Trees\nthat took hours to harvest by hand can now be shaken at a rate of l-3 trees/minute.\nThis allows the fruit to be harvested at its prime. Once the fruit is harvested,\nit is placed in tanks of cold water and chilled for 4-8 hours on cooling\npads before being trucked to the processing plant.\n\nHead of Cherry Shaker\nwith Fruit falling onto Tarps\n\nCherry orchards have an average\neconomic life of 25-30 years. Many trees may live longer than the 25-30\nyears; however, fruit quality, disease problems and tree death can make\nthe orchard operation inefficient and costly. When this point in the orchard's\nlife comes, the trees are removed from the ground and the orchard site\nis prepared by working the soil, cover cropping and fertilizing for two\nto four years before another orchard is planted.\n\nOrchard Removal (Brush\nPiles)\n\nPlease send any comments or suggestions\nregarding this site to: Bill Klein, kleinw@msu.edu"

      "text": "Friday - November 02, 2007\n\nQUESTION:\n\nOur group is running out of fall workdays. Is it OK to plant native perennials and small trees in Central Texas during the winter months? Or should we wait now until the spring?\n\nANSWER:\n\nNovember, December and January have always been our favorite time to plants woody plants. If you already have them, then certainly the sooner you get them in the ground, the better. You don't want the roots to dry out, and you sure don't want them out of the ground when the first freeze comes. The ground is a great insulator, and will keep the new roots from being damaged. You should try very hard to avoid transplant shock-in other words, get water in the loose soil around the roots, at a small dribble from a hose, about 3 times a week. The average first frost in Austin is usually about December 1, but in this temperate region, the ground does not freeze, and frosts usually last only a few hours. While the plants are in dormancy during cooler weather, the moisture in the plant is down around the base and in the roots. A plant can be severely damaged or killed by a heavy, hard frost freezing the water in the plant. The cell walls can burst when the water expands as it freezes, and the damage can be fatal. Another protection for the newly planted trees and perennials is a good, thick coat of an organic mulch over their root systems. This will hold moisture in the soil, further insulate the roots, and as it decomposes, add still more warmth and help to enrich the soil.\n\nIf the plants are being held in plastic pots and a freeze is predicted, a friendly garage, if one is available, would be a good place to store them. Plastic is no insulator, and can get very cold and very hot, to match the outside temperature. And if you are holding plants in pots, be sure to keep them watered. Even in dormancy, some moisture is needed, and a plant without its roots in the earth is very susceptible to drying out.\n\nTo sum up, a plant waiting to be transplanted into a permanent position, and with its roots out of the ground, is better off being planted just about any time, but the best time is when it's cool and the plants are in dormancy.\n\nMore PlantingNeed information about planting Red Maples in Houston, TX.

      "text": "Introduction\n\nAustralian-Willow is an attractive evergreen, 30 to 35 feet tall and 20 feet wide, with an upright, oval silhouette. The main inner branches are composed of strong, wind-resistant wood and are directed upward, while the outer smaller branches are somewhat pendulous. This gives a decided weeping habit to older trees. Younger trees are more oval-shaped. This characteristic, combined with the thin, narrow, three to six-inch-long, olive green leaves which droop from the branches, gives the tree much the same effect as a Weeping Willow. Short panicles of small, creamy white, showy flowers appear in early spring and early fall.\n\nUse and Management\n\nAustralian-Willow casts a light shade and is ideal for use around a patio or as a lawn specimen, but may be too weeping for use as a street tree unless it is properly trained when it is young. If the lowest main limbs are located high enough above the ground and are oriented in an upright-spreading fashion, then there will be clearance even for large trunks. Only small branches may have to be removed later as they droop from the main limbs toward the ground. Otherwise the tree has very good cultural adaptability to urban spaces.\n\nAustralian-Willow will give best growth in full sun on moist but well-drained soil although plants can tolerate light shade and very dry conditions. Trees grown in the open very rarely require any pruning if located where the drooping branches will not interfere with traffic below. A popular tree for the dry southwest, not really known or planted in the East.\n\nPropagation is by seed.\n\nPests and Diseases\n\nNo pests or diseases are of major concern.

      "text": "Can I Pollard a Fruit Tree?\n\nCan I pollard prune fruit trees to keep them smaller and more maintainable for my patio?\n\nPollard pruning, when done correctly, is a great way to keep trees manageable, and in some cases keep them living longer lives. Pollard pruning has been done in Europe for ages on street trees, and it is predominantly used to maintain a certain size and shape of tree, or to create a yearly supply of firewood. Pollarding is a technique best used on hard wood trees, and fruit trees have soft wood, so it is not a good practice to start on them.\n\nFruit trees bloom and fruit from fresh growth each year, but they need strong branches beneath them to hold the weight of the fully formed fruit. They also depend on good air circulation between the boughs to keep diseases and fungus away from them, so the rapid weak growth of a pollard pruning is the direct opposite of what will give you your best crop of fruit.\n\nIf you have space issues on your patio I suggest making a trellis, or using of a fence or wall to train your fruit tree into an espalier form. Espalier forms give your tree the support and structure they need to be able to produce and physically support their own food, but take up much less room than the average tree. If you're working with a young fruit tree, start it young and gradually form it into a shape you like. The 2D espalier tree can fit almost anywhere!"

Rather, they are part of the normal appearance of these trees and may provide some protection for the thin, fragile bark.\n\nThe hackberry is a relative of the elm. It grows rapidly under a variety of conditions, eventually reaching 60-70 feet.\n\nThe hackberry provides food for a wide range of organisms. The dull red berries that appear in early fall are a favorite for birds and squirrels. They persist throughout the winter, providing food at a time when little else is available. If you look at the leaves on the tree during summer and autumn, you will see that they are chewed up. This is a good thing, as it means that the hackberry is furnishing food for a lot of insects. In particular, the Hackberry is a host plant for butterflies including the Hackberry Emperor and the Tawny Emperor.\n\nAn interesting insect that is frequently found on hackberries is the Nipple Gall Psyllid. The adult psyllids resemble tiny cicadas. They spend the winter as adults, then mate in the spring and lay their eggs on the leaves or stems of hackberry trees. After the eggs hatch, the baby insects begin to develop inside small swellings on the underside of the leaves or stems. These swellings, called galls, function as nurseries for the baby insects, protecting them from predators while providing them with food from the inside of the leaf. Nipple galls are extremely common on hackberries; they can even cause leaves to die, but seldom do any long-term damage to the tree.\n\nStimulating gall production is a very common strategy used by some species of insects to protect and feed their young. On another stop on this tour, we will see a very different kind of gall on the underside of leaves on the American Elm."

Cold snaps caused some damage to trees, but for the most part trees grew quickly and flowered early with the abundant rain and warm temperatures. Trees that usually bloom in June bloomed in May and now in June we are experiencing July or even August-type weather.\n\nThis June is on track to be the 2nd driest June in the last 20 years. To date, we have had 1.13\" of rain in June, which is well below the average of 4.12\" of rain. What effect does this have on our trees? Right now, leaf drop, wilted growth, early fall coloration and death of trees is happening throughout the City. With the early flush of growth and ideal growing conditions in May, many trees started to put out a second flush of growth in late May and early June. That extra growth spurt may be wasted energy however, as the trees now have a lack of water to support all that new growth.\n\nAnother issue we have seen in the last week are tree pits catching on fire. The virtues of mulching trees are extensive, however with the extreme heat and dry conditions, mulch has become tinder, just waiting for a flame, and many people ignorantly provide the spark through their discarded cigarette butts. Cigarette butts are the most ubiquitous litter: Sometimes Tree Tenders may pick several hundred from a tree pit adjacent to a red light or bus stop. In the past, the often still-smoldering butts never really harmed our trees. Now in just the past week alone, four tree pits caught fire and one tree died from the tree pit fire. One fire even required a Tree Pittsburgh employee to call 9-1-1 to have it put out! We are carefully monitoring the other trees to see if they survive.\n\nIn the end spring put us two steps ahead and now only in the first week of summer, we are two steps back. Please help by watering your tree, your neighbors trees and remind people that throwing the cigarette butts in tree pits is littering and dangerous!"

Its always interesting to see what's under the foil and how well the graft has calloused over (photo at right). A graft that has made strong top growth usually means you'll find a well knitted graft union.\n\nHere's a photo (at left) of a graft that didn't callous as well as the\none pictured above. Even though the graft was successful, the stock\ntree didn't provide enough energy to force the rapid expansion of the\nscion. Without fast scion growth, the quick covering over of the wound made by\ngrafting is impossible. Grafts made late in the grafting season tend\nto to grow slower (like the one in the photo) than grafts made as soon as the bark slips in the spring.\n\nIn contrast, a fast growing scion can nearly heal over a grafting wound in a single growing season (photo at right). Notice that callous tissue has formed all around the cut surface of the stock, leaving only a small circle of stump yet to cover. Here's a tree that will be producing nuts two years after grafting.\n\nWhen uncovering a graft, I often find a colony of ants tending their eggs in the warm, moist environment provided by that aluminum foil and plastic bag (photo at left). Ants usually don't interfere with callous formation, but they can enhance the decay of the stock stump. Once exposed to the sun, the ants will disappear.\nA technique for limiting ant nesting is to remove all wraps in August (in the year of grafting) and painting the graft union white. White latex house paint will protect the graft union from sun scald while eliminating the protected environment ants need for nesting.\nAs always, make sure to support all bark grafts with a sturdy stake until the grafting wound is completely covered by new wood growth."

Some conifers (e.g.\nDouglas fir) produce resin at the tree base when attacked by Armillaria.\nResin becomes evident when the fungus has moved up the roots to the\nroot collar. Decayed wood initially is gray to brown-stained and\nappears water soaked. As the disease advances, the decay is white to\nyellow in color and is stringy or spongy.\n\nLIFE\nCYCLE: The\ndisease spreads from a host tree or stump to uninfected live trees in\ntwo ways: root systems of the two trees come in contact and knit\ntogether, or fungal mycelium grow through the soil from infected to\nsusceptible tree roots. The fungus spreads along the root system of the\ntree penetrating its bark and entering the cambium. It then continues\nto spread along the root until it reaches the root collar where it\nspreads to other primary roots. Death occurs when the tree is girdled\nat the root collar, when bark beetles attack, or windthrow occurs. Armillaria\nsurvives as a saprophyte on dead roots and stumps for 20-30 years.\nContact with old roots can infect new trees."

Climate, lack of moisture or excessive soil moisture, low temperatures. There also is a genetic factor that may predispose cone production if any of those other factors may trigger it. This can also be affected to insect feeding on female flowers that will become cones. Perhaps there was less feeding this year then in previous years but I can't give you a precise reason for why more cones were produced. Just an interesting example is pinyon pine, which heavy cone production is valued because of the pinyon pine seeds that native American Indians would use for food. They would move to where there was good cone and seed production, because it was unpredictable."

Symptoms shown here are on knobcone x radiate.\n\nPhoto by Everett Hansen, 1987.\n\nPonderosa pine with typical symptoms.\n\nMelodie Putnam, 2006.\n\nCauseMycosphaerella pini (asexual: Dothistroma septospora). Formerly Scirrhia pini (asexual: Dothistroma pini). The red band disease has caused serious losses in some Christmas tree plantings of hard pine (two- and three-needle pines), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Austrian pine (P. nigra), and shore or lodgepole pine (P. contorta). Five-needle pines also are reported to be susceptible. The fungus attacks both current-season needles and needles produced in past seasons. Black, asexual fungal structures (stroma) mature 1 to 2 years after initial infection. Spores produced within the stroma are spread long distances by rain and wind to cause new infections. Usually by mid-August all spores have been disseminated. Spores germinate under moist conditions and penetrate stomata. A toxin, dothistromin, diffuses into the tissue ahead of the fungus, killing plant cells.\n\nSymptoms Chlorotic spots on infected needles in fall and winter. Spots gradually spread, turn red-brown, and girdle the needles, killing the distal end while the base stays green. In early spring, a black fungal growth (stromata) erupts through the needle epidermis. Affected trees may defoliate during the growing season, rendering the trees useless for sale. Reduced growth rate is another result of annual defoliation.\n\nCultural control\n\nAvoid using seed from susceptible (off-site) tree sources.\n\nPrune the lowest whorl of branches at first opportunity.\n\nFor high-value trees, remove and destroy fallen needles that collect in branch crotches and on the ground.Avoid planting in low-lying areas with poor air drainage.\n\nSpace plants for good air circulation.\n\nForest trees-thinning stands is helpful.\n\nControl weeds and vegetation around the bases of trees.\n\nShear trees during dry weather.\n\nChemical control Apply just before budbreak and again a few weeks later."

Nursery professionals are an excellent source of additional information.\n\nl Prune spring-flowering plants such as azaleas after they bloom. Summer-flowering plants like butterfly bush or crape myrtle should be pruned just before spring growth. Consult your garden center if you're uncertain.\n\nl Non-flowering ornamentals can be pruned in late winter, spring or summer. Pruning in fall or early winter may encourage tender new growth that cannot withstand cold.\n\nl On bulbs, cut faded blooms to stop seed formation. Cut back foliage only after it has died naturally.\n\nl Branches damaged by diseases, insects, winter or storms should be pruned back to the healthy green wood. Remove branches that grow inward, rub against other branches, are leggy, or those interfering with walkways or mowing.\n\nl Heading shortens plants and makes them more dense. Cut terminal portions of branch to a point directly above the bud.\n\nl Thin to improve sunlight penetration, shorten limbs or direct growth. Cut back entire limb or shoot to its origin at trunk or branch. Cut at branch collar, but leave collar intact.\n\nl Tip pinch to encourage thick foliage and new branching. Remove stem tip of new growth with thumb and forefinger.\n\nl Renewal pruning brings abundant new growth. Plants such as spirea will benefit from a few of the oldest canes being cut back to 6 to 12 inches above ground.\n\nl Shearing promotes lush new growth. Use hand shears on stems to create a uniform surface.\n\nTom Dominguez is an agent with the Quay County Extension, NMSU Extension Service.

      "text": "Gardening Pruning Primer: What and When to Prune\n\nKnowing what and when to prune is essential to maintaining a healthy and aesthetically pleasing garden. Here are some general guidelines on what to prune and when to prune it.\n\nWhen to Prune\n\nFruit Trees: Fruit trees should always be pruned before buds start to swell, so usually in late winter or early spring. To maintain shape and encourage air circulation within the canopy, remove any branches growing inward or those growing vertically.\n\nEvergreen Trees: Evergreen trees seldom need pruning. If you prune, wait until after the tree has completed substantial new growth, or you may end up having to prune it again-usually late spring or early summer.\n\nDeciduous Trees: Deciduous trees also seldom need pruning. If pruning is needed to maintain shape, it should be done in mid to late winter while the tree is dormant.\n\nBerry Bushes: Berry bushes are usually best pruned in late fall or early winter. Regular pruning to maintain shape can be done throughout the season, but is best done immediately after harvesting to minimize production loss.\n\nEvergreen Shrubs: Evergreen shrubs don't flower, but some produce cones. Typically, it's best to prune evergreen shrubs between late winter and early spring-after they produce cones.\n\nDeciduous Shrubs: Let the flowers guide you. It's best to prune shrubs back immediately after they flower (usually late spring or summer).\n\nRosebushes: Older shoots and those turned inward should be pruned by late winter-early spring at the latest. Cut remaining 4 to 8 canes to a length of 12 to 24 inches. Ideally, cuts should be made within an inch above a bud or strong shoot.\n\nDistinguishing Between Plant Types\n\nFruit Bearing: for pruning purposes, defined as any tree or shrub that bears fruit.\n\nDeciduous: any perennial plant, tree, or shrub that loses all of its foliage for part of the year.\n\nEvergreen: any tree, shrub, or plant that bears foliage throughout the year.\n\nTypes of Pruning\n\nMaintenance Pruning: Regular maintenance pruning is usually done annually in order to maintain the general shape and hygiene of plant.\n\nFormative Pruning: Formative pruning is a technique usually reserved for young plants, plants that have outgrown their space, or for plants remaining after another plant in close proximity has been removed (to prevent growth from looking lopsided). Essentially, it's pruning to train or correct shape.\n\nPruning for Rejuvenation: Occasionally, it's necessary to prune old shrubs to renew their vigor. Some shrubs responds well to hard pruning, while others are better rejuvenated over a period of 2 to 3 years. If your shrub has not been pruned regularly, go slowly and space pruning over several seasons. Select no more than 1/4 to 1/3 of the oldest wood in a single season. After pruning, feed plants and keep soil moist and well mulched. Generally, plants that grow more than 12 inches in a season usually respond well to hard pruning. Plants that grow more slowly (less than 12 inches per year) should be pruned more gently and only when necessary.\n\nPruning for Pests and Disease: Just like it sounds, this type of pruning is done in response to the outbreak of disease or pests.\n\nShrubs That Respond Well to Hard Pruning\n\nButterfly Bush (Buddleia)\n\nBlue Spirea (Caryopteris)\n\nCommon Smoketree (Continus coggygria)\n\nDeutzia\n\nEucalyptus\n\nForsythia\n\nFuchsias\n\nHydrangeas (some)\n\nMock-orange (Phiadelphus)\n\nRed Stem Dogwood (Cornus stolonifera)\n\nRoses (some)\n\nRubus (some)\n\nSt. Johnís Worts (Hypericums)\n\nTatarian Dogwood (Cornus alba)\n\nWillows (some)\n\nShrubs Better to Prune Lightly*\n\nAucuba japonica and cultivars\n\nBarbarry (Berberis)\n\nBoxwood (Buxus sempervirens)\n\nCotoneasters\n\nDaphnes\n\nMagnolias\n\nPotentilla fructose cultivars\n\nPrunus (plums, cherries, peaches, apricots, and almonds)\n\nRhodoendrons\n\nViburnums\n\nYew (Taxus baccata)\n\n*These can be pruned hard, but often take years to recover.\n\nPruning Tips\n\nThink before you prune. Each cut should enhance the overall shape of the tree or bush. This means cutting just above an outward-pointing bud so that new shoots do not emerge pointed inward where they will slow down air circulation and receive less light. Shrubs with buds opposite each other (rather than staggered) should be pruned level as close to the buds as possible.\n\nAlways use top-quality pruning shears with sharp blades and sturdy handles. Dull blades will crush or tear branches. Look for shears with parts that are easy to remove and sharpen. Hand shears should feature a safety mechanism that keeps blades safely closed when not in use.\n\nBe prepared for some losses. If new growth fails to emerge on a plant a month or two after pruning (except when pruned in the winter), it may have a weak root system and or disease problems, and may never come back. Consider shopping for a replacement.\n\nWhen pruning trees, leave the branch collar intact when removing limbs. The branch collar is the swollen area at the base of the branch, the point where one branch arises from another (or the trunk). This area is like a security door. It stores important protective chemicals that keep diseases from invading the parent limb. Leaving this intact when removing limbs will help promote faster healing.\n\nWhen concerned about the hardiness of a plant, it's best to wait until the end of winter to prune it. Intact branches will trap air over winter, creating a microclimate to help protect the plant may have missed this but all spring flowering trees, as well as shrubs (which were mentioned) should be pruned right after the flowers fade or not at all. This includes Azaleas, Camellias, and others. Something that drives me crazy is crepe murder. It's utter foolishness to cut back a 30 foot tree to make it a shrub and those knuckles are hideous. If you want a small tree, buy one. Topping any tree isn't going to cause it to produce more flowers, but will certainly cause sucker growth, and shorten the life of the tree.\n\nBy\n10/27/2008\n\nJust wanted to say thanks for the useful information! I have always been confused and intimidated by pruning, and your articles explain the process so clearly and simply!"

It keeps a garden looking tidy and does redirect the energy used to make seeds go back to the plant increasing the plant's vigor. However, if you let them go and do not \"dead - head\", (cut the seed head), you provide food for wildlife. An added bonus is you also create interesting shapes and forms by leaving them in the winter garden.\n\nPhoto of Dried\nSunflowers\nCourtesy of Pete Jayne\n\nAn excellent plant not to deadhead is Coreopsis. Goldfinches, which are year-round residents of Maryland, will constantly return to eat these flower seeds. Birds such as the Carolina Wren will also find nesting materials in the dried stalks.\n\nThree other species to leave through the winter are Coneflower (Echinacea), Black - eyed Susan (Rudbeckia), and Asters.\n\nIf you are a grower of annuals, try leaving Cosmos, and Sunflowers, both large and small\nvarieties. An amazing number of winter birds will visit those seed heads.\n\nIf you decide you cannot let your\ngarden go totally weedy all winter, you can try deadheading half of a\nfloral planting and letting the other half remain. Remember, you can\nalways \"clean-up\" the garden after the seeds are consumed. Try leaving the\nseed heads of flowers in the back rows of plantings. Leave those that are\nclosest to winter cover to provide protection from predators as the birds\nfeed on the seeds.\n\nOctober-December: Now that nesting season is over it is time for you to inspect the nest structures that you have on your\nWild Acre site. Provide a hinged side or roof so the nest box can be\neasily checked and cleaned each year.\n\nJanuary:Repairs and inspections of squirrel and owl boxes should be done by January, as they are early nesters.\n\nFebruary:Kestrel boxes should be inspected\nand installed by the start of February, as these birds-of-prey are one of\nthe first migrants to return from their wintering grounds.\n\nMarch:You should finish your inspections and repairs by the first week in\nMarch for most songbird boxes.\n\nHelpful Tips\n\nDuck and owl box roofs kept shut\nwith a hook or eye can be opened by a raccoon. Instead use several paired\nroofing nails with large heads on the side of the roof and on the upper\nedge of the side. Wire these paired nails together.\n\nNest boxes need drainage from the\nrains. Four 3/8\" diameter drain holes should be drilled in the bottom of\nevery house, except for the Peterson bluebird house.\n\nBoxes need to be attached to a\npost, building or tree. When you put a nest box on a live tree, use lag\nbolts and washers. Unscrew them every spring to allow the tree to grow.\n\nCommercial martin houses are\nacceptable as are commercial plastic wood duck boxes. You should place the\nwood duck boxes in shady locations.\n\nWood boards ¾\" thick are the\neasiest to work with when repairing or replacing nest boxes. Cedar is the\nall-around best choice. Softwood such as pine is ok for small boxes.\n\nSmall mammals such as mice may\ntake housekeeping in your bird boxes. You should remove their nests (otherwise plan to put up additional boxes to house the birds and the\nrodents). Or, when the nesting season is over, open the front or side of a\nsongbird house and leave it that way until spring.\n\nIf bees or wasps have taken over a\nnest box, remove the nest and spray the inside of the box with a\ndisinfectant.\n\nVERY\nIMPORTANT ADVICE:\n\nDo Notplace bluebird houses on trees.\nCats and raccoons can easily climb into the box from a tree.\n\nDo Not\nput perches on any\nbirdhouses. The only birds that perches invite are house sparrows and\nEuropean starlings. Remove any perches from boxes.\n\nDo Not\nuse cans, milk cartons\nor metal for nests. They do not provide enough insulation.\n\nDo Notuse sawdust for the\nbottom of a nest box. It packs down when wet and holds moisture. Instead\nuse wood shavings or chain saw wood chips. They allow for better drainage.\n\nDo Notuse wood treated with\ngreen preservative. When this is exposed to water it can produce poisonous\nvapors.\n\nIf you follow these general\ninstructions, you should have successful nesting for the coming year.\n\nMaryland\nCooperative Extension offers home and garden information, tips\npublications, plant problems, Bay issues, and other links at \nTheir Home and Garden Information number is statewide and can be\nreached at 1-800-342-2507, and from outside Maryland at\n1 pleased to have you visit.\nWe are anxious to make this site as user-friendly as possible.

      "text": "Contact\n\nOffice Hours\n\nThe Wrong Way to Mulch Trees\n\nPosted: February 8, 2012\n\nFor the past ten years many professional landscapers have been incorrectly mounding up soil and heavy layers of mulch around the base of deciduous and evergreen trees. According to Edward Flory, Penn State Extension Horticultural Assistant, this practice seems to be catching on with more landscapers but it is a practice that is a waste of money and harmful to the tree. Landscapers should know better since the tree trunk should always be above ground to where the root flares out at the soil line. Soil or mulch around the trunk encourages rodents and disease damage that can kill the tree. Also roots need to breathe and heavy mulch inhibits oxygen from getting to the roots.\n\nHow should the tree be properly mulched?\n\nKeep mulch and dirt at least 3-4 inches away from the tree trunk.\n\nMulch out to the tree's drip line which is where the furthest branches from the tree end.\n\nFine-textured mulch should not be more than 2 inches deep and coarse-textured mulch should not be more than 4 inches deep.\n\nIf putting on new mulch always fluff up the mulch layer before adding new mulch. The entire mulch layer should not exceed 2-4 inches.\n\nBy following these simple practices you will continue to have happy and healthy trees.\n\nFor more information or for horticultural information, Contact Ed Flory at Penn State Extension, 570-421-6430."

Selecting the right species and high-quality nursery stock based on planting site characteristics, available care after planting, transplant size, root ball characteristics and nursery production practices is essential to successful transplanting. The rewards for attention to these details will be realized as the transplanted tree matures and increases its importance to your property.\n\nTrees experience tremendous stress in the transplanting process, primarily from adverse changes in their ability to absorb water due to root loss. Water stress is the primary cause of transplant failure. Root loss affects hormone synthesis and distribution that regulate shoot growth. Root loss also reduces carbohydrate storage, affecting energy available for rapid root regeneration, critical for transplant survival. The ability of a tree to maintain sufficient vigor while recovering from the adversities of transplanting will determine its success or failure.\n\nTrees have traditionally been offered for sale in the nursery trade using three methods: bare-root, balled and burlapped (B&B), and containers including pot-in-pot and in-ground fabric containers."

My moccasin-clad feet carried me over a good square mile of terrain and I learned a lot about nature and plants just from being outside and observing. Norbert, the neighbor down the road, also taught me a lot about gardening and plants. Then there was the National Junior Horticultural Association where I competed in state and local competitions, earning awards for my plant knowledge. The love of plants is still going strong and the fact that I know a thing or two about how plants grow also helps to keep the landscaping costs down just a smidge.\n\nWillows are an interesting family of trees. The Native Americans, and other numerous ancient cultures, used the leaves and bark of willows for medicinal purposes. Salicin, the basis for aspirin, comes from willow. Willows also root readily from cuttings – you can just stick them in the ground where you want them to grow or put them in a glass of water, the roots will begin growing very quickly. Because they root so quickly they are perfect for erosion control along waterways. The subject of today's image ended up in our yard the way quite a few plants have ended up in my yard: collecting. One day, years ago, I spotted a specimen of Salix matsudana and Mr. Muse and I really liked how it looked, so a six inch piece of that tree just happened to make it's way to our house. Years later, that six inch piece is nearly six feet tall.\n\nYesterday we had a warm front move through the area and the morning's temperatures quickly rose to 50 degrees.

They're almost sitting on the ground. Should I stake them up so they're not laying on the ground or is it OK to leave them?\n\nPhoto: Kathleen Collins The good news is there is no need to stake your berries. Instead, apply a layer of straw so that they do not touch the soil. The straw will also keep the strawberries clean. However, the bad news is, since this is a new strawberry patch, experts recommend you remove all blossoms and fruit the initial year to allow the plants to first establish themselves in the soil before harvesting fruit in subsequent years.\n\nFor in-depth information about cultivating strawberries, consult The Ohio State University (OSU) Extension Fact Sheet HYG-1424-98, \"Strawberries Are an Excellent Fruit for the Home Garden\" (\n\nQ: This disease is on a lot of my trees and I do not know what it is. I have tried a lot of sprays but nothing works. Do you know what it is and how can I stop it?\n\nA: How lucky you are to have such a fine crop of lichens growing on your tree trunks. Lichen growth is actually an indicator of a healthy environment. Please do not use any chemical sprays or otherwise try to destroy this growth.\n\nQ: I remember in a past column or story you wrote about how to keep mums from falling over in the fall when it rains. Last fall, my mums were so big they fell over and looked terrible. How can I prevent that from happening this year? I have some mum plants that are already 6 inches high, and at this rate, they'll be very high by fall. What should I do to prevent them from toppling over this fall?\n\nA: A timely question indeed. I just finished the first pinching of my mums to half length. In another four weeks, I will pinch out about another third of new growth, and again, in late June and no later than July 4, I will do the final pinching of another third. This practice will encourage the mum plants to branch out and form a tidy compact bush less likely to topple over in full bloom.\n\nShown is the distressed burning bush mentioned in one of the \"Ask Dayle\" questions.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Harley Bossenbroek\n\nQ: I have several groups of burning bushes that I use for a hedge. They are mature and reach heights of 10 to 12 feet. A couple of years ago, one of the bushes came out fine in the spring but then started looking sparse as the summer progressed. I took samples of the bush to three different garden centers and was told three different things. I tried all of their recommendations, but the bush died and did not come back the next year. The bushes next to it remained fine, and I replaced it, but this year it appears that another bush is having the same symptoms. Can you determine what I can do to keep it from the same fate?\n\nA: There is a term applied to shrubs and trees called \"service life.\" Service life refers generally to that period of time when the plant is in a healthy, vibrant state, producing new growth, its presence complementing the surrounding landscape. Eventually, the plant will surpass its service life and begin a decline. Your photos do not show active disease, per se, although I do see one trunk that has expired. It may be that your mature burning bushes are beginning to succumb naturally to a spent life. Maybe, maybe not. No plant lives forever and no plant lives in constant health during that lifetime.\n\nA few additional observations with regard to your photos: I don't see evidence of routine pruning and shaping on the tall shrub. The interior appears quite shaded. Even shrubs grown as a tall privacy hedge must be regularly pruned to allow light to enter the middle branches, which encourages foliage growth. No pruning for light penetration equals sparse foliage, especially if the plant is planted in a spot that has more shade than sun. Over time, insufficient foliage will render the plant unable to sustain itself through photosynthesis, which is the process in which plants produce their own food. Inadequate photosynthesis will result in the untimely decline and death of the plant.\n\nQ: I was looking at my hydrangea in front of the house, next to the porch. It looks like the stems are kind of brown and I don't know if that is normal or not. It did start to get green buds. However, some of the buds have shriveled and brown leaves are at the tips. It is about 3 years old. Is there something special I should do?\n\nA: The stems that grew last year on your hydrangea will indeed appear brown this year. The green buds of foliage that sprouted from these brown stems and then shriveled with brown tips sounds like frost damage resulting from our unusual weather patterns this spring. Hydrangea blooms on last year's wood, so it is possible the frost killed the still unseen flower buds. However, do not trim back the plant. Allow it to leaf out and hope for the best in flower production.\n\nFor more horticultural information or to request fact sheets, call The OSU Summit County Extension hotline Tuesdays from 9 a.m. to noon at 330-928-4769, ext. 3, or visit online  to print out relevant fact sheets, as well as about the OSU Master Gardener program.

      "text": "rate this answer\n\nFriday - June 06, 2008\n\nQUESTION:\n\nI recently planted two types of Banana trees, a Darjeeling and a Giant Nepal. I know that both are hardy to my zone 7 but that the Nepal needed heavy mulching. My first question is how long will it take my seeds to sprout, what is their growth rate and what do I do in the winter? I want to keep them in the ground year round. Also, I have clay soil; is that good or do I need to increase the drainage?\n\nANSWER:\n\nThe banana tree, Genus Musa, is native to tropical regions of southeast Asia and Australia. They are not actually trees, but fast-growing, herbaceous perennials arising from underground rhizomes. They are now cultivated throughout the tropics. We don't know how to tell you this, but Gladstone, Virginia is not tropical. Not even sub-tropical. Also, this plant is WAY non-native to North America. The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center's work and research all has to do with plants native to North America. We encourage the use of native plants because they are already adapted to where they are growing, and thus will require less water, fertilizer and maintenance to do well. Obviously, we have no information on this in our Native Plant Database, and certainly no personal experience with growing this plant. But, we will try to find some websites that might answer the questions you have. Note: All banana leaves, even of the most cold hardy species, will be damaged by frost and killed outright by a hard freeze. But many underground rhizomes are much cold hardier than people realize. This means that that the underground root will sprout new growth in the Spring.\n\nIn our search for answers for you, we learned that the cultivar Darjeeling Banana tree is Musa sikkimensis, and the Giant Nepal is not really considered a true banana, the Latin name being Ensete glaucum.\n\nFrost Protection: Bananas flourish best under uniformly warm conditions but can survive 28 deg. for short periods. If the temperature does not fall below 22 deg and the cold period is short, the underground rhizome will usually survive. To keep the plants that are above ground producing, protection against low temperatures is very important. Wrap trunk or cover with blanket if the plants are small and low temperatures are predicted. We checked on the weather conditions in Nelson County, Virginia, learned that it was in the central part of Virginia, midway between Charlottesville and Lynchburg. The climate in summer has temperatures averaging about 77 deg in July. The temperature in January averages 38 deg. It appears to be in Zone 6b (average minimum temperature 0 to -5 deg) to 7a (5 to 0 deg). It will have to be your decision whether to risk the expense and trouble of preserving a tropical under those conditions. We also understood that you are planting or have planted seeds for these plants. One of the posts on the forum we directed you to says that the seeds are very difficult to propagate. We also saw a suggestion that if you really wanted these plants in your garden that you buy a fresh young shoot every Spring and trash it when it freezes in the Fall. Since they grow so fast, you shouldn't have to wait long for results from that.\n\nMore Non-Natives QuestionsMowing wildflower concerns from Lockhart TX March 30, 2012 - I went to the Texas Highway Department (Texas Department of Transportation) web site and sent them a concern or complaint about them or independent contractors shredding the roadsides before the blueb"

      "text": "New Zealanders adopt dwarfing rootstocks\n\nApple growers hope to revitalize their industry with new varieties and intensive plantings.\n\nGeraldine Warner\n\nGood times led to complacency, says Craig Hornblow.\n\nIn the last few years, New Zealand apple growers have been planting trees on the dwarfing Malling 9 rootstock in an effort to improve the efficiency of their orchards.\n\nTraditionally, New Zealand orchardists have used the larger Malling 106 or M.793 rootstocks, which are resistant to woolly apple aphid. A typical Braeburn planting in the past had trees spaced 3 meters (10 feet) apart with 5 meters (16-1/2 feet) between rows.\n\nCraig Hornblow, a consultant with AgFirst in Nelson, New Zealand, said that about 90 percent of recent plantings in the Nelson area have been on the M.9 rootstock and the rest on new rootstocks from New York's fireblight-resistant Cornell-Geneva series.\n\n\"We were very slow picking up on the M.9 trend,\" Hornblow said. \"We didn't start planting M.9 on a large scale until six years ago.\n\n\"The enemy of great is good,\" he added. \"We had a good time in the 1990s with Royal Gala and Braeburn. We could not do anything wrong with M.l06. There was no real reason to strive and get more efficient and get better.\"\n\nBut times have changed. Although yields are high in New Zealand's conditions, growers are having difficulty growing large fruit on old Royal Gala trees and are struggling to get good returns on Braeburn from Europe. \"That really was our catalyst to change,\" he said.\n\nGrowers learned how orchardists in other parts of the world, such as the South Tyrol area of northern Italy, revitalized their industries with more intensive plantings.\n\nSunniest place\n\nApple production in the Nelson area has declined over the past few years by about 20 percent from a peak of 6 million boxes annually, but it is still the South Island's major apple-producing region, producing about 30 percent of the national crop. About 65 percent of New Zealand's 17-million-box crop is produced in the Hawkes Bay area on the North Island.\n\nThe Nelson area, situated at 42°S on the north coast of the South Island, has a temperate climate. Summer temperatures are generally between 18 and 20°C (64 and 68ºF) and rarely exceed 30°C (86ºF). Though it boasts that it is the sunniest place in New Zealand, it receives almost 1,000 millimeters (40 inches) of rain annually. It has heavy soils with good water-holding capacity.\n\nHornblow said the Nelson area's first commercial orchards were planted at Motueka in the late nineteenth century, and commercial apple production began in about 1910 when syndicates were formed to buy large tracts of land. These tracts were divided up into small blocks that were offered to people who wanted to start growing apples to export to the United Kingdom, \"the Mother Country,\" as Tasmanian orchardists were already doing.\n\nBy 1937, the region was producing a million cartons annually. In the 1980s, tobacco was the main crop around Motueka, but a number of farmers switched to kiwi or apples.\n\nVarieties\n\nGala and Braeburn make up more than 75 percent of the district's production, but are declining in importance, along with Cox. Some Fuji is being grown, though growers struggle to get good finish.\n\nAlthough the district grows the majority of New Zealand's Jazz, that's only about 333,000 boxes so far, Hornblow said. \"Even though there's a lot of talk, it's only a little profit to the region.\"\n\nThere have been recent plantings of Delbush (marketed as Tentation), which is a managed variety from France. \"What we're looking at is an integrated approach to new varieties, with someone to take it to the consumer,\" Hornblow added"

You stick them in your pocket so you can ponder them later and share them with the important people in your life.\n\nI didn't know if it was a plant thing (seed pod? fruit?) or an insect thing (eggs? larvae?) or a disease thing (gall?). I'm still not sure.\n\nThis closeup of the surface where the \"stem\" is attached sure makes it look like it's vegetable rather than animal. This thing is not very big. It's 1.5 inches in diameter. But maybe it's an immature weird thing.\n\nHere is where the \"stem\" is attached to the twig. I'm not sure if the stem grows in multiple fibers like this, or if the bark has been shed from the stem, revealing an interior structure that would normally be enclosed.\n\nActually that seed pod is from a Sycamore tree. They form like regular seed pods do and if you break it open theres tons of tiny seeds in there with a sort of fluffy hair like tips so they can travel on the wind.\n\nSycamore trees lined the playground at my elementary school. When these seed-pods get real dry and start to loosen up, all those little spikes come out. Kids would throw those and they'd explode - sort of.

Wrap the root ball of a balled tree in plastic or place in a tub\nwhile it is in the house.\n\nLive trees may be decorated, but with care. If lights are used, they must not\ngive off any heat.\n\nDo not remove the tree directly from a warm house out into freezing temperatures.\nInstead, move to a sheltered area first for several days.

      "text": "Tips For Planting Trees From A Wholesale Tree Farm\n\nPurchasing trees from your wholesale tree farm has a science and technique to keeping the trees strong and healthy until they reach maturity. Some of the techniques to be aware of include:\n\nHow much mulch to use\n\nProper watering\n\nHow often you should prune\n\nHow Much Mulch to Use\n\nWhen planting trees, it is important to use mulch. A lot of individuals skip this step because of the extra cost and time that it takes, but it is so important. Most trees are planted in the fall or spring. By using mulch you can help protect the roots from the cold winter months, or from the hot summer months. The mulch also soaks up the water well keeping the ground moist and perfect for the trees. The roots can easily become dry in the winter and summer, and the mulch helps keep them wet and moist.\n\nProper Watering\n\nWhen watering your tree, you should keep the ground moist and not soaked. If your tree is swimming in water, that is too much. Having the mulch around the roots can help you prevent over watering your tree. Also, when planting your new wholesale tree farm purchase, you should water the trees immediately and should not delay this step. This will help the tree adapt to its new home without any issues.\n\nHow Often You Should Prune\n\nThe worst time to prune your trees and a time that is not recommended at all is the fall. The reason for this is because the trees seem to grow slower in the fall and having an open wound on your trees from the pruned branch can cause decay to spread faster. It is wise to prune your tree in the early spring so that the dead branches from winter can be removed and stimulate new growth. It is also okay to prune dead branches occasionally when they appear during any of the seasons except for fall.\n\nBy following these simple, but very important tips, you'll be taking care of your investment in your landscaping and help ensure that your new trees start out on the right foot and begin to grow strong and healthy. Your wholesale tree farm may also have various guidelines and tips for planting their specific trees, so be sure to head all the counsel that they provide. Most tree farms with know their specific species of trees very well and can truly be a wealth of knowledge on how to keep your trees healthy and beautiful for years to come."

      "text": "Brush Killer\n\nAre there any brush killers that are safe to use around mature trees. We have some large pines with very overgrown undergrowth. I would just go in and start cutting but there is also some poison ivy. I looked at Bonide brush killer and it seems to indicate it would work. I would also like to use it around the perimeter of our yard where the growth has taken over.\n\nRoundup will kill almost everything that it comes in contact with, so if you spray the undergrowth and don't get any on the needles of the pines you will be OK.\n\nDepending how much you need to spray, you can purchase a gallon of the equivalent called \"Pronto big and tough\" 41% solution from tractor supply for about $25. Roundup will cost 5x that. Use it in a 2% solution (2.5 oz to a gallon ) so a gallon goes a long way. It will kill the weeds and anything else green. For grass it takes about 7-9 days for results. Really tough stuff like American Barberry takes about 3 weeks to show the results.\n\nI am in the middle of a mission to spray and kill invasive Barberry in my 30 acre wood lot so am quite familiar with this material.\n\nDo not use anything like 2,4-D as that will get into the soil and possibly harm the pines. -- The difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits.\n\nI'd try 2,4-d first and see if that kills most of the stuff. That won't hurt the grass or trees but should kill most of the other stuff. It won't kill the poison ivy but if you can kill everything else then you can come back later with some Roundup aka glyphosate in a dish and use a paintbrush to apply the glyphosate to the poison ivy to be safe. Any chemicals can get into the soil but 2,4-d and glyphosate are both classified as non-persistent to slightly persistent. 2,4-d is a broad-leaf killer so it's selective while glyphosate will kill anything it touches. Glyphosate shouldn't hurt the tree as long as you don't get any on the leaves but that's a call you'll have to make.\n\nAs you can see I have a pretty extensive collection of weed killer products directly from the farm supply store.\n\nMy next-door neighbor is going south of the border, so we'll probably go splits on the 2.5gal and also get some weed-and-feed that's been banned from our stores by dem damn treahuggers dustwvl I've had good luck with Round Up. For small weeds and grasses a single spray will due, for larger stuff you'll need to do multiple treatments. Round Up works through the plant's leaves, so it's best to spray on the leaves (top and underside) and avoid the soil where practical.\n\nI used it on some very aggressive ivy, it took several days of spraying to start to kill it off, and then I ended up just yanking a lot of it down followed by pulling it's stump out with my SUV at the time (this ivy had grown so large and so enormous that it had a trunk the diameter of a small tree (at least 6\" around).\n\nKeep in mind that if you have poison ivy, the stuff that is 'poison' will remain even after the plant is dead... so exercise caution pulling out the dead stuff.\n\nWhat I recently did in my yard was to say eff it and buy several yards of mulch, I put a 3-4\" barrier of mulch down, first off it's black, so in the sun it gets HOT, second, most weeds will not grow through that much mulch... so if you can rent a brush cutter to get it all down to the 1-2\" level you might consider just covering it w/ mulch.\n\nThanks everyone. I have been out of town and I am just getting back in the swing of things. Thanks for all the help.\n\nJust a note: Roundup is effective. I think its patent on glyphosate expired back in 2000, so there are a few generic products like the one I posted the link for (Compare-N-Save 2.5 gal. Grass And Weed Killer) and Pronto that are based on the same active ingredient, just cost a heck of a lot less.\n\nThey literally were giving it away last year... I got a gallon of round up with a remote pump/sprayer with purchase of something, I think a 40lb bag of grass seed or something...\n\nI read something about adding some dish soap to the mix to help it stick to the plants especially ones with a waxy coating. Any opinions on this?\n\nYou want a nonionic agent. Some dish soaps are OK but Jet Dry actually states it is non-ionic on the label. Typical rate is 0.5% or just over 1/2oz per Gallon. -- The difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits."

      "text": "Features\n\nThe danger of trees\n\nTrees in a garden can be attractive and also provide other benefits including the comfort of shade. Problems arise if a landowner allows the trees to encroach from his land onto the property of a neighbour. To permit such encroachment amounts to a nuisance.\n\nIf, for example, roots are allowed to invade the neighbouring land, causing damage to property, the neighbour will have a potential right of action.\n\nDamage can be caused by the roots taking water out of the soil, particularly where the root system is beneath the foundations of any building. This is a natural process. In warmer weather evaporation causes moisture loss and, naturally, the tree replenishes the water through its roots. In the absence of rain, soil can then become dehydrated and, in the case of clay, the soil will shrink. The clay will then swell when the rain comes in winter. These movements in turn may cause movement and damage in buildings and structures.\n\nCases\n\nIn the 2001 case of Delaware Mansions v Westminster City Council, the House of Lords gave guidance on the law relating to a claim for damage by encroaching trees. They formulated the following test:\n\na) What is the duty between neighbours with regard to trees?\n\nTo support a claim for damages it has to be shown that the damage was caused by the encroachment and that the owner breached the duty of care owed to their neighbour. In this context, a private nuisance may be caused by a landowner doing something that is lawful but his conduct is not confined to his own land but extends to the neighbour's land by encroachment, causing physical damage to land or buildings or vegetation or unduly interfering with the neighbour's comfortable and convenient enjoyment of their land. Where the nuisance is not caused by a deliberate act, the duty does not arise unless and until the landowner has, or ought to have had, knowledge of the defect and the danger created.\n\nIn the 2011 case of Berent v Family Mosaic Housing and London Borough of Hillingdon, the Court of Appeal applied the decision of the lower court and said that the general law of negligence and nuisance applies to tree root cases. They are not special.\n\nDepending on the circumstances, it may be reasonable to take no action if the risks are unlikely to result in danger. The test is whether the defendant should have foreseen reasonably a real risk of danger. That is a risk for which they should have considered taking reasonable avoiding or minimising steps. It is necessary to consider the degree of risk and likely damage.\n\nb) Did the tree roots cause damage?\n\nc) Was the harm reasonably foreseeable?\n\nd) Were there any practical measures that could have been taken to minimise or avoid damage?\n\ne) Was there a reasonable response to the damage?\n\nRemedies\n\nNuisance is an actionable tort. The person suffering the damage (claimant) can institute civil proceedings against their defendant neighbour asking for either or both:\n\ni) Injunctive relief to abate the nuisance and prevent recurrence.\n\nii) Damages for compensation for loss.\n\nChecklists\n\na) The person damaged (claimant) should check the following matters:\n\n• The claimant needs to establish who is responsible for tree maintenance, which may be, for example, the neighbour or highway authority.\n\n• If your property is near trees, you should check routinely to see whether any damage is being caused or may be caused to your property.\n\n• If there is damage actual or potential, you should notify the owner of the trees immediately. This will give the tree owner a maximum amount of time to deal with the issue.\n\n• If, following professional advice, it appears that underpinning work may be required, this should be raised as early as possible.\n\nb) Tree owners should check and be aware of the following:\n\n• They should regularly survey their trees and check whether damage is being caused or is likely to be caused to neighbours' properties. The tree owner will be liable if he or she ought reasonably to have known of the damage being caused\n\n• Be prepared to manage trees properly and to make any possible damage less likely or minimise any potential harm.\n\nRemember that you must show that damage was reasonably foreseeable and that there were reasonable steps that the defendant could have taken to eliminate or minimise risk. This must also have regard to the social utility of the existence of the trees.\n\nIf any of the matters in this brief synopsis are of interest or may be affecting you, please contact Michael Hartley, Peter Miller or John Campbell."

      "text": "Why do some flowering crabapple trees lose most of their leaves by midsummer?\n\nIn spring, leaves of flowering crabapples develop scab disease, caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis. This is a common fungal disease on susceptible varieties of crabapple and is especially active during wet spring weather. When leaves become infected with scab, they develop olive-green to black spots on the leaf. Infected leaves often turn yellow and drop from the tree, resulting in premature defoliation.\n\nAlthough fungicides are available to prevent scab disease, frequent, timely applications are needed. Raking and removing fallen leaves helps to reduce infection the following spring. The best defense is to plant a crabapple cultivar resistant to scab.

Cambium Layer - The green growth layer just next to the bark.\n\nBud Union After grafting the buds on fruit trees, the nodes will appear swollen. This is the bud union.\n\nThe bud union will look like a dark knob, at or just below the soil line. It's not uncommon for roseplants to be grafted onto hardier root stocks. This helps the rose survive in colder climates, but it can also lead to a problem with suckers.\n\nIn Australia, the bud union or graft should be 4 cm to 5 cm above the surface of the soil. Rose Disease ...\n\nThere will be a bump on the trunk called the bud union. You want the bump to be about two inches above the soil surface. This bump or bud union is where the scion, or top portion of the tree, was grafted onto the rootstock.\n\nWhen plantinggrafted roses in cold zones, be sure to set the bud union five to 10 centimetres below the surface of the soil. Be prepared to water weekly and more often during dry spells, wetting the soil to a depth of at least 45 centimetres.\n\nDo not allow the wrapping to constrict the bud union. About 10 days after budding, check the buds and release the wrapping by making a single vertical cut on the backside of the stock, away from the bud.\n\nThe bud union needs to be protected from cold winds and major changes in freezing and thawing. This is done in rosegardening by mounding up the soil after the first frost to about one foot in height.\n\n\"It's growth that's coming from the bud union and it needs to be removed for the tree to maintain its health.\" The bud union is where the lemon was budded onto the rootstock to help it grow vigorously.\n\nIn zones 6-10, the bud union should be about an inch above the soil surface. In zones 5 and under, it's a good idea to bury the bud union an inch or so under the soil surface. Use a wood dowel or the handle of a shovel to gauge the proper depth.\n\nWhen removing an entire cane, make the cut as flush as you can to the bud union. If you leave a stub, it can die back into the bud union allowing entry for disease and pests. You may need to use a tree saw to get the final flush cut.\n\nWhen you plant the tree, be sure the \"bud union,\" where the scion meets the rootstock, is roughly 2 to 3 inches above ground level. Water and gently tamp the soil as you replace the dirt around the rootball; this will remove any air pockets.\n\nPlant them with the bud union (knob) an inch below the surface of the ground.

If a peach tree is planted too deep it may be injured or killed. Fill in the hole, tamp down the surrounding soil, and finish by moderately watering.\n\nFall-planted trees are more subject to cold injury during the first winter after planting.

This evergreen with prickly leaves and red berries reminded them of English holly which was a symbol of Christmas England and Europe. Also called white holly or Christmas holly, the tree has been one of the most valuable and popular trees in the Eastern United States for its foliage and berries, for Christmas decorations and for ornamental plantings. Ilex opaca is the only native North American holly that attains tree size.\n\nThe attractiveness of its foliage is American holly's principal value, whether as a forest tree, planted ornamental, or Christmas decoration. The development of commercial holly orchards and the education of landowners in the value and harvesting of holly foliage have lessened the exploitation of wild hollies.\n\nForestryimages.org provides several images of parts of American holly. The tree is a hardwood and the lineal taxonomy is Magnoliopsida > Celastrales > Aquifoliaceae > Ilex opaca Ait. American holly is also commonly called white holly or Christmas holly.\n\nThe Range of American Holly\n\nUSFS\n\nFrom the maritime forests of Massachusetts, holly is scattered along the coast to Delaware. It grows inland into several Pennsylvania counties and abundantly southward throughout the coastal plain, Piedmont, and Appalachian system.

      "text": "AMARILLO, TEXAS -- Although drought causes lack of soil moisture with which to nourish trees, there are other factors aiding in the deaths of trees across the Lone Star State.\n\nAccording to Texas AgriLife Extension Service Forestry Specialist Dr. Eric Taylor, other pre-existing environmental factors such as overcrowding, age, trenching and inappropriate use of herbicides played a big part in killing off some of the trees last year. Had these issues not been factors, the trees might have recovered from the drought.\n\n\"This is an important concept to remember because our best defense against drought is to promote a tree's health and vigor through proper care and management,\" Dr. Taylor said.\n\nTaylor pointed out trees need water to do everything. But even though moisture stress may have been a trigger, the trees likely died from heat stroke, diseases and insect damage.\n\n\"Much of the recent tree deaths and general decline might also be attributed to the extreme and prolonged heat of 2011,\" he added. \"Extreme temperatures, not only during the day but also in the early evenings and night, have negative impacts to tree physiological processes.\"\n\nDr. Taylor added if this is the first year a tree has dropped leaves, it is possible it may recover.\n\nShould the drought continue, Dr. Taylor recommends homeowners reduce the stress on their trees by paying attention to over-crowding and watering, minimizing damage to stem and roots and properly pruning.\n\n\"A good watering on half or one-quarter of the root system can be very beneficial. Do not concentrate the water at the base of the tree. Doing so can lead to root diseases.\"\n\nDr. Taylor added the best time to water is in the early evening and night. This is when trees normally catch up and replenish the water they lose during photosynthesis.\n\nDr. Taylor is conducting a four-part course on woodland management this August. Though the course is aimed at people living in woodlands, it will include information useful to people living in the Texas Panhandle. See  for more information."

The word just doesn't do justice to this statuesque, intriguing woodland plant. Grow this North American native for its broad, spreading form (perfect for a living screen), bright spring catkins, fuzzy foliage, and striking fall color. Its nuts ripen in unique fringed husks in mid to late summer, providing food for birds, squirrels, and persistent humans.\n\nGarden notes\n· Corylus americana looks good in woodland gardens or at the back of the border, where it can stretch out. Its mature size is too big for the middle of a flower bed.\n· Use this shrub as a privacy screen or a hedge. It will sucker and form thickets unless pruned back.\n· If you keep birds and squirrels away, you can harvest the edible nuts in fall. They're smaller than the hazelnuts you buy in stores.\n\nCultivars\n· Corylus americana doesn't have cultivars, but its cousin, C. avellana, has many. Commerical growers typically use cultivars of C. avellana, a hazelnut originally from Europe and Turkey (not to be confused with the Turkish hazelnut, C. colurna).\n· Another native American hazelnut, C. cornuta, has growth habits very similar to C. americana.\n\nAll in the family\n· The Birch family also includes alders (Alnus) and hornbeams (Carpinus)—and, of course, birch trees (Betula).

Along with the tulips and daffodils, one of the first colors of spring is seen in the ornamental crabapples.\n\nDue to its frequent cross fertilizing, the list of crabapple cultivars is extensive with over 400 to 600 different crabapple types grown across the country. The crabapple is part of the Rosaceae family and shares the Malus genus with the table apple. In fact, the only difference between crabapples and the apple species we eat, is fruit size. If the fruit is less that 2\" in diameter it is considered a crabapple, while anything larger, considered an apple.\n\nThere are few other trees or shrubs that are as impressive as a crabapple in full bloom. The flowers range in shades of white to pink to red with a bloom time anywhere between late April to early June depending on cultivar. The ornamental also has color appeal throughout the summer and fall with varying foliage colors of greens and purples as well as late season red to yellow fruits.\n\nMost forms reach a height of 15' to 25' at maturity and often have unique branch architecture. In general, crabapples require little pruning, but if any is done it should be completed before early June. Pruning may be done to remove sucker growth and out of place branches and to open the center of the plant to light and air. Since flower buds for the next season are initiated in mid-June, avoid pruning after this time to reach full bloom potential.\n\nCrabapples are adaptable to a variety of soil conditions and do best in well drained, moist and acidic (pH 5.0 to 6.5) soils. For best flower and fruit production, trees should be planted in full sun. One of the most common diseases found in crabapples is fireblight, with the first visible signs consisting of tip dieback on young shoots and bud clusters. Branches are also killed off by sunken cankers that eventually spread into larger branches and trunk. Infected plant material should be removed during dormant, dry conditions with cuts made at least 4\" below the canker base. To avoid fireblight as well as other disease and insect problems, make sure to purchase the newer cultivars bred for resistance. Forms from Asia have been found to be especially more resistant than our native crabapples."

Minnesota USDA zones are 2,3,4 and 5, a fact that restricts favorable growing in Minnesota of Fruit and Nut trees that are recommended for MN. planting such as the American Black Walnut, Juglans nigra, the Butternut ( white walnut) and Shag bark Hickory nuts. Black walnuts are excellent trees, not only because of the tasty nut kernels, but the black walnut lumber is extremely rare, desirable and expensive for fine cabinets and furniture tables and gun stocks. White walnut is a heavy bearing walnut tree and is cold hardy throughout Minnesota. Hickory trees produce tasty nuts and hickory wood is in high demand for smoking delicious flavor into meats and other foods. Both hickory nuts, white walnuts (butternuts) and black walnuts are all an important diet supplement for wildlife animals and wildlife game birds.\n\nFruit tree orchards in MN are important, with many new apple fruit trees recommended by the University of Minnesota, including the Honey Crisp and the old timer antique apples, Red Delicious apple trees and Golden Delicious apples. Crabapple trees are important pollinators for apple trees, because the crabapple pollen is necessary for cross pollination in insure that apples will be produced.\n\nCherry trees are fast growing and the North Star cherry tree is an excellent tree for growing sour (tart) cherries. Sweet cherries such as bing cherry and Black Tartarian cherry are not cold hardy enough to survive predictable Minnesota snow and ice and temperature drops to minus 45 degrees F. Pear trees can be grown in Southern MN, but very few Pear cultivars are cold hardy enough to revive extreme Minnesota winters. Apricots can be grown in Minnesota gardens, and the two best recommended cultivars are the Sun Gold apricot that is delicious and very productive and the Moongold Apricot. Apricots are high in fructose sugar content upon ripening in late summer.\n\nPlum trees such as the Superior plum tree cultivar will survive in MN. Shade trees are very important in Minnesota to shade yards and homes and to save and cut electric bills. Maple trees are excellent to plant to create shady environments, and oak tree and elm trees shade the homes of Minnesotans.\n\nLatham Raspberry plants are productive throughout Minnesota and the Latham, red raspberry plant cultivars are the most cold hardy. Great interest has been shown in growing berry plants organically, and that basically means withholding industrial, inorganic fertilizers and avoiding chemical sprays of every type. Berry plants are ideally adapted for growing in organic soils, much like the native MN raspberry plants that normally grew in the native wild environments. Not only raspberry bushes, but blueberry bushes are best grown in organic heavy soils and are unfortunately often damaged or killed by over- fertilization by Minnesotan gardeners. Pick-you-own organic, blueberry orchards are appearing and thriving as a farm supplement to berry plant and fruit tree income."

      "text": "Beekeeping For Beginners\n\nThe Correct Way to Plant a Bareroot Tree or Shrub\n\nOver the years, I have seen many dead trees and shrubs in new landscape projects, and the first thing that comes to mind is; were they planted correctly? Most of the time, I find that improper planting is the reason the plant didn't make it. So, here's some instruction on the correct way to plant a tree or shrub.\n\nStart by digging a hole that is deep enough to cover the roots all the way to the bottom of the \"trunk flare\". The \"trunk flare\" is the part of the trunk that starts to widen just above the root top.\n\nWhen the hole is the right depth, widen it to 3 times the diameter of the root ball, without digging the hole any deeper (roots grow out to the sides).\n\nNow build a mound in the center of the hole large enough to spread the roots out over the top of. Pack it down so it won't sink in the future. Now set the plant over the mound of soil with the roots spread out over it. The hole should be wide enough so that none of the roots are cramped when you spread them out. They should easily be able to grow out sideways. Done correctly, the tree should be sitting so that the trunk flare is sitting slightly above the top edge of the hole and the roots should be spread out like octopus legs over the mound you created.\n\nNow backfill the hole enough to hold the tree or shrub in place. Fill the hole with water and let it soak in. When it's finished soaking in, fill the rest of the hole with soil. The trunk flare should be showing above the surface. If it looks like a telephone pole sticking out of the ground, you planted too deep.\n\nIf it all looks correct, lightly press the soil down around the base to squeeze out the air pockets, and water the tree or shrub thoroughly. Cover the area with 2\" to 3\" of mulch. Make sure the new planting gets 5 gallons of water a week while it's getting established.\n\nNote: Make sure that you keep the roots moist the whole time you have them exposed. Do not let them dry out.\n\nIf the tree is in an extremely windy spot, tether it on two sides for the first year. Make sure the tree still has a little room to sway.\n\nFor better results, plant in the fall when the plant has stop putting on top growth or in the early spring once the soil is workable."

It is\ntotally acceptable to use an equal number of elements in a display; although odd\nnumbers are traditionally used. At the biggest Shohin-bonsai exhibition in\nJapan, Gafuten, in 2005, second place was taken by a display that contained six\ntrees. Newer display racks are designed for both odd and equal numbers of trees;\ntwo or four items are standard for equal numbered stands.\n\nNatural elevation is not the issue\n\nAs misunderstood (also by me according to earlier western\nreadings of the subject) the arrangement of trees in a display is NOT about the\nnatural elevation of the trees like they grow in nature.\n\nIn a display of more than one level, the elevation of the\nitems has do with the rhythm of the trees according to each other. Form and\nmovement decides how the trees are placed. When a Japanese display often shows a\nconifer at the top of the rack, this has do do with traditions and the\nexpression of the tree, not where it grows in nature.\n\nA deciduous tree is as valid as a conifer as the main\ntree. The characteristics are the important detail to observe when choosing the\nmain tree. It has to be a formal steady, and strong looking tree (without\nflowers / berries, because this shows a feminine sign that is classified as a\nweaker tree without being impolite to women). the reason Japanese exhibitions\nmost often shows Pines or Junipers, are simply tradition.\n\nSuiseki\n\nSuiseki, or viewing stones, are symbolic in bonsai and\nare often displayed together. The stones represent mountains or plateaus, maybe\na waterfall or steep ocean cliff. The use of stone in display dates back many\ncenturies. For displays not using multi-tiered stands, Suiseki suggesting\ncelestial feelings are sometimes placed higher than the bonsai but more\nimportant is the interaction with the other elements. In the same\nmanner, it is more natural to place Suiseki resembling mountains, turtles, or\nother earthbound images below the top bonsai in a display.\n\nAccessories like water bowls and ornaments (i.e. copper\ndeer) are naturally placed lower than the top bonsai; like accent plants that\ngrow naturally below the trees. This achieves a natural and harmonious\nimpression. The artist has the freedom to place objects however they work best,\nas long as they are in the right relationship to the trees.\n\nOf course, great care has to be taken when\npairing the tree and the accent plant, in order to create harmonic play between\nthe two elements. For a Shohin-display on a multi-tiered stand, accents are\ncommonly placed beside the binary tree, and not on the main stand but that is\nnot a rule, just tradition which can easily be diverged.\n\nReading the display\n\nIn a Shohin-bonsai display, the number of trees allows\nfor a creative set-up, but the basic principles must still be followed in order\nto make the display work. Secondary trees (everything but the top tree and the\nassistant tree) can be arranged freely on the stand, which makes it fun to set\nup a Shohin-display, because there is so much freedom in arranging the items.\nGenerally, a display of Shohin follows the basic rules a little less rigidly\nthan other displays. There is a more relaxed attitude when it comes to rules,\nbut still a very tight focus on bringing out the best result.\n\nThere are some basics guidelines to be followed when\nreading a Shohin-bonsai display. Knowing these guidelines helps to understand\nwhy the trees and other items are set up like they are. In a normal bonsai\ndisplay, the main tree is placed closest to the middle and the back of the\nexhibition area. The second most important tree is placed farther away,\nreceiving the movement of the main tree. Because the secondary tree is\nplaced alone it is wise to use tree slightly larger to make the right balance\nbetween the elements.\n\nThe Shohin-display differs from the bonsai display. The\nmain tree is often placed on a stand with two or three levels, making it\nimpossible to place it closest to the middle of the overall display. Instead,\nthe stand that supports the main tree (the tree is placed at the top shelf), is\nplaced nearer the middle than the assistant tree whenever possible.\n\nAll copyrights reserved Morten Albek | Shohin-bonsai Europe\n\nPlease contact me if\nyou want to ask for permission to use text or photos from this website."

      "text": "A Bird Blog with Kate St. John\n\nArchive for the 'Winter Weeds & Trees' Category\n\nThe sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is a common tree in northeastern North America, prized for its wood, its brilliant fall foliage and its sap for maple syrup in the spring.\n\nLike the white ash, the sugar maple is one of the few trees with opposite leaf buds. If you look closely you'll see that each pair of buds is rotated about 180 degrees from the previous set. This keeps the tree in balance as the buds eventually become branches.\n\nSugar maple twigs are brown and slender and the leaf buds are brown and very pointy. Test the tip of a bud with your finger and you'll find it's almost sharp!\n\nA good hint for remembering the tree is to realize that the buds resemble upside down ice cream sugar cones. \"Sugar cones\" on sugar maples.\n\nMany trees are easy to identify by their bark but the sugar maple is not one of them. The bark on young trees is stone-gray and smooth as shown below…\n\n…but the bark on mature trees becomes furrowed with large flat scales that seem to vertically peel off the tree. This makes for a lot of variation and can be quite confusing. When I finally learned to identify sugar maple bark I called it \"the bark that looks like nothing else.\" Not easy to explain.\n\nIf I'm stumped by the bark on a tall tree I always have one more trick up my sleeve. I use my binoculars to examine the twigs.\n\nAre the buds opposite, brown and pointed like sugar cones? Sugar maple!\n\nJust after Thanksgiving the tree cutters visited my neighborhood. Hired by Duquesne Light, they trimmed or cut down every tree they found near the electric lines at Magee Field.\n\nAfter they were gone I went to check the damage. Did they cut down the honeylocusts whose pictures I'd taken the week before?\n\nOne look at the trunk of a honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos) and you know right away you don't want to touch it. The tree is protected by huge clusters of branching 3-inch-long thorns quite capable of impaling your hand.\n\nThe thorns are diagnostic. No other tree in Pennsylvania has them(*).\n\nThe twigs are distinctive, too. They're stout, zig-zagged and tapered but there's no need to remember that because the thorns stand out. They're reddish-brown, thick and branching just like the thorns on the trunk. Hawthorn trees have thorns but nothing like this. Theirs are long, slender and unbranched.\n\nHere's a picture of the twig showing the tip of my thumb while I gingerly hold it against the paper. The longest thorn is as long as my thumb!\n\nSo did the tree cutters take down the honeylocusts?\n\nNo. Of course not!\n\n(photos by Kate St. John)\n\n* p.s. The closely related waterlocust has similar thorns but doesn't grow in Pennsylvania.\n\nHere's a tree that will soon disappear from western Pennsylvania, a victim of the emerald ash borer.\n\nWhite ash (Fraxinus americana) is easily identified by its twig with the chocolate-brown bud. The twig is stout, the leaf buds are opposite each other, the leaf scar is a horseshoe shape under each leaf bud, and all the buds are chocolate brown. (Click here for definitions of twig anatomy.)\n\nIt's easy to find these buds in our area. There are many white ash seedlings now because the trees have put out a lot of seed while they're under attack.\n\nOpposite leaf buds are a good marker for the ash because most trees have alternate leaves. The main species with opposites are maples, ashes, buckeyes and dogwoods. I learned to remember opposite leaves with the acronym MAB DOG (Maple, Ash, Buckeye and Dogwood).\n\nWhite ash bark is distinctive too. Its deeply ridged and the ridges join to form long diamond shapes as shown below.\n\n.\n\nUnfortunately, larvae of the emerald ash borer kill the tree by tunneling under the bark and damaging the phloem and xylum. Often this causes the ridges to slowly separate from the bark. Woodpeckers hear the larvae (amazing!) and chip away at the ridges to get at the bugs. The result is that a dying tree has pale patches where the ridges fell off. Infected trees try to survive by sending out sprouts near the ground. You can see both effects on the trunk below.\n\n.\n\nIf you examine the chipped bark closely you may find the D-shaped exit hole of the emerald ash borer. (Thanks to Dianne Machesney for this photo.).\n\n.\n\nLearn the white ash now. Sadly, it won't be with us much longer.\n\n(photos by Kate St. John, except for the one noted by Dianne Machesney)\n\nThough I mentioned we would identify trees by their twigs I can't resist starting the series with a tree that's really easy to identify by its bark.\n\nThis is the Northern Hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), a member of the Hemp family. It produces small berries that ripen in autumn. Some berries fall to the ground, others persist on the tree into the winter and provide a good food source for birds.\n\nFor me the easiest way to identify young hackberry trees is by their bark. (Bark is at eye level!)\n\nHackberry bark looks as if someone glued lumpy pie-crust ridges onto the originally smooth gray surface. You can see these odd ridges in the photo above.\n\nA second very distinctive trait is the witch's broom, easy to see when the leaves are off the trees. Not all hackberries have these bundles of malformed twigs but when you see them in combination with the lumpy bark you can be sure you've found a hackberry.\n\nHere's a close-up of a witch's broom. Not only do the twigs clump at one spot but there are woody lumps at their base.\n\n.\n\nAs the trees mature the pie-crust lumps grow farther apart and sometimes look as if they'll peel off the trunk.\n\nHackberries are easy to find in Schenley Park, especially near the Greenfield Bridge.\n\n(three photos by Kate St. John. Photo labeled UGA5188076 is by Whitney Cranshaw, Colorado State University from Bugwood.org)\n\nOn my walks through Schenley Park I've started to notice the trees again. Not that they've been missing — far from it! — but ever since the songbirds arrived last spring the trees were mere bird accessories, places for birds to find food, nest and perch.\n\nNow the migratory songbirds have left and the deciduous trees have gone through a great transformation. They've dropped their leaves and seeds and stripped down to trunks and twigs. They're easier to see and they're easier to identify.\n\nIn late October when I noticed the trees again, I got excited and took my Winter Tree Finder to Schenley Park. Soon I began taking pictures of bark and twigs. It didn't take long before I'd dreamed up a Wednesday series on Winter Trees.\n\nToday is the first entry but it's just an introduction. Before I start showing you the trees next week you may want to do two things:\n\nFirst, familiarize yourself with the anatomy of a twig (shown below). I'll be using the terms highlighted on this illustration from Clemson University. Click on the twig picture to read the definitions and learn more.\n\nSecond, you may want to get your hands on the Winter Tree Finder so you can explore for yourself. (You can buy it on Amazon by clicking on the book cover above.)\n\nNext Wednesday I'll show you the first tree in the series, all of which grow in southwestern Pennsylvania. I know they do because I found all of them in Schenley Park.\n\nLast Saturday my husband and I participated in our neighborhood fall cleanup. At Magee Field this involved a lot of clambering on the hillsides to collect beer cans and water bottles that people had \"thrown away\" in the woods. Volunteers collected 14 large bags of garbage.\n\nAfter the cleanup I threw our clothes in the wash but when I pulled them from the dryer I found an unwelcome surprise. My socks had collected burdock and the laundry had broken it up and redistributed it as tiny hooks on the bath towels. I spent half an hour pulling the hooks off one by one.\n\nBurdock spreads easily by hitchhiking on mammals. Its purple flowers bloom in late summer inside bracts covered with tiny hooks. In the fall the flowers dry and the bracts tighten around the seeds (shown above). Now the ball is ready to grab fur, skin or clothing and transport the seeds to a new location.\n\nIn 1941 Swiss inventor George de Mestral went out hunting with his dog and they both came back with burdock stuck to them. De Mestral studied the hooks and saw the possibilities for a reusable fastener. He experimented with various materials and found nylon and polyester to be the best. His invention was patented in 1955 and ultimately grew into Velcro USA Inc, based in Manchester, New Hampshire.\n\nVelcro didn't catch on at first because it seemed stiff and unwieldy on clothing, but after NASA used it on astronauts' space suits, skiers saw its value and now the rest of us use it too.\n\nIt pays to observe nature. In de Mestral's case it led to great things. As he once told Velcro executives, \"If any of your employees ask for a two-week holiday to go hunting, say yes.\"\n\nThis grass is aptly named because its seed head resembles a fox's tail.\n\nFoxtail grass can be a weed or an ornamental depending on your point of view. The small version (Setaria glauca) is annoying in the \"perfect lawn\" but giant foxtail (Setaria magnus) is quite beautiful with its large fuzzy tufts that hold seeds at the base of the hairs.\n\nYou don't have to cultivate foxtail grass. It grows easily by the side of the road and in waste places. And without any effort it will grow in your lawn.\n\nFoxtail grass is in the same genus as cultivated millet. I've often watched house sparrows jump up to pull seeds from the plumes of foxtail grass in my backyard. Oddly, they refuse to eat the millet in mixed birdseed — they literally throw it on the ground.\n\nSnow cover is increasingly hard to find in Pittsburgh so this scene is fading fast.\n\nExposed here by the melting snow is a plant whose name I've just learned: common haircap moss (Polytrichum commune).\n\nI've often seen it in the woods where it covers the ground like a dense carpet of green bottlebrushes. Though it's a moss, it's rather tolerant of dry conditions and does well in a variety of Pennsylvania locations. I've read that in dry weather the green leaves wrap around the stem to protect the plant from moisture loss.\n\nIts scientific name describes the plant well. Polytrichum means \"many hairs.\" Commune probably refers to its ability to form dense colonies.\n\nWhere are the hairs? I know we can't see them in this photo because they're so small. The hairs are on the caps that initially cover the brown spore capsules. The spore capsules are those brown heads on the naked brown stems poking out of the snow. So, yes, those brown stems are not a different plant. They're the sporophytes of the haircap moss.\n\nAt this time of year the haircaps may be missing because they pop off to expose the spores for dispersal.\n\nI've never seen any of this because I haven't looked closely at this moss before. I didn't even know that the brown stems are part of the moss' life cycle.\n\nNow that I know what to look for, I'm going to find those hairy caps. I wonder what time of year they're visible…\n\nSwamp Thistle is showy when it blooms and has large, dried flower heads when it dies.\n\nA native biennial in the Cirsium genus, swamp thistle stands five to ten feet tall and produces 1″ long purple flowers on hollow, spineless stems. When the plant flowers in mid to late summer it's in its second year, so by the time you find its dried flower heads in winter the plant is dead.\n\nLook for swamp thistle in swamps, wet woods and thickets. On the ground nearby you'll see its first year plants overwintering as flat rosettes of prickly leaves.\n\nMy Weeds in Winter book says you can easily find these rosettes if you walk barefoot in the vicinity of the flowering plant."

      "text": "Shining Gum for Farm Forestry\n\nNote Number: AG0849\nPublished: September 2000\nUpdated: February 2009\n\nShining Gum is a popular plantation tree for woodchip and sawn timber in the colder and high rainfall areas of Australia. This is due to its very fast growth rate, its ability to grow in cold and dry areas at high elevations, and its many favourable timber characteristics.\n\nThe name nitens is Latin for shining, polished, bright. This refers to the leaves, buds and the bark. The fruits in particular have a distinct glossy, varnished appearance\n\nNatural occurrence\n\nShining Gum occurs naturally in scattered pockets in the higher altitudes (800-1300 m) of the Victorian Alps (eg. the Baw Baws, Mt. St Leonard), along the coastal escarpment of the southern tablelands of NSW and in north central NSW (Barrington Tops).\n\nProvenances\n\nDue to its scattered natural occurrence, there are many provenances in existence. Improved seed orchard material is available, with selections mainly concentrating on growth rates and fibre properties such as basic density and pulp yield. There are provenance differences in their resistance to foliar insect attack due to genetic variation in insect repellent polyphenolics in leaves. Breeding for sawn timber traits has not yet occurred.\n\nSite requirements\n\nShining Gum requires sites with a minimum annual (not average) rainfall of 700 mm/yr, and distribution from a slight winter maximum, to more or less uniform. It prefers cool wet slopes, with best growth occurring on moist loams in higher elevations. It is tolerant of exposure, snow and frosts with seedlings having a very high frost resistance.\n\nDuring the drought years of 2006/07, many Shining gum plantations in North East Victoria and Gippsland have had substantial deaths. Most affected drought-stressed trees have been attacked by wood borers.\n\nGrowth rates\n\nShining Gum trees can reach heights of 70 m, and diameters of 1-2 m at breast height. It has good form (even when open grown), having a straight bole up to two thirds the height of the tree.\n\nIt can be extremely quick growing, with growth rates of 50 m3/ha/yr being measured under ideal conditions. More commonly, 20-30 m3/ha/yr on average to good sites has been achieved.\n\nManagement\n\nShining Gum is generally a poor self-pruner and some provenances tend to fork if the growing point is damaged. Early form pruning will be needed if this occurs. Where clear-wood is being produced, regular lift pruning will also be required to minimise the size of the knotty core.\n\nUnder good growing conditions, sawlogs can be produced in 15-25 years and pulp logs in 10-15 years. Improvements in technology are leading to sawn-timber being produced from small diameter logs. This process has commenced in Tasmania where EcoAsh is being produced from trees under 10 years old.\n\nShining Gum will respond well to fertiliser application, particularly phosphorus and nitrogen, if these elements are at low levels in the soil. The micronutrient boron has been found to affect tree form significantly where deficiencies occur, particularly on ex-pasture sites, causing distorted and stunted growth. In coastal areas, zinc and copper responses have also been observed.\n\nPests and diseases\n\nYoung plantations of Shining Gum have so far shown little incidence of endemic insect pests. They can be susceptible to Autumn Gum Moth larvae and other leaf eating beetles such as paropsis, but generally insects are not a major concern. Gum Tree Scale is one of the more serious pests causing dieback and even death of young trees. The appearance of many ants, flies and other insects on the trees feeding on the honeydew secreted by the scale, is often the first indication of a scale infestation. Leaves and the ground may become black from the sooty mould which also grows on the honeydew. Provenances vary in their susceptibility to insect attack. It is the juvenile foliage that is most susceptible to insects and animal browsing. Management to increase early growth and reduce the time for mature foliage to develop, will help control outbreaks. Autumn Gum Moths and leaf eating beetles such as paropsis spp and liparetrus spp (Spring beetles) have been observed to attack some plantations.\n\nShining Gum is susceptible to Phytophthora root rot fungus, and soil should be tested prior to planting. It is moderately tolerant to root rot fungi via stem injury, but susceptible via root injury. Fungal pathogens entering through the bark have caused significant mortality when young Shining Gum are stressed.\n\nRoot coiling (and subsequent strangling), root death and fungal infections can be a problem in Shining Gum. This causes death of trees after a few years. To ensure root coiling does not occur, seedling growth in pots and subsequent planting must be undertaken with care.\n\nUses\n\nTimber from Shining Gum has a wide range of uses, from pulp to sawn products. It is a good quality pulping species, although the wood is of slightly lower density than Tasmanian Blue Gum and therefore gives lower pulp yields. When plantation grown, it has potential to produce sawlogs of select grade material if pruned. The timber is used for joinery furniture, framing and flooring. The pale wood of young trees means the timber can be interchanged with Mountain ash.\n\nWood quality\n\nThe heartwood is a straw colour with pink or yellow tints, and the sapwood is not always easy to distinguish. The texture is medium with a straight grain. Pin-hole borer holes and associated black stains of \"pencil streak\" are often present, giving otherwise attractive timber a very speckled appearance.\n\nGreen density of the timber is 1050 kg/m3 and air dry density at 12% moisture is about 700 kg/m3. The wood is not as hard as Blue Gum, being moderately hard at 5.8 kN when dry. The heartwood of Shining Gum is not sufficiently durable for external use (Class 4), and the sapwood is susceptible to lyctid borers.\n\nDrying characteristics\n\nThe wood from Shining Gum is difficult to dry, with moderate shrinkage and high cell collapse necessitating reconditioning. Improvements in the technical aspects of drying timbers will reduce the impact of these problems on timber from younger plantation-grown native hardwoods.\n\nSummary\n\nShining Gum is an excellent fast growing plantation species when grown in areas of high rainfall and cooler temperatures and high altitudes. It is ideally suited for pulp production in these areas"

      "text": "CORNUS SERICEA:\nRed Twig Dogwood\n\nKnown both as C. sericea and C. stolonifera, our native red-osier or red twig dogwood is one of our most beautiful shrubs and is ideal for the wetter parts of your garden. It would be ideal near a downspout disconnect as it is tolerant of seasonal flooding.\n\nAt home along waterways, boggy areas and wet woodland areas from low to mid elevation across our region (and indeed, across most of North America), it is outstanding in the bright red, leafless stems in winter. For example, it was an unforgettable sight this summer: a bright ribbon of scarlet red winding its way along the bank of a river through the stark scenery and monochromatic winter colors of the arid Southern Oregon landscape.\n\nThat outstanding red color that gives this plant its name and distinct beauty is only one, albeit the most dramatic, of its virtues; it is, in fact, a plant with four-season interest and great wildlife value: Textured green, oval leaves in the spring are a striking contrast to the colorful bark.\n\nMid-spring to summer finds this shrub in bloom – frothy white clusters of tiny flowers ride the ends of the branches, giving way to white or bluish white berry-like fruits that are not particularly appetizing to the human palate, but that will draw birds to your garden in numbers, and are also a striking contrast to the stems and the foliage – which in the fall, turns various shades of red to red-orange, making it a blaze of color.\n\nAnd then, there is the drama of the bare, red branches to light up the garden in the winter. Beautiful and electric, be it in contrast to the gray skies and icy rain, or a crisp white snowfall.\n\nExtremely winter hardy (down to USDA zone 2), red twig dogwood is a fast-growing shrub, growing in sun or shade, from 3 to 15 feet in height and as wide - forming a thicket by horizontal stems at the base of the plant that root from nodes coming in contact with the ground. This thicket forming ability, along with its berries, makes it an excellent habitat plant for birds, providing both food and shelter. It also provides a quickly-established hedgerow and potential screening plant.\n\nKeeping it in a partially shady spot with more \"normal\" garden water, pruning out the rooting horizontal branches, will maintain the plant as more of a single specimen, if you don't want it to spread as readily.\n\nThere is also the C. s. ssp. occidentalis, which you will occasionally find in nurseries. This is a naturally-occurring slight variation of the species that is most readily found west of the Coast and Cascade ranges. It is one of numerous subspecies – all of which carry slight variations in leaf and flower, but are essentially the same as the species.\n\nThere are also many cultivars of C. sericea available, varying in mature size and growth habit, leaf and stem color (some have variegated leaves, some have branches that are all yellow, or range from yellow to orange to red). In other words, we think there is a C. sericea suitable for almost every garden setting!\n\nPhoto credit of cornus fruit: Greg RabournCornus sericea\n\nFACTS:\nCORNUS SERICEA\n\nFamily: Cornaceae\n\nGenus: Cornus\n\nCommon: Red Twig Dogwood, Red Osier Dogwood\n\nNative Range: Low to mid-elevations throughout most of North America, along streams, in floodplains and boggy areas, moist to wet woodlands.\n\nCharacteristics: Multi-stemmed shrub 3-15' tall and wide, spreading by horizontal branches at the base rooting at points of contact with the ground; thicket-forming, with newest branches the bright red that is its main feature.\n\nCulture: Grows in full sun to shade (performs better with at least some sun). Much prefers moist to wet conditions, can tolerate seasonal flooding. (That being said, it is also known to be tolerant of drier to more normal garden moisture conditions, especially if given some shade.)\n\nPests/Diseases: Can be susceptible to a variety of fungal diseases, some quite minor and easy to control."

      "text": "My old friend Von Woods sent me a question a few weeks ago that made me do a little research. \"Do you have a list of dogwoods that are disease resistant?\" he wrote, \"I've heard that a new fungus is killing a lot of the wild trees in the Smokies.\"\n\nVon's information is true, but it's not time yet to hit the panic button in Atlanta. Discula destructiva has killed thousands of native dogwoods along the Atlantic seaboard. Fortunately, scientists have observed that most of the infected trees occur on elevated mountainsides and on dogwoods growing in heavy shade. That means that most of our trees, both landscape and woodland types, are reasonably safe.\n\nResearchers began testing for discula resistance in the early 1980′s. They found that although our native flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) and the Korean dogwood (Cornus kousa) are susceptible to this disease, their inter-species hybrids are not. In other words, when native dogwoods were crossed with Korean dogwoods, their offspring could fight the disease to a standstill. Rutgers University has released several of these patented, disease-resistant dogwoods, including 'Stardust', 'Stellar Pink', 'Celestial' and 'Constellation'.\n\nEven with the availability of disease fighting hybrids, I wouldn't hesitate to plant less disease-resistant dogwoods like the white-flowering 'Cherokee Daybreak', 'Cherokee Princess' and 'Cloud 9′ or the pink-flowering 'Stokes Pink', 'Cherokee Chief' and 'Cherokee Sunset'. Although discula disease has appeared in scattered spots in Atlanta, most of our dogwoods are planted in enough sunshine to keep the leaves dry and fungus-free.\n\nThe factor that determines, more than any other, how well a dogwood will fare is the availability of moisture in summer. If your trees are growing in full sunshine, be sure to water them once per week when drought is upon us. Additionally, a thick layer of mulch spread under the tree out to the ends of the branches will keep the soil cool and conserve what moisture is in the earth.\n\nCOLD HARDINESS Clint Hasty, up in Cumming, is trying to avoid hearing \"I told you so!\" due to a lack of research. He writes:\n\n\"My wife and I purchased six wild potato bushes last summer at a local home improvement store for $36 each. The tag said it was a hardy plant down to -10 degrees. They were beautiful shrubs with hundreds of small purple flowers on them. After our first frost they lost all their leaves. My wife thinks they all are dead but I keep telling her they will come back in the summer like a crepe myrtle. Please tell me that I am right; I am not sure what this plant does throughout the year.\"\n\nWhew! I can just imagine the worried look on the missus' face as they shelled out over $200 in one landscape plant purchase. But SURELY a store wouldn't sell a plant that isn't winter hardy here, would they?\n\nDespite Clint's memory of the plant's information tag, potato bush (Lycianthes rantonnei) is not winter hardy outdoors here. It is grown in many other warmer spots in the country but it just won't survive an Atlanta winter. If Clint still has the plant tag, he should show it to the nursery manager and ask for a refund.\n\nAs planting season gets into full swing, make sure you know a little bit beforehand about the plants you buy. Unless you are positive about their growth habit, pest resistance and hardiness, ask a knowledgeable gardener or nursery person to advise you. Personally, I find \"The Southern Living Garden Book\" to be a comprehensive and easy-to-use reference to most of the plants you could consider growing here."

      "text": "rate this answer\n\nSunday - June 08, 2008\n\nQUESTION:\n\nWhen is the best time to trim oak trees? Concerned regarding oak wilt if cut at wrong time. Ball moss is not harmful but will it help or harm if trees trimmed. These are large oak trees. Thank you.\n\nANSWER:\n\nThe Nitidulid beetles that carry the fungus (Ceratocystis fagacearum) that causes oak wilt are most active from February through May. Their activity declines as the summer temperatures rise but they are still around June through October. Their activity also subsides during the colder months November through January. Definitely, do not trim your trees from February through June. Probably the best time to trim is during a particularly cold period in the November through January range. Alternatively, the very hottest months—July, August, September—would be a reasonably safe time to trim. No matter when you trim be sure to paint the wounds IMMEDIATELY with pruning paint or even latex paint.\n\nRegarding the Tillandsia recurvata (small ballmoss), they are epiphytes and not parasites; however, if they become too numerous on the limbs they can shade out leaves where photosynthesis occurs and interfere with the health of the tree. You don't really need to trim off the branches to remove the ball moss unless the limb itself is already dead. You can remove the ball moss from the limbs mechanically. There are also chemical controls, but unless the density is high, you probably can leave them where they are with no harm to the tree.\n\nMore Trees Questions"

      "text": "When to Prune\n\nPruning in Winter\nThe most required practice for plants is Pruning during dormancy. It results in a energetic burst of new enlargement in the coil and should be used if that is the preferred effect. It is regularly best to wait until the coldest part of winter has passed. Some class, such as maple, walnuts and birches, may bleed when the sap begins to flow. This is not damaging and will cease when the tree leafs out.\n\nPruning in Summer\nTo direct the enlargement by slowing the branches you don't want; or to slow \"dwarf\" the development of a tree or branch, pruning should be done soon after recurring growth is complete. The reason for the slowing result is that you reduce the total leaf outside, thereby reducing the amount of food artificial and sent to the roots. Another reason to prune in the summer is for remedial purposes. Defective limbs can be seen more simply, or limbs that hang down too far under the weight of the leaves."

In many areas of UK it is also known as Weymouth Pine. As the characteristics of all the pine trees are this tree also have bundles of leaves generally five in one. The sheath is deciduous and the leaves can be bent. The leaves remain on the trees for about 18 months and have a dark bluish green color to them. These trees grow cones that are slender and have a length of 8 to 16 centimeters. The tip of the cones is reflexed and round with scales. The wind helps in dispersal of the seeds. One can see that the production of the cones is at its best after a gap of 3 to 5 years. The age of these trees can well be around 200 to 250 years and there are exceptions as well that live up to 400 years. It has been found out that humid and cool climates work perfectly to promote the growth of these trees. Due to the height of these trees one can easily point them out even in the mixed forests. The tree has a number of uses apart from being a shelter for the small mammals and some forest birds. These pine trees were reserved for the British Royal Navy in the past and the wood that came from the trees was often squared after the trees were felled. This was done because then the wood used to fit better in the holds of the ships. The needles of the white pine have great amount of vitamin C and cambium is also used for eating purposes. The trees are wonderful and can be grown even in therocky highlands."

      "text": "Is Fall a good time to prune back my shrubs and trees?\n\nYou recommend mixing Bio-tone to the soil when planting. Why is that necessary?\n\nBio-tone Plus is something very special that will help your plant from day one until the end of its life. Bio-tone Plus contains strains of Mycorrhizal fungi, soil-dwelling fungi that have been helping green plants for probably 400 million years. They establish a symbiotic relationship which allows the fungi to be fed from their green host's sap supply, in return for attaching themselves to the host plant's roots and extending their own huge network of feeder roots, called hyphae. This adds about 70 times more feeder roots capability working to find and bring in water and nutrients than what the host could achieve by itself. Added to the backfill soil, the fungi make contact with the plant's feeder roots, attach, and begin helping their host to quickly establish itself and grow faster, stronger and better for life.\n\nWhen should I plant the Fall bulbs that bloom in the Spring?\n\nThe bulbs are available for planting from September to the New Years Day. They need to be in the cool ground early enough to receive 12 weeks of \"chill\", that is a consistent period of soil temperature below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. This is absolutely necessary so the bulbs can received the proper stimulus that tells them winter has occurred and they may put out blooms in the spring. I highly recommend that you plant these bulbs as early in the fall as possible, as planting fresh bulbs is always better and waiting too long means that the selection of desirable types and colors of bulbs is much more limited.\n\nCan I plant shrubs and trees in the ground now, even though it is mid-January?\n\nIt is not the ideal time to plant shrubs and trees. But yes, you certainly can. However, winter planting means that plants being planted then will not become established until spring. This is because the soil is too cold now to promote root growth. It also means that if we get any hard freezes (extremely low temperatures in the 'teens or below) the soil will become too hard to dig. But this winter's temperatures so far, have been rather moderate and digging planting holes now should not be a problem. Please remember to mulch the soil area around the plants with at least a 2 inch-deep layer of mulch to protect the surface roots of your plants.\n\nWould it make sense to apply lawn food to my lawn even thought it's winter?\n\nNot really. Although your lawn is still green, it is experiencing little or no growth in winter. This low level activity means less energy is being used and additional nutrients needed to produce energy are not in demand by the grass. Therefore, lawn fertilizers should not be applied until the lawn soil warms in the spring and the grass is actively growing again. Also, the Fertilizer Use Act of 2011 is now Maryland law and went into effect on January 1, 2012. One provision of this law prohibits a homeowner from applying fertilizer to lawns (only lawns) except between March 1 and November 15 of each year. The reason is that the lawn is where unused fertilizer can be easily washed from the soil by rain and is close to the walkways and streets. Since grass lawns will not be taking up hardly any fertilizer during this time of the year, much of it will likely end up washing into the streets or enter the groundwater, directly affecting the quality of the water flowing through Chesapeake Bay watershed system. You can purchase lawn fertilizer now, but do not put it down on your lawn until March 1st.\n\nIs January too early to prune my shrubs and trees?\n\nShrubs and trees (woody plants) can be pruned now, but ideally, late-February and March would be the best time to prune most plants. Remember that spring is the period of the growing season when MOST new growth is formed; not in the summer. The best time is early spring or late winter; before buds begin to swell and open, and new blooms and leaves emerge. But it is import to know that certain woody plants need special pruning times during the spring. Spring-blooming plants such as azaleas, rhododendrons, lilacs, forsythia, dogwoods, should be pruned as soon that all flowers are through blooming. Also, any pruning of new branches produced that spring should not be pruned after mid-July! If pruned anytime after the end of July, you will be pruning off flowering wood that is forming or has already formed flowers for the next spring. If this is done, the plant is not harmed, but you will have few or no flowers blooming in the spring.\n\nI have heard that March is the month to apply pre-emergent weed killers. Does this mean these products won't work if applied these products after March?\n\nThe lawn weed preventers must be in place in the surface layer of the lawn's soil before the seedlings germinate and break through to the sun. Normally, if you apply the crabgrass and weed preventers, which include the chemical preemergent products and the organic in March, the ground is still cold enough that this will not yet happen. These products DO NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT on any crabgrass or weed seedlings that have broken through (emerged). This is why it may not be as effective in getting the majority of the weeds if it applied in April or later when the soil is warm enough and many weeds have already emerged.\n\nShould I apply fertilizer to my flowering shrubs that will bloom this spring now or should I wait until they finish blooming?\n\nWait until all the blooms have finished blooming. This is when new growth starts and the plants will be actively taking up food to build green leaves and new branches.\n\nI already have weeds coming up in my lawn, but am told that lawn weed killers will not work this early in spring because the weather is too cool. Are there any weed killers that WILL work now?\n\nThe magic number is 45 degrees F. or higher. These are the temperatures at which all plants, including weeds, begin to become active and their sap transporting systems are fully flowing. This is necessary for the systemic herbicides such as 2-4-D and Dicamba to be able to reach the roots where the killing action occurs. The only product that we stock that CAN work on weeds in soil temperatures down to 40 degrees is the Bonide Weed Beater ULTRA. This product contains an agent that allows the herbicides to reach the roots when similar products cannot.\n\nI see summer flowering bulbs are now available at garden centers even though it is still very cold. Is it safe to plant these bulbs in the ground now?\n\nThe bulbs on sale in garden centers at this time of the year are not the same types you plant in the fall for spring blooming. The spring-planted bulbs are for plants that bloom only in warm weather, starting in late spring. Many of them are repeat bloomers and will bloom almost continuously until the fall frost in November. However, they can be killed off by a hard freeze (temperatures well below freezing) should the soil temperature drop to those levels. These are the bulbs that are \"lifted\" from the soil and stored indoors in a cool, dark and dry location to hibernate until next spring, when they can be planted in the garden again.\n\nMy hollies are showing brown leaves on some branches now. Should I be concerned?\n\nThe damage we see now to the leave of hollies and other broadleaf evergreen shrubs, and trees may be from more than one cause. If the brown leaves are limited to specific branches and the die-back pattern shows that the browning restricted to the tips and edges of the leaves, it most likely is weather, not pest-related. The strange weather patterns we have experience the last three winters, shows that we have a warming effect which is not a normal pattern for our region. This past winter we have had warming episodes between some very cold temperatures. This inconsistency of temperature norms causes water issues for plants that cannot predict the need for it foliage. The brown leaf tips and edges indicate that insufficient water is reaching the farthest reaches of the plant's water distribution system. This damage will pass as we go into spring and those damaged leaves will be replaced before summer."

      "text": "OAK WILT AND TREE MAINTENANCE Trees require regular maintenance to keep them healthy and looking good. The colder days of late Fall and Winter are tree time! The weather is cooler and the Oak Wilt bugs are less active. Still, we have to take precautions for Oak Wilt. Oak What?\n\nOak wilt is an aggressive fungal-disease that affects many species of oak. It is one of the most serious tree diseases in the eastern United States and Texas, killing thousands of oaks each year in forests, woodlots, and home landscapes. It attacks the water-carrying arteries of the tree and clogs them. Live Oaks, White Oaks and Red Oaks (often called Spanish Oaks) are affected. White Oaks have a natural resistance and may recover or take several years to die. Some Live Oaks may live a year or more with the fungus but most die within a few months. Red Oaks die quickly, usually within a few weeks to a few months. Common symptoms include \"veinal necrosis\", by which the leaves develop yellow to reddish-brown coloration of their veins.\n\nOak Wilt spreads primarily in two ways. Local spread can occur through root systems, as intertwined roots pass the disease from tree to tree. Oak Wilt can also spread great distances carried by specific beetles attracted to the oak sap. Any wound to the tree releases oak sap and potentially attracts the beetle. Heavy equipment used in development and improper pruning have contributed to tree damage, sap leakage and the beetle's rapid spread of the fungus. Under certain high-moisture conditions, the dead Red Oak will host \"fungal mat\" development under its bark. Fungal mats will burst the bark open to reveal a highly concentrated spore colony.\n\nControl and protection are the primary defenses against Oak Wilt. Infected Red Oaks should be removed immediately. Burning, burying or open-air drying kills the fungus. Trenching down four feet around infected trees has proven effective in halting local root spread. Any pruning of oaks should be treated with a proper pruning paint such as Tree Kote. Paint seals the wound and the release of the beetle-attracting sap and acts as a barrier.\n\nBe careful when bringing firewood to your property, it may have been infected by the fungus. If suspicious about your firewood, cover it with clear plastic. Trapped beetles go toward light sources to find an exit. Clear plastic helps confuse and trap them.\n\nMore information can be found at the United States Forest Service web site at:"

Although they do not compare to the bright yellow of gingkos, bald cypress turn a pleasant and uniform shade of paper bag brown.\n\nGardening newsletter\n\nE-mail *\n\ndo not change\n\nContact Email\n\nContact Email2\n\nContact Url\n\nSubscribe to Blog\n\nRemember my Info\n\nThere are very few coniferous (cone bearing) trees that are deciduous; and because most prefer cooler winters, very few are ever seen in mild climates. The bald cypress, Taxodium distichum, happens to be one of the few deciduous coniferous trees that really could be more popular than it is, since it seems to be right at home in mild climates. It is native to coastal riparian regions from Maryland to Florida to eastern Texas, and up the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers as far as Indiana. The soft foliage resembles that of coastal redwood in California, but is more finely textured. It is light green through most of the year, then turns paper bag brown before trees go bare for winter. The tiny individual leaves are shaped like flat pine needles, and are not much more than half an inch long. The ruddy or grayish brown bark is finely shaggy. In the wild, mature bald cypress trees can get more than a hundred feet tall with trunks more than five feet wide. Some of the largest trees have buttressed trunks as wide as fifteen feet! Trees in swamps develop distended growth from their roots known as 'knees', which can stand several feet tall! Fortunately, bald cypress rarely get half as tall or develop such massive trunks where well exposed in landscapes"

      "text": "The English Apple Man\n\nJournal for 26th March 2010\n\nIt IS getting warmer:\n\nAfter the much warmer weather of the last week, all plant life is growing away fast. The Primroses and Daffodils are a clear indicator of the rapid changes about us. Fruit trees are no exception, although the weather forecast suggests lower temperatures next week. Either way apple growers will be watching closely changes in fruit bud development as fungicide sprays to combat scab need to be applied as soon as young green tissue (a sign of what will be the first leaves) forces its way out of its protective winter coat. Of course scab will not necessarily infect the newly exposed tissue if the spores are not present and the weather is cool and dry.\n\nApple Scab (Venturia inaequalis):\nScab is the most economically challenging apple disease in the World. Most varieties are susceptible; very few are immune, however some like Discovery only suffer infection in extreme conditions while Gala is the most susceptible of the commercial varieties. Scab spores overwinter on leaf debris and other vegative debris (wood) on the orchard floor; if high levels of scab were present in the previous season it is highly probable scab will be present on the one year old wood on the tree. The next factor in the 'risk chain' is wet conditions and warm temperature. Leaves need to be wet for infection to take place and the release of spores increases as temperature rises. In the spring time overwintering scab inoculum; as Ascospores released by the rain from overwintering leaves on the orchard floor or as Conidia spores from tree sources infect young leaves and fruitlets. As the season develops growers assess the risk by careful inspection of the leaves for minute scab infections. This needs a magnifying glass to spot the first signs of leaf scab. Generally the process of infection is from old (overwintering) source onto young tender leaves and then, IF infection is high and weather wet and warm, conidia spores will infect the young fruitlets.\n\nThe essential elements of Best Practice require good orchard hygiene by reducing inoculm wherever possible. Measures such as maceration of leaf litter and removal of infected wood on the tree and Autumn fungicide sprays to eliminate/reduce overwintering inoculum and critically, by timing early fungicide sprays to protect the young tissue from infection.\nIf this regime is followed by vigilant inspection and regular early season sprays, it will be possible to stop scab sprays before mid summer. However if scab establishes itself on leaves and young fruit, the grower will fight a rearguard action all summer long, with money wasted on sprays and reduction of marketable fruit; altogether a potentially disastrous result. In dealing with the 'vigilant inspection' aspect, most growers will rely on regular orchard walking by using a trained advisor who will spend the entire season 'crop walking' and by virtue of his exposure to seasonal factors on many different farms and geographical locations will develop a keen eye for problems. One should add, there are always 'hot spots' (areas where a problem of disease or pest is more likely to prevail) where the experienced advisor will look first, thus influencing where and what to look for next!\n\nVarieties flower at slightly different stages and equally some will reach bud burst ahead of others. In a mixed orchard scenario it is vital therefore to observe carefully for the first buds on the move! Often the pollinating variety will be first to reach bud burst and where a Malus (Crab apple) is used as a pollinator it will be the 'first to burst'\n\nObserve the next two pictures; one of Malus and one of Gala both taken today (Friday 26th March) in the same orchard. While the Gala is ahead of the Cox and Bramley in adjacent orchards, the Malus is clearly well advanced and potentially at risk of scab infection. Once infected, it will in the right weather conditions, spread to the neighbouring Gala trees.\n\nOrganic Apples:\nWith very little in the armoury for use against scab, organic growers must depend heavily on a combination of; (1) Use of varieties with scab resistant genes; (2) Eradication of overwintering inoculum by removal of infection by leaf maceration, and tree management which allows good air movement allowing rapid drying of leaves and fruit after rain. Currently the only permissable spray for organic use against scab is Copper which is only effective as a protectant. To maximise the efficacy growers now follow a 'predictive model' rather than applying a routine (7 day) programme. Taking note of the local weather forecast is central to the model and the ability to apply the copper protectant in dry conditions before the onset of scab infection is critical.\n\nGood weather is the best control agent; Keen gardeners will observe that scab infections are nil or minimal in years where the spring and early summer is predominately dry. Conventional apple & pear growers benefit greatly in dry conditions too. On some of the more susceptible organically grown varieties it can be a 'make or break' moment!\n\nWell that's all for this week, but before signing off may I remind my readers of the Blossom Walk Competition!\n\nA readers competition\nThe English Apple Man offers a blossom walk to the web visitor with the best description of 'Their favourite English Apple'\n\nDescribe in no more than 30 words the virtues of your favourite English Apple!\n\nThe prize will consist of a day with The English Apple Man and a walk through apple orchards in bloom and a pub lunch for two people.

      "text": "Trees, Shrubs & Vines For Minnesota Landscapes\n\nW O O D Y V I N E S\n\nThere are few woody vines that are adapted to the conditions of Minnesota. Vines are useful in creating a feeling of informality in the landscape. Some can be used effectively to break up large architectural masses, especially if there is not enough space for trees or larger shrubs.\n\nBITTERSWEET\n\nBittersweet is grown primarily for its fruits, which are used for winter bouquets. It requires good light and a support to produce an abundant crop of fruit. Since each bittersweet plant is usually of a single sex, several plants should be planted in an area to ensure fruiting. Bittersweet is adapted to a wide range of soils. The height of some of these vines is determined by the height of their support. Some vines will spread on the ground and are useful as a ground cover. Bittersweet vines climb by twining.\n\nAmerican Bittersweet (Celastrus scandens). This native species produces the most desirable bright orange fruits for fall arrangements. Hardy in both zones 3 and 4.\n\nChinese or Loeseneri Bittersweet (Celastrus rosthornianus) is sometimes sold in Minnesota. Although it is more fruitful than the American it is less desirable if grown for fruit since the hulls surrounding the fruit shatter easily. The hull is somewhat yellow while the fruit is a medium orange color. It is a very vigorous vine that will grow 30 feet tall if support is provided. This plant suffers winter injury most years in zone 3, often killing back to the ground. It is normally hardy in zone 4, but can suffer injury there some years.\n\nBOSTON IVY\n\nBoston Ivy (Parthenocissus tricuspidata) often takes a couple of years to become established, but then grows vigorously. It climbs by tendrils that often have disk-like tips that will adhere to wood or masonry surfaces. Leaves are three-lobed and are dark green, but turn a bright red in the fall. Dieback to the ground is common with young plants and occasionally occurs on older plants. Trial in zone 3; adapted to zone 4.\n\nCLEMATIS\n\nClematis (Clematis hybrids) is probably the showiest of the vines that can be grown in Minnesota. It grows best where it doesn't get too hot. It does well with an exposure to the east but if it is grown on the south and west side of a structure, the clematis will be benefited by midday shade. Clematis does best in a cool, moist soil, but the soil must be well drained. In Minnesota, lime should not be added to the soil. The soil can be kept cool during the growing season by using an organic mulch. Clematis climb by leaf petioles that act like tendrils. Most clematis sold in Minnesota will bloom on the current season's growth if cut to the ground in the spring before growth starts. Some clematis are useful as a ground cover. Zones 3 and 4.\n\nENGLEMANN IVY\n\nEnglemann Ivy (Parthenocissus quinquefolia 'Englemannii') climbs with adhesive disks at the end of the tendrils. It has a compound leaf made up of five leaflets similar to the woodbine, but the leaflets are smaller. It takes on a bright red fall color. Zones 3 and 4.\n\nHONEYSUCKLE\n\nVine Honeysuckles (Lonicera spp.) are not commonly used landscape plants in Minnesota because there are few that are hardy. There are species of vine honeysuckle that become weedy because of their vigor. Fortunately these are hardy in Minnesota.\n\nDropmore Honeysuckle (Lonicera x brownii 'Dropmore Scarlet Trumpet') blooms from early in the growing season into the fall. The abundant showy flowers are an attractive red-orange color. The foliage is a rich green. This vine climbs by twining and will grow 10-15 feet if support is provided. Zones 3 and 4.\n\nTRUMPET CREEPER\n\nTrumpet Creeper (Campsis radicans) climbs by aerial roots. Although not considered dependably hardy, it is sometimes seen in southern Minnesota. It grows best in a sunny location on fertile soils. The large trumpet-shaped flowers are yellowish orange to scarlet in color and appear in July. This vine needs a sturdy support. Dieback is common after a severe winter. Trial in the southern part of zone 4.\n\nVIRGINIA CREEPER\n\nVirginia Creeper or Woodbine (Parthenocissus quinquefolia) is a common native that climbs in trees. It has tendrils that end in disks. The foliage turns a bright red in the fall. The small berry clusters turn blue in the fall. Zones 3 and 4.\n\nWISTERIA\n\nWisteria (Wisteria sinensis and W. chinensis) is not normally considered hardy in Minnesota; however, it is occasionally grown here in protected locations. Some gardeners lay the vines down to protect them over winter, but some wisterias survive the winter without protection. This vine produces long clusters of violet-purple flowers. It is a vigorous twining vine that will grow 65 feet tall. Trial in the southern part of zone 4 on protected sites"

      "text": "Why do we prune trees in Winter?\n\nWe want to prune trees in winter because this is the least stressful time for the tree.\n\nYou can definitely prune woody plants at other times of year, but pruning in winter takes advantage of the tree's natural growth cycle and encourages faster, more complete healing.\n\nMost of our trees are deciduous, so they are dormant in winter. And even semi-evergreen species like live oaks don't actively grow when it's cold out. So their--which are also more active in warmer weather--to the source of a direct route into their body.\n\nBut a bit of sap-flow is actually a very good thing, leading to natural healing of the wound. Shortly after being cut, the tree will start to form callus tissue, which will at first look like a small donut ring, and will eventually, perhaps after many years, grow to cover the entire cut surface.\n\nAnd because you want a little sap-flow but not too much, the late winter, when plants are still asleep but are getting READY to wake up, is the best time in the plant's natural growth cycle to take advantage of this strategy.\n\nThis is especially true when pruning oak trees, to avoid the possibly of oak wilt, which is insect-vectored. Like most insects, the beetles that vector oak wilt are not active during the winter, so there is very little chance of infection if you prune at this time.\n\nBecause of oak wilt, it's advisable to paint the pruning cuts on oak trees. But this is NOT recommended on other species, since the pruning paint actually inhibits the natural healing process."

Their chlorophyll seems to be fading fast. The whole tree may be bright yellow in a few more days, heralding our annual symphony of color.\n\nThis could be a good year for autumn leaves in Illinois. State climatologists expect cooler, damper weather in the next month or so, auguring a variety of fall hues if certain conditions are met. What we need are several days of bright, sugar-making sunshine.\n\nAccording to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, the variety and intensity of leaf colors are governed by sunlight during this critical period.\n\n\"Both green and yellow pigments are always present in leaves, but chlorophyll is dominant during the growing season,\" a DNR release explains. \"During spring and summer, its green color blocks out the yellow tints of the carotenoids. As autumn approaches, producing shorter days with less sunshine, the amount of chlorophyll in the leaves is reduced. This allows the gold, orange and other yellow tints, which always have been there, to be seen.\n\n\"Unlike carotenoids, anthocyanins are not always present in leaves. The production of this group of reddish pigments depends on bright, sunny days occurring in late summer and early autumn. Their red colors can combine with the carotenoids' yellow tints to produce bronze, deeper orange and scarlet shades. A lack of clear, sunny days in early fall can result in an absence of rusty red and scarlet colors. In those years, the yellow colors predominate Illinois landscapes.\"\n\nForesters say cool weather with normal precipitation can kick-start a color change by as much as a week. Normally, fall colors rise in northern Illinois around Oct. 1. Central Illinois reaches its peak in mid-October, followed by southern Illinois later in the month. The same schedule holds for Indiana and Missouri.\n\nI'll never forget the best color autumn I've ever had. Back when I still covered a lot of college and pro football, I was assigned to a pair of games in Minneapolis at the height of Minnesota's color phase. The next week I was in Madison and Green Bay, followed by Boulder, Colo,, Champaign, Bloomington, Ind., and Lexington, Ky.\n\nI inadvertently did what a lot of color-struck retirees do. I followed the splendor from north to south. Unfortunately, I never had the time to search for deer or squirrels.\n\nFor those who wish to find the best locations for breathtaking color, the Illinois Tourism Bureau offers an armload of recommended scenic drives and fall festivals, including guided bus tours through Shawnee National Forest.\n\nIn this region, you can't go wrong by following any river valley--chiefly the Kankakee, Illinois, Rock and Mississippi.\n\nSpecial tours have been set up in Knox, Pike, Union and Fulton Counties, including two on the Spoon River. A spectacular 70-mile route through Shawnee Hills has been crafted along the Ohio Scenic Byway from Mitchellsville. The Southernmost Tourism Bureau in Ullin will tailor itineraries to complement each visitor's timetable and preferences.\n\nLet's just hope we don't have an early frost followed by a heavy rain and gusty winds. There's nothing like barren trees to jolt a fine fall into early winter.\n\nGame wardens' blotter: Police booked a Starved Rock State Park visitor for toting a collapsible semiautomatic rifle and a Ninja throwing star--and, no, the guy was not a hunter. . . . A Bloomington pickup truck driver was charged with criminal damage and pollution after he drove his truck into the Mackinaw River. Police said he cleared 35 feet of trees to make a path. . . . Undercover wardens, using a personal boat, nabbed 16 Heidecke Lake anglers for illegally fishing in restricted waters near the cooling plant. . . .

This small, shrubby, evergreen tree slowly develops an upright, rounded habit with age. It is not a common tree in its native Jamaica where it exists in rocky limestone woodlands where soils are seasonally dry. Blossoms occur in flushes any time of year and attract moth pollinators.\n\nA stiff-looking tree with glossy foliage, the needle-flower tree is prized for its long, tubular flowers that emit gardenia-like perfume at night. This small evergreen tropical has upright branches and develops a mounded, spreading canopy if grown as a specimen tree in an open area with plenty of light; trees crowded in groves become narrower and taller. This species is native to the humid forests of Mexico and northern South America where it commonly grows in volcanic soils.\n\nA common landscape plant in desert regions of the American Southwest, this spiny tree is native to southwestern South America. Most plants sold under this name are unnamed and unarmed selections or hybrids. This semi-deciduous tree rapidly forms a dense spreading canopy of twisting branches.

      "text": "Removal of diseased elm trees slows the spread of Dutch elm disease. The disease is spread by beetles which are able to fly for miles, making the disease a region-wide problem.\n\nQ: What happens to logs brought to the city's yard waste site?\n\nA:\n\nLogs and brush are ground every three weeks during the Dutch elm disease season. Brush is hauled away for disposal. Logs are used for landscape mulch. Grinding elm trees into small pieces makes the wood uninhabitable for elm beetles.\n\nQ: Will diseased trees or those deemed a nuisance be re-inspected?\n\nA:\n\nThe city will re-inspect your trees 20 calendar days after notice is sent by mail. If additional trees are show signs of disease, they will be marked for removal and you will be further notified.\n\nQ: What if I don't believe trees that the city has deemed hazardous are located on my property?\n\nA:\n\nIf you believe the trees are on a neighboring property, please locate and flag your survey markers and let us know. The city will use landscape cues and plat books when the corners are not identified. The city cannot be responsible for surveying all properties.\n\nQ: Can I keep the wood from a tree that has been cut down because it is structurally unsound?\n\nA:\n\nYes, you may keep wood from structurally unsound trees.\n\nQ: What type of trimming is done to my trees?\n\nA:\n\nIf the tree is within the public right-of-way, trimming will include:\n\nLifting branches for road safety;\n\nRemoval of parallel, crossing, dead and broken branches; and\n\nThinning out branches to allow sunlight and air flow through the crown of the tree.\n\nIf the tree is not within the right-of-way, but extends into the street, trimming will be limited to lifting branches for road safety.\n\nQ: Does the city trim trees for power line clearance?\n\nA:\n\nNo, the responsibility of trimming for clearance rests with your utility company. They usually subcontract the required work to a qualified tree care company.\n\nQ: How do I know which trees the utility company will trim?\n\nA:\n\nThere are two common situations that involve utility companies are:\n\nPole to Pole – For poles located along property lines and involving more than one residence, utilities prefer to trim by removing as much of the tree as necessary to prevent damage to lines and avoid power arching.\n\nPole to House – For lines from the service pole to your house, the utility often disconnects the service lines to allow you and/or your contractor to safely remove troublesome branches.\n\nQ: What is a boundary tree?\n\nA:\n\nGenerally, a tree planted on the boundary line between two lots or a tree whose branches, trunk or roots have crossed a boundary.\n\nQ: What can you do when a boundary tree has become a nuisance?\n\nA:\n\nHere are the dos and don'ts of legally abating the nuisance.\n\nPrune overhanging branches up to the boundary line at your own expense. Property owners have the right to use self-help to prune branches or roots of a neighbor's tree that encroaches onto their property.\n\nPrune, but don't harm or destroy the tree. Don't remove too much of the canopy, so as to jeopardize the tree's capacity to photosynthesize. Don't cut so many of the roots that the tree may become unstable. Don't prune oaks during the high-risk period of April to July. If you don't know what may harm a tree, consult a tree expert before cutting.\n\nDo not trespass onto your neighbor's property to trim a tree or shrub. Technically, that means don't lean over the property line to make the pruning cut, without your neighbor's consent.\n\nDo not cut down a tree whose trunk is on the boundary line without the consent of the adjoining property owner. Minnesota law provides for an assessment of treble (three times) damages awarded in court for intentionally cutting down a tree without the owner's permission.\n\nQ: What about trees that fail and cause damage or injury?\n\nA:\n\nTypically, tree owners are legally responsible for damage caused by their unsound trees. The test is whether the tree owner knew or should have known that damage was likely. A tree owner is not expected to be a tree expert, but he/she is expected to recognize obvious symptoms of a problem, such as visible decay, stem cracks, a dead limb and a trunk with a dangerous lean.\n\nQ: How do I know if a problem caused by a tree was due to neglect or an \"act of God\"?\n\nA:\n\nTo qualify as an \"act of God\", all of the following elements are needed.\n\nThe accident must have happened from a force of nature that was both unexpected and unforeseeable.\n\nThe force must have been the sole cause of the accident.\n\nThe accident could not have been prevented by using reasonable care.\n\nQ: What if the owner of a defective tree won't address the problem?\n\nA:\n\nTalk to the tree owner. Tell him/her about the problem and ask for it to be fixed. By putting the owner on notice, the owner can't claim ignorance when the tree fails. If the owner refuses to correct the perceived hazard, contact the Forestry Division for an independent assessment.\n\nQ: Because trees and shrubs block my view, I can't see oncoming cars at the intersection in my neighborhood. What should I do?\n\nA:\n\nTalk to the property owner, tell the owner about the problem and ask for him/her to fix it. By putting the property owner on notice, he/she can't claim ignorance if an accident does occur. If the owner refuses to correct the hazard, contact the Forestry Division for an independent assessment.\n\nQ: What can the city do about hazardous intersections caused by sight obstructions?\n\nA:\n\nThe city will inspect the intersection and corresponding sight triangle (30 feet). If there are sight obstructions within the triangle, the property owner will be notified and requested to correct the situation.\n\nQ: How do you determine the boundary line?\n\nA:\n\nA survey is the sure way to know where a boundary line is, assuming that you can locate the survey markers.\n\nMinnesota Statutes define a nuisance as: \"Anything which is an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property is a nuisance.\" Branches that rub against the neighbor's roof, tree roots that push up a sidewalk or a tree whose trunk is on your neighbor's property but leans far into your yard and prevents your use of a corner of your lot can be defined as a nuisance.\n\nQ: Who owns the boundary tree?\n\nA:\n\nGenerally, the location of the trunk determines who owns the tree. A tree trunk that stands solely in your yard is your tree.\n\nQ: What if I trim my own boulevard trees or have special considerations/concerns?\n\nA:\n\nBefore neighborhood trimming, you will be notified by a door hanger. Please contact the Forestry Division so that special arrangements can be made in advance."

      "text": "Why Fruit\nTrees Fail to Bear\n\nA fruit tree will normally begin to bear fruit after it has\nbecome old enough to blossom freely. Nevertheless, the health\nof the tree and its environment, its fruiting habits and the cultural\npractices used can influence its ability to produce fruit. Adequate\npollination is also essential to fruit yield.\n\nIf just one of these conditions is unfavorable, yields may\nbe reduced. Perhaps the tree will not bear fruit at all. The grower\ncan exercise some control over most of the factors contributing\nto fruit production.\n\nBearing Age\n\nNursery-grown fruit trees will probably be from one to two\nyears old. The length of time from planting to fruit bearing varies\nwith the type of fruit. Trees growing at a moderate rate generally\nbear fruit sooner than those grown either too quickly or too slowly.\n\nDwarf fruit trees usually begin to bear one to three years\nsooner than standard-size trees.\n\nThe age trees can be expected to bear fruit after planting\n\nVariety\n\nTime in Health\n\nHealthy trees produce good quality fruit. Weak or diseased\ntrees produce little or no fruit or fruit of poor quality. The\nfirst step in fruit production is to keep the fruit trees healthy.\n\nTwo of the main problems involved are insects and diseases.\nTypical diseases attacking the leaves and fruit on apple and pear\ntrees are scab fungi. The fungus which causes brown rot on apricot cherry, peach and plum\ntrees can also attack the blossoms.\n\nDiseases and insects can be controlled through the periodic\napplications of the proper insecticide and/or fungicide. These\nmaterials, if used properly, can be effective against most fruit\ntree pests. Contact the Cooperative Extension Center for control\nleaflets for specific fruits. When fruit trees are not sprayed\nproperly or are left untreated, disease and insects may restrict\nthe size and quality of the yield, although the tree itself usually\ncontinues to bear fruit. It is also possible to purchase varieties\nwhich are resistant to one or more of the common diseases.\n\nClimate and Weather\n\nMost hardy fruit trees need a certain\namount of cold winter weather to end their dormancy and to promote\nspring growth. When winters are too mild, spring growth is delayed,\nirregular and slow. These factors extend the period of blooming\nand, thereby, increase the possibility of frost injury.\n\nExtreme cold during winter dormancy may\nkill the fruit buds. Winter weather rarely threatens apple, pear,\nplum and sour cherry varieties. Sweet cherry trees, however, are\nrelatively sensitive to cold until they become dormant. Peach\ntrees are very vulnerable to cold weather. Their buds can be killed\nby midwinter temperatures around 10oF below zero. The\nstone fruits, cherry, peach, plum and nectarine, can lose cold\nhardiness due to extended midwinter warm periods. Damage to the\nflower buds can be extensive, especially if the warm period is\nfollowed by a very cold period.\n\nAs the fruit buds grow and open, they\nbecome more susceptible to frost injury. The exposed buds can\nusually withstand temperatures near 24oF. However, the\nopen blossoms of practically all fruit trees will be killed if\nthe temperature drops below 24oF.\n\nWhen a heavy frost is expected, covering\nthe trees will sometimes prevent bud or blossom injury, provided\ntemperatures do not fall too low and the cold weather is of short\nduration. Polyethylene sheets or plastic bags that reach to the\nground are usually effective, but cheesecloth and even old bed\nsheets may be used.\n\nDuring spring frosts, some commercial\ngrowers heat their orchards, but this method is impractical for\nmost home gardeners. An alternative method is to sprinkle the\ntrees with water. Start when the temperature falls to the low\n30s. Keep the water running until all the ice is melted. Water\nmost be dripping off the ice at all times or the plant will suffer\nfrom frost damage. After a severe frost, injured blossoms may\nappear normal, but if the pistils (center part of the blossoms)\nare killed, the tree will not bear fruit.\n\nPollination\n\nAll fruit trees need to be pollinated.\nWithout sufficient pollination, they may blossom abundantly but\nwill not bear fruit. Some species of fruit trees have perfect\nflowers. Both the anthers, which contain pollen, and the pistils,\nwhich develop into fruit, are located in the same blossom. If\nthey bear fruit as a result of pollination from their own anthers,\nthese trees are called self-fruitful.\n\nSelf-fruitful tree fruits include quinces,\nsour cherries, apricots (except Perfection and Riland), peaches\n(except the J.H. Hale and several others) and European-type plums,\nsuch as the Stanley, Green Gage and Italian prune.\n\nHowever, there are many types of fruit\nwith perfect flowers that cannot produce fruit from their own\npollen. These require pollen from another variety and are called\nself-unfruitful. Self-unfruitful types include most apple, pear,\nsweet cherry and Japanese and American plum trees. To pollinate\nadequately, two or more varieties must be planted near each other.\n\nSome species of fruit trees do not fit\nconveniently into either category. Some have pollen-producing\nmale trees and female trees which produce fruit. To grow them\nsuccessfully, it is necessary to plant at least one tree of each\ngender near each other. Fruits grown in Connecticut fitting this\ncategory are the hardy kiwi and persimmons. When selecting the\nvarieties of the self-unfruitful tree fruits, make sure the flowering\nperiods of the different varieties overlap. The following planting\npractices are recommended for the self-unfruitful plants.\n\nApple\n\nPlant at least two varieties of apple\ntrees near one another. Golden Delicious, a self-fruitful type,\nis one of the few exceptions to this rule. Poor pollen-producing\ntypes, such as Baldwin, Gravenstein, Stymen, Winesap and Rhode\nIsland Greening, need to be planted with at least two other varieties\nto ensure adequate pollination of all.\n\nPear\n\nMany varieties of pears are completely\nor partially self-unfruitful. For adequate pollination, plant\nat least two varieties together. Note: Bartlett and Seckel pears\nwill not pollinate each other and Magness cannot be used as a\npollinator.\n\nPlum\n\nSince most varieties of Japanese and\nAmerican plums are self-unfruitful, plant two or more varieties\ntogether.\n\nSweet Cherry\n\nBing, Lambert and Napoleon (Royal Ann)\ncherry trees do not pollinate one another. Plant a pollinating\nvariety, such as Black Tartarian, Republican, Van or Windsor,\nor a sour cherry, such as Montmorency, nearby.\n\nBiennial Bearing\n\nOccasionally certain fruit trees, such\nas apples, bear heavily one year and sparsely the next.\n\nThis is called biennial bearing. The\nbuds of most hardy fruit trees have been set during the previous\nsummer. Therefore, an especially heavy crop one year may prevent\nadequate bud formation for the following year.\n\nBiennial bearing is difficult to alter\nor correct. However, it is possible to induce a return to normal\nyearly fruit production by early and heavy thinning during the\nyear in which the trees are producing their large yield.\n\nAbout 30 to 40 healthy leaves are needed\nto produce good quality fruit. Within 30 days after bloom, thin\nto leave only four to seven fruit per yard along the branches.\n\nCultural Practices\n\nFruit trees need full sunlight for best\nproduction. Inadequate sunlight delays the beginning of flowering\nand may reduce the amount and size of fruit. Avoid placing fruit\ntrees where they will be shaded by buildings or by other trees.\n\nTrees will grow more vigorously and bear\nbetter if they have adequate space to develop their root systems.\nDo not plant them where roots of trees or large shrubs will compete\nfor water and plant nutrients. To reduce competition from weeds\nor grasses, cultivate, use a mulch or carefully apply a properly\nregistered herbicide.\n\nApply adequate amounts of fertilizer\nto produce strong growth. Avoid excess fertilizer which will produce\nweak, leggy growth and delay the setting of flower buds. Prune\nyoung apple trees to develop a strong framework with a central\nleader and horizontal branches. Excessive upright growth will\ndelay fruit bearing and reduce the quantity of fruit produced."

And is there a certain size tree that is best to purchase for greatest chance of survival?\n\nANSWER:\n\nThere was an old saying in Pennsylvania that you could plant trees in any month that has the letter \"r\" in it, so that would only exclude May, June, July and August (i.e. summer).\n\nHowever, that was before the days when a homeowner could drive to a local plant center, buy a pot grown tree and go home and plant it. These days you can plant a tree as long as you can find one in the nursery and the soil is not frozen.\n\nGenerally, the best time to plant is in the early fall. The air and soil are warm enough that the plant can get established (generate some root growth) and then fall into winter dormancy. Then it is ready for the stresses of the heat and drought of summer in the following season. However, if you are planting your Cercis canadensis (Eastern redbud) in an environment that mimics its native environment and not in the center of a lawn in a new development (full sun and compacted, nutrient poor soil) it will be fine if you plant it now.\n\nKeep it mulched and watered until it is established and follow the tips in our Step by Step Guide. It will bring you joy in late winter for many years to comeLooking for a tree not toxic to horses in Pennsylvania. May 26, 2009 - I'm sending a tree as a gift and I need to know what I can get that is non toxic to horses. Can you please suggest a few."

Also, callus may be produced\naround the canker that makes it more sunken.\n\nWhat causes\ncankers?\n\nPathogens are\nmostly Ascomycota. Many also have an asexual\nstage in the Deuteromycota.\n\nThere are some diseases usually considered\nwith other groups that also involve cankers:\n\nCanker rots\n\nSome basidiomycetes that decay wood in\nthe stem may also kill patches of sapwood\nand bark. We consider them along with stem-decay fungi.\n\nStem rusts\n\nThese cause cankers, but we consider\nthem separately.\n\nFoliage diseases, shoot and tip\nblights\n\nSome of these kinds of diseases also\ncan involve cankers of twigs, branches, and even main stems.\n\nIt is amazing for how few of them we really\nknow how the pathogen gets in. We think that generally none of them\npenetrate intact bark.\n\nOften, cankers are\ncentered around a wound or branch stub, suggesting that they were the\ninfection court. But seeing a branch at the center does not tell us much.\nDid the pathogen colonize the branch or stub after it was dead, then\nattack the nearby living stem? Or did it infect the branch while it was\nalive (perhaps through some kind of wound?) and then grow down into the\nstem, killing the branch in the process?\n\nSome people have trouble with this. Cankers\nare a good topic for examples. For example, the pathogen\nof coral-spot Nectria canker has both a sexual and asexualfruiting structure that occur separately. The\nsexual structure is in the perithecialascomycetes,\ncharacteristic of the genus Nectria, and the fungus is called Nectria\ncinnabarina.\n\nThe asexual structure is a sporodochium.\nFungi with sporodochia are classified in the Deuteromycota. This\nparticular sporodochium and conidia it produces\nbelong in the genus Tubercularia, and this one is Tubercularia\nvulgaris.\n\nSo the pathogen\nhas two names. They both refer to the same fungus. If we want to refer to\nthe whole fungus (as we usually do), it is usually best to refer to the\nname for the sexual stage, because, as with plants, that is the stage\nusually used to indicate relationships. So we call this pathogen Nectria\ncinnabarina. But you may also hear people refer to the asexual stage\nby name.\n\nFor some fungi, though, we may just see the\nasexual stage. Cytospora canker is an example. We\nalmost always only see pycnidia. So it is natural\nto call it by the stage that we see, Cytospora or Leucocytospora.\n\nFor some fungi, a sexual stage may never\nhave been seen. Pitch canker is an example. All we see are sporodochia,\nso we can use only the name for the asexual stage, which in this case is Fusarium.\n\nIn other cases, there may be both stages,\nbut the sexual stage is so consistently present that we don't need to use\nthe name for the other stage and there may not be one. Hypoxylon canker is\nan example. There are conidia, but you never hear a name for that stage.\nThere are almost always perithecia around to\nidentify."

      "text": "Even with the water in its roots, a tree still needs to transport it up its trunk to the all-important leaves which manufacture food – and that's a long way in the case of some trees.\n\nFor a long time no one could work out how trees did this. Of course, they have no moving parts like heart pumps to do the job for them. It was once thought that external air pressure caused water to flow upwards, as it does when you suck a straw, but air pressure simply isn't strong enough to pump water up a 100ft tree.\n\nThe answer is down to the ingenious design of tree leaves which contain millions of tiny perforations, or holes, called stomata. Trees open or close these pores, depending on the weather and conditions of the day. When it is hot, water in the leaves evaporates through the stomata making the sap in the tree trunk more concentrated. This drags underground water upwards through the trunk and into the leaves at the top of the tree. This process is called transpiration.\n\nThe tree's final challenge is to find a way of spreading their offspring, even though they cannot walk or move. The earliest species used the wind to spread spores in much the same way as fungi. The problem is that spores need exactly the right conditions to germinate – usually they must land in wet places, such as marshes or bogs. In dry climates, this is a big problem. Then, about 360 million years ago, trees came up with a much better solution. Seeds.\n\nUnlike spores, seeds contain a partly formed tree embryo as well as a substantial food store of sugar, protein and fats. The embryo, with its larder stocked with food, is then encased in a coat (a testa), ready for a sometimes epic journey, using one of a number of alternative transport systems.\n\nSeeds dramatically increase a tree's chances of successful reproduction. They are tougher than spores, they can survive droughts, they take their own food rations with them and some can even float. The first seed-bearing trees were the Cycads which have been traced back to about 270 million years ago – about 40 million years before the first dinosaurs appeared. About 130 species of Cycads are still living today, although many are under threat of extinction owing to the destruction of their habitats. These trees also mastered the art of sexual reproduction, which usually requires the genes of two different trees to combine to make a seed. But that leaves a final, apparently insuperable challenge: how could two different parents mix their genes when they are both, literally, rooted to the ground?"

      "text": "Drought is usually defined as prolonged dry periods that can cause damage to tree, plants and other crops. Drought, or water deficits in trees cause them injury, ranging from symptoms of wilting of leaves to total plant death.\n\nWilting of the leaves in hardwood trees can be temporary, or permanent, depending on the length of time water is unavailable. Temporary wilting can be seen as leaves drooping during the day. At night the tree will rehydrate and recover from temporary wilting. If the tree does not recover during the overnight period temporary wilting can become permanent wilting. Permanently wilted trees plants may recover when water is added to the soil, but prolonged permanent wilting usually kills most species of plants.\n\nConifer trees, especially pine trees, usually don't \"wilt\" from drought stress. During very dry periods, the second year needles (located away from the tips of the branches) will turn yellow and begin to drop from the tree prematurely. This is usually a sign of water deficit stress. If the needles on a pine tree turn from yellow to red, the tree is severe, and usually dies.\n\nSometimes, it is tricky to determine if a tree has died from drought stress or has simply become dormant and appears to be dead. Try this simple test to help determine if a drought-stressed tree is alive or possibly dead. Use your fingernail to scrape a small section of bark from a small twig or branch within reach. If the tissue under the bark is green and moist, the tree may still be alive. To be absolutely sure the tree is not dead, wait until the next spring to see if it sprouts a new crop of leaves.\n\nWatering trees will help minimizing drought damage, especially for younger or newly planted trees. Give the tree 5 gallons of water plus and additional 5 gallons for every diameter inch of tree trunk. For example, if a tree has a trunk diameter of 4 inches, provide 20 gallons of water slowly over the root zone.\n\nQ. This past spring, I noticed that myjacaranda tree was dripping sap - it's 30 years old and located in a planter. My guess is the roots are bound and it's the tree's way of telling the system to send the sap up to the blossoms. Is there a way to stop this or is the tree ready to see it's end of life?\n\nA. Thanks for your inquiry. Jacarandas are infamous for the dripping sap at certain times of the year, such as spring. It is not a condition of the tree's health, but more a condition of the number of aphids ingesting flower nectar. The rain of sap is actually aphid honeydew, or waste. The aphid activity probably won't harm your tree. But if you suspect the roots are circling underground instead of growing outward, you might want to contact a qualified tree professional in your area for an onsite examination.\n\nYou can find a tree expert here.

      "text": "Olives trees are shapely, long-lived, and perfectly suited to our climate -- but you have to love olives!\n\nThe Truth About Olive Trees\n\nDo you want the truth about olive trees (Olea europaea)? Here it is; If you don't want olives, don't plant olive trees. Yes, I know that they are very sculptural, and their gray bark enhances a dark landscape. I know that the multiple trunks are handsome, and I know that the silver foliage provides an airy feeling. Yes, they are perfectly suited to our Mediterranean climate. However, if you don't want olives, don't plant olive trees. I know this from experience.\n\nOlive trees thrive in deep rich soil, but they are equally at home in alkaline or shallow soil, being native to the dry, rocky hills and mountains of the Mediterranean region. They are very drought-resistant and thrive in areas with hot, dry summers. Sounds perfect, right?\n\nThe grounds of Sunset Magazine and Books in Menlo Park were spangled with 43 beautiful olive trees that had been transplanted as mature trees to the property at great expense. They thrived in the heavy clay soil, and because they were so happy in their environment, produced an abundance of fruits. Therein lies the rub.\n\nThe patios at Sunset Magazine are made from expensive terra cotta tiles. Tiles plus olives equal stains -- dark stains that were impossible to clean. Great lengths were gone to in order to prevent the trees from dropping their abundant crop all over the patio tiles.\n\nEvery spring the head gardener tried to gauge when the trees were in full flower. At that point, the entire garden team arrived very early in the morning to cover or move every container or flower bed under each of the many trees. Once the surrounding plants were protected with plastic sheeting, the head gardener came in to spray with Florban, a product used to inhibit fruit production by interfering with the flowering of the tree. This type of product is usually used on liquidambar trees to discourage the production of those little \"ankle biting\" balls.\n\nOnce the olive trees had been sprayed, they were given an hour or so to drip dry before the plastic covers were removed, the pots set back in place, the patios swept and everything was once again presentable for public viewing.\n\nThe problem was that spraying only made the olive trees mad. Instead of the usual process of natural selection causing most of the flowers to drop, leaving only the strongest to develop into fruit, a secondary crop of flowers bloomed after the treatment. Left to mature, this second crop of flowers, although smaller, produced thousands and thousands of seedy little olives. I think the trees were trying to overcome what they perceived as an attack and produced more fruit to ensure survival. So, instead of a few large fruits which would normally be carried away by hungry birds or people, the trees produced as many seeds as possible. Those pithy little fruits dropped in abundance all over the tiles in spite of our best efforts. Many man hours were spent sweeping up and throwing away zillions of tiny olives.\n\nThere are varieties of olive trees that are supposedly fruitless and are sold that way. However, they all eventually revert to their natural state, so don't trust the claims.\n\nWith and average life span of 500 - 900 years, and some living to 2,000+ years old, an olive tree is going to be with you for a very, very long time. So, my advice to you is; if you don't want olives, don't plant olive trees."

It involves heavy pruning in the early years to establish the bushy tree form, but that delays production.\n\nAt the Grove Research Station in Tasmania, senior horticulturist Predo Jotic is demonstrating to growers how to modify the Spanish Bush to produce earlier crops.\n\nJotic said Green's philosophy is that growers should be patient about cropping and wait for a big crop in year four. But Jotic feels that if you can prune less and crop a cherry tree in year three, you might as well do it. Plus, in Tasmania's cool climate and poor soils, the rate of growth of the cherry trees is generally too little to benefit from the aggressive pruning that the KGB entails.\n\nHe is testing a system he calls the Intensive Spanish Bush, which involves planting the trees at higher densities and pruning less in order to improve the precocity of the planting.\n\nIn a trial with Lapins and Simone on Colt rootstock, Jotic planted trees 1 or 2 meters (3.3 or 6.6 feet) apart with 4.5 (15 feet) meters between rows (1,111 or 2,222 trees per hectare). The planting will get off to a better start if the nursery trees have plenty of feathers, he said. A bench-grafted nursery tree might have six to nine branches.\n\n\"You prune those down to six inches at planting and then let go,\" Jotic explained.\n\nAt the end of year one, one or two limbs are cut back to a stub to improve light penetration, but minimal pruning is done other than that. In this system, the trees will grow to have about 12 to 15 limbs—half the target number of limbs of the KGB.\n\nJotic compared one-year-old grafted trees and two-year-old bench-grafted trees planted at the same spacings. At 1,111 trees per hectare (450 trees per acre), the one-year grafts produced 4.6 tons per hectare in year three, while the two-year-old feathered nursery trees produced 7.6 tons per hectare. At 2,222 trees per hectare (900 trees per acre), the one-year-old trees produced 7.3 tons per hectare in the third leaf, compared with 12.9 tons for the two-year-old trees.\n\nJotic concluded that more trees, better nursery trees, and lighter pruning can generate higher early yields"

While the fruit from these trees may be annoying where shoppers are walking, we should be careful not to trade away our charming leafy streets for a sterile thoroughfare.\n\nFirst, we all need to recognize that trees are more than just decoration; they provide irreplaceable economic, social, and environmental benefits. Consider:\n\nThe shade from trees planted near buildings can reduce air conditioning needs by 30 percent and can save 20-50 percent in energy used for heating, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The net cooling effect of a young, healthy tree is equivalent to 10 room-size air conditioners operating 20 hours a day.\n\nStreets paved with asphalt last longer when shaded by trees, the USDA reports.\n\nTrees prevent pollutants on streets from getting into our waterways and slow down water run-off.\n\nA single mature tree can release enough oxygen back into the atmosphere to support two human beings.\n\nOver a 50-year lifetime, a tree generates $31,250 worth of oxygen, provides $62,000 worth of air pollution control, recycles $37,500 worth of water, and controls $31,250 worth of soil erosion, according to calculations by USDA Forest Service.\n\nTrees are essential habitat and a source of food for songbirds; the Bradford pears may be messy, but they feed hungry birds.\n\nThere is another very important reason to think clearly before removing all the trees at once. Emmaus is a picturesque small town with a lovely, authentic shopping district. It's not just another mall with artificial small-town atmosphere designed into it. Without trees, it will lose its unique character.\n\nI do understand, though, that the Bradford pears are a nuisance. Let's consider these steps to help clean up the streets:\n\n1. Choose appropriate species to replace them. The right choices will grow slowly, last a long time, create cooling shade, provide habitat for songbirds, and require minimum clean up.\n\n2. Plant several different types of trees with advice from the Borough Shade Tree Commission on the right trees for our needs.\n\n3. Remove the current trees gradually, starting where they are most troublesome, so that we don't leave our beautiful Main Street un-shaded and treeless for a long time to come.\n\nIf we take these steps, Emmaus will preserve its roots, maintain its charm, and enjoy a long future as a great American small town.\n\nArdath Rodale of Lower Macungie Township is the chairman of the board of Rodale Inc., the Emmaus-based publisher of Organic Gardening magazine and dozens of books on landscaping."

He has received the highest teaching and gardening awards from the University of Georgia, American Society of Horticultural Science, American Horticultural Society, American Nursery & Landscape Association, Massachusetts Horticultural Society, Southern Nursery Association, and Garden Club of America.\n\nRead an Excerpt\n\nI hope the book provides a measure of inspiration for the plants and incites the readers to search them out for their gardens and landscapes.\n\nAesculus parviflora, Bottlebrush Buckeye\n\nTruly one of the best native shrubs for late-spring and early-summer flower. This broad-mounded, suckering shrub can colonize a large piece of real estate. The wonderful coarse-textured, dark green leaves are composed of five to seven 3- to 8-in.-long leaflets that turn rich butter-yellow in fall. The 8- to 12-in.-long, bottle-brush-shaped inflorescences contain hundreds of white, four-petaled flowers with pinkish white stamens that stand out an inch from the petals. The inflorescences occur at the ends of the branches and are held upright. Interestingly, this species flowers almost as prolifically in shade as in sun. Smooth, 1- to 3-in.-long, pear-shaped, light brown capsules contain one or two shiny, light brown seeds. Bottlebrush Buckeye requires moist, well-drained soils for best growth, although quality specimens are found in every conceivable situation. Transplant balled and burlapped or from a container. Ideal for underplanting in woodlands or for use in shrub borders and large masses. Grows 8 to 12 ft. high, 8 to 15 ft. wide. Zones 4 to 8 ...\n\nCalycanthus floridus, Sweetshrub, Carolina Allspice\n\nOne of the great treasures of eastern North America, especially the open-grown specimens that develop into large, roundish shrubs and offer wonderfully fragrant, brown-maroon flowers in April and May. Truly an old-fashioned heirloom plant that I have found in many old gardens. It offers a sense of permanence and purpose ... Always buy the plant in flower to insure pleasing fragrance ... Zones 4(5) to 9 ...\n\nParrotia persica, Persian Parrotia\n\nI love this tree: the clean summer foliage; the yellows, oranges, and reds of autumn; the cream, green, gray, and brown exfoliating bark; and the small, maroon flowers that glow on a late-winter day. Over the years, my travels have led me to many parrotias, no two alikebleeski\n\nPosted April 9, 2012\n\nBest in its class\n\nWas recommended to me by my Master Gardener instructor.Am glad I purchased it.Is like a gardener's Bible.\n\nWas this review helpful?

      "text": "Espalier Trees Can Create Privacy Fence or Adorn Walls\n\nThere's a house I walk by with the dogs that has a hot tub in the yard with several espalier fruit trees around it to create a privacy fence. In the winter, the \"fence\" is a bit bare, but now that the leaves are coming out, it looks pretty impressive.\n\nAn espalier tree is one that is trained so the branches grow flat, going out in two opposing directions instead of every which way. These techniques are both interesting and practical, since an espalier tree can often be possible in a spot where you ruled one out initially because you thought there wasn't enough space (against a wall or along a neighbor's fence, perhaps).\n\n\" or allée.\" ~ The Art of Espalier\n\nMany kinds of trees can be trained this way, including fruit trees, which are said to produce more abundant fruits and flowers since the roots have less area to nourish."

      "text": "Caring for a Live Christmas Tree\n\nMy family always had a real Christmas tree when I was growing up. My dad, a retired fire chief, taught us the proper way to care for a live tree.\n\nWhen looking for a tree, check for freshness by grabbing a branch and pulling along it. If any needles come off, it is too dry and could become a fire hazard.\n\nDo not have the tree seller cut the bottom of the tree for you. When you get it home, you don't want to let it sit for too long before getting it into water, so prepare your tree and stand right away. It is essential to have a good tree stand when using a live tree, as this will help ensure that the tree gets water.\n\nI like to give the tree a good shake to release any dead needles and any bugs before bringing it into the house. I prep the tree by cutting off enough of the lowest branches to give good access to the base of the trunk. I then saw off at least 1 inch of the trunk just before putting it in the stand. A fresh cut makes it easier for the tree to draw the water up. After cutting, get it into the stand quickly so it can get water right away.\n\nRemember that you need to keep an eye on the water level. A really good, healthy tree will need to be watered 2-3 times a day for the first few days. If you keep it well watered, it will last for over a month before drying out. After\nChristmas, I check daily for loose needles. If the tree gets very dry I go ahead and take it down, but usually we can wait until New Years Day.\n\nAnother way to check for dryness is to pull off a needle, twist it to check for flexibility, then scratch it open and check for moisture and fragrance. A tree which is dry enough to be a hazard will have lost flexibility and moisture.\n\nKeep the tree lights off when you're not actually in the room. I recommend completely unplugging the lights rather than just switching them off"

      "text": "Soil Injection Fertilization\n\nFertilization is an important aspect of tree care in modern landscape settings. Trees require certain nutrients to function and grow. Most residential soils are stripped of natural organic nutrients due to soil disturbance during construction and yearly leaf removal. Therefore these soils do not contain sufficient available nutrients for sustained health of trees, and supplemental fertilization is quite beneficial.\n\nProcess - Our fertilization process uses hydraulic pressure to inject liquid solution to 6\"-8\" below the soil to where trees feeder roots are located. This also places the fertilizer underneath the roots of any competing plants such as grass or other ground cover.\n\nSoil Aeration Benefit - By the process used the soil beneath the canopy of the tree is loosened and aerated. This allows better soil penetration of water and air, and allows easier root growth/elongation due to a looser soil.\n\nN (Nitrogen) - Nitrogen affects the vegetative growth on trees, it is used in producing new shoots, buds, and leaves. Nitrogen is also the main component of chlorophyll which is the green chemical in leaves responsible for photosynthesis which is how a tree produces its energy.\n\nP (Phosphorus) - Phosphorus is very important for root health and development. It is used more heavily during bloom and seed production. It is generally released into soil from decomposing organic matter.\n\nK (Potassium) - Potassium also aids in root development and the formation of chlorophyll as well as other important plant compounds. It also helps with disease resistance and absorption of trace elements.\n\nMycorrhizae - Mycorrhizae are a beneficial fungus that attatch to roots and form a symbiotic relationship that provides an extension to the trees root system. Mycorrhizal fungi can increase the absorbing surface area of roots from 100-1000 times. They also release enzymes that help dissolve more tightly bound micronutrients. Re-establishing mycorrhizal populations can dramatically improve plant performance by increasing water and nutrient assimilation.\n\nMicronutrients - Micronutrients are essential for plant growth, but are only needed in small amounts. The micronutrients are boron (B), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), chloride (Cl), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), and zinc (Zn).\n\nTiming - When should your trees be fertilized?\n\nSpring - Most trees flower and have a flush of growth in the spring followed by slower growth in the summer and fall. It is beneficial to have nutrients available to the tree for this growth period. Fertilizer should be applied from when the ground thaws until the trees start growing in late early May.\n\nFall/Winter - Once growth stops in the fall, until the ground is frozen is very beneficial for fertilization. At these times the tree's roots take the nutrients from the soil and apply them to important health-promoting functions such as root development and disease resistance, rather than simply putting out new growth.\n\nNutrient Deficiencies - If the trees leaves are discolored or abnormal there is a chance of macro or micro nutrient deficiency and fertilization may help to alleviate the issue. Have our arborist come check your trees if they appear sick so recommendations can be made."

      "text": "PRUNUS:\nCherries & their Prunus relatives\n\nPrunus is a huge group of trees and shrubs that includes many of our favorite spring-flowering trees, some of the most common privacy hedges and arguably our tastiest fruits. Peaches, plums, nectarines, cherries and almonds are all different species of Prunus.\n\nEnglish Laurel, long the go-to plant for blocking the prying eyes of nosy neighbors is also a member. The glorious flowering cherry trees that dot Portland's Waterfront Park welcoming spring are yet another example. This article covers the species grown for ornamental use.\n\nFlowering Cherries:\n\nBitter Cherry P. emarginata – Native to the Northwest. White flowers with notched petals bloom in late winter, red bitter berries in summer are good for wildlife. Dark green leaves are lighter underneath. Plants grow into a small tree or large shrub, 7-50' tall, depending on their culture. Roots are very wide-spreading, often forming suckers far from the original tree. In the wild they often form thickets.\n\nGrows 7-50' tall\nSun, part shade, or shade – Hardy Z4\n\nEuropean Birdcherry P. padus – Native to Europe, northern Asia, Korea & Japan. Clusters of white flowers in April after other flowering cherries are finished blooming. Green leaves turn yellow to bronze before falling in autumn. Small black wrinkled fruit in clusters is loved by birds, but bitter for humans. Prone to aphid problems.\n\nGrows 30-40' tall, upright with a round canopy\n\nSun, Hardy Z3\n\nSargent Cherry P. sargentii – Light pink flowers in April, shiny dark green leaves turn bronze or red in fall. Fruit is small, black and bitter. Growth is upright and oval, in cultivation 20-30' x 20-30' is a reasonable expectation, though they can get taller. Several cultivated varieties are available.\n\nJapanese Flowering Cherry P. serrulata – This is the species for many of the trees commonly brought to mind when folks consider flowering cherries. It's been in cultivation for hundreds of years and many variations are available.\n\n'Kwanzan' – Deep pink flowers with many petals usually bloom in early April. New leaves are bronze, turn green during summer and peachy gold in autumn before dropping. Growth is upright, vase-shaped with a broad canopy, 30-40' tall & wide.\n\nMany of these varieties are available grafted to Gisela root stock that dwarfs the tree to about half of its original size.\n\nHigan or Weeping Cherry P. subhirtella – Early blooming species that has both upright and weeping varieties.\n\n'Autumnalis' – Pale pink semi-double flowers open sporadically during the warmer spells of winter, usually finishing in early March. Slender twiggy branches create an open woodland look. Upright growth to 20-40' x 15-30'.\n\n'Pendula or 'Pendula Double' – Pink flowers in March are single or double and lightly fragrant. Weeping branches are usually grafted to a 4 or 6' trunk and grow out and down to the ground, with gradual mounding adding height gradually. In 10 years trees are about 12-15' tall x 10-12' wide, but in time branches will form some upright growth and trees can reach 30' tall x 40' wide. Prone to shot-hole fungus.\n\nYoshino Cherry P. x yedoensis – In Japan Yoshino Cherries are called 'The National Flower'. In 1912, the mayor of Tokyo gifted 900 Yoshinos to the USA, which were planted in Washington D.C. Clusters of small flowers are pale pink in bud and white when open. Flowers open before green leaves fill-in. Leaves turn lovely yellow and peach in autumn before falling. Young trees grow very fast and develop thick trunks quickly. Trees mature around 40-50' tall.\n\n'Akebono' – Akebono Cherries are planted around Oregon's capital building in Salem. Their flowers and shape are very similar to Yoshino but their form is smaller, making it a more manageable city tree. It matures around 25' x 25'.\n\nFlowering Plums\n\nFlowering Purple-leaf Plums P. cerasifera – One of the first trees to bloom in spring with pretty pink flowers. Green-leaved forms exist, but the most ornamental forms have dark purple leaves. Most forms develop a red, yellow or purple fruit that is edible, but is usually left for birds. Many cultivated varieties exist, differing mostly in their overall shape. All types are subject to problems with shot-hole fungus in the leaves and serious aphid problems. Without treatment an aphid infestation will cause considerable dropping of sticky aphid dew on whatever is parked beneath the tree. All are best in full sun and hardy to Z5.\n\nPurple-leaf Sand Cherry P. x cistena – A hybrid between P. cerasifera and P. pumila. Flowers and leaves are the same as tree-form plums, but this is a shrub. It grows in an upright, multi-stemmed dense shape to 6-10'. It likes full sun, and is super hardy to Z3.\n\nFlowering Japanese Apricot P. mume – Flowers on bare branches during winter in colors from white to dark pink, in single or double form. Leaves are green and sometimes glowing yellow fruit develops in summer. Grows into a small tree to 15-20' tall. Sun, Z6\n\nLaurel\n\nThe species grows very fast, sometimes more than 4' in one year. In Portland unpruned English Laurels commonly reach 25' x 25'. The national champion is 33' tall x 52' wide in Seattle.\n\nOften laurels are planted without knowledge of the immense size they can reach in a relatively short amount of time. They can be kept smaller, to about 8-12' tall and wide with pruning twice a year. If that sounds like a lot of work to you, choose a different plant. There are several varieties of laurel that grow more slowly.\n\nFACTS: PRUNUS\n\nFamily: Rosaceae\n\nGenus: Prunus (pr-OO-nus)\n\nCommon: Cherry, Plum, Peach, Almond, Apricot, Nectarine, Laurel\n\nOrigin: Over 400 species of trees and shrubs from temperate northern climates world-wide.\n\nCharacteristics: Flowers are usually white, sometimes pink, usually with 5 petals. Those with more petals are called 'double'. Some flowers, like those on Laurels are held in spikes, or vertical clusters. Many are sweetly fragrant. Fruit is fleshy and single seeded. Leaves are sometimes evergreen but mostly deciduous. Some Prunus that lose their leaves have nice peachy-orange fall color, but most have insignificant fall interest.\n\nSize: Shrubs are usually large, growing above 6' tall. Trees vary by species. The smallest dwarf Peach trees are mature at just 3' tall, and the largest Cherries and Laurels are 40' and taller.\n\nCulture: Excellent soil drainage is imperative when growing any type of Prunus. Excellent soil drainage means creating a situation where water flows through the soil allowing roots a nice drink. If soil becomes water-logged, roots cannot breathe and will rot. If water runs across the top of the soil without sinking in, like on a slope, roots cannot access enough water.\n\nImprove soil be blending compost into a wide planting area. Pumice can also be added to sites that are very dense, or to make a bed for particularly testy plants.\n\nPlums, Cherries and Laurels are among the more tolerant species of our PNW heavy clay soils. Peaches, Nectarines, Apricots and Almonds are among the more difficult species to grow in our climate. Peaches and Nectarines thrive east of the Cascades where rain is less plentiful, soil is more alkaline and naturally better draining.\n\nTo grow Peaches and other difficult species successfully west of the Cascades, create an environment that is drier during winter months. Growing in containers, under a south-facing eve for example, will allow for enough sun and will limit moisture while providing good soil drainage and a neutral pH.\n\nLight: Full sun, at least 6 hours per day, preferably during the warmest part of the day.\n\nProblems: Problems are touched-on briefly in the culture section of this page. There are many other concerns though.\n\nOvergrowth = Over-Work English Laurel grows very fast and will out-grow a spot in no time, requiring pruning several times a year to keep it in check.\n\nBirds like the fruit If trees are planted to provide fruit, cherries for instance, they may need to be protected from birds, critters like raccoons and insects that appreciate tasty fruit just as much as you do.\n\nFungal diseases: All Prunus are prone to fungal problems. Some, like Shot Hole Fungus, cause just cosmetic damage, where others cause damage to the fruit and leaves, and may ultimately cause the death of the tree."

The Chikrasi Tree\n\nA giant tree capable of reaching over a hundred feet in height, the Chikrasi here at Selby Gardens was planted thirty years ago and is now blooming for the first time. This enormous tree had previously engulfed a traffic light on U.S. 41 and is now kept in serious check by line-clearance pruning by our local power provider. The tree has a fine wood coveted by wood turners and cabinet-makers alike, and peels easily to make a high-quality veneer. The astringent bark has a history of ayurvedic use in India, and is currently under pharmacological study.\n\nWhen trees are young, they resemble another ayurvedic plant, the Neem tree, except that the leaf margin of the Chikrasi is smooth, whereas the Neem's is serrated. Both trees have small, cream-colored flowers, and thrive in monsoon-fed areas with good drainage. Chukrasia has a tendency to colonize areas where nothing is currently growing, and can be found growing alongside roads and ditches in its native range. When found in a forest setting, the tree's canopy completely dominates everything around it."

      "text": "Why on earth would anyone want to grow small trees when they could just as easily grow something that would be 10 times the size with 10 times the yield? Well, the reason is very obvious. Large fruit trees mean getting a ladder to reach the topmost fruit. It also means getting on the ladder to prune the trees to get the optimum yield. Then there is the excessive 'drop' that occurs when trees naturally thin themselves out to keep themselves producing. And what about trees that need a pollinating partner? If I want to grow more than one variety…..are we talking about an orchard here?\n\nWell, looking at this video I made you would think so…. Sorry for the quality!\n\nDwarf Fruit Trees, the ideal solution for small spaces.\n\nDwarf trees are great if you only have a limited amount of open space in your yard. They take up as little as only as eight-foot diameter plot of land. Dwarf fruit trees are trees that have a naturally restricted growth to enable their growers to grow the fruits they want in a very small space either in the ground or in containers. And although they are smaller than the standard sized trees, their fruit is just the same size. Due to their restricted height looking after the tree is a cinch making them also easier to prune and harvest.\n\nHave you ever seen slender columns of pears 8′ high clinging to the stems like water balloons of colour? Have you ever seen an orchard of apples, 6 varieties grown in an area of just 10 feet?\n\nI remember as a child walking around the local allotment being amazed at all the things people were growing. It was the first time I realized that growing fruit and veg was possible in a city, and I recall being shouted at when I stood too close to some twigs before seeing that they were 'step over' fruit trees.\n\nHave you ever seen these 'stepover' trees surrounding the garden borders like a living fence?\n\nDwarf Fruit Trees as a living boundry?…Wow, how cool is that?\n\nWatch this video…\n\nThis video shows you how to grow a single tier espalier type of tree, that you can 'step over!!…duh!…but there is nothing to stop you having 2 or 3 tiered espaliers..thereby raising the height of your living 'fence'.\n\nHey, take your pick. These small trees are the ideal way to grow an orchard in your backyard. There are plenty of varieties to be found on these pages.\n\nHardiness Zones….\n\nFruit trees require sun and water. Most require a dormancy period. Some need to have a period of frost. This is where 'Hardiness Zones' come in.\n\nHardiness Zones are the average frost temperature that a tree can comfortably withstand……I mean, you cant expect to grow oranges outdoors in areas where there is plenty of snow for months at a time, can you? So you need to know what Hardiness Zone you live in….when you know that, then you can look for trees that fit your area.\n\nFruit Size…\n\nWill the fruits be the same size as regular ones?\n\nAbsolutely, the tree is grafted onto a rootstock which will inhibit the tree growth but the fruits will be normal size.\n\nApples, Pears, Figs, Cherries, Plums, Peaches, Nectarines…the list goes on! The fruits are of normal size because having a dwarf fruit tree doesn't mean that the fruits are small. Take a look at two photos showing you what they look like in pots or in the ground…\n\nThe GROW YOUR OWN culture\n\nHave you noticed recently how many times we are being told to take a good look at our current lifestyles? The amount of information appearing in the media which is aimed at getting us to lead a more healthy life is absolutely incredible. All kinds of diets and exercise plans are constantly being developed to entice us to eat healthier and take more exercise on a regular basis. As we are continually being told to eat more fresh fruit it would make sense to grow our own fruit trees in our backyard.\n\nWhen I started out growing these trees I began reading as much on the subject as I could. With the advent of the internet this has become so much easier. Now I can help others to grow these trees and begin a great hobby. And when you pick the fruit..what then? Well you have the choice of creating something to eat or dare I say drink!!\n\nSo come on in and have a look around and discover the wonderful world of Dwarf Fruit Trees in your own backgarden or backyard and be the envy of your family, friends and neighbours."

These seed were collected in November 2011, stored through the winter in a bucket of water then planted in a wet-muck seedbed in February 2012.\n\nBroken Bald Cypress cones expose the seed- Feather-like foliage\n\nSeeds are produced annually and good seed production occurs about every 3 years. Seeds are dispersed more frequently by flood waters. Under swamp conditions, the best seed germination generally takes place on a sphagnum moss or a wet-muck seedbed. On better drained soils, Bald Cypress seed usually fail to germinate due to lack of surface water. Soil saturated for 1 to 3 months after seed-fall is required for germination. Seedlings require light for good growth, thus control of competing vegetation is necessary.\n\nIt has been six months since the sprouting Bald Cypress seed were planted\n\n>\n\nBald Cypress tree is an excellent choice for someone who is just getting started with bonsai. Seeds and small trees are easily collected in this area, now is the time to find trees with cones and watch for them to turn brown so that the seed can be collected just before the cones open. The best digging time for cypress is from mid-­December to late February. Bald cypress bud back easily and will produce vigorous sprouts from the stumps. Taxodium distichum are frequently planted in groups in a single container, forming a Bonsai forest. Japanese term for growing a bonsai from seed is Misho.\n\nThe Ginkgo Tree is also called the \"Maidenhair tree\" and nicknamed \"The Stink Bomb Tree.\"\n\nyellow fruit has a large seed inside\n\nGather the seeds as they fall from the tree (wear good latex gloves). Remove the fleshy coating (wear good gloves!) crush the coat and squeeze the seed out with ones fingers. Then rinse the seeds a few times until they are very clean!) and let them dry well. Store them in a closed container filled with slightly moistened sphagnum moss in the fridge or in a cool, dry place until they are planted in spring. When they are sown, carefully pop the seed shell open.\n\nFrom a seed collected in1980\n\nSome people are sensitive to the chemicals in the fleshy outer layer. These people should handle the seeds with care when preparing the seeds for consumption, wear disposable gloves. When I cleaned the seed of these trees, I had several 5 gallon buckets full. The cheap rubber gloves developed holes and my entire arm was coated with the juice. fortunately I had no allergic reaction, but the next morning my arms had turned black. Two weeks later the skin pealed a way........\n\nThe other tree from the seed collected in1980\n\nThe Ginkgo Tree is also called the \"Maidenhair tree\" and nicknamed \"The Stink Bomb Tree.\"\n\nficus microcarpa Sep 4, 2011 | 1:17 PM PST\nTags:\nficus microcarpa\n, future style\n, mame bonsai\n, bonsai\nHello everybody i took my ficus ginseng this one is a lot like itA few weeks ago i took the trunk off and it is so tiny it is going to be in the mame class and i want it to be sort of like this when i finish\nyour thoughts?\n\nWire is an essential in bonsai for maintaining shape and creating movement. I took a few cuttings off of one of my Ficus benjamina to see what I could do with wiring them. I wired two new Cascades, an interesting spiral, and I wired 5 together to create an upright tree.\n\nA friend and I made a trip up to Meehans Miniatures, a large bonsai nursery on the East Coast, yesterday. It's a nice hour drive from where I live. The owners have been working with bonsai for 38 years. 38! They had decent prices and were very wonderful people. I picked up two trees. The first is a Willow Leaf Ficus I bought for $70 and the second is a Ficus benjamina 'Christine' in desperate need of a trunk chop. I just liked the movement in the lower trunk.\n\nI was not looking for anything in particular...... just outside my windowsill where I have kept my three flower pots with bonsai (in the making), ginkgo biloba, fig and wisteria. I was attracted by a sudden movement at the base of the gingko biloba sappling and what I saw was something the least expected.... a potter wasp had just landed and it was dragging a caterpillar.\n\nWonder of wonders...... it had dug a neat hole at the farthest extent of the flower pot and I had no clue of its labor of love. It took all the time it wanted to clean up the larva, at least that is what it appeared to me. The wasp would sting the larva again and again as it it was injecting some fluid inside the larva in preparation of the diet for its baby. Finally it appeared satisfied and dragged the still wriggling caterpillar down inside the dark chamber.\n\nInternet does not talk about potter wasps who live underground. The ones I had written about earlier had made pots of the regular shape and size and the wasps were themselves as close relatives of paper wasps.\n\nMy wasp today is of iridescent blue black color and half the size of its cousins reported earlier.\n\nWith due apology to the poet: \"Men may come and men may go, the potter wasps go on for ever\".\n\nI am a natural gardener, untaught and unread. I do my gardening instinctively.\n\nI do not plant my flowers in flower beds. I love azaleas because they do not demand a lot of care and they bloom where they are planted. Azaleas put to shame many other \"delicate\" flowers when they burst out abloom. The way my azaleas are blooming clearly tells me they are as happy as could be, but not so my hydrangeas; the overgrown crepe-myrtle is too much of a deterrence.\n\nNow, it is time for bonsai-ing a wisteria and a ginkgo biloba. My bonsais are not tiny, I let them grow up to around fifteen to eighteen inches. I have written in my earlier blog that I moved into my present house only couple of a months ago and these bonsais are the very first ones in this house.\n\nI have taken a two years old wisteria plants from an old vine to start my bonsai but my gingko biloba will be growing out of a seed I bought on ebay. I have been fascinated by this plant.\n\nDuring World War II, Nagasaki and Hirosima were flattened, razed to the ground by the first even nuclear bombs. No one knew how long the two cities would remain thus in ruins but come Spring season, everyone breathed a sigh of relief when a green sprout emerged from the desolate landscape; it was gingko biloba that had stood there for more than two centuries before being burnt to ashes by the nuclear inferno.\n\nI also strongly believe in its medicinal value and hence my favorite subject of bonsai.\n\nControlling a tree's growth, reducing it to more than half its size and admiring the finished product is known as bonsai. However bonsai artistes have failed to see the manipulation and harassment imposed on these trees for many weeks and months, while they cut, wire, clamp, defoliate and chop to get the required design.\n\nIt was the Chinese who introduced this art to the Japanese. 'Bonsai' is a Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese term penzai. The five basic bonsai styles are formal upright, informal upright, slanting (or windswept), semi-cascade and cascade. Speaking to The Sunday Leader environment lawyer Jagath Gunewardene said he doesn't like stunted plants. \"I like to see plants grow out naturally and bloom,\" Gunewardene said.\n\nFormer President Dehiwela Mount Lavinia Horticultural Society Sunila Rajawasan said when we prune or cut branches from a tree or plant it feels it. \"This theory has not been proved but I read it in a book. In bonsai you are basically limiting the growth of the tree by controlling its nourishment and lessening the soil. Wires are used to control the growth of the branches and unwanted branches and small roots are cut off,\" Rajawasan said.\n\nLandscape Architect and Chartered Architect Shereen Amendra said in nature you find stunted plants. \"Due to the low layer of soil and high wind conditions plants are stunted. In Hakgala due to the wind conditions trees that should be 30 to 40 feet high are only three to four feet in height. A bonsai plant was initially created by planting a plant in a shallow pot and exposing it to high winds. However since these conditions couldn't be found easily wires were used to bend the branches,\" Amendra said.\n\n\"According to Peter Thomkins and Christopher Bird's Secret Life Of Plants, plants have their own life. In an experiment one plant was hooked to a machine to test its reaction and another plant was mutilated in front of the previous one. The plant hooked to the machine responded when the other plant was mutilated, therefore proving that plants have their own feelings and energy. The roots are pruned and the growth of the plant is controlled. It's not torture to the plant but manipulation. A plant needs to complete its cycle within a time period. We cut the branches to get more leaves. We are depriving the plant from completing its normal cycle by forcing it to do what we want,\" Amendra said.\n\nShe added that if a person has a small garden space and wants to have a bonsai plant that is fine. \"It is a lovely art form from a human's point of view but not from the plant's point of view,\" Amendra said.\n\nTechniques used in bonsai include leaf trimming, pruning, wiring, clamping and defoliation. Copper or aluminium wire is wrapped around branches and trunks to hold them in place until they lignify (convert into wood).\n\nScrew-based clamps are also used for shaping trunks and branches and are a much greater force than wiring. To prevent damage to the tree, the clamps are tightened a little at a time and make their changes over a period of months or years.\n\nIn defoliating most or all of the leaves are removed by clipping partway along each leaf's petiole (thin stem that connects a leaf to its branch). Petioles later dry up and drop off or are manually removed once dry. The tree responds by producing a fresh crop of leaves, but defoliation weakens the tree.\n\nFlattened \"muscular\" trunks and exfoliating bark, revealing the white inner bark, add an extra special interest to the tree. If the soil does become too dry, the leaves will dry up and fall off; but in 2 weeks it buds out again. And by the 4th week the tree will be covered with new leaves and shoots!\n\nThis tree can be grown from cuttings and large branches can be air-layered to form good small trees quickly!\n\nAugust has been a busy time in my garden, even though we haven't had much rain. Morning, is the best time to be out though the mosquitos seem to be really thick this year. With school starting next week, I have to get as much done as I can before I am lost to faculty meetings and lesson plans. I plan to bring some of my baby bonsai to my classroom to introduce my students to the art form.\n\nI added a couple of pictures for you. I hope that you don't mind. Witt\n\nAtlast I able to post some of my bonsai picture. Though they are not in a very good condition cause the scorching heat. they will look good in the months of December and January. I requst everybody to take a look on it. And if you have any suggetions or comments please let me know. I will be highly obliged. thank you. have a good dayThe layered section was a lower branch that would not be suitable for the final design of the tree. We started the layer about 2 months ago and it had already established a good number of roots. Nothing fancy went into the prep work. I believe we used one side of a shear to shed the bark down to the cambium, then spread rooting hormone over the section and covered it in moist sphagnum moss and a section of a plastic. We then placed wire around the bag to tighten the seal and conserve the moisture."

      "text": "Free Tree Seedling\n\nThere are many different ways to get a free tree seedling. On Arbor Day, there are free trees shipped from companies like the Arbor Day Foundation as well as local nurseries and governments. Announcements usually appear in the local newspaper.\n\nCheck Local Organizations\n\nCheck with local organizations, particularly cabinet makers, lumber yards and those in the lumber industry. Many want to give back to the community by planting as many trees as possible and will offer free saplings for the asking.\n\nFree Tree Seedlings at School\n\nSome high schools and colleges offer a horticulture program and either give away or sell very cheaply tree seedlings to those who are interested in planting the trees on their property. Try calling your local Extension Office for information.\n\nAs Wedding Favors\n\nA unique idea for a wedding favor is to give out free tree seedlings as a celebration of life. Personalize the seedlings with a small card asking the family to plant the tree to help celebrate your new life together. While not all the guests will plant the seedlings, many will and you'll have the joy of knowing that the trees are growing as your love for one another does over the years.\n\nLocal Nurseries\n\nLocal nurseries and greenhouses will sometimes offer very small seedlings for free.\n\nAsk Friends and Family\n\nAnother option is to ask a friend of family member for seedlings from their yards. If you've seen a tree that you like in particular, you may want to get a seedling of that tree and nurture it into adulthood.\n\nPlanting Seedlings for School\n\nTeachers and home educators may want to encourage their students to plant a tree to gain a sense of community and to give something back, all while learning about science. Many organizations will donate free seedlings for this purpose.\n\nNot Trash but Trees\n\nTalk to your local nursery and home centers about taking any sickly looking trees off their hands. At the end of the season, many of these small trees are simply thrown away. However, with a little tender loving care, that small wilted tree may become a beautiful oak, maple or dogwood one day.\n\nFuture Seedling\n\nOne day, your tiny free seedling could turn into a bold and beautiful tree that will provide shade and comfort to your children and grandchildren.\n\nWhether you want to plant a blue spruce, a golden maple or a pine tree, LoveToKnow's handy Tree Identification guide will help you choose which tree sappling is perfect for your family."

      "text": "Oakleaf Hydrangeas\n\nPlant Taxonomy of Oakleaf Hydrangeas:\n\nPlant taxonomy classifies oakleaf hydrangeas as Hydrangea quercifolia. This is a case where the Latin genus name (Hydrangea) is so commonly used that it essentially doubles as a common name; when used as a common name, I don't capitalize the word. The cultivar that I have grown is 'Snow Queen.' For research purposes, note that the common species name for these plants is sometimes given as \"oak leaf\" hydrangeas (two words, instead of one).\n\nPlant Type for Oakleaf Hydrangeas:\n\nCharacteristics of Oakleaf Hydrangeas:\n\nIn summer, oakleaf hydrangea flowers in clusters, and the white flowers fade to a pinkish-brown in fall; their floral display is extremely long lasting. But the plant's distinguishing characteristic is its oak leaf-shaped foliage. The leathery leaves are large and turn purple, orangey-bronze or red in the fall. These shrubs routinely achieve a height of 4'-6' and a spread of 4'-6', but can grow to be larger than that. They are multi-stemmed shrubs, and the branches can shoot out from the center in any direction. Exfoliating bark offers winter interest.\n\nPlanting Zones for Oakleaf Hydrangea Shrubs:\n\nHydrangea quercifolia 'Snow Queen' shrubs can be grown in planting zones 5-9. The species plants are indigenous to the southeastern United States.\n\nSun and Soil Requirements for Oakleaf Hydrangeas:\n\nOakleaf hydrangea shrubs are understory plants in the wild. So in the South, give them afternoon shade; in the North, oakleaf hydrangeas can get by with less shade. Too much shade may reduce the intensity of their fall foliage color. Grow them in a well-drained soil with a slightly acidicsoil pH and plenty of humus.\n\nUses for Oakleaf Hydrangeas:\n\nWith their brilliant fall foliage and long blooming period, oakleaf hydrangea shrubs are attractive enough to function as specimen plants. As understory shrubs in the wild, they are also appropriate in woodland gardens. Their big leaves give them a coarse plant texture, useful as a contrast with plants of a more delicate texture. The dried flowers are used in crafts.\n\nPruning, Care for Oakleaf Hydrangeas:\n\nOakleaf hydrangea shrubs require little pruning: if a bush suffers damage (e.g., winter die-back), prune down to just below the damage. Mulch to keep the roots cool in summer, especially in hot regions.\n\nOutstanding Feature of Oakleaf Hydrangeas:\n\nWhile the shape of their leaves is their distinguishing feature, the outstanding feature of oakleaf hydrangea bushes may well be their long \"blooming\" period. I put \"blooming\" in quotes because it is not actually petals that are anchoring the floral display, but rather sepals. Sepals are sterile; since they can't be pollinated, they can't go to seed. Exempt from the reproduction process, they're free to just \"hang out\" -- and provide your yard with color throughout the summer. The true flowers on oakleaf hydrangeas are those tiny ones you see behind the sepals.\n\nWord Origin for Oakleaf Hydrangeas:\n\nI mentioned above that the scientific name for oakleaf hydrangeas is Hydrangea quercifolia. But how does that moniker break down? Well, we're all familiar with the Greek root hydr- as a reference to water, as in \"hydrate.\" Meanwhile, angeon comes from the Greek for \"vessel.\" Hydrangea seed pods supposedly resemble a water vessel? All I know is that most species require a lot of watering (oakleaf hydrangeas are an exception in this regard).\n\nAs for the species name, quercifolia, literally means \"oakleaf\" in Latin -- thus explaining the common name, too."

A leaf must have both sunlight and warmth for the chlorophyll to kick in.\n\nIn the wonderful magazine, Northern Woodlands, Michael Snyder wrote: \" If those newly emerged leaves are greeted by a cold snap or prolonged cloud cover, they cannot make chlorophyll and will remain reddish for an extended period.\n\n\"This red color in spring leaves is due to the same pigments responsible for the brilliant reds of autumn, the anthocyanins. Scientists studying the physiology of fall foliage have suggested that the anthocyanins responsible for red color in leaves – in fall or spring – may help them withstand cold and screen them from damaging ultraviolet rays, air pollution, and various other assaults\"\n\nMary Holland suggests another theoryIn her book Naturally Curious, : \"While there is not a complete understanding of this phenomenon, studies have shown that young leaves have less damage from herbivores (plant eaters). It is possible that the pigment anthocyanin, which produces the red color, makes red leaves less discernible to some insect herbivores, or makes insect herbivores more discernible to predators.\"\n\nWe predict our maples will be reddish on Victoria Day, which in Canada is (in the milder provinces, at least) considered the unofficial start of summer. Most Canadians take advantage of their three day weekend start working on their lawns and gardens—a pursuit which is taken very seriously by our neighbors to the north.\n\nIt is fitting that on Victoria Day, Crossroads will re-screen the film that inspired the Safe Lawn in Door County movement.\" A Chemical Reaction\" is a 70 minute feature documentary movie\" that tells the story of a powerful and effective community initiative which began in a small town in CanadaDescribed and the \"most effective tool ever created for advocates of pesticide reduction,\" the Emmy nominated documentary film was produced by Paul Tukey, who recently spoke at Crossroads and the Door County Sustainability Fair. We will show the film Monday May 20 at 3:00 and 7:00 for those who missed earlier showings and for those who, after meeting Paul Tukey, want to see it again.\n\nOn Wednesday, May 22, at 7:0 The Door County Environmental Council presents the lecture: \"Antibiotics Increasing in our Groundwater Supply.\" Andrew Werthmann, Wisconsin organizer for the PEW Campaign on Human Health and Industrial Agriculture a part of the PEW Charitable Trusts from Eau Claire will be speaking on the research of antibiotic use on livestock farms. The overuse of antibiotics for healthy farm animals is causing detrimental residue in our water supply. Andrew will be giving factual statistics on over-use of antibiotics in all agriculture with animal waste spreading and runoff and the resultant impact these abuses are having on our groundwater now and far into the future.\n\n]]> Day  07 May 2013 11:27:48 +0000cheeringa … continue reading]]>\n\nDuring our annual EGGstravaganza, one of the children asked, \"When a mother bird lays an egg, how long will it be before it hatches?\" As in most nature questions, the answer begins with \"It depends.\"\n\nSome baby birds such as chicks and ducklings are fully developed when they hatch. Within hours after emerging from their eggshells, they are cute and fluffy, and able to see, walk, and feed themselves. These precocial birds require about three or four weeks to develop before hatching.\n\nIn contrast, many of our songbirds are blind, naked, and helpless when they hatch. These scrawy pink infants must remain in the nest, cared for by the parents. Almost like premature human babies, these birds are born before they are fully developed. It make sense—and it turns out to be the case—that the birds which are born helpless have a shorter incubation time and smaller eggs.\n\nBut unlike human babies, which develop in the mother's body, bird embryos do their growing in the egg, and for development to take place, an egg must be warm—somewhere in the neighborhood of 104 degrees\n\nIf a mother bird lays an egg and does not sit on it, the unborn chick does not start to develop. Does this happen in nature? Absolutely.\n\nDuring their nesting season, most songbird mothers lay an egg every day or so. For example, it might take four or five days for a robin to lay four eggs. Yet all four baby birds hatch on the same day, usually simultaneously, or at least between minutes of each other. And this is important. It would be next to impossible for a mother bird to keep some eggs warm while trying to feed hungry hatchlings.\n\nSo the mother bird does not begin incubating the eggs until she has laid all of the eggs she is going to lay. This is not true of all birds, but apparently many species of birds have a specific number—a \"clutch size\"–that seems just right. This is more complicated than it sounds, because clutch size varies depending on the age of the mother bird, the time of year, and whether she is working on her first or second brood of the season.\n\nA mother bird just keeps laying eggs.-one a day until she instictively knows that enough is enough. Then, and only then, does she start incubating the clutch. Because of this behavior, all of the eggs are warmed the same length of time, even though they have been laid days apart.\n\nNesting seems to be late this year, probably due to the cold weather, and spring green up is late too, but on Mother's Day, there will be flowers at Crossroads. This will be my first Mother's Day since the death of my mother, and my most cherished memories of her involve tramping through the spring woods searching for wildflowers. We invite families to join us at 3:00 Sunday for a gentle ramble down to the creek and through the woodlands. Moms deserve flowers on Mother's Day.\n\nIf you enjoy searching for wildflowers, you might want to participate in the wildflower inventory of Crossroads. Every few years, we record the locations and blooming dates of the flowers of Crossroads. We hope to establish a long term record of weather and habitat changes. No experience is necessary, though shoes that can get wet are a good idea.\n\nSaturday night, the Door Peninsula Astronomical Society will hold a Viewing Night at our Astronomy Campus. Starting around 8:00 if there are clear skies, members of DPAS will share the wonders of the night sky. Views of Saturn should be spectacular this month. Viewin nights are free and open to the public.\n\n]]>Fish Report: The fish run has stopped (for now, anyway.) Plenty of dead suckers to observe.\n\nFinally, peeping can be heard at Crossroads at Big Creek. Near Hauser Pond, the evening are becoming quite noisy.\n\nThe extremely loud sounds are coming from tiny frogs…which, for fairly obvious reasons, are call Spring Peepers. About an inch from snout to vent, these frogs are for many, the herald of spring. …the signal that the forests are coming alive.\n\nAll winter, adult peepers hibernated underground in the forest, often far from ponds. Strange as it sounds, their little bodies actually freeze solid, but their cells do not rupture and once they thaw, they come to life and seem compelled to find mates. Instinctively, they know that eggs must be laid in water….a pond or a spring woodland puddle. It just has to be deep enough for tadpole development.\n\nOnce they find their pond, the males climb up on a piece of grass or emergent vegetation or even low hanging tree limbs. The are able to stick onto plant parts thanks to sticky pads on their toes. And from this perch, they sing to attract mates. And when the mating occurs, the eggs drop directly into the water.\n\nA male peeper sings by blowing up what appears to be bubble gum, but what actually is his throat. A Peepers puffs up his throats to almost equal his body size. Vocal chords are located in the throat.\n\nTo sing, (and the song is music to my ears, and irresistible to female peepers) the frog forces air between his mouth and lungs. The air produces sound which is amplified by the puffed up throat.\n\nEven amplified, the peep of one peeper is not very loud. But the sound of one tiny frog is amplified to enormous volumes by the sheer number of frogs in a pond.\n\nVolunteerism is like that. One volunteer, working with total heart and energy, can only do so much. But one person's efforts, amplified by sheer number, can do amazing things. Our group is called Friends of Crossroads. This group of volunteers meet the first Monday of each month at 6:30 to plan events, to organize tasks, and to serve as a focus group for Crossroads. This month, the group will be planning summer project and programs and they would welcome more new members.\n\nIndividuals of all ages and abilties are invited to volunteer at Crossorads as a part of the United Way Day of Caring. Indoor and outdoor tasks ranging from organizating the kitchen to planting trees will be accomplished between 9:00-noon, and all volunteers will receive a complimentary breakfast, courtesy of McDonalds and a great LIVE UNITED T-shirt.\n\nRunning Green for Crossroads, scheduled for June 22, is looking for volunteers. And organizers tell us that Run Volunteers are looking for early entry forms as well. It really helps the committee order shirts, prizes and refreshments when they have firm numbers, plus, pre-registration saves you money. Those who register before June 12 receive a signifacnt price break. Visit  for information and registration forms.\n\nEven the Door Peninsula Astronomical Society is looking for volunteers to help with summer astronomy outreach programs. This group will hold its May General Meeting at 7:00 May 7 at the Stonecipher Astronomy Center. DPAS invited vistors to enjoy a screening of Cosmos Episode #2 followed by a review by Professor Ray Stonecipher and a short progam about\"Galileo's Burial Site.\" by Dave Luhrs. Refreshments will be served.\n\n]]> Run  28 Apr 2013 20:13:45 +0000cheeringa suckers are running in Big Creek. Not peak yet, but many fish.

I replied that when I was little, there were not quite as many, but yes, there were Disney Princesses. Correctly surmising that I probably never was a girly-girl, she timidly asked if I had a favorite. Oh, yes. I loved Snow White, and I was both enchanted and horrified by the Grimm's fairy tale and the Disney movie.\n\nHaving grown up in the safety of a loving family, I was simply shocked..SHOCKED… that a grown-up would give a poison apple to a child. Grownups were supposed to protect children from danger. Grownups kept children safe when they played and gave them healthy food to eat. Giving a child poison? Really? No wonder they called the queen \"evil.\"\n\nToday's parents and grandparents, school and park officials, and land managers no doubt care passionately about the safety of children (and of pets and wild birds) and would probably never knowingly expose them to poison, but alas, they do that very thing when they apply certain chemicals to their lawns.\n\nAbout a year ago, representatives from Door Property Owners, Sustain Door, and Wild Ones gathered at Crossroads to preview a film called \"A Chemical Reaction,\" In this award winning documentary, spokesman Paul Tukey exposes the harmful consequences of the overuse of pesticides and profiles the experience of a small Canadian community's successful battle with an industrial giant in stopping the nonessential use of lawn chemicals. The film examines evidence that pesticides harm the environment and can be detrimental to human and animal health, leading to cancers, neurological damage and other autoimmune disorders.\n\nWe at Crossroads were so moved by this film, we immediately created a Policy of Chemical and Fertilizer Restrictions to Lawn and Gathering Areas which was passed unanimously by the Crossroads Board of Directors. Last June, Crossroads hosted a public screening of \"A Chemical Reaction.\" The reaction to that showing was the creation ofa new organization/movement: Safe Lawns in Door County.\n\nOn the DPO website, Safe Lawns in Door Countystates: \" We all have the right to go to public places without being exposed to unnecessary health risks. Contact exposure of people, especially children, to known toxic pesticides and herbicides has been linked to cancer and asthma. Children are more susceptible to chemicals than adults because of their proximity to the lawn, in addition to taking in more pesticides relative to body weight and the vulnerability of developing organ systems that are less able to detoxify toxic chemicals. Similar to second hand smoke, pesticide spray can and does drift, yet we continue to spray our sports fields which are often near schools.\"\n\nIn conjunction with the Sustainability Fair, Safe Lawns in Door County is bringing Paul Tukey, North America's leading advocate for natural lawn care, to Crossroads on Friday, April 26, at 7:00. During the free lecture, Tukey will address the hazards of lawn care products and explore the benefits of non-toxic lawn care with safer and equally beautiful alternatives.

During the question and answer session, I got the courage to ask: \"What definition does NASA use for intelligent life? \"\n\nWithout missing a beat, he replied, \"Chipmunks and above.\"\n\nChipmunks certainly are intelligent if the criteria is \"the ability to solve problems.\" At Crossroads, at home, and at my summer job at Interlochen, I feed birds, which is to say, I feed squirrels and chipmunks. These critters have no difficulty solving problems or outsmarting me.\n\nSeveral years ago, I moved my supply of sunflower seeds inside the rustic nature museum where I work each summer. This wooden building is not airtight, nor is it rodent-tight, especially after a chipmunk gnawed a hole near the door. Understand that this chipmunk was not intending to eat. Instead, the petite striped creature was intent on collecting and caching food for the winter.\n\nHe gnawed into the seed bag and quickly stuffed his cheeks with seeds. Chipmunk cheeks expand, and according to my students (who conducted a little investigation), a chipmunk can cram as many as fifty black oil seeds into his chubby cheeks. After stuffing his cheeks, he scampers back to his borrow, stashes the seeds and hurries back for another cheekful.\n\nOn one particular trip, the chipmunk must have been nearing his capacity, for when he reached the hole by the door, cheeks protruding so much that he looked like he had the mumps, he couldn't get out. He knew this immediately because when his cheeks are are fully extended, touch-sensitive whiskers stick straight out and warn him if his head is wider than the opening. It was.\n\nSo, the chipmunk had a problem. What to do? Body language and tail flicking demonstrated frustration and puzzlement. But then, the chipmunk jettisoned two seeds and tried the opening. Nope. Three? Four? Leaving five seeds inside the building , he was able to squeeze through the opening and run to his burrow. In no time flat, he was back, nabbing the five seeds and returning to the burrow with the full load.\n\nChipmunks encounter problems, and they seem capable of solving them. Humans also encounter problems…. as soon as they get outside in the spring. How does one handle problems in the garden? with growing native plants? and with insect, disease and drought problems in a forest? Or for that matter, the shortage of good water throughout the world?\n\nWell, a good start in problem solving would be to attend a program Crossroads.\n\nWild Ones of Door County is an organization dedicated to landscaping with native plants. The plant species found here have spent the ages adapting to this particular mix of temperature, moisture, soil, ph, etc. and are unique in the world. Over the millennia they've formed what Aldo Leopold called the \"land organism.\" They've developed expertise; think of it as floristic wisdom… they know how to deal with these specific conditions.\n\nOn Saturday, April 13, at 2:00 Wild Ones invites the public to the free program \"Nurturing Biodiversity. Presenter Dale Goodner and his wife Mary will \"discuss modeling and structuring their own backyard ecosystem (garden), in order to better fit in with this place. While our landscape includes vegetables, and also features horticultural varieties of plants, they use native flora to better establish a sense of place, and also to better attract animals.\" The Goodners moved to Algoma in May 2010, after 34 years in Peoria, IL, where Dale served as Chief Naturalist at Peoria Park District's Forest Park Nature Center for some 20 years, and then was Supervisor of Interpretive Services, overseeing 5 facilities, including the George Luthy Botanical Garden, before retiring in 2009. Mary is a professional horticulturist. The Goodners will report on decades of experience, illustrating the lecture with stunning photographs of Door County flowers and landscapes.\n\nAs spring begins, Door County Master Gardeners are scouring seed catalogs, dreaming about this year's garden, and making plans to correct the nagging problems that have faced their home gardens in the past. At the same time they are budgeting for seed and plant purchases, they are also working to discover the best way to economically fix those things that went wrong last year.\n\nOn Tuesday, April 16 at 7:00 Master Gardeners invite fellow gardeners to join them for a program called \"Garden Survival 101- Small Projects to Fix Big Problems\" designed to help Door County gardeners navigate the treacherous waters of home garden improvement projects. The guest presenter is Jason Feldman of Jason Feldman Landscapes, Sturgeon Bay. Jason will discuss the wide range of problems gardeners typically face here and then focus on several of them in detail (for example, rainwater runoff issues) to show how down-to-earth common sense solutions can be found to correct them. Utilizing common sense, gardeners can correct almost any problem they face, so understanding how the process works to provide down to earth solutions in specific examples gives the home gardener another tool he or she can use to fix the unique issues they face at their own homes without spending a fortune.\n\nWhile gardeners worry about problems in the garden, members of DCIST, the Door County Invasive Species Team, are thinking about the problems in the forest. On Wednesday April 17, at 2:00, DCIST will present the program Insect and Disease Issues from 2012. Linda Williams, a Forest Health Specialist from the Wisconsin DNR , will speak on last year's weather events, specifically the drought and heat, and how it has impacted (and will continue to affect) our trees and forests. The program will include a discussion on insect pests that caused problems last year, the impacts of weather on forest pests, and what we can expect in the future. Updates on emerald ash borer and beech bark disease also will be provided. This program is free and open to the public.\n\nThe Door County Environmental Council begins their 2013 educational series on Wednesday, April 17 at 7:00 with a free screening of a powerful documentary \"Last Call at the Oasis\". Because America has had ample water until now,we tend to be spoiled, blasé and unaware when it comes to the international water situation. Make no mistake, as the film says, water is about to become more valuable than oil — it's the element the wars of the 21st century will be fought over. We are using too much water, and fouling what we use.\n\nThough the crisis is global, \"Last Call\" for the most part focuses on situations in the U.S. with a case study of Las Vegas. The real problem is that the city has been allowed to grow more than it should given how little water it has. The city relies entirely on the massive Hoover Dam and enormous Lake Mead to provide water, but that lake is shrinking at an alarming rate, dropping 10 feet a year. The time is in sight where there will be so little water that the dam will stop producing electricity, a situation no one ever thought was possible.Water crusader Erin Brokovich, family farm protector Lynn Henning, Johnny Cash, Julia Roberts and a host of other concerned activists convey the important water message in this powerful presentation. A short discussion will follow the film.\n\nIf we are intelligent life, perhaps we can work on ways to solve our problems.\n\n]]> Season for Seeds  31 Mar 2013 12:23:18 +0000cheeringa … continue reading]]>An of an individual seed actually growing into a healthy plant are dismal.\n\nHere in Wisconsin, a seed must first survive winter. It might rot or mildew. The seed could become a meal of some ravenous little animal. Or be corpted by an insect larva. Or any of number of things.\n\nBeing cold does not hurt seeds. In fact, many of our native seeds cannot sprout unless they have been frozen for a while, and then thawed. (This is a survival feature–if seeds could germinate whenever the weather is mild, we would have had seeds sprouting last January.)\n\nBut when (true) spring does arrive and seeds start to grow, every seedling requires certain conditions: a combination of nutrients, chemical balance, the right temperatures and humidity. Too little or too much of anything can be devastating. And oh, by the way, every species of plants has a unique set of requirements, so conditions that are is good for one seedling are not necessarily good for another.\n\nWhen any one environmental variable is in short supply in a habitat—and one usually is, [scientists call this the \"limiting factor\"] plants must compete. The limiting factor in a forest habitat often is sunlight. Seedlings that fail to get enough light weaken and eventually die. Last year, in many Wisconsin habitats, the limiting factor was water. And some seedlings didn't make it.\n\nIn a very real way, a garden is a habitat. To thrive, seeds planted in a garden also require certain conditions. It is up to the gardener to create the best possible conditions for each kind of seed to flourish. But in the artificial habitat, a gardener can at least try to manipulate the soil texture and nutrients, to provide the appropriate amount of water at the appropriate time of day, and to control weeds and harmful insects (while encouraging the helpful ones), so that plants have the best possible chance to flower or to produce vegetables. Gardening is a complicated endeavor.\n\nSo each spring, A Garden Workshop for Families, offered by Master Gardeners, Pat's Patch, and the Community's Garden and Crossroads, is held in the Collins Learning Center and the Heritage Garden at The Crossroads. Families take part in a four-session workshop during which they make soil blocks and plant seeds in the Crossroads greenhouse, discover how to make good garden soil, and learn how to keep weeds under control. The best part is that at the end of the workshop, each family leaves with an assortment of vegetable starts which they can grow at home or in the Community's Garden.\n\nThe family workshop will be offered from 6:00-7:30 on Tuesdays, April 9, April 23, May 7, and May 21. While the parents attend the lectures about sustainable gardening, the children participate in nature-related activities outdoors (weather-permitting) But everyone helps with the planting and tending of the plants, and the young and old alike enjoy the samples of homegrown vegetables. The materials fee is $15 per family and the class is filling up fast. Pre-registration is required. For information about space availability, contact Jenny Spude at UW-Extension Nutrion Educator (920) 746-5994.\n\nThis week, the history video The Loggers of Door County will be screened on Wednesday, April 3 at 3:30. This video documentary , created by the Door County Historical Society, tells the story of the logging era in Door County. Free and open to the public.\n\n]]>TRAILS: Poor and deteriorating. But the pussy willows are coming out!\n\nYes, the day before Easter, Crossroads at Big Creek will hold \"that egg thing\" again. EGGstravaganza is our annual celebration of eggs, but it is not a hunt. Instead, learners of all ages explore the wonders of eggs…..the strength, the shape, the variations. Last year, the explorations took place outside on lush green grass. But whatever the weather, we will hold the event on Saturday, March 30 at 1:00.\n\nBoiled eggs are significant in the commemorations of several religious holidays. So this week, many people will be cracking and peeling eggs. But perhaps because they are so familiar, we seldom take the time to appreciate that eggs are structurally beautiful…amazing really.\n\nConsider that the thin shell must be strong enough to protect the embryonic chick from the being squashed by a setting hen. And the egg shape is much stronger than a cube. The egg shape is so remarkably strong because the rounded end is rather like a dome, an architectural form constructed as to exert an equal thrust in all directions. The the mother bird does not break the shell because no single point on the supports her weight.\n\nBut don't assume all bird eggs are shaped like the eggs of domestic chickens. Some wild birds have eggs which are almost round. Other eggs are so tapered at one end that they are almost pointed. The shape of an egg is usually determined by the nest environment.\n\nBirds that nest in holes tend to have the spherical eggs. Spheres are very strong, but they roll. But in a deep cavity nest, rolling eggs have nowhere to go. In contrast, birds that nest on cliffs have very tapered eggs. And that a good thing. If a cone-shaped egg moves, it will roll in a tight circle rather than plummet over the edge.\n\nThose that nest on bare ground tend to lay very tapered eggs. In fact, most shorebirds lay four eggs which they arrange with the pointed ends toward the middle so they fit together like the pieces of a pie. Not only are they less likely to roll away, but fitting close together with very little space in between them, the tapered eggs actually keep each other warm.\n\nA round or tapered egg is much easier to lay than, say, a cube (ouch!) but I was surprised to learn that the blunt end comes out first. It seems that as the mother bird pushes the egg out of her oviduct, she squeezes with her muscles, and on the final push, she squeezes harder, so the not completely hardened shell becomes pointed on one end. (Apparently, as a hen ages, her eggs become rounder because her muscles aren't as strong as those of a spring chicken.)Learners of all ages are welcome to participate in this EGGciting annual activity.\n\nOn Tuesday, April 2, at 7:00 the Door Peninsula Astronomical Society will hold April meeting at the Stonecipher Astronomy Center. Program \" Apps for Astronomy\" will be presented by Dave Udell & Tom Minahan. Dr. John J. Beck will present the Viewing Target of the Month. Refreshments will be served. Visitors are encouraged to attend the meeting.\n\nHowever, the Learning Center will be closed on Easter Sunday and the will be no Community Ski."

      "text": "Root Rot\n\nRoot rot is a disease that can affect a range of plants in your garden and which can spread through the soil. It can kill plants in a very short space of time and can be difficult to control. Some plants are very susceptible to this disease. Don Burke recently looked at a product which will help in the control and prevention of root rot.\n\nWhat is root rot?\n\nRoot rot is the common name for phytophthora root rot (Phytophthora spp.), a fungal disease which infects fine roots and root hairs of many plants. It is spread throughout the garden where there are moist soils.\n\nSymptoms include: wilting (although the plant is not in need of water)\n\nyellowing leaves\n\nthe sudden dying back of some or all of the plant\n\nthe plant becoming loose in the soil\n\nstem lesions appearing near the base of the plant (for example with citrus). Gum is released from fissures in the bark of the plant in woody species.\n\nThis disease also affects pot plants but the plant may become infected well before symptoms are displayed.\n\nPlants affected?\n\nMany plants are affected by root rot and range from small plants such as strawberries through to larger trees. Many Australian native plants and plants in the protea family can be very susceptible to root rot problems especially in poorly drained soils. Particularly susceptible plants include boronias, macadamias, waratahs and proteas.\n\nTreatment\n\nRecommended treatments have included fungicides such as Fongarid, which are very expensive to apply and can be toxic to other organisms.\n\nNow on the market is a phosphonate fungicide sold as Phosacid 200 or Foli-R-Fos 200 which has phosphorous acid as its active ingredient. Phosphorous acid (different from phosphoric acid) eventually breaks down to produce phosphate and has no serious effects on the environment.\n\nPhosacid and Foli-R-Fos are safe, effective and easy to apply. They can be used as a protectant or as a cure and are said to stimulate the defence system of the plant.\n\nPhosacid 200 has been used successfully on Australian native plants and commercial proteas, and is useful for prevention and cure of root rot, as well as for the treatment of downy mildew on citrus, avocados and grapes.\n\nAlthough this fungicide contains phosphorus, our trials have found no problems arise from using phosphonates such as Phosacid 200 on phosphorus sensitive native plants such as grevilleas and banksias.\n\nMethod of application\n\nPhosacid is sprayed over foliage or used as a soil drench. Follow the directions on the label for both application methods and rates. As a guideline: read the label\ndilute Phosacid 200 as directed for your particular problem (see directions on container)\nspray onto leaves (it is taken by the plant down to its roots) or use as a soil drench\n\nTip: A small spray pump bottle from the supermarket is ideal for applying this treatment.\n\nProduct safety\n\nAccording to the manufacturers, this product is less toxic than table salt, however it is wise to avoid contact with eyes and skin and always to wash hands after use.\n\nAvailability\n\nProduct names: Phosacid 200 and Foli-R-Fos 200\n\nStockists: These chemicals may not be in stock at your local nursery. Look for them instead at rural suppliers such as Elders Stockmans.\n\nCost and container sizes:\n\nPhosacid 200 costs around $20-$25 and comes in a 5 litre container, which could last the average home gardener many years. This product is manufactured by Craig Mostyn & Co Pty Ltd. Phone: (02) 9475 3200.\n\nThe smallest container of Foli-R-Fos 200 is 25 litre and retails for approximately $80. This product is manufactured by U.I.M. Agrochemicals (Aust.) Pty Ltd. Phone: (07) 3277 2077"

If trees are kept in optimal condition - with sufficient water, nutrients and light - they are less susceptible to pest problems and disease.\n\nIf your tree develops any abnormality, or isn't thriving as it once was, consider having a certified arborist assess it to correctly diagnose the problem. An Arborwood expert will look at the tree type, abnormality patterns in roots, leaves, and trunk, as well as surrounding factors to determine the nature of the problem. It is essential to distinguish between an infestation, an infectious disease and a non-infectious disorder to determine the treatment that will be effective.\n\nArborwood tree experts are trained and licensed to diagnose and treat insect and disease problems, and it is our policy to use the least toxic methods and products."

Plus, what to do when one lives under (and gnaws on) your porch. Get up close, but not too close, to porcupines.\n\nPorcupines are adapted to climb trees in search of food, but they can still make mistakes. According to Dr. Curt Stager, it is not uncommon for porcupines to mess up and fall out of a tree.\n\nPorcupines are less likely to fall in the winter time. \"They are usually gnawing on bark, chewing off the outer layer, and then getting at the inner bark. They can use their four legs and squeeze the trunk with the insides of their legs and then they use their tail as a prop, and stick the quills into the trunk a little bit to hold them.\"\n\nDuring the summer they are much more likely to fall. Then they are up in the canopy eating leaves near the end of the tree, \"Usually they will nip the twigs off, pulling them in, and strip off the juiciest part of the leaf and drop it. These are called nip twigs and you can see them at the bases of trees,\" says Stager.\n\nThe author of \"The North American Porcupine,\" finding a porcupine dead beneath a tree, assumed it had fallen. During autopsy, he found that the head was bruised, but he also found an old fracture on the left side of its hip. The claws on the right side were worn down, showing that it had used the right paw more frequently than the left. These injuries probably led to its fatal fall.\n\nPorcupines can be very destructive of property. Plywood contains sodium and porcupines happen to be sodium deficient, because the plant matter they consume lacks the nutrient. Stager says, \"Any place there is salt they will go for it, so just plain old plywood or salt left behind from sweaty hands on an axe handle will attract them.\" The author of \"The North American Porcupine\" found that it was mostly females to blame for damage to structures during the spring season while nursing their young, which creates an increased demand for salt.\n\nA study conducted at a summer camp found that the boy's cabins were the main target of attack by porcupines. This was due to the large amount of sodium left behind from the boys urinating on the sides of the wooden cabin."

The 1 to 2.5-inch-long needles are stiff and twisted, forming blue/green tufts of foliage at branch tips, and creating an overall fine texture to the tree's silhouette.

      "text": "Fruiting\n\nThis section deals with plants, trees, and shrubs that are beneficial to wildlife (specifically birds) for the fruit they produce. Providing fruit producing shrubs and trees can be a boost to the birds visiting your yard - especilly for late-summer and migration. Some fruits are left overwinter to ripen and soften, providing an overwinter, or early spring food source for residents and early migrants.\n\nAlso known as Candleberry, Bayberry is adaptable to a range of landscape conditions including poor, sterile, sandy soils and heavy clay soils. The leaves can be up to 4 inches long and possibly an inch wide. The leaf color is a lustrous dark green. A unique quality of the leaf is that it is aromatic when brushed or crushed. Even the slightest contact with the plant produces the aroma which is rather pleasant. The leaves are retained well into the fall before dropping. The flowers on the plant are small and white or green in color. Flowering is in late March or early April before the new crop of leaves emerge. The berries are a preferred food of tree swallows, eastern meadowlarks, red bellied woodpeckers and gray catbirds to name a few. Bayberry shrubs also make good nest sites for songbirds.\n\nA very shade tolerant tree - often excelling in the understory of established farm groves, Red Mulberry produces an edible red-purple drupe that resembles blackberry. The fruit is used in jams and wines, and is relished by many wildlife species. Fruiting in June provides nesting catbirds, thrashers, and robins with a plentiful source of sweet fruit. Mulberry can tolerate a variety of moist soil conditions, and can even tolerate seasonal flooding.\n\nBirds: late-fall migrants, and into winter species such as cedar waxwing, yellow-bellied sapsucker, mockingbird, purple finch, and robin.\n\nHackberry is a 40-60' tall tree with a 30' spread. This tree can attain very large proportions, usually reaching 40'-60' tall. When grown in the open, it develops a short bole and a large rounded crown. A native North American tree that is widely distributed in the east, and the Great Plains, Hackberry prefers full sun to partial shade, grows in a variety of soils, and is very draught tolerant. Hackberry fruit is a round drupe with a thin, sweet, edible pulp enclosing a bony, cream-colored nutlet. The fruit, which is usually variable in size, form and color is dark orange or red to dark purple or black in color. The fruit persists though the winter, but most are consumed or fall off by the spring by some of the 25+ species of birds that feed on it, including cedar waxwing, yellow-bellied sapsucker, mockingbird, robin, and others.\n\nEastern Wahoo (Euonymus atropurpurea) 8-15' tall/6-15' wide. Sometimes referred to as \"burning bush\", the name 'Wahoo' is derived from the Native American Otoe word meaning arrowwood. It's a native plant that can be grown into a large shrub or small tree, up to 15 feet tall, or trimmed to maintain a lower height. The branches are gray to dark brown with ridges or scales, like the non-native winged Euonymus or \"burning bush\" plants. Wahoo plants produce crimson-red, fleshy fruit in four-lobed capsules that attract a wide variety of birds. The fruit remains on the plant all winter. People are drawn to its outstanding fall color of pink to deep red leaves. It is an adaptable plant, able to withstand hot, dry conditions along with moist and cool conditions. Grows in full sun to part shade. Older, specimen plants will develop horizontal branching. Great for naturalized plantings."

The flowers are produced in catkins 4–20 cm long, with the female flowers at the base of the catkin and males on the rest. The fruit is a densely spiny cupule 4–8 cm diameter, containing two or three glossy brown nuts; these are 2–3 cm diameter on wild trees. The scientific name mollissima derives from the softly downy shoots and young leaves.[1][2]\n\nChinese chestnuts have evolved over a long period of time in coexistence with the bark fungal disease chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica, formerly Endothia parasitica), and have evolved a very successful resistance to the blight, probably more so than any other species of chestnut, so that, although it is not immune, it typically sustains no more than minor damage when infected. This is in stark contrast to the American chestnut, which had no resistance to the blight, and was nearly wiped out by it after the introduction of the blight from Asia to North America. An active program has been pursued in North America to cross-breed the Chinese and American chestnuts to try to maximize various desirable traits of the American chestnut, such as larger stature, larger leaf size, larger nut size, and greater nut sweetness, while also isolating and carrying the blight resistance from the Chinese chestnut.[5]\n\nThe nuts are edible, and the tree is widely cultivated in eastern Asia; over 300 cultivars have been selected for nut production, subdivided into five major regional groups: Northern, Yangtze River Valley, Sichuan and Guizhou, Southern and Southwestern. Besides that, the Dandong chestnut (belonging to the Japanese chestnut – Castanea crenata) is a major cultivar in Liaoning Province.[6] Some cultivars, such as 'Kuling', 'Meiling', and 'Nanking', have large nuts up to 4 cm diameter. The nuts are sweet, and considered by some to have the best taste of any chestnut,[7] though others state they are not as good as the American chestnut.[8] The nuts also provide a significant food source for wildlife."

      "text": "American chestnut tissue culture and transformation The American Chestnut Research and Restoration Project\n\nAmerican chestnut tissue culture\n\nPlant tissue culture (also known as micropropagation) is a method of propagating plants asexually in aseptic conditions. The four main steps of micropropagation are establishment, multiplication, rooting and acclimatization. An additional step, regeneration, is needed for embryo tissue culture. The following explains the process of tissue culture for American chestnut somatic embryos (non-zygotic embryos established from zygotic cells). All steps are performed in a laminar-flow hood that uses a HEPA filter to keep the air aseptic. The whole process can take between 18 to 24 months.\n\nEstablishment\n\nTo establish American chestnut somatic embryos in tissue culture, the nut is removed from the spiny bur and then sterilized with bleach to rid it of microorganisms. The cleaned nut is cut open and the ovules are removed and placed on an embryo initiation medium (a semi-solid gel containing nutrients, vitamins, sugar and hormones) in a sterilize Petri dish. After a few weeks, some of the embryos will begin to grow, however, the majority of the embryos will either become contaminated or die. The embryos that do survive are now ready to be multiplied.\n\nMultiplication\n\nOnce an embryo is established, it can be multiplied. By using a certain combination of hormones in the medium, new embryos will begin to grow out of the original one. As more embryos develop, the nutrients in the medium become exhausted. The new embryos are separated into smaller groups and transferred to fresh medium. Every two to three weeks, as more embryos grow, they are separated and transferred to fresh medium.\n\nRegeneration\n\nThe next step is to regenerate the embryos into shoots. To do this, the concentration of nutrients, sugar and hormones in the medium is changed. There are a total of three different media used during this process. Once the shoots develop, they are multiplied on yet another medium. The shoots are cut into smaller segments and transferred to fresh medium once month.\n\nRooting\n\nNow the shoots are ready to be rooted. They are dipped into a liquid solution of a rooting hormone and then placed in a charcoal medium to absorb the excess hormone. Anywhere from 10 to 60 percent of the shoots going through this process will develop roots. These rooted plants are put in potting mix and then they go through an acclimatization process.\n\nAcclimatization\n\nThis has proven to be the most difficult part of American chestnut tissue culture. The plants are very sensitive to slight environmental changes and will die under the wrong circumstances. Lids are kept over the plants to reproduce the high humidity they were used to in tissue culture. The lids are removed in stages to let the plants get acclimated to ambient conditions slowly. They are watered and fertilized when needed. Only one to three percent of plants going through acclimatization survive to be planted in the field.\n\nAmerican Chestnut Transformation\n\nTo add potential blight-resistance genes to the American chestnut genome, a method known as Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is being used. This method uses a bacterium called Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which is a natural genetic engineer. Wild-type Agrobacterium lives in the soil and colonizes small wounds near the root collar of many plant species. When the Agrobacterium encounters a wound, it attaches itself to plant cells, pokes a microscopic hole into the cell and injects small pieces of DNA. The DNA travels to the nucleus and is incorporated into the chromosomes of the plant. Wild-type Agrobacterium injects genes that cause the plant's cells to divide rapidly, producing a warty gall, and to produce food that only the Agrobacterium can use. Scientists have \"tamed\" Agrobacterium strains so that they insert genes of interest to the research project instead of the genes that are only adventageous to the bacterium.\n\nTo transform American chestnut somatic embryos, we use this Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method. This means we use a \"dis-armed\" strain of Agrobacterium containing our putative resistance enhancing gene and selectable and scorable marker genes. The Agrobacterium is mixed together with the embryos in a test tube. The bacterium is given enough time to inject the designer DNA into the plant cells and then the embryos are moved to a medium containing antibiotics that will kill the bacterium but not the plant cells. The plant cells that have not taken up the new DNA are eliminated with a tiny dose of an herbicide that won't harm the transformed cells. The embryos that have been transformed are then regenerated into whole plants.\n\nThe pictures below follow the process from inoculating medium with the Agrobacterium (fig. 1), co-cultivating the Agrobacterium with chestnut embryos (fig. 2), desicating the Agro/embryo mix and then visualizing the transformed cells using the green fluorescent protein, GFP, marker (fig. 3), and the selection of transgenic embryo clumps again using the GFP marker (fig. 4). The embryos are then multiplied and regenerated into whole plants as described in process above. GFP was chosen as a marker because it have been show to be a safe and non-destructive marker system that can be used in transformation and subsequent environmental studies.\n\nThe first American chestnuts to be transformed this way contain an oxalate oxadase gene that originates from wheat (reference below). Several American chestnut plantlets with this gene have been planted outdoors and are doing well. Currently we are working on transforming more American chestnut somatic embryos using other blight-resistance genes."

It is a small to medium size tree 15-20 m tall with smooth grey bark even in old age, its life span being a maximum of 60-100 years. The leaves are matt green, ovoid, 5-11 cm long and 4-8 cm broad.\n\nThis species fixes atmospheric nitrogen and is also tolerant of polluted soils, it can be used for land reclamation, especially on coal tips;\nThis is an excellent pioneer species for re-establishing woodlands on disused farmland, difficult sites etc. Its fast rate of growth means that it quickly provides sheltered conditions to allow more permanent woodland trees to become established. In addition, bacteria on the roots fix atmospheric nitrogen - whilst this enables the tree to grow well in quite poor soils it also makes some of this nitrogen available to other plants growing nearby. Alder trees also have a heavy leaf canopy and when the leaves fall in the autumn they help to build up the humus content of the soil. Alder seedlings do not compete well in shady woodland conditions and so this species gradually dies out as the other trees become established;\nThe bark and the fruits contain up to 20% tannin;\nWood - light, soft, fairly elastic, easy to split. Used for clogs, bowls, woodcuts etc. Much valued by cabinet makers;"

Most other shrubs will benefit from a little trimming now.\n\n• Prune roses, eliminating dead shoots. Once roses send out tiny red buds that will turn into stems, they are ready for pruning. When the stems are about 1/2 inch long, the rose is pretty well out of dormancy. You should be able to tell what wood is alive and what has been killed by winter cold and should be removed.\n\n• Spray fruit trees with dormant oil. Do this when the temperature is above 40 degrees. Dormant oil, available at garden centers, prevents scale insects, spider mites and other pests later in the season. You can also spray dormant oil on roses and other trees and shrubs that have been troubled by pests in the past."

Yet the modern day British conifer is all of those things as will be demonstrated during National Conifer Week 2010 which runs from 2 – 10 October. This is a campaign that originates from the Horticultural Trades Association which represents growers in the UK.\n\nEvergreens and conifers are traditionally planted in spring and autumn, and conifers in particular are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your garden. There is a huge range of different shapes and sizes of conifer to make traditional and contemporary displays, conifers that will suit containers as well as borders, and varieties which will make good ground cover, low and medium tall shrubberies as well as stately trees. Conifers represent a fantastic group of plants that can fit into most gardens often as stand-alone features to give height to borders, or create a formal look for a path or around a doorway. They are really striking when covered with snow or frost in winter. In truth their popularity was at its peak in the 70's but they have achieved something of a well earned revival in recent years. The fact that they do work well with so many other plants is a real advantage especially where space is limited and the choice of plants is critical. Not all conifers are huge, fast-growing types; there are some excellent dwarf growing varieties as well as some that make neat upright or bushy shapes.\n\nAnd conifers don't stay the same colour all year round – many of them change colour with the seasons, so you can achieve fabulous splashes of orange, blue or purple in autumn and winter when other plants are dormant, as well as fresh vibrant greens and yellows in spring.\n\nA final positive in their favour; they are mostly easy to care for and as long as they're planted in the right spot will only need a little pruning and watering, Conifers tolerate a wide range of soil types and conditions, putting up with much that other evergreens would not.\n\nTry to match conifers to your garden situation; for smaller gardens avoid varieties which grow very quickly or get very big. As a rule it is best to buy good sized specimens of slow-growing cultivars for smaller gardens. It gives a mature look straightaway and there is virtually no pruning required.\n\nFeeding is very straight forward – a root feed when planting such as bonemeal, rose fertiliser or Vitax Q4, and then again in spring to support the new seasons growth. Conifers in pots benefit from liquid feeding but only when the plants are actually making growth and not in the dormant season."

      "text": "What is Phomopsis tip blight? Phomopsis tip blight is one of the most common fungal diseases of conifers in Wisconsin. Eastern red cedar, creeping and Rocky Mountain junipers, arborvitae, Douglas-fir, true firs, larch and jack pine are most commonly affected by the disease.\n\nWhat does Phomopsis tip blight look like? Initially, small gray lesions (spots) form on the terminal four to six inches of new shoots in early spring. Infected branches typically first turn dull red or brown, and finally ash-gray as lesions expand to girdle and kill branch tips. Small, black pycnidia (the reproductive structures of the causal fungus) can easily be seen on dead branches with the unaided eye or with a hand lens. Severe infections may result in death of an entire plant.\n\nWhere does Phomopsis tip blight come from? Phomopsis tip blight is caused by the fungus Phomopsisjuniperovora, which survives in diseased branches. Spores of the fungus are produced throughout the growing season, and are spread by wind and rain. Infections can occur whenever new foliage is produced, and moisture or humidity is high. Most infections occur in the spring, but late summer infections can occur when over-watering or over-fertilization stimulates new growth.\n\nHow do I save a juniper with Phomopsis tip blight? Prune out and destroy diseased branches as they appear. Always prune in dry weather and cut four to six inches below obviously diseased areas on each branch. Disinfest pruning shears after each cut by dipping them for at least 30 seconds in a 10% bleach solution or alcohol (spray disinfectants that contain at least 70% alcohol can also be used). Use of copper-based fungicides or mancozeb may be needed for susceptible junipers. Make applications at seven to 21 day intervals during rapid plant growth in the spring. Be sure to read and follow all label instructions of the fungicide that you select to insure that you use the fungicide in the safest and most effective manner possible.\n\nHow do I avoid problems with Phomopsis tip blight in the future? Plant only resistant juniper species, varieties, and cultivars. DO NOT plant conifers in poorly drained sites or heavily shaded areas. DO NOT overcrowd trees and shrubs in new plantings. Provide adequate space between plants to promote good air circulation. DO NOT prune or shear conifers excessively as this stimulates overproduction of new, susceptible growth. If possible, DO NOT use overhead sprinklers for watering. Use a soaker hose instead. If you must overhead water, water early in the day to allow for fast drying of plants."

A plant whose virtues have yet to be discovered.\" – Ralph Waldo Emerson, Fortune of the Republic (1878)\n\nArchive for the '' Category\n\nThis is another spring flowering tree imported to North America from the Orient. Native to China, Japan and Korea. It is later flowering than the native flowering dogwood that blooms in early April here. This variety starts blooming in late May and will often continue bloom as late as July.\n\nThe fruit is edible raw or cooked, they are juicy and sweet. Although they are very seedy, they are nice in small quantities out of hand. The skin is thick and tough, but the pulp inside is almost custard like in texture.\n\nThe fruit is an important food source for many species of birds, who eat them very quickly. There is no known toxicity.\n\nIn the eastern part of North America, from southern Maine in the north, to northern Florida in the south, west to Kansas, Texas and Illinois this small understory tree grows with abandon. It has been placed on the protected list in many states. In early April the trees bloom in the wild with white bracts surrounding the small, inconspicuous flowers. In cultivation the colors range from white through pink and sometimes almost true red.\n\nDuring the time of the American Revolution certain medicines were hard to come by. One of which was Peruvian bark, and Dogwood bark was easily substituted for it. It has proven effective when the Peruvian bark has not worked for malaria like symptoms. In parts of Mexico they use cornine in medicine which is found in Dogwood bark.\n\nA tea substitute can be made from the bark, and the fruit can be eaten when the seed is removed. Mixed with other fruit and mashed can be made into jams.\n\nThe wood is hard, heavy, and strong, it has been used to make shuttlecocks, tool handles, wheel cogs, mauls, hayforks, and pulleys. It has on occasion been used to make golf club heads, roller skate wheels, jeweler's blocks, knitting needles, and woodcut blocks. Native Americans employed the roots to make a red dye. And a black ink was made from the bark mixed with gum arabic and iron sulfate.\n\nIt is the state flower of Virginia. It is also the state tree for Missouri. Fayetteville, N.C. has an annual Dogwood Festival in April\n\nThe Chinese dogwood (Cornus kousa) is a later flowering form of dogwood. This Dogwood flowers for a long time beginning in late May and often lasts into July.\n\nThere are no known uses in medicine, but the fruit is edible, being juicy and sweet.\n\nThe fruits are an important food source for dozens of species of birds.\n\nIn magic use it Keeps writings and meetings secret, therefore is an excellent herb for the Book of Shadows. An oil of the flowers is priceless in sealing letters and keeping unintended eyes from secret writings. Powdered flowers and dried bark may be used as incense. Place the sap of the dogwood onto a handkerchief on Midsummer Eve. This will grant any wish you have as long as you carry it faithfully. Dogwood leaves or wood can be placed in protective amulets.\n\nThis appears in the wild in eastern North America where it is considered an understorey tree. It will grow up to 10m in height\n\nThe common name 'dogwood' is a corruption of 'dagwood' , which comes from the Old English word 'dag', meaning dagger.\n\nSurprisingly the bark waas used to make teas and quinine substitutes. The fruit may be removed from the around the seed, mashed, mixed with other fruit and made into a jam.\n\nIn magic use it is much-used by the gypsies for basket making, the lovely red twigs are burned and the ash boiled into a thick mixture which is combined with the gypsy's blood. This is then smeared onto 'promise paper' (birch bark), which has been written with a wish. Such a wish is sure to come true. Dogwood is one of the nine woods traditionally placed in the traditional Celtic Druid balefire.\n\nSome Native American peoples made a scarlet dye from the roots of flowering dogwood.

      "text": "rate this answer\n\nTuesday - October 27, 2009\n\nQUESTION:\n\nWhat native trees should I plant for full sun. I am building on a 1/2 acre previously used as grazing land on the original Katy prairie. I need one large shade tree, a few smaller ornamentals, and an evergreen. The soil is silty sand/clayey sand and slightly acid. It is moist but very well drained. I need to be able to purchase the trees at local (within 30-40 miles) nurseries, either wholesale or retail. Finding natives seems to be a big part of the problem.\n\nANSWER:\n\nFrom considerable experience we can tell you that trying to select specific plants for someone's landscape, sight unseen, generally yields less-than-satisfactory results. However, we can suggest three approaches to solving this problem that will allow you to select the species best suited to your specific landscape and to find a source of supply for them.\n\nFirst, go to our Recommended Species page and click on East Texas on the map. This will bring up a list of 133 commercially available native plant species suitable for planned landscapes in East Texas. Then go to the Narrow Your Search box on the right side of the page and select Texas for state, Tree for GENERAL APPEARANCE, and Perrenial for LIFESPAN. Check Sun for LIGHT REQUIREMENT and Moist for SOIL MOISTURE. Your list decreases to 10 trees. Clicking on the name of each tree will bring up its NPIN page with information about its growth characteristics and requirements, along with images. Select trees whose growth requirements most closely match your location.\n\nA second approach is to use the Texas Tree Planting Guide from the Texas Forest Service and Texas A&M. The Custom Tree Selector, you will give you a list of trees that are suitable for Harris County. Again, try to pick trees that are suitable for your location.\n\nThis website for the Houston Area Urban Forestry Council has a wealth of information about trees ranging from selection, to planting, to complying with the tree ordinance in the Houston area. Generally, November to February is the best time for planting trees in the Houston area.\n\nOur Suppliers page can help you find businesses where you can buy the trees you have selected.\n\nMore Trees Questions\n\nGrey Goo Coming from red Oak in Manchaca TX May 13, 2013 -Problem with leaves of Texas Ash in Austin May 21, 2012 - We purchased a 3' to 4' Texas Ash in March 2012.

      "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhy plant a hedge?\n\n-Privacy; If it's privacy you're after, most people would rather see a hedge than a flat wall or fence. Many hedging species can reach a good height very quickly.\n\n-Boundary marking; Most boundaries are marked in one way or another. As hedges are available in such variety, there should be a size, price and look to suit everyone. Hedges are softer on the eye than walls and fences and cheaper too!\n\n-Shelter; A hedge can soften strong winds whereas a fence or wall can channel and increase wind through your garden.\n\n-Security; Any prickly hedge will provide some deterrent to intruders to your property.\n\n-Long lasting; If you choose well and plant and maintain your hedge, particularly in the first few years, your hedge can last a lifetime, or longer.\n\n-Wildlife; Hedging is a great environment for wildlife and often provides a in an ever increasing urban sprawl. Native species are a haven, as are hedges that flower or berry. Leylandii too is a favourite with birds.\n\n-Pollution; Many hedge species are pollution tolerant, as well as filtering pollution in the air, particularly near roads.\n\n-Which plants should I use to screen out my neighbours, and obtain privacy?\n\nAn evergreen hedge will be ideal. Options include Laurel, Photinia and evergreen Oak. Leylandii are also fine, as long as they are regularly trimmed.\n\n-I want to plant a traditional countryside hedge. Which plants should I use?\n\nBareroot plants are the most cost effective method. These are available between November and March when they are dormant. A good mix would be 80% Hawthorn and 5% of four other species. These would be planted in a d double row containing five plants per metre.\n\n-I live in an area where heavy clay soil is predominant, which plants will thrive on this type of soil?\n\nNearly all the hedging listed on hedgingtoyourdoor.co.uk will thrive on clay soil. Beech does prefer lighter soils, but with care will establish very well. Hornbeam is particularly good for clay soils.\n\n-I am considering establishing a hedge that will also act as a security barrier. Which plants would be best?\n\nHawthorn would be the best choice from the bareroot availability plants. Planted in a double row at five plants per metre, it will create an impenetrable barrier. Holly and Pyracantha should also deter any undesirables!\n\n-What sort of preparation should I do before I start planting my hedge?\n\nThe planting strip should be free of weeds and grass. The soil should be loose and friable, and free from compaction.\n\n-What should I do to ensure my hedge continues to thrive?\n\nDuring the first growing season, the hedgerow will need watering daily. Do not overwater. Little and often, to retain moisture, is the aim. Keep your hedgerow free from weed growth. Adding a mulch of approximately 2-4\" in depth will accelerate growth. Woodchips, bark or black polythene will all do the job.\n\n-What do I need to do to protect my plants?\n\nTo guard against rabbits, you may need a spiral guard and bamboo cane for the bareroot plants and a shrub shelter and stake for the bushier containerised plants.\n\nBefore you can buy plants, you will need to consider how large you want your hedge to be eventually. This can vary greatly from small Box to very tall Leylandii. Bear in mind though that it is possible to keep most things clipped to the required height.\n\nSoil type-\n\nMost hedging plants will thrive in any fertile, well-drained soil, but there are a few exceptions so consider your soil type before choosing your hedge. For example, Beech will thrive on lighter soils, whereas Hornbeam prefer clay.\n\nAspect-\n\nAgain most hedging plants will survive in most conditions, most will survive semi-shade, but planting in full shade can be a problem for some.\n\nPersonal perference-\n\nThis varies enormously and is a big factor in choosing a hedging species, but be careful to choose something that will flourish in the garden or site that you have.\n\nBudget-\n\nAs a rule, slower growing species are more expensive, especially in the larger sizes. Bare root plants are very economical but are only availiable during the dormant season and are nearly all decidous.\n\nSpecial considerations-\n\nSome hedges will have to tolerate extreme conditions, whether it be coastal exposure or a damp site. The key is to plant a hedge that can cope with these conditions, otherwise it will never look healthy and may not survive.\n\nSome other things to consider are:\n\n-Wildlife\n\n-Native\n\n-Fast grower\n\n-Flowers or berries\n\n-Evergreen\n\n-Foilage and stem colour\n\n-Some hedging species are much more vigorous than others. You should consult a structural engineer if you are planting a hedge and would like advice about roots near a property.\n\nHow long will it take for my plants to arrive after I order?\n\nUsually, the plants will be despatched within 48 hours of your order being placed.\n\nHow soon should I plant my hedging after it arrives?\n\nBareroot hedging should be planted within a couple of days of delivery. Plants in containers can be kept much longer if they receive regular watering."

It can easily reach a height of 60 feet, with fast growth, and is relatively short-lived; their life spans are typically about 120 years. The branch spread is usually equal to the tree?s height. The fast growth rate and tolerance of poor site conditions (tolerant of pollution and salt) make the honey locust valued in areas where growth is wanted quickly, such as new parks or housing developments, as street trees, and in disturbed and reclaimed environments, such as mine tailings. The honey locust casts only light shade, which allows turf to grow beneath them. Honey locusts are hardy to zone 4 and grow best in full sun in deep, moist, fertile soils of neutral pH, though it is adaptable to a range of soils.\n\nRichard Old, XID Services, Inc., Bugwood.org\n\nHoney locusts produce a high quality, durable wood. The fruit of the Honey locust is a flat pod with a sweet, edible pulp on the inside which gives the tree its name. The pulp was used for food by Native American people and can be used as high protein cattle fodder, but pods can be numerous and messy. Blossoms are nondescript, though fragrant, and leaves turn a showy, clear yellow in the fall. Honey locusts commonly have defensive thorns that can also be safety concern. The honey locust is a low water-use tree and is quick to sequester larger than average quantities of carbon.Shademaster and Skyline varieties were planted at this location.\n\nThe 'Shademaster' variety is popular for its upright, symmetrical growth habit to 40' tall. It produces some pods and has good, deep green foliage. It also reportedly has very good drought tolerance.\n\n'Skycole', or Skyline, variety is a cold-hardy form with yellow fall color and few fruits, this selection is most notable for its unusual upright growth habit. It forms a broadly pyramidal tree 40' tall and wide. It makes a good street tree and is widely regarded as one of the finest forms available."

Each flower contains both male and female parts.\nChokecherry is mostly found on moist soils, such as in aspen groves, scrub, oak/pine woodlands, and coniferous forests, as well as ravines, rocky slopes, canyons, and the edges of creeks. It can also be found in old fields, uncultivated field edges, and dry, exposed sites. Additionally, it can grow well on sandy soils. Chokecherry prefers full sun to partial shade and is intolerant of full shade\nChokecherry provided a staple for Native American tribes and was first cultivated in North America as an orchard crop in 1724. Prussic (hydrocyanic) acid is found in the bark, leaves, and pits of chokecherry, and there are numerous reports of cattle dying after eating these parts of the plant. The acid in chokecherry pits is neutralized by boiling or drying. In addition, the bark is used as a tea, and the fruit is used to make jellies and jams."

However, plum pockets is rarely considered a serious threat or economically important.\n\nSymptoms first appear as small, white blisters on immature fruit. These blisters enlarge as the fruit develops and soon encompass the entire fruit. Infected fruit becomes abnormally large (3-4 times its normal size), misshapen, and bladder- like with a thick, spongy flesh. The plum seed does not develop, so a hollow pocket forms in the center of the fruit. Infected fruit is initially red colored but later appears gray as it is covered with a powdery fungal growth. Eventually, infected fruit withers and falls from the tree.\n\nInfected fruit produces spores, which can infect healthy fruit and survive winter on healthy twigs and buds. Removal of infected fruit will help reduce the number of these spores. If infection has been severe in past years, plum pockets may be controlled by a single spray of lime sulfur or Bordeaux mixture applied before the buds swell in early spring.\n\nRepresentative trade names may be included along with generic names.

The smell of decomposing leaves on the forest floor is soul-enriching, until powder-post beetles kick-start the same composting process in your sleeping porch. And Old Man Pine is a friendly giant until he threatens to bash your cottage to smithereens. Realities like these are why all cottagers eventually learn the truth about trees. As beautiful as they are, sometimes they've got to go.\n\nThough cutting down a perfectly healthy tree may seem like a sacrilege to some, when it comes to building protection and personal safety, sometimes cottagers have to make the sacrifice. But before you head to the shed for your chainsaw, be sure to ask yourself if a given tree really needs to be cut down. Then figure out how, or even if, you can do it yourself.\n\nMaking the cut\n\nThe first step in felling a tree is figuring out which way it will fall. Stand about 15 metres back from the tree and use a plumb line to determine the lean. Do this from two different spots to make sure you get it right. Once you know which way it will fall, make two cuts on the leaning side of the tree: A 45° downward cut that ends 0.3 metres above the ground and penetrates the tree by a third of its diameter; and a horizontal cut that meets the bottom end of the angled one, forming a triangular notch in the face, or leaning side, of the tree. Next, make the back cut . This horizontal cut is about 5 cm above the intersection of the triangle and runs from the back side of the tree toward the notch, but not all the way through. Leave 15 per cent of the thickness of the tree uncut. This slab of wood between the notch and the back cut creates a hinge, called hingewood, that minimizes the risk of the tree twisting as it falls.\n\n\"If a living tree is tilting towards a building — or if it's dead or dying — then it's prudent to deal with it while it's still upright,\" recommends Steven Mann, manager of Bartlett Tree Experts in Bracebridge, Ont., whose company regularly fells trees for cottagers. \"Even dead branches on nearby trees can harpoon a hole through your roof if they fall big-end down. Why take the chance?\"\n\nWhile a hazard in themselves, large, dead branches high up in the canopy are often an early indication of decay inside the trunk, explains Todd Leuty, agroforestry specialist with the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs. So depending where the tree is on your property, close to the cottage, say, or beside a well-travelled path, you may want to take it down. Ditto for a diseased tree in cases where it could infect the whole stand. Tim Lehman, area forester with the Ministry of Natural Resources, also warns against one particularly contagious tree disease called target canker (Nectria galligena) that infects maples. Trees showing the telltale exposed concentric callus ridges of this condition should be cut down and removed immediately.\n\nBut what if a tree is just gnarled, hollow, and ugly, yet not endangering anything? Leave 'em be, says Lehman. They may not look like much to you, but they're a welcome sight for forest critters. Lehman recommends that at least six \"cavity\" trees be present on each hectare of land for wildlife habitat – the same condition required on managed Crown lands in the Great Lakes/St Lawrence forest region. In eastern Canada, more than 40 species of birds and mammals depend on cavity trees for shelter, hibernation, and rearing their young. What foresters call mast trees are also critical to wildlife food supplies. These include oak, ironwood, basswood, ash, beech, and any other species that produces nuts.\n\nEven when it's obvious a tree should come down, sentimental attachment often makes cottagers reluctant to do the deed and it can take years to arrive at the decision. Once you get there, here's some cutting advice.\n\nKnow your limitations\n\nMost troublesome cottage trees are near buildings, and while you may be tempted to emulate professional arborists and break out 2.5 cm-dia., 14,000 kg test-strength rope, nylon web slings, multiple-pulley blocks, and a gas-powered winch to help you direct the tree's fall, every expert we consulted warned against trying to use ropes, pulleys, and winches to fell tricky trees yourself. That's because there's nothing between you, your cottage, and thousands of pounds of teetering wood except a bunch of things you probably don't have: experience, training, and specialized equipment. Labour statistics show that pros who trim and remove trees work in one of the riskiest trades on the planet, right up there with police work and firefighting. That's not to say you shouldn't cut down trees yourself, just that the job demands extreme caution and a realistic assessment of your skills.\n\nBrian Lawrence, consultant/trainer with the Ontario Forestry Safe Workplace Association (OFSWA), the North Bay-based safety association that delivers training to forestry professionals, knows the importance of this first-hand. \"Back about 1986, I nearly dropped a tree onto my two-year-old son. I had no formal training and really didn't know how to cut a tree safely,\" he says. \"Since I started with the OFSWA 12 years ago, I've been passionate about getting the safety message out to everyone who uses a chainsaw – pros and casual users alike. Never forget how much is at stake.\"\n\nSteven Mann offers a checklist for cottagers considering cutting their own trees:\n\n1. If the tree is closer than 1 ½ times its height to a hydro line, don't cut it yourself. In Ontario, Hydro One Networks — the electricity delivery company spun off from Ontario Hydro – removes dangerous trees growing on power line easements held by the utility, but doesn't provide such a service on private property. It will, however, turn the power off on service lines running across your land while you or your arborists do the felling – one such free service per year. After that, you pick up the cost — about $400 each time.\n\n2. Ask yourself whether the cut could cause property damage if the tree fell the wrong way. A \"yes\" should serve as a no-go signal unless you're experienced, equipped to handle the work, and willing to shoulder the risk of dropping a tree on your cottage, an event possibly not covered by cottage insurance. Even the pros occasionally crunch buildings, but they have liability protection.\n\n3. What shape is the tree in? Is it storm-damaged, with a split trunk and partially broken limbs hanging off? Are all the heavy branches on one side? Is it leaning steeply? Any of these conditions means there's stress within the trunk that could cause it to split and spring outward unpredictably as it's cut or to pinch and immobilize the chainsaw. If any of these safety considerations gives you pause, call in professional help.\n\n4. Are there multiple, clear escape routes present? One is never enough, especially if the tree happens to fall toward your sole emergency exit. Can you make two or three distinct routes? Trees in congested areas pose increased felling risk, especially if they're likely to hang up on other trees and stay there until the next strong wind.\n\n5. Is the tree smaller in diameter than the length of your chainsaw bar? If not, don't try to tackle it yourself. \"Respecting this limitation is a good rule of thumb for cottagers,\" explains Mann. \"Trees larger than a saw's bar can be cut safely, but not without training.\"\n\nSafety tips\n\nOkay, you've run through the checklist and decided you can handle the cut. Now you need to arm yourself with the proper equipment and the know-how to use it. If your only cutting challenge was to take down the odd short, small tree (say 15 cm in diameter or less), then an old-fashioned bowsaw would do the job nicely. But since trees are often larger and felling is just the first step, most folks invest in the speed and ease of a chainsaw to cut logs and branches into shorter lengths, either for fuel or just to carry away.\n\nProfessional arborists are mandated by law to wear CSA-approved boots, chainsaw pants, hard hats, ear protection, eye protection, and heavy gloves on the job. What makes sense for you as a casual cutter? According to Ted Whitworth, field services manager with the Farm Safety Association, \"you'll certainly need ear and eye protection, and heavy gloves to prevent cuts and scrapes.\" And since a third of all chainsaw injuries are leg-related, some form of lower-limb protection is strongly recommended. \"Chainsaw chaps are generally cooler and lighter than the pants used by the pros, yet they still offer protection from saw chain injuries to the front of your legs,\" explains Whitworth. Chaps cost about $100, so it makes sense for two or three cottages to get together and buy a pair between them. Chaps with calf protection for the back of your legs are best.\n\nAny saw you use should be equipped with a chain brake – a feature that halts the travel of the saw chain if the machine bucks upward unpredictably. This bucking, called kickback, happens in an instant and accounts for nearly a half of all chainsaw injuries. Although manufacturers now regularly include chain brakes on new machines, older saws don't always have them. For that reason, inspect carefully for a brake before you rent a chainsaw, or if you're considering purchasing a used one.\n\nThe top half of the tip of any chainsaw bar is the primary kickback danger zone because the chain is travelling nearly straight down at this point. Since restriction of the chain's travel in this area is the major cause of kickback, the best way to avoid it is by preventing any contact between the chainsaw's tip and the wood. A dull chain is also more likely to kick back than a sharp one because it's less able to slice through wood, and more likely to ride on top of it. Feeling tired? Stop sawing. Fatigue increases the chance you'll make mistakes leading to kickback.\n\nBringing it down\n\nProper felling technique involves three saw cuts that work together to create a hinging action that influences the direction of a tree's fall. At the same time, they prevent the butt from jumping up or twisting wildly as the trunk hits the earth. The first two cuts, made about 0.3 metres from the ground on the side the tree will naturally fall, create a notch into the trunk about one-third the tree's diameter. The third cut — the back cut — is horizontal, entering the side opposite the notch, 5 cm above its bottom face, and penetrating inward to within about 15 cm of the notch's point. It's important that the back cut doesn't intersect with the first two: The uncut wood fibres across the centre of the trunk — about 15 per cent of the thickness of the tree — create a hinge that keeps it under some control as you move back and away from the stump yelling Timber! Cutting through the hingewood is a dangerous mistake made by amateur fellers, and can allow the tree to fall in an unpredictable direction or to buck into the air as it hits the ground.\n\nIf you call in a pro\n\nIf you have to call in an arborist, know that you're buying more than expertise. You're buying insurance, too. At least you should be. \"Up to 30% of what we charge customers goes straight for liability protection,\" explains Steven Mann of Bartlett Tree Experts. Every tree business is required by law to carry two kinds of coverage: a minimum of $1 million general liability insurance to protect property, plus Worker's Compensation insurance for every employee on site. \"If you hire a so-called pro to cut a tree on your property and an accident happens, you may be named in a lawsuit if the arborist wasn't properly insured, even if the accident wasn't your fault,\" says Mann. \"Ask to see valid insurance certificates that specifically mention cutting trees before agreeing to any kind of work.\" The only time Worker's Compensation coverage isn't required is when the owners of the tree-cutting business (not employees) are doing the actual work. Rates for removing trees run about $1,200 to $1,600 per day of labour for a two-person crew. And when it comes time to sign the cheque, don't get conned into paying PST. Tree removal is a service only, so GST is all you need to fork over to the government."

      "text": "walnut\n\nwalnut, common name for some members of the Juglandaceae, a family of chiefly deciduous, resinous trees characterized by large and aromatic compound leaves. Species of the walnut family are indigenous mostly to the north temperate zone, but also range from Central America along the Andes to Argentina and through tropical Asia to Java and New Guinea.\n\nCommon Species and Their Uses\n\nSeveral trees of the Juglandaceae are of commercial importance for the edible nuts and for lumber. The \"nuts\"(they are actually drupelike), usually enclosed in a leathery or woody hull, include many of the most valuable food nuts of the United States—the walnut and the butternut of the walnut genus Juglans and the pecan, hickory nut, pignut, and mockernut of the hickory genus Carya. The single-seeded nuts contain no endosperm; the edible portion is the corrugated, meaty seed leaves of the embryo itself. Lumber is obtained chiefly from Juglans, Carya, and Engelhardia. The latter genus is now restricted to East Asia, but fossil trees have been found in the United States. Species of these and other genera (e.g., Pterocarya, the Asian wingnuts) are often planted as ornamental shade trees.\n\nThe walnut genus Juglans (from Lat. Jovis glans=nut of Jove) is the largest and most widely distributed genus of the family. The dark timber of the black walnut (J. nigra), found in hardwood forests in the eastern half of North America, and of the Persian, or English, walnut (J. regia), native to W Asia, is unusually hard and durable and is valued for furniture, interior paneling, gunstocks, musical instruments, and other uses. Black walnut has been the foremost cabinet wood of North America since colonial times.\n\nThe closer-grained English walnut, usually sold as lumber under the name Circassian walnut, is widely cultivated in S Europe and the Orient and has been introduced with great success into California, now the major producing area of the world. The nut of this tree is more easily extracted from the shell than that of the black walnut and is the one usually sold commercially for use as a table nut and for confectionery, flavorings, and sometimes pickling. A decoction of the leaves, bark, and hulls has been used for a brown wool dye and the crushed leaves for an insect repellent.\n\nThe butternut, or white walnut (J. cinerea), of approximately the same range as the black walnut, has a sweet and oily nut that is gathered locally but is not of commercial importance. The butternut is also timbered; the wood is softer than that of the black and English walnuts. Sugar is sometimes obtained from its sap, and the hulls yield a yellow to gray dye that gave color to the homespun of pioneers and to the \"butternut\" uniforms of some Confederate soldiers. The inner root bark, called butternut bark, has been used in domestic remedies, as have the hulls of the English walnut. Other American and Old World walnuts are also used and esteemed locally for timber, dyes, and food.\n\nClassification\n\nThe walnut family is classified in the division Magnoliophyta, class Magnoliopsida, order Juglandales.\n\nAny of about 20 species of deciduous trees in the genus Juglans, family Juglandaceae. Black walnut (J. nigra) of eastern North America and English, or Persian, walnut (J. regia), native to Iran, are valuable timber trees that produce edible nuts. The butternut (J. cinerea) of eastern North America also produces an edible nut. The walnut family contains an additional seven genera of flowering plants, found mainly in the northern temperate zone in a variety of habitats. Pecan and hickory are among the many family members that are prized for both their edible nuts and their strong, attractive woods, especially noted for their grain patterns and lustre. Leaves of the walnut family are feather-like; tiny, resinous scales that look like yellow dots on the undersurface of the leaflets give Juglans species a pungent aroma.\n\nNational monument, north-central Arizona, U.S. Established in 1915 and covering an area of 3 sq mi (8 sq km), it preserves more than 300 pre-Columbian dwellings built by the Pueblo Indians in shallow caves on the canyon walls. Main occupancy was from AD 1000 to 1200.\n\nWith exceptions to some busy intersections (such as near Mt. San Antonio College), the hilly and affluent city is considerably more relaxed in comparison to most nearby neighborhoods. The city is almost and is home to more than 32,000 people and 600 businesses. A large Sysco headquarters is located in the city.\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of Walnut dates back to the Indians who were of Shoshone origin. They were called Gabrielino Indians by the Spaniards because they lived in an area controlled by the San Gabriel Mission. Walnut was primarily used for the grazing of cattle and sheep by the Mission.\n\nSpaniards who arrived here in the early 1800s introduced the concept of ranchos and started agricultural development and the creation of home sites. The first land grants in the Walnut area were those of the Rancho De San Jose granted to Don Ricardo Vejar and Don Ygnacio Palomares; the Rancho De Los Nogales, issued to Jose De La Cruz Linares; and Rancho La Puente, issued to John Rowland and William Workman in 1842 which consisted of a total of . The City of Walnut was included as part of one of the 24 ranchos belonging to the San Gabriel Mission\n\nIn 1868, John Rowland and William Workman divided Rancho La Puente, leaving Rowland the eastern half and Workman the western half. Rowland's land included the western portion of Walnut. The land was used for raising cattle and growing wheat, grapes, and fruit trees.\n\nMany years earlier in 1840, Mexican Governor Juan Alvardo awarded a man named Jose De La Cruz Linares a land grant of , land which included a portion of Walnut. This land was known as Rancho De Nogales, or Ranch of the Walnut Trees. In 1847, seven years after the unfortunate death of Linares, the rancho was acquired by Ricardo Vejar. This land included the eastern portion of Walnut and became part of Rancho San Jose. The City of Walnut originally obtained its name from the Rancho De Los Nogales land grant, Nogales being the Spanish word for walnut.\n\nIn order to preserve part of the community's history, the City of Walnut's Bicentennial Commission selected the construction of Lemon Creek Park and the restoration of the William R. Rowland Adobe Redwood Ranch House as Walnut's bicentennial project. In 1871, the Lemon Creek Park area became the property of Sheriff William Rowland, who inherited the ranch from his father, John Rowland. The modest structure served as the home of Mr. Meridith, ranch foreman for William Rowland. It was built in 1883. The adobe redwood ranch house is one of the few remaining original ranch style redwood and adobe structures in the area. On October 1, 1975, the State Landmark Committee placed the W.R. Rowland ranch house in the National Registry of Historical Places.\n\nWalnut was one of the only cities to have Black Walnuts able to be picked.\n\nOn July 29, 2008, a 5.4 earthquake shook the eastern portion of the LA basin, with a strong shaking felt in Walnut.\n\nWalnut Family Festival\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of Walnut is the Walnut Family Festival. For one day each year during the fall, several larger streets are closed in the early hours of the morning and a parade is held in which many local clubs and groups participate. Later in the afternoon, a fair with booths, games, food, and activities is held in Suzanne Park, adjacent to Suzanne Middle School.\n\nThere were 8,260 households out of which 50.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 77.1% were married couples living together, 9.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 8.2% were non-families. 5.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 1.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.63 and the average family size was 3.74.\n\nIn the city the population was spread out with 27.8% under the age of 18, 9.8% from 18 to 24, 27.2% from 25 to 44, 28.4% from 45 to 64, and 6.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females there were 96.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.5 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $97,367, and the median income for a family was $106,996. Males had a median income of $51,944 versus $36,197 for females. The per capita income for the city was $31,196.

      "text": "Caring for Rose Trees\n\nBy Elizabeth Hannigan\n, last updated February 7, 2011\n\nCaring for rose trees is actually much easier than the playing card soldiers from Alice in Wonderland would have you believe. Rose trees, also called rose standards, are just like rose plants and bushes; only they have been trained to grow to resemble trees. Rose trees have long, skinny canes that are about a meter long, and full, rose covered foliage at the very top. They resemble lollipops. These trees are made by creating two grafts. One at the top supports the hybrid tee and the other at the bottom near the rootstock.\n\nYou can't graft your own rose tree at home, so you will have to buy your rose trees from a nursery. The best time to bring your rose tree home is in early spring. Examine your rose trees carefully before you make any purchases. Rose trees are susceptible to disease, just like regular roses are. Choose a young, health plant that is potted in moist soil. There are a ton of varieties of rose tree available today. You might want to consider investing in some Knockout rose trees. This varietal is the most low maintenance rose on the market. It is less susceptible to diseases and requires little pruning and no dead heading.\n\nThe most important factor in your rose standard's success is where you choose to plant. Obviously, rose standards are extremely top heavy. They won't thrive anywhere where they are subjected to harsh, drying winds. A strong wind is capable of snapping your rose tree's cane. Furthermore, the canes of rose trees are especially prone to sun scald. You need to choose a nice, semi shady spot for your rose tree. Otherwise you risk burning and killing it in direct sunlight. Rose trees are also in danger during the coldest parts of winter in states where it freezes and snows. It is worthwhile for you to note that rose trees will grow in either pots or the ground. If you live somewhere very cold, it might be a good idea to grow your rose tree in a pot so that you can move it to a warmer spot in winter. If you live somewhere very hot, on the other hand, you can move your rose tree out of the sun when it gets too intense.\n\nYour rose tree is definitely going to need to be staked. The foliage and flowers of your rose tree are balanced upon a thin cane that really is barely capable of bearing their weight. If the tree is subjected to wind or you bump into it, you risk breaking the cane and killing it. You can help to protect it by carefully staking it with two or three stakes. These stakes will probably have to stay on the tree for its whole life. You will also need to carefully prune your tree so that it does not get even heavier on the top. Prune your tree so that the thickest, heaviest parts of the foliage rest nearer to the bottom and make sure to cut out any dead branches."

      "text": "Manage Trees During Drought - Making Tree Water Available\n\n1 of 2\n\nMost well-established trees can tolerate some drought, although much depends on the drought resistance of certain species and whether they are growing on an appropriate site. The most drought sensitive tree species are exceptions and demand a bit more attention. Dogwoods, Japanese maples, flowering cherries, and birches need extra water in times of drought.\n\nTrees absorbing moisture through the roots supply leaves with water using a decrease in water pressure in the leaves. This pressure difference \"siphons\" the water from ground to leaves and is necessary for a tree to survive. Ninety percent of tree water is eventually lost into the atmosphere through evaporation. This beneficial loss of water from plants is called transpiration.\n\nYoung seedlings planted this season should be your main concern. You need to remember that trees can suffer from drought in winter as well as summer. Recently planted trees need extra attention since they are still trying to replace roots lost in the transplanting process. But all moisture sensitive trees need watering during dry periods.\n\nThe National Arboretum suggests that \"In areas where water is available, you can most effectively water trees by turning the hose on to a trickle and placing it a few feet away from the trunk. Let it trickle for several hours to moisten the soil in the vicinity of the tree thoroughly. One to four hours time may need to pass to accomplish this as well as loosening any hardened mulch that resists water.\"\n\n\"Plunge a trowel or spade into the earth to check to see if the soil has been moistened to a depth of at least six inches. If you run into dry earth, more water will be needed. Once watered, you may not need to return to water the tree for two or three weeks.\"\n\nIf you are limited to hand watering, build a small circular \"berm\" of soil a few inches in height a few feet away from the trunk. Fill the basin you have created with water. it will then seep into the soil slowly. If your soil is heavy, you may need to fill the basin several times over a period of several hours to get the soil moistened to a depth of more than six inches."

There are several trees alive in Japan that survived the 1945 atom bomb explosion. Talk about survival of the fittest!\n\nGingko trees can be male or female. The nursery industry sells male trees, because female trees have messy, unpleasantly scented \"fruit.\" Even though nurseries guarantee a male tree, sometimes a female slips through. It can take up to 10 years before fruiting starts, and by the tree is attractive and you may not want to cut down (this situation has occurred in my mother's front yard. The tree is so pretty we are just dealing with the \"fruit\" as best we can). Interestingly enough, in Asian cultures, the nut inside the fleshy (stinky) fruit is considered a delicacy.\n\nIn fall, ginkgo leaves turn a beautiful golden color. A lawn covered in ginkgo leaves looks as if someone has thrown an autumn confetti party. Ginkgos are pest and disease resistant and tolerate conditions many others trees cannot. They are a great choice for a street tree or in a backyard.\n\n3 Responses to Fall Color: Ginkgo\n\nI love the story that for all the ginkgos we have around the world for ornamentals, the ancient tree was more or less extinct except for a single grove or two in China. I love living fossils like these and the Dawn Redwoods, also from China."

Among the other beautiful trees of this well-known park, the Pacific Madrone was to me one of the most impressive. There is something truly magical about a dense stand of this broadleaf evergreen with its lovely red peeling bark. Since that time in Oregon, this tree has been one of my favorites. In addition to Lithia Park, Ashland's graveyard has hundreds of Pacific Madrones scattered throughout the historic gravesites.\n\nPacific Madrone is a native of North America with its natural range from British Columbia to Southern California. You'll typically find it in lower elevations in sunny and dry locations. It can reach up to 100 feet in height but is more commonly around 60 to 70 feet. The branches of this tree can twist and become quite sculptural. The leaves are dark green and shiny. Other features of this tree are its red berries and fragrant flower clusters. The berries are a strong temptation for wildlife and birds. Many birds also find this tree a comfortable place to nest. The fruit is edible for humans as well, but is not recommended to eat very many because it is said to cause stomach cramps. Pacific Madrone is a source of hardwood that provides a creamy sapwood and a pinkish to reddish heartwood. It can be quite durable and stiff and resists shock well. People have used the wood for making novelties, furniture, tool handles, flooring, and inlay ornaments, among other items.\n\nPacific Madrone likes well-drained soils and full sun, although it will tolerate partial shade. It can be difficult to transplant, so you'll want to get a younger tree and be careful of the taproot when transplanting. Also, be aware that this tree is sensitive to pollutants, so you'll want to plant it away from any source of contaminants. The peeling bark and occasional falling leaves require some degree of cleanup, so if you want a maintenance free tree, look elsewhere.\n\nThis site provided by the U.S. Forest Service has a lot of interesting facts and botanical info on the Pacific Madrone: Pacific Madrone Facts"

And, most experts\nwill also recommend adding a source of water –\nsuch as a bird bath or pond. Did you know, however,\nthat many landscape plants might be more important than\nfeeders? Trees, shrubs and flowers provide not only\nfood, but also shelter and nesting areas. Following\nare some of the landscape plants that have been used\nsuccessfully in the Brainerd Lakes area to attract a\nvariety of birds – from the tiny hummingbird to\nthe gargantuan pileated woodpecker..\n\nMany of the flowering crabapples do a great job of\nproviding food for robins, waxwings and if you are lucky,\nevening grosbeaks or the white winged crossbill. Best\nof all they are very hardy, provide wonderful spring\ncolor with their blooms, as well as colorful fruit through\nthe winter. Our two favorites are the Red Jade Crabapple\n(Malus 'Red Jade') and the Red Splendor Crabapple\n(Malus 'Red Splendor').\n\nAnother small tree or very large shrub that works wonders\nis the Pagoda Dogwood (Cornus alternifolia). It does\njust fine in shady areas but the dark blue fruit doesn't\nlast long. We have frequently watched the frenzied competition\nbetween the catbirds and robins, and occasionally we\nmight see a bluebird or woodpecker trying to get in\non the action. It has a nice early season bloom and\nequally nice fall color.\n\nThe Shadblow Serviceberry (Amelanchier canadensis)\nis another large dandy shrub or small tree that provides\nfruit that drives the birds crazy. Another benefit is\nthat its leaves turn a magnificent scarlet to red in\nthe fall.\n\nThe common Elderberry (Sambucus canadensis) is one\nof the easiest shrubs to grow. The fruit not only attracts\nrobins and catbirds, but many more. Prepare to duck\nas the birds flock to this favorite. If you are planning\nto make elderberry wine you had better move fast as\nthe competition will be extreme.\n\nA small native tree in Minnesota that attracts over\n30 species of birds is the Chokecherry (Prunus virginiana).\nIt is easy to transplant to your yard as long as it\nis dormant, which means in the spring prior to leaf\nout or in the fall as the leaves have fallen.\n\nAre you hoping to attract some of the numerous hummingbirds\nthat frequent the Brainerd Lakes area during the late\nspring, summer and early fall? Here is a list of the\nperennials that has been used with great success. There\nare a number of Bee Balms that produce remarkable results.\nBrainerd area favorites include Gardenview Scarlet Bee\nBalm (Monarda 'Gardenview Scarlet') and Petite\nWonder Bee Balm (Monarda 'Petite Wonder').\nAnother hummingbird favorite is Elfin Pink Penstemon\n(Penstemon 'Elfin Pink'). Believe it or not\nthere is a hosta that attracts hummingbirds well, the\nHoneybells Hosta (Hosta 'Honeybells').\n\nFor a little variety try the climbing vine, Dropmore\nScarlet Honeysuckle (Lonicera x brownie 'Dropmore\nScarlet'). It is one of the first plants to leaf\nout in the spring and blooms all summer. There is also\nan annual that when mass planted is a magnate for hummingbirds,\nLady in Red Salvia (Salvia coccinea). It has a much\nfiner bloom than most Salvias and a bonus is that it\nself-seeds quite well.\n\nConeflowers are excellent for attracting goldfinches\nand siskins in late October and November. You are likely\nto see dozens of goldfinches feeding on the seeds of\nthe spent blooms. There are may varieties of coneflowers\nand they come in both purple and white colors. Think\nof including any of the following varieties in your\nBrainerd Lakes Country landscape to entice late fall\nfeeding: Bright Star Coneflower (Echinacea 'Bright\nStar') and Kim's Knee High Coneflower (Echinacea\n'Kim's Knee High').\n\nCommon sunflowers work wonders for attracting chickadees,\nnuthatches, blue jays, woodpeckers, goldfinches and\npine siskins once the seed heads have matured. This\nsun loving annual is a natural for providing food for\nbirds.\n\nIf you have Red Oaks (Acer rubrum) on your property\nbe sure to protect them, as they are great for blue\njays and woodpeckers because of their acorns. An added\nbenefit is that they attract flying squirrels by night.\n\nPlants for nesting and to provide cover and protection\nare equally important. Consider planting a mass of clavey's\nDwarf Honeysuckle (Lonicera x Clavey's Dwarf).\nThese will mature into bushy plants and can make a nice\nhedge. This will provide cover and protection for juncos,\nthe white throated sparrow, cardinals, chipping sparrows\nand many others that feed on the ground.\n\nAnother great plant for cover is the Balsam Fir (Abies\nbalsamea). These grow fairly quickly and are quite dense\nmaking perfect nesting areas for chipping sparrows and\nrobins.\n\nResist the urge to cut down old and dying trees –\nespecially oaks, quaking aspens and jack pines –\nas bugs burrow beneath the bark and provide great feeding\nopportunities for several species of birds. These old\ntrees also provide nesting sites for birds (such as\nwoodpeckers and nuthatches) that like to burrow into\ntrees to carve out their nests.\n\nStart slowly by adding a few plants and before you\nknow it, your Brainerd Lakes Country home will become\na backyard haven for birds of all shapes and sizes."

      "text": "Caring for Cercis Canadensis\n\nBy Dawn Marcotte\n, last updated February 12, 2011\n\nThe Cercis Canadensis is better known as the Redbud, Eastern Redbud or Judas tree. There are several varieties available including the Covey, Forest Pansy and Silver Cloud. The Redbud is native to the eastern United States and is actually the state tree for Oklahoma. The tree is small and produces showy pink flowers in the spring.\n\nThis popular tree is available from nurseries and should be planted in a moist, well-drained area. The tree prefers sunlight and is often seen leaning toward available light when found naturally in a wooded area. The blooms attract butterflies and the heart shaped leaves provide plenty of shade. The tree will grow to a height of approximately 15 feet depending on the variety chosen. It will spread to the same height it grows so the Covey that reaches 10 feet high will also spread 10 feet.\n\nFeeding and Watering\n\nThe Redbud produces showy pink flowers annually. Green leaves that turn yellow in the fall follow these flowers. The tree requires fertilizer on a regular schedule. Apply fertilizer away from stems and trunks on April 1, May 20, July 4, August 15 and October 30. The Redbud grows quickly until it reaches maturity and this feeding schedule will help the tree reach its full height and spread. Don't overwater the tree and ensure the roots do not sit in standing water to prevent fungus and allow for maximum growth.\n\nInsects and Pests\n\nThe Cercis Canadensis is susceptible to several insects and pests. Tree Hoppers lay their eggs under the bark of the twigs. They are evident by the white, sticky froth that covers the eggs. Utilize horticulture oil designed for dormant pests and spray the tree.\n\nScale insects are another pest common on Redbud trees. These small insects may even appear to be part of the growth of the tree. They appear as crusty bumps, most frequently on new growth. Spray them with horticulture oil to suffocate the insect. In the spring, when the new insects are hatched, spray with Bug Buster or another insecticide specific to scale to prevent the infection from spreading.\n\nSpider mites are very small and may be difficult to identify. Use a magnifying glass to inspect the underside of leaves for tiny specks that may look like spots of pepper. An alternative is to hold a piece of white paper under several leaves and tap the leaves to dislodge the insects. They can be seen clearly on the white paper. Once an infection is identified it is crucial to treat before the heat of the summer. The infestation will grow very quickly during hot months. Spray the tree with Bug Buster or another commercial insecticide specific to spider mites. Concentrate on applying it to the underside of leaves and in leaf crotches, as this is where the insect lives and lays eggs.\n\nCercis Canadensis is a beautiful ornamental tree that does not require a lot of care. Annual pruning and watering as needed during a drought will keep the tree in good health for its entire life."

      "text": "Local Garden Center\n\nAbout Winter Tree Pruning\n\nMaintaining a beautiful landscape is important for an avid gardener. One of the ways to help keep the garden looking clean and beautiful is by pruning trees. Pruning not only gives trees an aesthetic appearance, it contributes to their well-being and helps them with healthier growth. Performing winter pruning on trees annually can help trees develop beautifully.\n\nThe Facts\n\nWinter pruning is a method of using pruning shears, saws, clippers and other pruning tools to remove the woody part of any plant or trees during the winter season. Dead branches, new branches, diseased branches and wayward branches can be trimmed and pruned to give the tree a better appearance, while keeping it healthy.\n\nType\n\nThere are different types of pruning methods or cuts that one can use for winter pruning. You can perform a method called crown thinning pruning method, crown raising pruning method and crown reduction pruning method. \"Crown thinning\" is a method used to help develop a tree's form or structure by removing a selection of branches, which will allow a better air flow and light penetration around the crown of the trees. \"Crown raising\" is a method of removing branches from the bottom part of the crown of trees. \"Crown reduction\" or \"drop crotch catch,\" is a method used to prune overgrown trees that may have exceeded permitted growth height.\n\nBenefits\n\nPruning during winter can help stimulate the growth of the remaining branches. It helps the tree to develop a stronger structure while improving their form and appearance. Pruned fruit-bearing trees yield more fruits that are healthier while flowering trees yield more blossoms. Pruning removes diseased branches, preventing the infestation from spreading among the other branches that can ultimately kill the trees. It helps remove obstructions that may cause accidents to pedestrians, sometimes causing fire or electrocution when branches and electrical wires mesh with each other.\n\nRisk Factors\n\nPoor pruning can be damaging to the tree. You must have the proper tools and knowledge in pruning trees before tackling this project. Each type of cut can change the growth of the tree, so not knowing the proper technique may do more harm than good. In addition, using shears used to cut diseased plants and trees may transfer the disease to the next tree. Disinfect pruning shears before using."

      "text": "Tree's threat to foundation needs expert analysisA MyAADear Neil: I have grown a Mexican lime tree from a seed. I've had it for two years, but no flowers and therefore, no fruit. Is there something I need to do so it produces fruit, or does it need to be older before it can do so?\n\nA: First, when you plant any fruit crop's seed, you're not going to get the very same quality of fruit back. Almost all fruit crops are propagated by budding and grafting, and a few are even started from cuttings. But, none is started from seeds, because the seeds will not \"come true.\" That means that the offspring will not be exactly the same as either parent (as with human babies). All of that said, you're correct in assuming that this plant will have to grow for several more years (5 to 10) before it will be able to flower and fruit.\n\nIf you'd like Neil's help with your plant question, drop him a note to Gardener's Mailbag, PO Box 864, McKinney, TX 75070 or e-mail your questions to mailbag@sperrygardens.com."

      "text": "Bonsai Artist Michael Hagedorn\n\n◊ Crataegus Bonsai Seasonal ◊\n\nAlthough mixed with a lot of hilarity, the Seasonals are geared toward students who are serious about bonsai. The program is based on learning by contrast. We contrast pot-grown and wild-collected, deciduous and conifer, young tree and old, from season to season. The Seasonals offer lesson-style teaching in addition to platforms for self-discovery. This is perhaps a more palatable and fun version of the holistic, hands-on, varied, long-term, and seriously stressed-out education I received as an apprentice from Shinji Suzuki.\n\nSeasonal mornings start with sitting down around a table with a lot of tea, and covering the day's material with words—handouts, quizzes, questions—which can last an hour or more. The rest of the day is spent outside or in the studio with hands-on work.\n\nSeasonals run for three consecutive days, $675, with lunches and dinners included. Lodging is at a nearby hotel or bed and breakfast. You will be asked to bring a basic set of tools, but trees, wire, soil, etc. are all provided.\n\n(Starting in 2014 Matt Reel, who's been studying with Shinji Suzuki for 7 years now, will be dropping in for surprise visits to co-teach a day at the Seasonals. He's a natural teacher, deeply knowledgeable, and we're lucky to have him coming back to Portland, his hometown.)\n\nNow in its fourth year, the Seasonal program was created out of requests of students from around the country who were interested in coming to Portland to study. It's been an awful lot of fun and I hope you join us!\n\nEngelmann spruce\n\nIn the Seasonals we won't just be styling trees. We'll also cover horticulture, refinement of old bonsai, display, and a lot in between.\n\nMountain Hemlock created in the Winter 2012 Seasonal\n\nIn past Seasonals, we've covered the refinement of established bonsai such as Pine, Spruce, Juniper, Japanese Maple, Winter Hazel, Juniper and Chojubai Quince.\n\nAn old chojubai quince\n\nDesigning new bonsai is featured in all Seasonals. These range from older collected yamadori conifers like Rocky Mountain Juniper, Limber Pine, Engelmann Spruce, Mountain Hemlock, and Ponderosa Pine, to growing and developing deciduous trees like Japanese Maple, Chojubai Quince, and Stewartia.\n\nWinter Seasonals focus on repotting, while other Seasonals feature species appropriate visualization and styling, advanced wiring and bending, accent plants, and the study of display. A few past sessions have included experimental segments. Attention is paid to the interests of advanced students to help them create a personal bonsai yard that reflects their growing artistic sensibility.\n\nRam Lukas rewiring a Western juniper (featured in Bonsai Focus) during the Fall 2009 Seasonal\n\nThere are four Seasonals a year to cover each of the main periods of bonsai activity. Sessions are limited to four students. Although it is recommended that new students start with a Winter Seasonal to acquire new repotting techniques, any initiation time is fine.\n\nDays start before 9 am and usually end in the early evening, although it is sometimes later with the more involved work days.\n\n♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦\n\n'It is like entering a cathedral when you first walk into your yard, and I am honored that you allow me such a learning environment…you make learning a joy.' —Konnor\n\n\"I learned more in 3 days than I had in the last 12 years. He was a fantastic teacher, artist, and host while there. There were 4 others there and all had been students before me. I am returning in the fall for more training and looking forward to reuniting with the group and enjoying the many fine meals, reviewing the days events. Michael has had a large influence on where I want to go with bonsai design… I would not hesitate in recommending anyone to attend his small group sessions. Thank you Michael!!!\" —Ray\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\n8 Responses\n\nI'm fortunate enough to live in Portland and participate in Michael's classes for locals, where we work on our own trees.\n\nI can't recommend him highly enough for those who want to take their trees to the level of Really Nice Bonsai. Being exposed to Michael's trees and instruction has shown me that much of the \"nice\" bonsai I saw in books is fairly average, but that truly exceptional trees are within reach of the amateur if he or she is serious about acquiring excellent material to start with and caring for it diligently.\n\nAnd if folks' travel plans permit it, they should arrange to do some shopping for bonsai stock out here. Some of the best in the country is available within a two-hour radius of Portland.\n\nMichael\nlove the web site. I have 3 ficus trees that have been subjected to my bonsai technique. that is no training what so ever. the trees due to their hardy nature,ficus, have been with me for 15 years or more. i live in hood river oregon. do you hold any basic classes for someone like myself? your trees look so beautiful it might be a bit embarassing to bring mine in.\nthanks freddie\n\nVery happy to see the work you have done so far and look forward to meeting you in the future at a show in America or Japan. I am currently apprenticing at Kouka-en under Keichi Fujikawa. I have always been a huge fan of Suzuki-san's work and his style is present in your work for sure; not just styling but selection of material and character. I will be here for at least another year and will decide how long I will stay total in the near future. Tough to stat longer with responsibilities in America. I look forward to reading your book when I get back to Tennessee in December.\n\nJust read your article on \"Read This if you Grow Japanese Maple\" I have dealt with this problem for years.

Bonsai is the growing of miniature trees and other plants that can, under proper conditions, live hundreds of years.\n\nThe nonprofit group was organized in 1973 and meets nine times a year at the Bethlehem Area Vo-Tech School.\n\nMember Jim Gillespie learned about bonsai 20 years ago at a lecture given by a bonsai master.

Evergreens, cherry, plum, bamboo and maple trees are all suited to bonsai. Bonsai can be created from young trees, seedlings and cuttings.\n\nBonsai trees and plants are raised in containers and kept small by pruning the top and the roots. They generally range in size from 2 inches to four feet.\n\nMost bonsai are outdoor plants and winter outside with protection or in an unheated garage or shed.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, the Bonsai Society will hold its annual exhibit in the water garden division of Tilley's Nursery, 111 E.

      "text": "rate this answer\n\nSaturday - April 26, 2008\n\nQUESTION:\n\nWhich are the best eco friendly trees for parks?\n\nANSWER:\n\nWithout a doubt, the most ecology-friendly trees for parks or anywhere else are trees that are native to that area. A native tree will be adapted to the amount of rainfall the area normally has, the soil the tree is growing in and the high and low temperatures during the year. For instance, in your area of Brownsville, right down on the southern tip of Texas, the trees you are likely to see in the wild, and that therefore would be good in the parks, all are adapted to high temperatures, probably couldn't survive very low temperatures, and can get by on less moisture. For example, we went to the Recommended Species section of this website and searched on South Texas, selecting on trees, perennial habit, 6 or more hours a day of sun, and low soil moisture. This is the list of trees that met those criteria, and would therefore grow well in parks in the Brownsville, TX area. Then, we went to that list of eleven trees and selected some that we thought were more public-friendly, no dangerous thorns, no poisonous seeds, etc. and that list follows:\n\nMore Trees Questions"

      "text": "Acknowledgement: Most information in this section has been reprinted with permission by Four Winds Nursery of California, a nursery specializing in citrus trees whose founder was also responsible for the Improved Meyer Lemon. See  for even more information about Citrus.\n\nSometimes people aren't quite sure about using citrus as a landscape plant. In fact, citrus work extraordinarily well in most any landscape, offering beautiful evergreen foliage, lovely (and fragrant) blossoms, and colorful fruit. If you'd like to see some examples of successful landscape plantings, take a look at our landscaping slide show.\n\nSize\n\nCitrus trees grafted on dwarf rootstocks are perfect for container growing but can also be planted in the ground. If planted in the ground dwarf trees can be expected to reach \"Semi-Dwarf\" size – up to around 16 feet in height, depending upon variety. In a pot, the dwarf trees will stay much smaller, especially with judicious pruning. Standard size citrus trees, available at California nurseries, are best suited for growing in the ground and can be expected to get much taller – up to 25 feet, depending on variety. Be sure to provide more space in the ground for standard size trees. Generally, a Dwarf tree needs an 8-10 foot diameter space, while a Standard tree should be provided with a larger growing space – up to 15 feet in diameter.\n\nClimate\n\nIn general, ground-planted citrus trees are happiest in warm, temperate areas. San Francisco has 7 main microclimates but lemons can do well in all of them thanks to our mild climate. Fortunately, we rarely have frost.\n\nLocation\n\nA sunny, frost and wind-free location with southern exposure is best. (If in doubt, leave the tree in its plastic container and place it in the spot you have in mind. Water as needed, and after a week or two you should be able to tell whether or not it's happy.)\n\nReflected heat from sidewalks, walls, driveways, or other structures can help to create a warmer \"microclimate.\" Avoid planting citrus trees in lawns that get frequent, shallow sprinklings. Don't crowd your tree, for even though it is a dwarf, it will need room for its eight-ten foot ultimate diameter. The root system can reach far beyond the drip line.\n\nSoil\n\nCitrus trees are famous for tolerating a wide variety of soils, including clay. However, good drainage is essential, as citrus trees can't survive standing water for long. To test your drainage, dig a hole 30″ deep where you would like to place the tree. Fill with water to saturate the soil. The next day refill it with water. Your drainage is OK if the water level drops 2″ in two hours. If the water does not drain well, plant your tree in a raised bed and then amend the soil as described in the following paragraph.\n\nSoils rich in humus are best. For heavy or poor soils, we recommend digging a large hole and filling it back in, half with the best of the original soil, and half with a good-quality amendment mix. Plant the root ball high to allow it room to settle over time. Crown roots should remain visible just above the soil line.\n\nPlanting\n\nIf the plant is growing in a container, gently invert the container to remove the soil intact. Trees that are somewhat dry will usually release more easily from the pot for transplanting. Squeezing the sides of a plastic pot can help to loosen the soil and roots. If planting a bare-rooted mail order tree, shake loose the shavings the roots are packed in before planting. Add the shavings along with your other amendments to the prepared mix for the planting hole.\n\nTake note of the abundant fibrous root system. Straighten out any circling roots and cut off any broken or dead roots before planting. Amend your planting hole as described above. Do not add fertilizer to the soil while backfilling your hole; however, you can apply some to the soil surface after planting. Be sure to tamp soil lightly as you go and water thoroughly after planting to eliminate any large air pockets. Stake the tree as needed until well-established. Green plant tie is a good choice for tying trees to stakes.\n\nCitrus trees are best planted during the active growing season. In summer it is best to plant in the early morning hours when temperatures are cool to moderate. Try to keep the roots out of the sun as much as possible. Water thoroughly after transplanting. If desired, use a solution of Vitamin B-1 Rooting Tonic in the first few irrigations to help fine feeder roots recover more quickly. You may wish to pinch off fruit and blossoms for the first year or two after a new planting to encourage stronger root and branch development.\n\nWatering\n\nConsistency is the key with citrus watering! As with so many plants, citrus trees like soil that is moist but never soggy. How often to water will vary, depending on soil porosity, tree size, and temperature. Allowing the top of the soil to dry slightly is OK. A simple moisture meter, available at garden supply stores, can be used to determine moisture down to about a 9″ depth. Generally, when the meter indicates a root moisture level of about 50%, (center of dial) it is time to water. Always store your moisture meter dry between uses to keep it functioning properly.\n\nA wilted tree that perks up within 24 hours after watering indicates the roots got too dry. Adjust watering schedule accordingly. A tree with yellow or cupped leaves, or leaves that don't look perky AFTER watering can indicate excessive watering and soggy roots. In that case, water less frequently.\n\nIn the ground, citrus prefer less frequent, deep waterings to frequent, shallow sprinklings. Creating a watering basin around the drip-line of the tree can aid in deep watering. As the tree grows, be sure to expand the basin as needed to keep it as wide as the spread of the branches. Deeper watering promotes deeper root growth and strengthens your tree. Generally, once-a-week watering works well for in-ground plantings. Be sure to adjust based on weather conditions!\n\nIn general, it is probably best to water in the morning, but if plants are dry or wilted it is better to water them immediately, rather than wait until morning. See our watering page for more.\n\nFertilizer\n\nCitrus trees feed heavily on nitrogen. Your fertilizer should have more nitrogen (N) than phosphorous (P) or potassium (K). Use at least a 2-1-1 ratio. Miracid Soil Acidifier is a water-soluble product that works well and is a 3-1-1 ratio. In some regions, you may be able to find specialized citrus/avocado fertilizers. Buy a good brand and apply according to package directions.\n\nAny good citrus formula will contain trace minerals like iron, zinc, and manganese. Many all-purpose products will work. Just add trace mineral supplements if your fertilizer is deficient. We prefer slow release fertilizers in the granular form rather than fertilizer stakes. Follow rates on the package carefully as fertilizers come in different strengths, release rates, and application schedules. We recommend that you fertilize more often than recommended with most slow release fertilizers. Foliar applications of trace minerals in the form of kelp or other soluble fertilizers can be effective. Yellowing leaves indicate lack of fertilizer or poor drainage.\n\nCommercial organic fertilizers can work well for citrus trees. Supplement granular applications with foliar sprays of fish emulsion and kelp. Some people brew compost 'teas' which can be helpful when applied to plant roots.\n\nMulches\n\nLiberal use of mulches will conserve precious water and help inhibit weed growth. A 2-3 inch layer of redwood shavings, fir bark, compost, or other organic matter can be very helpful for water retention. To reflect heat and hasten fruit ripening, some people mulch with light colored gravel or crushed rock. \"Living mulches\" such as nitrogen fixing clovers can also be planted between trees in an orchard. To avoid root diseases, always keep grasses and other vegetation away from the root collar area. Keep all mulches at least six inches away from the base of the trunk.\n\nSuckering\n\nKnow where the graft union is on your tree. It can usually be seen as a diagonal scar between 4 and 8 inches from the soil. Remove all shoot growth below the graft. These so-called \"suckers\" take vitality from the top of the tree (the fruiting wood). Especially on young trees, they are very vigorous. Remove suckers as soon as they are observed. See photos.\n\nThorns\n\nThorns are removed from rootstocks when they are grafted. Juvenile fruiting wood will sometimes have thorns. This is a young plant's way of defending against grazing animals. As the tree matures, thorns will not appear as often. Prune off thorns if desired.\n\nPruning\n\nCitrus may be pruned as desired to achieve the look you want. Pruning is fine any time of year, except in the winter for outdoor trees. Pinching back tips of new growth can help trees to maintain a round form, without impacting future fruit.\n\nCitrus will look fuller with occasional pruning to shape leggy branches. Very leggy branches can indicate the need for more light (etiolation).\n\nSome trees may develop erratic juvenile growth above the graft. Don't be afraid to completely prune off an erratic branch if it is too irregular or crossing another branch. Other fruitful branches will replace it. Any growth above the graft can eventually bear fruit. Well-pruned trees have higher fruit yields and are less prone to branch breakage.\n\nPollination\n\nCitrus are self-pollinating, even indoors. Some people enjoy pollinating their trees and can do so by using a small soft brush or cotton swab to transfer pollen among the flowers.\n\nEspaliering\n\nCitrus trees can be trained fairly easily to grow on trellises. Simply use green garden ties to hold branches in place and prune to encourage desired branching patterns. Select specimens with an open growth habit that will most closely match with your intended espalier design. See this link for some tips on espaliering citrus trees: \n\nBeneficial Insects\n\nSpiders, lady beetles, lacewings, and preying mantids (praying mantis) are just some of the beneficial critters you may see around citrus trees outdoors. You can even buy some predator insects in local nurseries for release in your garden. See this link for an overview: \nOne reputable source for beneficial organisms is ARBICO.\n\nPest Insects\n\nIt is important to keep your tree free of ants, because they will \"farm\" scales and other honeydew-producing pests, moving them from place to place, milking their secretions, and protecting them from their natural enemies. Ant baits that contain boric acid may be helpful. A recipe for a homemade ant spray can be viewed here.\n\nIf you find harmful insects like scales, aphids, or mites, a household spray bottle of water with some mild dish soap could be all you need. Orange TKO, an organic cleaner, works very well at a dilute rate. You can also find specially formulated Horticultural Soap products at local garden centers. Use a soft toothbrush to scrub away adherent scale insects and recheck in a week to see if another treatment is needed. If scale insects persist, the usual nursery treatment is a 1% solution of light horticultural oil. Learn more.\n\nFrost\n\nMany citrus varieties can tolerate temperatures as low as 32 degrees for 2-3 hours. Even temperate locations can drop below freezing so it's good to have a plan of action ready. Old fashioned Christmas lights (that produce some heat) can be effective, either alone or in combination with frost covers. Anti-transpirant sprays such as 'Cloud Cover' can also be effective when used according to directions. Straw mulches, cloth covers and even plastic sheeting can be combined as needed to provide the necessary level of protection. See this link for more on frost protection options: \n\nProblem Solver: Best Varieties for Indoor Growing\n\nBy far, the Meyer Lemon is the most popular. Like all the lemons, it is easy to grow, prolific and does not need a lot of heat to ripen the fruit. The Meyer is slightly sweeter than the classic commercial varieties (Eureka and Lisbon). Its soft skin develops an orange hue when fruit is fully ripe, and its distinctive, mystical flavor combines lemon with a hint of tangerine. The Meyer lemon can be very productive, even indoors, and does not need a lot of heat to ripen the fruit.\n\nThe Variegated Pink lemon is a gorgeous plant that will also do well indoors. The trees are slightly larger than the Meyer and are very attractive with variegation in the foliage and young fruit. Flower buds and shoots of new growth tinged with fuchsia.\n\nOf the oranges, the Trovita is most suitable for indoor growing. Trovita ripens in the spring, so it can often be taken outdoors to finish sweetening the fruit.\n\nKaffir Lime leaves are used extensively in Thai and Cambodian cooking, and zest of the fruit is an ingredient in some curry paste recipes. Keep your Kaffir lime tree close at hand in a sunny window and you'll be able to create authentic recipes year-round.\n\nCalamondin (Kalamansi) is a diminutive tree originating in the Philippines. It's ornamental form, fragrant blooms and small tart orange-colored fruits have made it a favorite for centuries. The sour juice of ripe fruits can be used in salad dressings and other recipes.\n\nOro Blanco Grapefruit is the sweetest white grapefruit, and most tolerant of indoor growing. Provided adequate conditions indoors, it produces edible fruit without the high heat usually necessary for grapefruit. See our Citrus Variety Information Chart for additional information by variety.\n\nProblem Solver: Growing Dwarf Citrus as Indoor/Outdoor Plants\n\nContainer-grown citrus trees can be kept on patios and decks in warm weather, then moved inside to avoid frost damage in winter. To avoid shocking your tree with a sudden change of environment, move it gradually. Place the tree in partial shade for a week or so, to make the transition from full sun outdoors to partial sun indoors. It is best to let the roots get a bit dry before moving trees indoors, to ease the transition and reduce the chance of roots staying too wet through the winter. Later you can reverse this process after any danger of frost has safely passed. You will find that you need to water less indoors. A moisture tester will help prevent over watering. See this page for watering guidelines and recommendations.\n\nIf your tree will receive less than 6 hours of full sun per day indoors, it is best to supplement with grow lights. Adequate sun exposure is important for fruit production. See this link for helpful information on grow light systems. Some lemon enthusiasts have reported having good success supplementing with \"PAR-38″ LED grow lights. They are convenient to use because they screw into a common light fixture socket. They are available in several wattages and roughly match the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll."

      "text": "Tree & Shrub Care Guide\n\nYou'll find trees and shrubs sold three different ways, depending on the time of year and where you shop.\n\n1. Bare-root plants are typically available in late winter or early spring and are purchased while they're dormant. Bare-root plants are typically the least expensive because they don't have the cost of soil or containers associated with them. Learn more on planting bare-root plants.\n\n2. Balled-and-burlapped plants, often simply called B&B, are available from spring to fall. They feature a root ball in soil that's surrounded by a large burlap (or similar material) bag. Balled-and-burlapped plants are usually the largest specimens your nursery offers. Learn more on planting balled-and-burlapped plants.\n\n3. Container-grown trees and shrubs are the most commonly available. They're probably what you think of when you look for plants at your local nursery. Like balled-and-burlapped plants, they're typically available throughout the year. However, they come in a wide range of sizes. Learn more on planting container-grown plants.\n\nPlanting Tips\n\nNo matter which method you use to plant your trees and shrubs, water them well after planting. Spread a 2- to 3-inch-deep layer of mulch over the soil around the plant; this creates a protective zone so you don't have to mow lawn grasses right up against a newly planted tree (and risk damaging its young bark). It will also help the soil maintain its moisture level longer, so you have to water less.\n\nYou may need to stake newly planted trees, especially if you planted them as bare-root or if you have a hard time keeping them upright. Support them only for the first year or two; remove the stakes after that so your trees and shrubs can develop a sturdy trunk and root system.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to support a young tree is to use a single stake about as tall as the tree. Drive the stake in the ground about 18 inches deep and about 6 inches away from the edge of the planting hole. Use heavy wire wrapped by a section of old garden hose and tie the tree to the stake using a figure-8 pattern. (The hose prevents the wire from grinding against the bark.)\n\nTest Garden Tip: Avoid pulling the wire tight because it can damage the tree. The trunk should be able to move lightly in any direction if you push against it.\n\nPruning\n\nMany trees and shrubs benefit from a little pruning throughout their life. The process may seem complicated, but follow these guidelines to make it easier.\n\nWhat to Prune:\nNo matter what trees and shrubs you're growing, it's a good idea to prune out any dead or diseased branches. This helps the plant look better and can prevent the disease from spreading.\n\nYou should prune out any wayward stems that block pathways, driveways, or grow into the side of a house or other structures. Also remove branches that cross and rub against one another; as the bark gets rubbed off, it makes the tree more susceptible to disease.\n\nPrune most summer-flowering shrubs (including rose of Sharon, butterfly bush, 'Annabelle' hydrangea, and spirea) in late fall, winter, or early spring.\n\nTest Garden Tip: Dip your pruning shears in a bleach or rubbing alcohol solution between cuts. This prevents the disease from spreading to healthy branches.\n\n-Gardeners often prune trees and shrubs in winter, and for\nmany woody plants, this makes the most sense, but for\nspring flowering plants, the best time is right after they\nflower. That's because they form their flower beds on summer\ngrowth and winter pruning would eliminate much of the spring\nbloom. Forsythia is a good example. After it's done blooming,\neliminate branches that are too large by clipping them off\nnear the ground or find their branching point like this\nor make your cut there. Lilac is another example. This\nplant is getting too tall. So, I'll cut this entire\nbranch off at the base. That will open up the\nplant so this young shoots can grow and take its\nplace, but with a much smaller, tidier form. These guidelines\napply to other spring bloomers as well such as magnolia,\nWeigela and mock orange, azaleas, and rhododendrons."

Drought and diseases are weaking the trees and with most Texas oaks, you won't know they're rotted out until they fall on your house. I woke up one morning many years ago and found that one of the main trunks off a large oak (18\" diameter, about 20 ft long) had fallen, narrowly missing my dog's house. About 40% of the central core of the trunk had rotted out from the inside.\n\nThat, and Dallas has gotten some pretty nasty wind/thunderstorms over the past few weeks.\n\nIf they don't agree with the findings, hire a tree guy for a second opinion.\n\nWe have a small ravine behind our house with some massive farking trees in it.

Unfortunately, all can become such if enough residents stop caring (or care too much about the superficial) and let tinpot dictators in.\n\nI think they should pave the entire and then surround it with rubber padding. White, because black can get hot. They should not allow people outside unless they are going to work or have special permission from the association.

The only color on anything, cars, unit fences, clothing shal be white #001.\n\nask those people in Colorado about buying a \"wooded lot\". We all love trees. But trees need lots and lots of space far from houses and foundations. Best rule of thumb is they should be no less than twenty feet from a structure. Most urban lots do not have that kind of space. Then there is the mistaken assumption that if you go into a forest and cut down 80% of the trees and build houses around the remaining few, that those trees that are left will still go on acting like a forest. They won't. The developer probably wasn't too careful about driving over the root zone. Instant death warrant. Then the storms come in and a tree whose root system depended on its neighbors to keep it upright can no longer hold itself up. Instant dead fall. Then one has to consider the age of the tree. Trees, just like humans, get old and die. You have to watch for that and cull the old trees and replace them with new trees. Expensive. Nobody thinks to put \"consult arborist\" into their yearly budgets.Sounds like about 10 cases in 6 years. Considering one particularly bad storm could be responsible for multiple cases, I don't think that is particularly strange. What, exactly, is a properly maintained tree, by the way and where is the evidence that these trees were not? Frankly, this sounds like a pretty reasonable positiont to take. All the trees are on HOA-owned property... what's the beef?\n\nThe HOA said it offered to let residents keep the trees behind their homes if they agree to accept liability for them. Boggs signed a waiver, but said some of his neighbors oppose it.\n\nAntidamascus:Seriously. Granted I don't know much about Texas weather but are they really getting such massive storms that normal healthy trees are being toppled left and right?\n\nI get the feeling from how the article was phrased that these were trees that were native and left there when the subdivision was built, so they hadn't been maintained through their life to the satisfaction that they'll survive a major storm. Old trees crash down often enough that the HOA decided they don't want that liability.\n\nKeeping themselves from getting sued into oblivion is probably a good idea.\n\nAt first I kinda thought this was about my friend's neighborhood down in Houston. A whole bunch of trees on the HOAs property died in the drought last year, and she wrote them a letter asking that they be removed before they fell and caused damage. They ignored it. Then, a few weeks ago there was a storm and, yeah, one fell right on her house.\n\n\\She cleverly CCed her insurance agent on the letter, so she's got the HOA board on the run.\n\nAntidamascus: suckerThings get quite violent here. Not as bad as Oklahoma, but you can expect a few storms a year with winds over 80 mph, golf ball or larger hail, and a dozen tornadoes.\n\nAlso, as previously mentioned, there is drought weakening them. One thing that people don't seem to realize is that trees have lifespans. They get old and die just like everything else. The fast growing trees tend to have shorter lifespans and the slower growing ones tend to have longer ones, but they all get old and die. How old are the trees in the story?\n\nBegoggle:I like how they are called \"owners\", as if they actually own anything. The HOA owns the trees and your ass too, and does whatever they want. You signed your rights away when you bought the HOA home.\n\nI'm sure all the people who sold their HOA homes for a profit would disagree with you.\n\nReminds me of a story from my old home town. There is a track and football field behind the block I grew up on (there is a elementary/junior high school there). One of my neighbors was walking along the edge of the track during high winds and a tree fell on her. She suffered some pretty serious injuries, but she recovered. This particular tree was on the school's property so she figured that she would sue the school district to negligence (the tree had some rotting in the core, but there was no sign of this rot). The court ultimately ruled that the school was not responsible (\"act of god\") but the school then ordered that all trees on the school's property along the athletic field be cut down. When the school marked some tree that were on private property there was a lot of uproar and surveyors had to come in to mark out the property lines. Most of the trees along there were on private property, but enough were removed that there are some ugly gaps in the trees. Two of them were favored climbing trees from when I was a kid. I hate idiots.\n\nI bloody love my tree-lined street. They won't be taken down en masse here, thank goodness, because the neighborhood is so old - my house is almost 100. There's and oak in the alley out back, a redwood next door, and sycamores all over. Unfortunately the power company does total hack jobs for line maintenance (nor can they seem to maintain poles). I really like how the street looks and how the house gets shade. Even raking leaves has its moments.\n\nsuckerpunch:It sounds like the HOA and owners failed to properly maintain the trees.\n\nAgreed, and the current plan looks like a good solution for the current problem. It appears they have only selected trees that present a hazard and individuals can opt out if they assume the liability of their decision.\n\nwambu: Agreed, and the current plan looks like a good solution for the current problem. It appears they have only selected every treetrees that present a hazard and individuals can opt out if theyalready assume the liability of their decisionproperty."

The leaves can be either deciduous or evergreen depending on the species. The flowers are produced in loose inflorescences, each flower small, with four or five yellowish petals and ten stamens. The fruit is a globose four or five-valved capsule 5-8 cm diameter, containing numerous winged seeds.\n\nIn forests, the northern red oak grows straight and tall, to 28 m (90 ft), exceptionally to 43 m (140 ft) tall, with a trunk of up to 50-100 cm (20-40 in) diameter; open-grown trees do not get so tall, but can develop a stouter trunk, up to 2 m (6 ft) in diameter. It has stout branches growing at right angles to the stem, forming a narrow round-topped head. It grows rapidly and is tolerant of many soils and varied situations, although it prefers the glacial drift and well-drained borders of streams."

      "text": "Hypoxylon canker of oaks\n\nOne of the greatest losses that a homeowner can experience is the loss of a tree. Not only is a tree an aesthetic part of the yard, but it also provides shade for the homeowner as well as shelter for birds and other animals. Trees in the landscape are often focal points so that the entire family can enjoy the wonders of nature. Therefore, it is tragic that although it takes years for a tree to develop, it requires only a short period of time for a disease or diseases to kill it.\n\nAlthough there are early records of Hypoxylon Canker of oaks in Oklahoma, not much attention was given to its potential until the spring of 1979. Reports about the seriousness of this disease were first received from Pushmataha County in southeastern Oklahoma. The disease is severe, to very severe in several areas of Oklahoma County. The Bethany and Edmond areas are the heaviest affected areas.\n\nThe Hypoxylon Canker fungus infects most species of oaks and has been diagnosed from numerous habitats, including forest sites, trees in pastures, recently developed home sites, and established residential areas.\n\nThe casual organism of oak Hypoxylon Canker is a fungus, Hypoxylon atropunctatum. Unfortunately, little is known about this organism that attacks and kills trees. However, it is known that trees that have been stressed or weakened from drought or have had their root systems injured are much more susceptible to this disease than healthy trees.\n\nResearch indicates that the organism enters branches through wounds. The fungus then grows through the sapwood and causes decay. The first outward symptoms that may be evident are yellowing and wilting of leaves and death of top branches. The fungus is capable of spreading up to three feet above and below the point of entry within one growing season. Researchers have been able to isolate the fungus from seedling oak trees which showed no symptoms of infection. This would indicate that the fungus may be active in the trees for a number of years before disease symptoms are noticed. When the trees are weakened, particularly by drought, or injured, the disease is capable of overcoming resistance of the host, and the tree dies.\n\nThe disease progresses through the branches, causing dieback symptoms. Another early symptom is a lightening of the bark. These silver areas look as if they have been sprayed with bleach.\n\nThere is no effective control for this disease, which is due in part to lack of recognition of the early stages of the infection. Literature states the tree should be cut to the ground and burned if more than 15 percent of the crown is affected. No stump area should be left because the fungus can still reproduce even on very small stumps. In my observations, removing a tree before it is dead does little to reduce the amount of fungal spores, since more than likely there is an infected tree or trees next door or across the street.\n\nThe best defense against this disease is to maintain trees in a healthy, vigorous growing condition by adequate fertilization and to provide adequate water year round."

      "text": "The time to prune depends on the kind of tree and the desired results.\n\nLight pruning can be done anytime. The removal of unwanted growth while it is small is easier and will have\nless dwarfing effect than if done later. The removal of broken, dead, weak, or heavily shaded branches will have little\nor no dwarfing effect on the tree no matter when they are removed.\n\nRapid plant development can best be maintained if the required pruning is done before the period of rapid growth usually\noccurring in the spring. Most deciduous trees can be pruned during the dormant period between leaf fall and spring growth.\nEvergreen plants will be set back the least if pruned just before spring growth starts. A few broadleaved evergreen pants make\ntheir most rapid growth after the weather warms later in the season. Pruning of these plants can be delayed. Pruning just\nbefore the period of most rapid growth will keep the most leaves productive for the longest time. Also pruning cuts will be\nquickly concealed by new growth.\n\nTo retard plant development, prune when growth is about complete. The pruning should not be so severe nor so early\nas to encourage new shoot growth. For many plants, the time to prune for maximum dwarfing usually would be in late spring to\nmiddle summer.\n\nLeaf area will be reduced for the longest period of time. Pruning cuts should be made so they are not easily seen.\n\nDirecting the growth of a young tree can be done effectively during the growing season. Branches in desired positions\ncan be encourage by pinching back or by removing competing shoots in less desirable positions.\n\nCorrective pruning may be easiest during the growing season. Branches that are too low because of the weight of leaves\nand fruit can be partially or completely thinned. Dead and weak limbs are easily spotted for removal.\n\nTime of pruning to maximize flowering depends on the flowering habit of the tree.\n\nPlants flowering on current-season's growth (e.g. crape myrtle, Japanese pagoda tree and jacaranda) should be pruned during the\nwinter before growth begins. Moderate to severe pruning will favor larger blossom clusters.\n\nPlants flowering in the spring from buds on 1-year wood, particularly the flowering fruit trees, should be pruned at or near the\nend of the bloom period. The blossoms can be enjoyed and then removed before they set fruit that may compete with new shoots.\nVigorous growth will be encouraged o which to bear next year's bloom.\n\nBleeding of pruning wounds can be heavy on mature trees such as maples and elms. Bleeding of susceptible trees can\nbe minimized if the cuts are small (less then 3\") and made in the fall or early winter. Bleeding is much more likely if severe\npruning is done just before growth begins in the spring. Bleeding usually is not harmful to the tree. However, if it is\nheavy and persistent, it may cause bark injury below the pruning cut.\n\nCold injury may be increased by pruning. Some plant (e.g. roses, subtropicals) may be stimulated into new growth by\npruning in the fall or early winter. A pruned plant may begin growth during a warm period in the winter only to be injured when\nit turns cold again. These plants should be pruned close to the time growth begins in the spring.\n\nAt high elevations where temperatures below 0° F may occur, it is best to delay pruning until just before growth begins in the\nspring. Even though growth is not stimulated, pruning may reduce plant hardiness somewhat."

Can it be saved?\n\n-- Becky Nebes, Frankfort\n\nA. The canker (sunken areas on a stem) you describe sounds like golden canker caused by the fungus Cryptodiaporthe corni, which often is found on pagoda dogwood, Cornus alternifolia.\n\nIf the main trunk of your tree is infected, this disease will be fatal; however, smaller branches can be pruned back to healthy wood.\n\nRemove any branches that have the golden yellow sunken areas and are wilted or dead. Clean your pruning tools to disinfect (use rubbing alcohol or a 10 percent solution of bleach) in between cuts on a dry day. Good sanitation is important since the spores help spread the disease.\n\nCut 4 to 6 inches (if possible) below the infection site.\n\nQ. My landscaper recommended I spray my euonymus for scale. When is the best time to control this pest?\n\n-- Nancy Peterson, Deerfield\n\nA. Euonymus scale is the most serious pest of euonymus plants. It can be identified by small, narrow white lines or brownish-gray lumps found on the plant's stems and leaves.\n\nThe tiny yellow crawlers move to tender new growth to feed and are most commonly found on the undersides of leaves.\n\nInsecticidal soaps, summer-weight oil or dormant oil sprays and insecticides can be used for controlling euonymus scale.\n\nDormant oil should be sprayed in late winter or very early spring to smother females before they lay eggs.\n\nThe summer-weight oil spray for the late spring application can be applied when the catalpa trees are in bloom.\n\nCatalpa is an indicator plant and its flowering coincides with scale crawler emergence. Always follow all label directions.\n\nThere are several ways to reduce scale populations: prune out heavily infested branches; avoid planting against a foundation, which makes plants more susceptible due to poor air circulation; and avoid planting euonymus varieties that are prone to scale infestations, especially wintercreeper (Euonymus fortunei)."

Here are the best ways to protect plants from the cold -- inside or out.\n\nThere are still lots of things you can plant, and you can start the new year on the right foot by doing timeless chores that will add to your garden's health as spring approaches. (Bing:When is the first day of spring?)\n\nEverything you accomplish now will make spring that much sweeter.\n\nTrees and shrubs This month's tree and shrub tasks are all about planting, pruning and protecting.\n\nIf you live in a place that has mild winters, you can still plant trees of all kinds: fruit trees, shade trees and flowering trees; and choosing them is fun now, since nurseries tend to add their new selections in January.\n\nOn a day when temperatures are below freezing, plant new evergreens, rose bushes and deciduous shrubs.\n\nWhile you shouldn't prune flowering trees until after they've bloomed, you can now prune most shrubs and deciduous shade trees.\n\nWhen you notice new buds on deciduous trees, possibly late this month or in early February, give them their third and last shot of dormant spray — follow the label's instructions and avoid spraying on days that are windy, rainy or below freezing.\n\nKeep up with raking; fallen leaves can do heavy damage if left to smother grass.\n\nIf you have snowfall, knock snow off the branches of evergreens and fine-branched deciduous trees using an upward motion to keep limbs from breaking — don't risk the benign fluffy stuff turning into ice overnight. If breakage does occur, prune broken branches.\n\nWinterizing With winter in full force, there are several things you can do to protect challenged plants, trees, shrubs and even birds.\n\nDon't haul that Christmas tree out to the curb just yet: Its branches can be used to protect tender plants and even root vegetables and perennials or to form a wind or sun shield for shrubs such as azaleas, rhododendrons, holly and boxwood. Or the full tree can be staked near a feeder to shield birds from cold. (Place far enough away to avoid accidents with cats.)\n\nArticle continues below\n\nIf you live in an area that has heavy winters and you haven't yet wrapped newly planted trees or thin-barked trees such as maple, ash, mountain ash and linden, do so now. Wrap from the base upward to repel moisture.\n\nKeep protecting tender plants against freezes by covering them with burlap or other cloth supported by a perimeter of stakes; just don't let the cloth touch the leafy parts.\n\nHouseplants Winter houseplant care is more about attentive restraint than high maintenance.\n\nWhen you water, which should be minimal during the winter, do it just enough so that water saturates the soil and comes through the drainage holes; at this time of year, plants left in standing water can suffer root damage.\n\nTurn plants every two weeks for balanced foliage as they seek sunlight.\n\nCheck for pests in the greenhouse and on houseplants; treat with organic products so kids and pets aren't endangered.\n\nHold off on transplanting those plants whose roots are potbound.\n\nOn nights that are extremely cold, be sure to draw the curtains or blinds of plant windows.\n\nProfessional Services\n\nFind local plumbers, electricians, contractors and more.\n\nLittle live things Wouldn't it be nice if birds ate slugs for a living? If you're a feeder of birds, don't stop now — during this month they'll need all the help they can get, and it needn't be fancy. Birds will likely find any station above snow level, from old logs to carpet scraps.\n\nEvery slug you catch before it reproduces can spare you from facing several more generations. (And you thought rabbits were prolific.)\n\nMaintenance Take this chance to get sleek for spring. No, not to buff up for your getaway swimwear — you know, the fun stuff. Machines. Tools.\n\nMSN needs your opinion!\n\nI really don't think there is a way to kill ivy. I made the horrendous mistake of planting some my dear old Mom insisted on giving me and it, of course, took off. I finally decided it was going to cover my entire property if I didn't get rid of it so one day, after being properly fortified with a glass of cold iced tea, I got on my hands and knees and began to dig it out. Many, many garbage bags later, I was certain, just certain I had it all. Success!!! So a few weeks later, out filling my bird feeders, what to my horror did I spy peeking out of the ground? Ivy! Yep, ivy. And two years later I continue to dig it out as it sprouts it's nasty little head above ground. But it's just an odd sprout now and then, not an entirely covered yard so I guess I can call it a success as long as I have the strength to keep rooting out those odds and ends pieces. NEVER, EVER PLANT IVY, unless it's in a container it cannot escape as it will take over your yard in a short space of time.\n\nDon't forget to keep your poinsettias inside and take them out after the last frost to keep them alive till next Christmas. the secret to getting the red leaves is to put them in the dark for the month before Christmas!

      "text": "Recent Fact Sheets\n\nPresenter: John Patrick, 20/08/2011\n\nSERIES 22 Episode 28\n\nChoosing a feature tree is a big decision. There are so many possibilities that you can end up paralysed with confusion and never actually make a choice. I'm going to give you some tips about choosing a feature tree and I'm going to tell you 3 of my particular favourites. But first to the tips. There are a number of factors that you need to consider.\n\nAssess the Site Most importantly, assess the site you want to put the tree in. A bit of basic research will tell you what will suit your climate and conditions. The most obvious thing to do is to take a walk around your neighbourhood to see what trees work and what appeals to you, because these trees are suited to the conditions you're in. You also need to work out how high and wide you want your tree to be and what you have space for.\n\nDeciduous or Evergreen Next decide whether you want an evergreen tree like the lovely Angophora which will of course give you year round shade, or a deciduous tree like the Chinese Elm which will allow winter light in. Think too about the effect of that shade on existing plants and lawn. And of course, consider the shade and your entertaining area. You wouldn't want to entertain in really deep shade. And if you're choosing something like the Lily Pily , remember this is a pretty water-hungry plant, so, because of the competition, it's pretty hard to grow other plants underneath it.\n\nNow you may want colour, in which case spring flowering trees like Cherries and Plums are really fantastic and they'll also give you autumn colour, but for that, you're really better looking towards the Maples because they have wonderful rich reds and oranges. I also like to think about fruit on the tree and of course fruit can be highly decorative too and that's where the Persimmon (Diospyros kaki) comes into its own because it hangs onto those striking orange fruit so long.\n\nJohn's Top Three My first favourite is the Crepe Myrtle (Lagerstroemia cv.), the ideal tree for the smaller garden. Not only do they have wonderful summer flowers from white, through all the pinks to reds, but they also have great autumn colour and particularly good bark and that of course gives you great appeal during the winter. If you've got good bark like that then uplight it for the best effect.\n\nNext on my list is the Strawberry Tree, the Irish Strawberry Tree, Arbutus unedo and it has these exquisite hanging flowers which the native birds love to get into for food. They're followed by small orange to red berries. There are a number of species of these Arbutus and they're all really excellent garden plants.\n\nAnd then there's a native tree - one of my favourites. It's the Water Gum - Tristaniopsis laurina and I not only like its beautiful mature bark, but also the young bark which is a deep red colour. It has attractive yellow flowers and it's really well behaved in the home garden. The great thing about the 3 of them is that they're all really drought tolerant.\n\nA good feature tree adds both aesthetic and monetary value to your home, so it's really important that you make the right choice. Good luck!"

      "text": "Sometime ago, I wrote about my sad lemon tree that had blossoms and no leaves. Well now it has one green stem with 2 leaves and a small lemon, yes a lemon!\n\nIf you remember this is the tree that I consulted a citrus grower, looked on the IPM web site, and contacted Lance Walhem, who wrote a book on citrus, and they were stumped as to what was going on with it and so they could not give me any information on what I could do.\n\nSo I decided to let it be and only water it, when I watered my other citrus. I did not even give it any fertilizer as I was sure it would not survive, and it is still a very sad looking tree. I am not sure it is going to survive, but maybe the tree has made the decision to try and survive.\n\nI will be surprised if the lemon it has stays and continues to grow to maturity, but for now it has a lemon.\n\nOn Saturday, June 23, there was an amazing talk by John \"Cedar\" Seeger of the Four Winds Citrus Growers. He held court at Annie's Annuals in Richmond. The day was perfect, sunny but not too warm with a gentle breeze as we were given a lecture – fun, not dry – on citrus growing in the Four Winds style. First, though, a few facts about the company.\n\nFour Winds was started in 1946 by Floyd Dillion, a transplant from the Mid West. He came to California to start his own business and because he LOVED oranges, decided to start growing them. He was rather a visionary to notice that men coming home from the War were buying their own homes. He also noticed that the typical house of the time had a small yard with a patio. There was not enough space for a standard size orange tree in those yards, so he decided to figure out how to make the trees smaller or \"dwarf\" sized so that the tree could be grown in a pot. Through breeding and with plain old hard work and luck, he was able to hybridize dwarf sized trees! His goal of \"every yard, an orange tree\" was eventually realized. Today Four Winds is the largest producer of dwarf citrus trees.\n\nFloyd is gone now, but his descendants still own the business. His grandson runs the main office in Southern California, while his grand-daughter and her husband (John) run the growing fields in Winters.\n\nThings we learned from John:\n\nHow we grow our citrus trees effects the size of the tree. We can control the size of the tree when we grow in containers. If we take a \"pip\" or seed from an orange and plant it, we will get a tree that will be standard-sized or quite large. If we buy a tree already started, it can be a \"semi-dwarf\" or a \"dwarf\" sized tree. The size of the last two is dependent on the root-stock used. It is a good idea to check the tag for the growing size. This is to assure that the tree will fit within the limits of your yard.\n\nJohn brought up root-stocks for several reasons: 1) the root stock effects the entire tree's growth; 2) folks get confused as to why citrus on the tree is not consistent with fruit of past seasons (sound familiar?); 3) folks don't know why the tree has a different foliage pattern than before. John brought up the root stock known as the \"Flying Dragon\", a trifoliate-leafed plant primarily known for the wicked knife-like thorns. It used to be a popular and common root stock but is now grown as a \"security gate\" shrub for around houses and businesses. Four Winds uses a total of 8 root stocks for its propagation of citrus.\n\nRoot stocks are chosen for the different varieties based on hardiness and, believe it or not, for seedlessness. In the business, the cutting is the fruiting variety, while the mother is the root stock.\n\n98% of all troubles growing citrus = TOO MUCH WATER! According to John, \"drainage is everything\". If you have bad drainage, grow your citrus in containers or on a mound. The mounding method works well as the roots of a citrus of any size are 2 feet down. The exception is if you plant a seed into the soil where it will form a tap-root. Citrus purchased will not form tap roots. It take 5 years to have a citrus tree fill in a wine barrel; by that time, the tree should be 6 feet tall. Plant in a sheltered spot; would you believe that the Meyer lemon is a great houseplant even in California? John swears it's true!\n\nWhen you plant a citrus tree in its new container, the top roots, those little frilly roots should be at the surface. If your tree appears to be in \"suspended animation\" or isn't showing any signs of growth, physically expose those top roots yourself – it will start showing new growth again.\n\nCitrus trees need more than just N, P & K (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium). Use a 3-1-1 or multiples of that formula with trace elements. Sea weed products or finished compost supply these needed traces.\n\nIf you planted your citrus in or near the lawn, remove the sod or grass no less than 4 feet from the base of the tree. Water the tree with 5-7 gallons of water once every 7 days. In Winters, John waters the nursery trees 3 times a week, with one of those watering containing fertilizer. He suggests that we fertilize citrus year around; those in the ground monthly. A containerized tree can have a thick layer of compost instead on top of the soil. \"Good roots = good tops\"; healthy roots are either white or tan and firm to the touch. Don't use fertilizer stakes on the citrus as they can create \"hot\" fertilizer spots which can burn the roots.\n\nThere was more excellent information which I will put down in my next blog.The talk was good, the company fine, the weather lovely, and the shopping afterward was divine!\n\nSometimes gardening problems really stump me as this one has now, so maybe someone who reads this will be able to help.\n\nI have a lemon tree that some of you might have heard me talk about, if not this is the story.\n\nI was given this 'Meyer' lemon about 4 years ago. It had bright, healthy green leaves and over all, the plant looked good. I planted it just like I have planted my other citrus. However, about 7 months later I noticed it was losing its leaves. Not knowing what was going on, I looked in our California Master Gardener Handbook for an answer, and I also went on the IPM website ( for information on what the problem might be. I found no answers there either, so I contacted Lance Walheim who had written a book on citrus called Citrus: Complete Guide to Selecting & Growing More Than 100 Varieties. I figured he knows citrus and their problems, but it turns out that he was as baffled as I was and didn't have an answer for me either.\n\nDuring this time the tree had blossoms, but no leaves! The next year it had leaves on one side, no blossoms on the other side. Then the leaves fell off and blossoms on one side appeared.\n\nThis year again blossoms, no leaves. After exhausting all the places and people for ideas and being baffled I have decided to let the leafless, blossom bearing lemon do its own thing. I don't know how long it will go on like this as it goes into its 5th year of life. Oh by the way it has never had fruit.\n\nI was just given some really wise advice from a dear friend: Find the silver linings. Applying that to the state of my garden in the depths of a dry, windy winter makes for a colorful crazy quilt of good things. Here goes:\n\nSeeing red: Right now, the eye-catching spots in my yard are red. Tucked among the greens are Nandina domestica 'Firepower', which live up to their name when the sun hits them. The other reds are the berries hanging from the toyons (Heteromeles arbutifolia), firethorn (Pyracantha angustifolia)and asparagus ferns (Asparagus densiflorus 'Sprengeri'). The birds love the berries, too.\n\nLack of leaves: The winds of December took most of the leaves, and now I have an unhindered view of a big blue sky. It's a great contrast to the bare branches and occasional evergreen.\n\nOrchids: OMG, have you seen the orchids? They are everywhere, in full, beautiful bloom. A local warehouse store is selling a wide variety of Phalaenopsis orchids, beautifully potted, for $15. I succumbed to two, and they will provide us fresh blooms for the next month or two. Even the tough, big orchids I keep outside are ready to bloom. So exciting!\n\nCitrus: My potted 'Moro' blood orange is heavy with fruit, as is our tiny 'Improved Meyer' tree, which is in the ground. The bright yellow and orange draw my attention every time I head out back.\n\nFight on: Our tree mallow (Lavatera maritime) is the little engine that could. Last spring, this billowy shrub was showing signs of a nasty rust invasion. We cut it to just 6 inches from the ground and crossed our fingers. It now stands 6 feet tall again, and is covered in lovely lilac-colored hibiscus-like blooms. Gotta love a fighter.\n\nVernal hors d'oeuvres: Our warm, dry winter has caused many plants to start putting on new growth much sooner than normal. For instance, I have a crabapple in blossom now, and many of our Narcissus bulbs are nearly done blooming. We should expect many more nights with freezing temperatures, which will stunt this new growth. We also should be prepared for a long, wet spring, much like last year. So, I have to admit, I'm looking at our odd weather pattern as a vernal hors d'oeuvre, a nibble of spring. As long as we get some rain soon, it indeed will be a silver lining."

      "text": "This guide to outdoor bonsai\ncare is intended for use in the Pacific Northwest - specifically\nWestern Washington. Recommendations in this guide may not be\nappropriate for other regions with different seasons. When in\ndoubt, consult a trusted local bonsai advisor!\n\nJanuary:\nThis is the heart of winter, and while your trees are deep in\ndormancy, there is still work to be done. Continue your winter\ncare by keeping your trees mulched and protected from freezing\nweather. Don't forget to check them as they do need watered from\ntime to time, although their water needs will be minimal.\n\nIt's time for your second preventive\nspraying. Use horticultural dormant oil on your evergreens, but\nremember that dormant oil should not be applied when temperatures\nmight be expected to drop below freezing before the spray has\ndried, because freezing causes the oil and water to separate,\nand the oil forms globules - good coverage is lost. Note also,\nthat although oil and lime sulfur may be combined during the\ndormant season, oil and sulfur as separate applications should\nnot precede or follow one another within 30 days. Avoid spraying\nthose varieties with a blue-green cast to them, as the spray\nwill green them up! For deciduous varieties only, mix a little\nlime-sulfur with your dormant oil spray. This is a good time\nto apply wire to some deciduous trees that break bud early, like\nlarch, but be careful to not snap off the new buds as you wire.\nThis also a good time to inventory your pots in order to give\nsome thought to your repotting needs that are fast approaching.\nGive your pots a thorough cleaning so that when they are needed,\nthey are clean and ready.\n\nFebruary:\nDepending on your area, February can be the beginning of early\nspring. Frequently trees like Japanese larch can begin to bud\nout. If you need to repot, be sure to be vigilant about not letting\nyour repotted trees freeze, since a cold snap can be just around\nthe corner. You can begin to wire your deciduous trees while\nthe buds are still small.\n\nGet your tools ready by sharpening\nthem up. Consider your soil needs for repotting and begin stocking\nthe needed components. Sift your bark and grit. Get your hands\ndirty! You can begin to prune deciduous trees taking care to\nbe sure that remaining branches and shoots are in good health.\nIf in doubt as to whether buds on a particular branch or shoot\nare viable, then wait to prune until you see some bud-swell.\nDon't forget to sterilize your tools with alcohol before going\non to another tree in order to avoid spreading diseases and /\nor pests.\n\nCheck your PSBA calendar to see who\nthe guest artist is for February.\n\nMarch:\nTypically in Western Washington, your deciduous trees needing\nto be repotted that year will need to be completed before the\nend of the month. Look to your trees for signs that they are\nwakening. Look for swelling buds and white growing tips at the\nend of your roots. Those deciduous trees that you were unsure\nabout pruning can probably be safely pruned. Seal all substantial\ncuts with paste and protect them from heavy frost. Avoid repotting\nany larch that are showing green. If they are showing green,\nit is best to wait until next year.\n\nGenerally there is no need to begin\nfertilizing your trees yet. Let them leaf out, and for your repotted\ntrees, begin your feeding regime at least one month after repotting.\nYou may want to keep them sheltered under the eaves of the house\nand out of cold winds.\n\nCheck your PSBA Calendar to see what\nis going on at the monthly meeting.\n\nApril:\nIf you haven't repotted your deciduous trees by now, it might\nbe best to wait until next year. However, junipers are OK to\ndo now, and pines can be started any time during the month. Continue\nto provide good after care, by protecting repotted trees from\nfrosts. You can begin fertilizing trees repotted in March. Keep\nyour initial fertilizer mix on the light side for those first\ncouple doses of fertilizer.\n\nContinue to watch for insects, especially\naphids on crabapples, maples, etc. As the weather warms you will\nneed to step up your watering routine some.\n\nCheck your PSBA calendar to see who\nthe April guest artist will be! Start \"sprucing\" up\na tree or two for the annual Spring Show in May.\n\nMay:\nWrap up any repotting of pines by early in the month. Remember\nto keep them in the shade for a couple weeks. Trees repotted\nin April can be given their first light doses of fertilizer.\n\nContinue to patrol for insects and\nadjust your watering to match the warmer weather. Candles on\npines can be pinched any time. Start with the weak buds and do\nthe strong buds a week or so later. Spruce, junipers and larch\nshoots are probably ready for their first pinching of the season.\nWatch the new growth on your deciduous trees and trim back to\n1-2 pairs of leaves. It is critical to stay on top of maples\nnow and pinch out that center bud just as it emerges from the\nmiddle of the first two leaves. Continue feeding your trees on\na regular basis.\n\nDon't forget to attend the Spring\nShow. We need your help so please contact the chair to volunteer\nto docent or work the registration or consignment tables.\n\nJune:\nThings are growing like crazy now. Deciduous trees will need\nregular trimming. Be sure to sterilize your tools as you move\nfrom tree to tree. Two needle pines that are being encouraged\nto back bud should have new growth removed by mid month. Do this\nonly with strong trees. If the tree is weak or certain branches\nare weak, then it is best to get the tree or branches healthy\nbefore removing all of this year's growth.\n\nJune is a good time to leaf prune\ndeciduous trees like maples or elms. This should be done only\non strong trees that have been fertilized well. On maples, be\nsure to leave most of the petiole.\n\nPests are in full swing now, so use\ndue vigilance. Spray as needed. June is a time when many trees\nsuffer wire scars so be sure to pay good attention to the trees\non which you have wire. Pay special attention to deciduous trees\nand to the wire on the outside bend of branches. Continue with\nyour fertilizing routine.\n\nCall a fellow bonsai buddy and offer\nto water / care for his or her trees when your friend is on vacation\nthis summer!\n\nJuly:\nSummer is in full swing now so watch your watering daily, especially\nsmall trees like mame and / or shohin. Trees that are sensitive\nto full sun, like Japanese maples, should be situated so they\nare at least partially shaded from hot afternoon sun. Continue\nto check your wires.\n\nOn black pines from which you removed\nthis year's growth, you should start to see new buds forming.\nBe careful of these new buds if you are adding or removing wire,\nsince they are the future branches. Some trees, like pines &\nhemlocks enjoy a couple mild doses of fertilizer during late\nsummer and early fall.\n\nDon't forget to attend the PSBA summer\npotluck and sale.\n\nAugust:\nIn the Pacific NW, August can be our hottest month so pay careful\nattention to your watering and continue to protect trees that\nare sensitive to the hot sun, (if we get any!) It is recommended\nthat you start tapering off nitrogen late in the month and go\nto something like 0-10-10 in late Sept,-mid October. Avoid doing\nany heavy pruning so as to not generate new growth that will\nnot harden off before frosts in the fall.\n\nIt is too late to do any leaf pruning\nand avoid doing air layers this late in the summer. This is not\nsuch a good time to wire deciduous trees. It is hard to see the\nbranching with all the leaves. However, pines and junipers can\nstill be wired if needed.\n\nLate August is a good time to begin\napplying 0-10-10 to help harden off twigs and roots, and help\nset buds for flowering varieties.\n\nSeptember:\nEarly in the month can still be warm so watch your watering and\ndon't let your trees dry out too much. Growth is really slowing\nnow. Continue with your 0-10-10 fertilizers. Avoid pruning any\ntrees except pines. Jin and shari can still be worked, but avoid\nheavy cuts on deciduous trees until next spring. Continue to\nwatch your wiring, especially on pines. Pines tend to put on\ntheir wood in the fall so watch closely to avoid wire scars.\n\nCheck your PSBA calendar to see who\nthe guest artist is for September.\n\nOctober:\nFall is here. This is a good time to remove wire that is not\nintended to stay on throughout the winter. Give your trees their\nlast doses of 0-10-10 for the year. Watering needs are diminishing\nnow, so be careful to not over water. Fall color should be beginning\nshow on some of your deciduous trees.\n\nStart watching the weather forecast\nand be prepared to protect those trees that might be damaged\nby a heavy freeze. Any trees that were repotted in the fall should\nbe carefully protected from freezing for the winter. Don't bring\nthem into the heated house, but do not allow them to freeze either!\n\nCheck your PSBA calendar to see who\nthe guest artist is for October.\n\nNovember:\nFall color should be at its peak early in the month. During November\nwe typically get our first freezes so be prepared to protect\nyour trees. November can also bring long rainy spells so shelter\nthose trees that are sensitive to excess rain, such as pines.\n\nOnce the leaves have dropped from\nyour deciduous trees is a good time to begin needle thinning\nyour two needle pines. If you thin last year's needles by pulling\nbe careful to pull in the direction they grow. Otherwise, you\nwill most likely lose the bud you are trying to stimulate. On\nstrong, well developed pines, you can also thin this year's needles\nby thinning to 5 or 6 pairs of needles in the top half of the\ntrees and 7 or 8 pairs in the lower half of the trees.\n\nDon't forget to clean dropped leaves\noff your soil surfaces since they can provide shelter for unwanted\npests. If you put your trees away for the winter be sure to inspect\nthem for pests like mealy bugs or scale before doing so.\n\nThe PSBA annual meeting happens in\nNovember. Go cast your vote and volunteer for a service position\nfor the year. Also check your PSBA activity calendar to see who\nthe guest artist is for the month.\n\nDecember:\nWinter is here, complete with steady rain and the potential for\nsub-freezing weather. Before putting your trees away for the\nwinter it is a good time to give them their first spray of dormant\noil. For deciduous trees you can add lime-sulfur as well - follow\nthe label instructions. (See precautions in the January listing.)\nAlso, be sure to clean any dead leaves away from the tops of\nthe pots.\n\nPruning is not advised in December.\nInventory your tools and supplies so you can begin dropping hints\nfor holiday gift ideas!!"

      "text": "1411 Fireblight\n\nCherry, peach and other related species are NOT affected by fireblight, a sometime serious disease.\n\nSpringtime weather that is warm and rainy encourages fireblight. Bees and other pollinators may introduce the disease to blooming trees during pollination. As a result, symptoms often begin in the blossom, which develop brown, mushy-looking petals.\n\nMore commonly, trees with fireblight develop curling, bending and blackening shoots, called shepherd's crooking. Leaves turn yellow, then brown and finally black but remain on the branch.\n\nManage fireblight with a combination of resistant varieties and pruning. Removing diseased parts of the tree is always recommended. Pruning can be done anytime of the year, but it is best during March when trees and diseases are still dormant. Prune fireblighted trees when symptoms develop in the spring and early summer. If pruning during the growing season, when the disease is active, it is extremely important to sanitize pruning tools BETWEEN EACH AND EVERY CUT.\n\nChemical control of fireblight is an option, but it's not always effective. Copper sulfate can be used before leaves form in early spring. Another chemical, streptomycin sulfate, can be used when blossoms begin to open. Follow label directions carefully.\n\nFor more information, see the following Colorado State Extension fact sheet(s)."

      "text": "Red raspberry plants grow very well in Nebraska. The Boyne red raspberry bush has been researched extensively by Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, and will survive the extreme temperatures of Nebraska winters. The other New York researched red raspberries that are ever bearing and the taste of the berry is tart, with a sweet balanced flavor. Black raspberry plants are not cold hardy enough for planting in Nebraska soils. Blackberries, including the thornless blackberry and the thorny blackberry cultivars, are prone to winter freezing and are not recommended for planting by the University of NE that is located in Lincoln, Nebraska. Blueberry plants, too, are iffy generally, because most of the commercial blueberry bushes cant stand the frigid winters in NE. Most important in growing a blueberry bush is the soil profile requiring a very acid soil profile of 4.5 to 5.5 and a Nebraska home gardener should strongly consider amending the soil for container grown blueberry plants inside the home in winter and then maintain the proper outside the house after the temperatures warm up in Nebraska.\n\nRed Mulberry trees are native berry trees for Nebraska, but many tasty red, black and white mulberry tree cultivars are available to buy from nurseries online that produce juicy, flavorful mulberries."

      "text": "Ground Rulles: Shear madness\n\nMany a gardener has an inner Edward Scissorhands, but not all shrubs flourish under the shears and in real life as well as show biz, timing is everything. Cut broadleaf evergreens down to size from Valentine's Day through the end of March, but save the electric hedge trimmers for summer.\n\nNow is the time for the surgical approach, lopping off individual branches with hand pruners or a saw. Don't leave stubs. If you do this branch by branch, you can bring a holly, abelia or euonymous down to size in no time.\n\nA formal hedge provides a healthy outlet for those who enjoy sculpting with shrubs. It requires a couple of clippings in July and August to look its best. For inspiration, inspect the beautifully maintained privet hedge at Congregation Beth Israel on E. Jefferson Street.\n\nThis is not the season to prune needle evergreens like pine, juniper and hemlock. Only a few of these needle types, chiefly yew, can re-sprout from cuts into dormant wood. Wait until after they begin growth later in the season to shape them.\n\nFlowering shrubs are not at their best sheared into formal shapes. There are few sights sadder than the naturally graceful forsythia reduced to a diminutive green and yellow meatball. Although radical pruning at the wrong time will not kill these shrubs, you can reduce or lose altogether their blossoms for a season. The heart of the mystery is whether the blooms reside in old wood or new.\n\nForsythia, mophead hydrangeas (the old-fashioned blues and pinks) and lilacs flower early because they carry their buds on \"old\" wood produced last summer. A trim in late summer or early fall will decapitate them. Butterfly bushes and white snowball-type hydrangeas bloom in July, on \"new\" wood that will begin growing this spring. They will flower whether pruned or not but they profit from a late winter haircut to encourage more flower-bearing wood.\n\nIf untangling the old wood from the new gives you a headache, put down the saw and turn to the vegetable garden where the tasks of the season are as simple as waiting for the soil to dry out and getting something in the ground. Transplants of lettuces, cabbages and leeks will be available at garden centers around mid-month.\n\nIf you're going to be gardening in the same spot for a while and don't feel it's spring unless you're doing some serious digging, consider asparagus. Dormant crowns can be planted this month. A good bed can produce for 15 years and needs to be well-amended at the outset with lots of compost and rotted leaves. Plants need to grow for two to three years before you begin harvesting the tasty spears, so it's a long-term project, but isn't that what gardening is all about?\n\nOne pleasure of early spring that requires no sweat is to welcome the early daffodils. There is a world to explore beyond the great yellow honkers of April. \"Butter and Eggs,\" an old species narcissus, and the little wind-swept cyclamineus types like \"Peeping Tom\" and \"February Gold\" are among the first to flower. Consult Brent and Becky Heath's Daffodils for American Gardens (Elliot & Clark, 1995) and the Van Engelen bulb catalog ( to investigate the possibilities.\n\nFrom the demands of the shrubbery to the promise of the vegetable plot to the lure of the first flowers, the spring garden calls us up from our winter sleep. Be careful what you cut, plant something to eat and put your nose deep in a daffodil as we spin on towards the equinox on March 21ottesville"

      "text": "By Adrian Hunsberger\n\ndade@ifas.ufl.edu\n\nThis usually is part of a normal process that fruit trees go through. When the tree has too many fruit for it to safely produce to maturity, the extras are dropped.\n\nFor mangos, other causes are: cold temperature damage, \"nubbins\" produced from faulty pollination (especially in Haden, Palmer, and Irwin) and fungal disease damage. Cold damage is unlikely to be the cause this year since most mangos bloomed again six weeks after the cold snap in early January. Since you did not see any evidence of disease, it appears that your tree is going through a normal fruit drop.\n\nIf your tree has a lot of fruit still left on the tree, make sure that your tree is properly fertilized. Use an 8-3-9, \"palm special\" or similar type fertilizer. Nutritional sprays are very beneficial.\n\nTo learn how to care for your mango, please read this UF Extension fact sheet:"
