      "text": "just thinking about the matches I've played over the last few days. They were all extremely fun and I was trying to figure out how. I mean, SS was flying around in all of them. Everyone was using Torp Spread. I Got AMS'd once or twice. Sounds like it should have been a horrible experience. How could I possibly have enjoyed the last few days as much as I did? Especially with just me and one other person pugging it?\n\nThen it hit me everyone was \"doing it\", but they weren't \"spamming it\". It is almost as if a weird kind of balance came over the battlefield. Damage and Healing numbers were high on both sides, team builds were a fairly good mix of ships and the matches were mostly close or down to the wire.\n\nWe're all getting much better at dealing with \"broken\" powers than we used to be (who doesn't zoom in hit f1 and turn the camera as a reflex before hitting ST? or go defensive to ride it out when it can't be cleansed?), and casters had to time it instead of spam it. I wasn't being perma-scrambled. It always came as part of a coordinated strike or as a defense against one.\n\nGiven, there were really good players on both sides most of the time. As a result, we probably adapted to each situation better than most pugs would have. I still don't know how I kept getting so lucky being consistently teamed with some of the best players remaining in the game and then seeing some of them on the other side, too (trying to ignore the obvious that the diehards are the only ones still playing).\n\nThere is still fun to be found in the game. We just have to find it ourselves and I don't believe banning powers is the answer. Use them, use them all, just don't spam them or build teams with the sole intent of spamming them and we have a chance. (Part of me still wishes the PvP queues were 3v3 or 4v4 there is some sort of tipping point for spam at 5v5 that you don't see in smaller private matches)\n\nSS really does mitigate healing when used well and it can save your life in the same manner.\n\nDon't forget, we all get super-torp-spread-crits If you're not seeing the pretty numbers, join the lovefest. I don't use it all the time, but if there is enough spam, it's on And if you bring 2 carriers or more, I'm putting on 2 copies.\n\nAs far as P2W consoles go... they are here to stay. Adapt if you want, join in if ya want.\n\nWe are all trying to have fun, no more, no less. Only WE can ruin OUR fun. There is simply no platform with more potential for epic space PvP than STO, not to mention I finally get to fly a starship after 30 years of dreaming for something like STO (previous games never felt immersive or realistic when in space combat), and I don't want to give it up. Since Cryptic is ignoring us, then too, can only WE make OUR fun."

The term BattleSpace detonates full combat capabilities in both atmosphere and vacuum. Each Saber is powered by a nuclear reactor which is used to heat and ignite atmosphere or hydrogen propellant stored on-board, with an Aerospike exhaust configuration.\n\nFurthermore, the XF-1 Saber features forward swept wings and missile bays blending into the wings to provide protection of ordinance during re-entry as well as to reinforce the wing strength.

An escort, sure is more manurable but that really makes little difference when your shields go down faster then anything else in the game. Tactical?

I suspect a weapon's damage output is limited by its energy input, i.e. you get more damage without putting in more energy once you reach 100% energy to damage conversion.\n\nProjectile speeds can't actually be nearly infinite. If you consider rail guns, where the projectile contributes absolutely zero energy at time of firing, take the activation energy of the gun (with max skills) and assume the total kinetic energy of that projectile can't be any higher than gun activation energy.\n\nNow artillery gets tricky because the energy comes from the projectile itself and isn't listed in game, so probably the best estimate would be to compare a Lead railgun charge to whatever the 0% damage mod projectile ammo is and assume the ratio of their kinetic energies is the same as the ratio of damage they do. (Higher damage shells are a bad example because some of their damage comes from stuff like being made out of anti-matter.)\n\nedit: Come to think of it, maybe blasters are a better weapon to assume to have perfect efficiency in converting activation energy into projectile kinetic energy."

      "text": "community, i think this is a common sense topic, so after a big talk with some pvp folks on organized pvp, and with my brother ( kirby ) i think almost everyone thinks that actually, cruisers are underpowered, so i decided to create this topic.\n\nwell, comparing standard cruisers with standard escorts you will notice that the main trade is hull for turn rate as you can see with this ( not refering consoles, boff stations, crew, device slots, inertia rating or weapon slots ):\n\n...........assault cruiser---patrol escort ( examples )\nhull points: 39k -------------- 31k\nshield mod: 1 ------------- 0,9\nturn rate: 7 --------------- 16\nimpulse mod: 0.15 ------- 0.20\nafter comparing the numbers you can clearly see that the patrol escort has 8k less hull, 0.1 less shield, but +9 turn rate and more impulse modifier( why ? cruisers have bigger nacelles -.- ), lets be realistic, the gain of 8k hull doesnt compensate that loss of maneuverability, and the escort has more impulse modifier, this is important, the defense value of an escort almost compensates that loss of hull, which is almost nothing on pvp, anything with more than 50k hull is impractical, you dont need it !\n\nif the cruisers are the mother of all vessels, with the top weapons, the top technology, the space combat tanks, the frontline battle ships, why people prefer escorts ? theres something wrong here right ?\n\nthats because 1 turn rate is not the same of 1k hull as the devs think, thats why cruiseres are underpowered= lack of maneuverability, and a not well compensated resilliency: that is well known\n\nwhy people dont buy galaxy classes ? dreadnaughts ? omg come on, the spinal beam is almost useless on a ship with that turn rate, its almost the same thing as having dual heavy cannons on the voquv carrier, pointless...\n\nas it seems, carriers dont loose anything to trade off for their hangar slots, so lets make a list these are the tier5 non-carrier ships with almost or more 40k hull and less than 10 turn rate:(hope i dont forget any )\n\nassault cruiser\nstar cruiser\nodissey star cruiser\nambassador\nexploration cruiser and dreadnaught\nheavy cruiser retrofit\nadvanced heavy cruiser retrofit bortas\nneghvar\ndkora this list includes fleet versions.\ni didnt include the vorcha (tor'kath on the fleet version) or the galor, because these have 10 turn rate, although the galor doesnt have more than 40k hull, so the galor could be a perhaps ?\n\ni mean, if these ships were good, people wouldnt prefer bops, or escorts ... am i right ?\nif you notice, the ships with the lower turn rates on this list, are the ships that pvpers dont use or the ships you dont see pvping!\nwhy ? coz 7 or 8k hull doesnt compensate the high turn rate, and the impulse mod, escorts can do the so much called \"speed tank\", ive seen bops tanking 6 guys on kerrat, any pvper knows about this.\nSo, hull and crew is not simetric to turn rate and impulse mod\nif bops have a battle cloak ( let's say, compensating its lack of hull and shield ) why cruisers dont have anything to compensate its lack of maneuverability ? +1 weap slot seems not enough compared to escorts, but for bops ? 1- rear weap slot but a battle cloak and a full uni boff layout seems to be doing it\n\ncarriers doesnt seem to loose anything compared to normal cruisers, so my ideas for the ships on the list are:\n\n+1 or 2k hull ( still impractical )\n+0.1 shield mod ( like this one particullarly because escorts and cruisers share almost the same shield mod )\n\nOr adding innate abilities\n1 innate tractor beam 1 (weak version or something ) with 4 minutes cooldown ( every cruisers on star trek novels have it not beeing science based only, i mean tractor beam should be an enginner skill)\n\nor ( i love this one ) adding 4 innate emergy power to subsystem working almost the same as the innate beam targeting skills on science vessels\nlike : emergy power to shields, emergency power to engines, weapons and aux\nthese skills would have 1 minute cooldown and 30sec shared, giving +15 power to the subsystem and repairing it ( not sure if this integrated emergy power to shields would give shield points, but not shield resistance)\n\nwith this, these ships would be more resilient against more combat situations, combining it with a red matter capacitor and 1 or 2 boff emergency power skills, it would let the cruiser power not to be disabled as much as other ships ( pretty engineering based isnt it ? xP ), and you would see these ships more on pvp, not overpowering them, please consider my idea devs ...\n\ni hope the pvp community likes this and i hope the failaxy becomes the mister galaxy class again.\n\nYou really don't need to compare cruisers against escorts to talk about what is wrong with them -- the ships are too wildly different. When you talk about maneuverability for example, it's important to remember that cruisers can more effectively employ beams (since they get 8 weapon slots) so they don't need to maneuver as much to keep all their guns on target.\n\nCruisers also get higher level engineering slots than anyone else, which adds a lot to survivability as well as to their team role as healers.\n\nI'm not saying cruisers aren't weak, just that they don't need to be compared to escorts._______________ 4/4 Z-Store KDF Specific Bugs fixed! Thank you from the bottom of my wallet! I'm going to go buy some Zen points for a rainy day. Here's another batch about visuals.\n\nNot to mention that abilities like DEM, AB, AtID and EPtA are all but useless. EPtA has it's uses but quite underwhelming and until they fix Beam Accuracy, EPtW isn't particularly great either. So all that's left is Healing.\n\nI don't always use torpedoes but when I do, I prefer Tricobalts. Friendship is magic, my friends.\n\ncompare a cruiser to a carrier. seems fair ? cruisers should have something to compensate that something they dont have.\n\nyes noob, on the game you say \"failaxy\" and \"failoddy\" but here you say that cruisers are ok, you are just another escort handler affraid of getting kicked by a bigger ship, give me a cruiser that is as good to engys as the jem bug is to tacs, oh sorry, you cant =/\n\ncruisers have 8 weap slots, but thats not energy efficient as you can see here\n\nand the ships who benefit from 2 of those benefits, will loose something, as the vesta do with dhc and hangar, but 27800 hull and 1.35 shield mod\n\nso what the cruisers gain ?\nhow can everybody not ride a cruiser and say its underpowered, but when its time to call that to the forum you say its ok ? obvious, escort users are affraid of the time when cruisers get what they deserve and finally show its pottencial\n\ncarriers dont loose nothing on its gain of 2 hangar slots, so my idea was to add something to the rest of the cruisers, making them balanced compared to carriers and not underpowered, which people think it is On the gameBeam arrays themselves are ok (note the word of choice) I don't think their boff skills have problems, a properly used FAW is a very powerful tool and in some cases can be as powerful as CRF for cannons. An adjustment to their drain mechanics would make them good weapons the other problems that has really highlighted their weaknesses is the escorts newly increased capacity to do damage (new consoles etc) and the escorts ability to shrug off damage, fix/compensate for these and beam arrays will be a viable option once more.Nothing else really matters right? Because it all stems from this. You have Acc and Defense that ONLY mean something when they are compared to one another. You have these modifiers that are baked into the hull, so that when we try to add hull health to compensate for crappy movement and defense....we get....even CRAPPIER movement and defense.\n\nGranted OP you would think that sure isn't it possible they put BIGGER engines on bigger ships but no. And many of those other things you mentioned. But you didn't even need to bother. When def/acc/crit gets resolved, most of the other stuff will go away."

      "text": "Sunday, January 20, 2013\n\nGanking 101: Scouting\n\nYou've probably heard it said among our gank fleet members that the scouts are the most important members of the fleet, aside from the fleet commander (and even then it's arguable). All true. Our scouts play several roles at the same time. They're more like spies, really: Stealthy, sometimes invisible, sometimes in disguise, gathering intelligence, and oh-so-innocent behind their positive sec status.\n\nOur scouts may not carry weapons, but they are deadly. Our enemies learn their names quickly, and they immediately tense upon seeing one enter local. But how does a New Order scout operate? This post will offer some basic lessons.\n\nFirst thing's first. A simple Ship Scanner I allows you to peer into the tank of any potential target. It has no skill prerequisites. If you fit a Passive Targeter I (requires Targeting I to be trained), your prey will not know he's being locked and scanned. Simply activate the Passive Targeter and click on a mining ship. Though the glow of the module activation will not last long, you're in the clear. You can repeatedly scan the ship without its knowledge.\n\nAnd you must scan the miner repeatedly, because each time you do, you get only partial results. You used to get doubled results, but no more. Simply note each tank module and run another scan to see if there are more. You should do at least 5 scans. Each one takes a second. Your fleet commander will determine if the target is too tanked. Tell him about shield and armor modules. You can ignore shield boosters and EM or Explosive hardeners, since they'll have no effect on what we do.\n\nTo find targets, you can go to the nearest ice field, or use your directional scanner to find stuff in the asteroid belts. The simplest way is to scan a cluster of distant asteroid belts and then find out which one the target is in by warping to one and scanning the rest. Don't get too hung up on the targets; focus on the belts. Targets themselves may be stored in a POS where you can't get to them.\n\nIf you're cloaked in a Covert Ops or Stealth Bomber, maneuver your ship to find a clear path between you and the target, so nothing will decloak you when you approach. Anything can decloak you, including asteroids, cans, wrecks, and drones. The decloak range is 2,000m. Setting \"Keep at Range\" at 5,000m will enable your ship to breeze at top speed toward the target...\n\n...and you'll automatically slow down quickly enough to not be decloaked, even by orbiting drones. At 5,000m, you're too far to provide a proper warp-in for the fleet. You'll want to be right next to the target just before the fleet initiates its final warp to you. It takes around 15 seconds to go from 5,000m to being directly atop the target. If the fleet HQ is in the same system, hit \"Approach\" when they undock. If they're in the next system, begin the approach at the FC's signal. If you're an FC, a good signal time is when you start dropping out of warp on the other side of the final gate. By the time you exit warp, jump through the gate, and get ready to do the fleet warp, the scout should be in position.\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nA cloaked ship is not necessary for scouting. Sometimes it doesn't even help that much, because they often get decloaked in the busy ice field, or they drop cloak to run the Ship Scanner. Yet our scouts are notorious, and they get camped by people who want to interfere with the ganks. Scouts should always report to the FC whenever any combat ships are in the belt. A good scout is one who knows how to frustrate the campers. Here's how.\n\nFirst, a scout should hit different systems, rather than the same system over and over. A scout should check asteroid belts, as these generally aren't (or can't be) camped. Leaving campers in a belt all day while you strike elsewhere leaves them feeling useless.\n\nBut if you want to hit a popular ice field despite the campers, there's a useful technique: Bookmarking targets.\n\nAny ship can fly right up to a target and create a bookmark. Enter the target's name as the bookmark and then leave. It's now possible for a fleet to warp to the target without having a scout in person to provide the warp-in. And without a scout, the campers have no one to camp. They'll have no idea where the next attack will come.\n\nAfter collecting a target bookmark or two, the scout returns to the HQ station, copies the target bookmark into the inventory, and trades it to the FC. If the aggression period isn't up, the scout can continue looking for targets.\n\nOnce the FC has the target bookmark in his or her own People & Places, the target(s) may be hit at any time. Using this method, a scout can even set up warp-ins in multiple systems at once, further frustrating campers who don't know which system is next in line for attack. This is also efficient because a scout can look for more targets, rather than sitting next to just one while waiting for it to be attacked.\n\n\"But what if the bookmarked target leaves in the meantime?\" you ask. After giving the FC the bookmarks, the scout returns (preferably cloaked, but not necessarily) to keep watch from a distance. If the miner has not left, the bookmark warp-in is still good. In a busy ice field, a scout can even sit next to a second target on the other end of the belt. If campers follow him, the scout tells the FC to hit the bookmarked target. If the campers don't follow him, the scout tells the FC to warp to him and hit the target he's sitting on. Either way, the campers lose and the gankers win.\n\nIn some cases, I've seen miners return to the same position over and over throughout the day, because they've got their mining position bookmarked. But it's best not to wait too long before hitting a bookmarked target. Even though in theory you're \"warping to zero\", you can land 2,500m or more from the spot--especially if you bounce off an asteroid. A miner who returns to his old mining location may therefore be slightly further away, and leave some unlucky gankers just out of range. In any case, a ganker should always remember to get closer to the target on landing.\n\nOf course, if there are no campers about, it's easier for a scout to just sit near the target. But if campers are following a scout around, the ability to make undetectable warp-ins with bookmarks is a useful thing indeed.\n\nAny mining barge or exhumer works. The idea of the ghillie suit is to mine while you scan. Skiffs & Procurers are a great choice because it costs more isk than miners are willing to spend to gank them. The speed of the ship doesn't matter when you can warp from point to point.\n\nSome more scout tips: The disgruntled miners suicide ganked several scouts. Have tank or a ship you can't care less to lose.\n\nWatch out for Ibises. They aren't lost noobs, they are dangerous ECM boats that can defeat a gank.\n\nTake your time to talk to the miners, educate them about the Code, taunt the campers.\n\nLoot the wrecks of the catalysts for profit. Salvage them and also the miners. Scouting is a profitable profession, perfect place for a newbie who can't afford catas. If you loot T1, yell at the noob who fitted them.\n\nYou can warp to rocks in the other end of the belt\n\nHave Concord on your overview, they can't be in 150km of the target.\n\nAlways talk to your fleet or they might get bored and go AFK. They don't see how busy you are, they just sit in the station doing nothing.\n\nLink the name of the target to the fleet chat along with the system name.\n\nI'd be scouting in a Venture. You can biomass and start over whenever the name gets known, and be out there in an hour or so - and you are fine to just fit it with passive targetter, ship scanner, prop mod, and a civilian miner or two for protective camoflage...\n\nScouting with a Venture in an ice belt is about as subtle as doing it with a Catalyst in any belt. You'll get the AFK miners because surprise surprise, they're AFK. You won't get the ones actually paying attention most of the time because why would a Venture be in an ice belt if not to scout?\n\n\"In a busy ice field, a scout can even sit next to a second target on the other end of the belt. If campers follow him, the scout tells the FC to hit the bookmarked target. If the campers don't follow him, the scout tells the FC to warp to him and hit the target he's sitting on. Either way, the campers lose and the gankers win.\"\n\nPlayed right, a scout that attracts attention can be just as useful as one that doesn't, we saw that firsthand on yesterdays ganks. A scout had a number of campers around him in one location while we warped to a bookmark that was being monitored by another, the tarps didn't know where we were going to hit and just wandered about in disarray. It was beautiful.\n\nI've noticed a couple of miners fitting ship scanners, so in a busy ice field it's reasonable to expect that some of the regulars will know what your fit is. If your barge or exhumer fit looks suspicious then it's a pretty good bet that the locals know why you're there and are communicating that."

      "text": "a mission to Holodeck just before the weekend, got a few 3, 4, and 5 star reviews which was great (and I thank those who liked it), but I have received the odd angry review where one NPC character they were supposed to talk to was not available, and that the mission was a \"waste of time\". To be perfectly honest, I tested and completed the mission countless times both on my Foundry character as well as my Fed Holodeck characters without issue.\n\n1. Are there cases where some NPCs haven't spawned when you have been playing other missions? Or is it just a case of people just not looking hard enough for the dialogue \"bubble\" above an NPC indicating you were supposed to approach the character?\n\n2. How would you approach the unwarranted negative reviews? I'm leaning towards just leaving it as is and revisiting the storyline in the Foundry to make sure everything's fine, perhaps relocating the NPCs in question to a more obvious location.\n\nThanks in advance! I just feel really bad when I inadvertently anger people..\n\nIf there was combat, perhaps the contact died, that appartently happened in a mission I reviewed. I searched the whole colony for a good while checking all the other contacts before I beamed up and back and the mission reset the npc.\n\nI PM'd the author to let him know since I really liked the mission and he was the one that said he had asked around and contacts apparantly can get killed, so he moved that contact.\n\nIt happens sometimes. Some people are just being jerks, some truly hate it for whatever reason. My missions has a lot of 4 and 5 stars but one person gave it a 2 and 1 a 1. There outliers that I disregard.\n\nAs long as your mission makes it clear exactly where things are located and uses waypoints, then dont be concerned about a few negative comments. However, if you tend to see the majority of reviews commenting on something, then you might need to take action. Just make sure your mission dialog and waypoints are as clear as possible.\n\nThere is no way to please everyone, but you can tell an honest review from someone who is trying to knock you down a peg. I have gotten good reviews that explain why they could not rate the mission 5 stars. They'll tell you. \"You had a few typos and the reach marker at such and such was too small.\" Then one guy says \"Dude, it was bad.\" That's not a review. It's nonsense. Just ignore it. People who offer actual solutions are being real.\n\nPlus you never know how patient people are. I'm sure there are some out there who don't let combat finish and just see \"oooh it's not working, what a waste of time\". Then there are probably a lot of people who don't want to read dialog and just click next, next, next, ... and then wonder why they don't get what's going on.\n\nYeah, it's the creator's job to make sure everything is clear and there is enough information for the player of the quest to find his way around the mission, but what I'm saying is - there are just some people you won't be able to help no matter what."

Mostly industrial stuff and mining, but had a couple of PVP characters I'd do low sec hunting runs in.\n\nThe reason I left was it was starting to become a job I didn't get paid for. I was a CEO of a corp, and logging on meant dealing with payouts on mining operations, setting up manufacturing queues etc etc. Also, dealing with whingers (for whatever reason), dealing with new guys that didn't know what they were doing (didn't mind that so much), and of course inter-corp politics and war decs.\n\nI still think it's an excellent game, just evidenced by the fact that I could do all those things in a virtual universe... but it got to the point were it stopped being a game, and started being a job. I was spending 90% of my time docked, looking at markets and spreadsheets :)\n\nIckus is right, you really need to find a good corp early on, whether it's for null sec pew pew or high sec mining, a corp makes it all the better.\n\nFor me, I play Eve to ruin the experience of others. I like suicide attacks in high sec. I like taking years of someone's effort and breaking it. If they rage quit the game and spew forth a torrent of abuse and tears, even better. If I get no reaction, I just move on.\n\nI would play Eve again but it would have to be free, I can not justifiy paying money so I can sit there and mine roids for the next 4 years while my skills finish. I did enjoy it but I wish there was more to it besides Asteroids or PvP.\n\nyou can pay for eve with the ingame currency if you buy a plex and activate it, so if you could make enough, even if it meant ratting for a few days i suppose it would be free (thats how i pay for it).\n\nEve is like WOW. You don't really control things. You just 3rd person point and move around. There are some twitch space MMO's, Black whatever I think is one. Can't remember it's name. But you fly cockpit style. Ping is a factor. Eve is a community driven game. If you need fun given to you, then it's not for you. That's the whole point of a sandpit game, you create the environment you play in.\n\nI can not justifiy paying money so I can sit there and mine roids for the next 4 years while my skills finish.\n\nI was like Mantra, put about 4 years into it and it started becoming a job rather than a game (I was a Director of a high profile corp and a 'senior' member of an alliance). I knew it crossed a line when I was at work and being harassed to get on TS to sort out diplomacy issues between alliances..\n\nGreat game, would love to play it again for sure but this time I'd go full pirate and harass the shit out of people!\n\nTicMan and others that have played at a high level... if you ever get time could you please write a few stories of some moments in the game that you witnessed? And some stories about some stories that you've heard but can't exactly confirm.\n\nI find that stuff so fascinating. A friend told me a story of 3 of the most powerful alliances in the game. One of them had 3 of the largest ships in the game and a swarm of heavy armorment ships. He was part of this faction and it took about 3 and a half years to build with a group of some of the most dedicated EVE players starting it. A bunch of them didnt actually have to work IRL for some reason and ran the alliance fulltime? One of the highest level people 'jumped to another alliance' and took one of the large ships with him and sent the other ships into a trap where they were all destroyed almost instantly by the faction he went to. Apparently that's completely legal in the game and is actually encouraged (to add game diversity). Suffice to say there was only two major factions for a while after that.\n\nEdit: The traitor jerry rigged the two remaining largest ships or self detonated them or something, thats why the all died instantly. He used the other large ship to turn on those that were left while the ships from the faction he traitored to were behind them or something when they came out of warp. Not sure how it all works so cant explain it with the correct 'terms'.\n\nI am currently playing EVE online, I have to say, I'm loving the shizz out of it. However, to enjoy it, you need to actively search for what's suitable for your needs. What I mean is, if you like PvP, you need to make sure you go out and have experience, join a corporation is your best bet for this to happen. The game is pretty much a sandbox mmo, the game mechanics are there, but what you do with it is entirely up to you. To expect to be handed something. That's how I ended up leaving the game for a period when I first started out.\n\nAh HED-GP .. spent many many nights camping it or running through it on the way in to G-ME2K. One problem I have restarting now is that *ALL* my stuff is spread across Stain space and we all know what people think of players in NPC corps flying through their systems."

A combination of [acc], [dmg], [crith] or [critd], with some being more desirable than others. Polarised disruptors, however, and all the other special types such as the new phased polarons, only get 2 of those, because they have the other weapon type's bonus added in.\n\nSo, a mk xii very rare disruptor weapon might have [acc]x2 [critd], while a mk xii very rare polarised disruptor will only have the [acc]x2, but with the chance for polaron's power drain merged into it.\n\nBoth are improved by the disruptor console, but the power drain only occurs in 2,5% of the shots, while the third modifier always applies.\n\nIt's a choice. I prefer the extra [acc] or [crith] on my pvp tactical, but went for the potential power drain on my science captain.\n\nYou will not regret it when you've downed the whole gate transformers and all on one side and the 4uss's on the other side haven't even destroyed one cube you'll just look at your screen and declare allegiance to the empire that's what I did never looked backAs far as I know, the \"Javelin\" is not a console, but rather an innate ability so it doesn't take up a console spot. Kinda fits when you look at it, with more and more ships with 10 consoles it's cool that you wouldn't use a console spot for that.\n\nIf you've put some skill points into impulse thrusters, I suspect the turn rate console would be unnecessary, really. I'd go for 3 neutroniums.\n\nScience, either the field generator (but that one's expensive), or emitter arrays, I think.\n\nPersonally, I tend to go for full on energy console, as the torps hit hard anyway, but only on hulls. The energy weapons always hit, and when they blast a shield section, the torp can hit home properly. That's why I suspect you'll get more benefit from 4 disruptor coils (even more so with the javelin getting an additional bonus).\n\nEngines, yeah. I'm inclined to say \"go for the efficient engines you get as a reward in one of the first missions\". They are nice and free. The most noticeable upgrades would be the pricy ones from the rep system. I'd say they're the least important part of your ship though, surprisingly. Shields are a matter of personal taste too, really. I use covariant and resilient shields, equally.\n\nDeflectors do come in a lot of flavors. For this kind of ships, I'd suggest a positron array.\n\nAll refer to skills in your skill sheet. For escort/destroyer gameplay, I'd say [shds], [sif] and [em] are most relevant. I got me a positron array with bonus modifiers to shield systems [shds] and structural integrity [sif], the other day, for a similar ship. There's tons on the exchange with many different set-ups, and they are relatively cheap."

      "text": "I was wondering whether anyone knows of a rule update on the Markov drives. I checked the errata but there was nothing there and it REALLY makes NO sense how its currently formulated.\n\nRAW:\n, but I would like to know if FFG themselves already figured out how broken their current implementation is.\n\nOr am I overlooking something major??\n\nNote: I know the math is slightly off, e.g. 26 jumps of 2 weeks - 1d5 weeks with a minimum of 1 day will result in more then 26 days but that's not what this topic is about, so pls no nitpicking on the math (unless I made a major error of course).\n\nYeah, they're rather odd. I houseruled it that it reduces the sidereal-time. Makes more sense given the engine's role in courier vessels where getting the message through as quick as possible is what matters.\n\nWith the markov drive, the temperamental warp engine history, and the skittish oddity warp travel time can be reduced up to 3d5 weeks. This creates an issue where the players in your case, day jumps not weeks, would be constantly showing up before they left. Considering the average open warp travel ratio of 1:12 (1 day in warp = 12 days out of warp) it would make more sense to be a 'real' time reduction instead of a 'warp' time reduction (unless you want your players traveling back through time constantly). Even then that doesn't really resolve the issue a week jump = 12 weeks 'real' time which means you could still arrive early.\n\nOne could simply say that the markov drive and the temperamental warp engine reduce travel time by 1d5 week to a min. of 1 week (which is exactly what skittish says). This means the drive and the history fail to offer any benefit to a trip lasting a week or less. Combined they could still reduce a 16 week jump to a 1 week jump.\n\nAt least that is what I would say. Given the one to twelve ratio that's a combined savings of 3-15 weeks or 36-180 weeks 'real' time. That's a 3.46 year savings on the high-end. Which means if one had all three the optimal jump length would be 9 weeks (9-2.5-2.5-2.5). Reduced to 1 week or 12 weeks 'real' time per jump. The example from the RT CORE says on average one can travel across a sector in 30-60 days which translates to a huge time savings.\n\nAlso, there is a limit to how long a ship is going to stay in the warp. Frankly warp travel is dangerous and shorter jumps are generally safer and more common then longer ones. If you have a destination that is on average a year's warp travel away you're going to try to break that up not just enter the warp and exit a year later.\n\nSo, yes I agree there needs to be a house rule on this one since an official one hasn't been made to my knowledge. You might also want to ask FFG for their ruling via the ask a question link.\n\nShowing up before you left is awesome, and should be encouraged to the fullest.\n\nAnd then, as GM, exploited to the fullest.\n\nThink about it. They receive a distress call, set off, and get there…\n\nAnd nothing bad has happened yet. Sure that gives them time to prepare… IF there were some details, but they're certainly suspicious for showing up. How bad does it sound when you're consistently exactly right about what's about to happen, eh Tzeench?\n\nPlus, you get to toy with self-fufilling prophecies, the timeline being changed by their showing up [the cultists might not come out of hiding just yet knowing there's suddenly a giant cruiser in the skies], and, absolute best-case scenario: Both Rogue Traders try to go highlander or lootaz on himself and his one ship, and start assaulting themselves through time.\n\nwow yeah they've hidden that link pretty well! thanks for the pointers, will sent message now.\n\nIll be back on this next year\n\nedit: here's what I send as question:\n\nThe Markov drives in Rogue Trader - Into The Storm make absolutely no sense and I was wondering whether you can give a ruling/errata on these:\n\nRAW:. Given the fact that most trips are relatively short and the impact of these drives is clearly intended as 'High' I would suggest the Markov 1 to half the warp time travel and the Markov 2 reduce it to 75% (3/4) of the warp travel time. A possible alternative is that it does NOT influence the warp travel time but the real time that has passed, so the [12 x base (Warp) time] becomes 6x for M1 and 9x for the M2.\n\nIt really depends on what game you ask the question for I think and who gets it. I have had questions answered the same day. I have also had questions answered a month later. At which point I had sort of moved on. Of course the deathwatch forum was still arguing about it until I posted the response and they settled down.\n\nGood luck I am curious how it turns out. The RT game I play in one of their ships has skittish and temperamental warp engines for up to a 2d5 week reduction when they are lucky."

Granted to beat a tornado fleet, unless you comp for it you have to use some good manuvering to defeat them but if your like set against an Alliance that obviously isnt scrub does that matter when your deciding to fight or not?\n\nFor example... United. RR BS gang is a pretty good gang. So me as an FC would prolly think twice before engaging unless I was sure we had a shot. Is this the case for some of you? Like I think glepp said... that they would do well 6-8 Oneiros/diemos vs 10-15 Tornados... my question is would it matter if it was Alliance A or Alliance B?I wasnt as much comparing the RR BS vs Tornado gang as much an RR bs gang vs RR BS with the alliance or party involved factoring into the psychological aspect of the engagement.\n\nWell, if you're planning on taking on someone you know to be skilled, especially with the same setup or one that's not a direct counter to you/you are not a direct counter to, then yes, you take that into account. Not saying \"THESE GUYS ARE GOOD, DON'T ENGAGE BECAUSE OF EVEN NUMBERS\", more like, \"Yeah, these guys are good, so be on your toes, gentlemen.\" You also take into account whether you're likely to get hotdropped.\n\nFascinating thread, and pretty much showing where I thought we'd be right now. Who was it who said that the Talos was the best of the bunch again?talos is the best for adding to a mixed comp shield fleet (you know the, \"hey let's roam\" \"what we bringing?\" \"oh, shield nano...\"). tornado is better in a gang built specifically around it, and i'm not even sure that's true because i haven't seen people even try 15 talos + support (holy fuck dps). i know at least in my small corp we just have had more tornado pilots than talos pilots from day 1, not because they were better, but because winmatar has been winmatar for ages, so more people had t2 large AC than t2 large blasters. but we don't generally bother bringing lone tornado's in 'mixed bag fleets' because those pilots are normally better off bringing something else. (whilst there's rarely anything better than a talos that someone could bring )\n\nor to put it another way, corp funds talos's but you can buy your own tornados\n\n*really wants a talos gang now*\n\nalso, the issue with mwd'ing armour HACs vs tornado's isn't so much the alpha, it's the 'chase' leaving the oneiros behind. we've found we can keep everyone alive pretty easily, but that by the time the deimos' have caught the tornado's the logi's are lagging dangerously behind. a few time's we've had to slow down and lose the chance to tackle to keep reps runningthis isn't really true. in every fight i've had vs tornado's we've started 30-50km away from them, it's tough but starting at 0km isnt a prerequisite. though i dunno whether you mean '15 man tornado gang' as '15 tornados + support' or 'tornado's + support equalling 15 guys'. because fuck burning into the alpha of 15 tornado's >_<\n\nregarding the quality of the opposition, yeah it kind of matters.\n\nagainst bads, somehow we always seem to be able to get onto and take out their hugins and scimi's quickly... a better quality of player/alliance just doesn't give you that chance (or at least you'd hope not). bads are entirely capable of losing track of their distance from things while concentrating on webing/repping etc, and you can take advantage of that. against an entity with a repuation for competence i wouldn't expect to get those opportunitie and probs wouldn't engage unless we were gifted an opportunity (like scimi's/range control being at 0km to a celestial, or near a wreck etc).Dunno what your experience is like, but we have a king-hell-bitch of a time trying to hit Drams that approach us for warp-ins even when the fuckers are painted and webbed. 99 times out of 100 it should be the Tornado's support fleet that's killing frigates, not the Tornados themselves. We (Rote) might not fly with enough raw numbers for lucky hits to accumulate meaningfully. Do arties really hit frigates that well en mass?If the pilot flying the tornado is dumb and does little to counter ceptor transversal then no, it's not an issue. But I usually look at things from the pov of what happens when both pilots know how to fly their ships. Combine that with recon webs/tps and well, yeah...\n\nOn the contrary, with the aspect of metagaming/theorycrafting/consistancy and frequent use of gangs coupled with the prevelance of said gang and experience with those gangs by the individuals using them its a pretty legitimate question. The psychological aspect of any fleet is significantly an influencer of fleet fights. Even the most well thought out and effective strategy or comp could fail due to mentality/stress/fear/apprehension/error of the opposing fleet.\n\nFor instance, if you were fighting Alliance A who is known for hotdropping all of the time, you may fly your fleet DIFFERENTLY than you would in an attempt to fight them. Maybe not warp to 0, maybe use a drag bubble. If Alliance A is nortorious for fitting damps onto thier gangs, would you not plan accordingly? Maybe ECM. These variables can limit or hinder your want/desire to get involved in conflicts with other groups off the sheer chance of a variable you cannot account for nor comp against. The example being hot drops.\n\nIn addition the fear of a loss may override your want to attempt to take on said fleet especially if your not perfectly comped for them. The example would be like AHACs vs Tornado fleet without the appropriate speed mod/recon/position to engage playing in the favor of the AHAC gang. This is a prime example of a HUGE advantage in the way of the tornado fleet especially if they can dictate distance.\n\nThe perfect example happened recently when the IRED/SEDI gang in some BCs with a more bulk DPS/Range Oracle/Naga gang engaged a ROTE AHAC gang with Guardian support and the Ahacs some having mwds and some having ABs. This is textbook disadvantage for the Ahac gang considering the IRED/SEDI gang came in at range and we gave chase. The Variables being our ability to tackle, hold them there, maintane reps, isolate thier tackle, any Recons being present we cant get to because of our inability to hit at farther range and or burn.. and so on. This could disuade even some confident FCs into attempting an OBVIOUSLY dangerous fleet manuver to attack and even kill the Ranged DPS gang. However our FC attempted it, and due to an excellent webbing loki, Logistics doing thier best to keep us alive, and some luck we did a better job than maybe I would have expected. This is a serious example where mindset, and the FC play an almost as large a role in success than Fleet comp.\n\nAnother example is when I fc'd a SEDI gang and we landed ontop a BS/BC gang that had double our numbers and scorpions on the field. Normally my gang had a numerous disadvantages but variables such as IRED's help, my expierence, some serious luck and a huge blunder on the side of the opposing fleet led us to a pretty great victory. If your not willing to fight an opposing fleet, or worried you cant win because of who your fighting, theres ALMOST no point.\n\nThe connection I was making or maybe the point I was leaning towards was, if a gang was more commonly using a fleet type I.E. tornados and you were flying in an AHAC gang, you may avoid fighting that gang because of several factors such as the fear of loss and the odds playing too much OUT of your favor. The inevitable fact is you can decide on the best course of action all day, you can give them the tools, you can get the CHANCE.. if you cant pull the trigger which is a mindset that I think is the real problem here especially verse a gang like Tornados. If you know that the people your fighting are good with thier tactics, or there are too many variables you cant comp for/cant out manuver then you may regardless of even the best comp attempt to fight the other fleet. Fights are not won by comp alone, they are won and lost primarily by the FC and by his fleet. Thier ability, and his expierence/nerve, and just alittle luck.\n\nThis is a problem that plagues all gangs and fleet, \"the other gang is out in thier \"leet\" comp we better not chance it... \" that IMO is a huge problem in countering another fleet in any capacity. Your not accounting for the other gang, mistakes they could make, things you may not be aware of and variables you havent accounted for. TO ME that is the single most important part of the equation or really the biggest answer to the question what can you counter a tornado fleet with.\n\nAre you willing to try?\n\nNow you can say how is this relevant, or well after this thread we KNOW how to defeat them! SO NOW WE CAN. I say I don't believe that yet, and I want you to prove me wrong. If it was merely not being specific on the tactics why is it there are so many \"obvious\" counters to the Tornado fleets present in this thread and no one has tried ANY of them on a tornado fleet, especially against us? Agony says they have.. I admire they tried it and were successful against the PIZZA gang! Awesome! It shows the tactic isnt fullproof.. but why the other night did they not try against Rote? Numbers were close enough that I think Agony had a real shot. Now you can say what you want, but if Im wrong and Mindset/targeted enemy is NOT as big a factor as i think it is.. then Agony would have fought Rote the other night in S-U. Thats definitly not a jab at Agony, thier \"Tweed\" gang seems well thought out and effective. I trust in thier ability to fly it and fight other gangs even at a disadvantage. But there is alot to this from a Psychological aspect, the fact we feel we have to gimp ourselves with Welp fleets/no logi or like Rooks and Kings. Maldor is Brilliant and his fleets are highly effective, that thought alone scares enough FCs into avoiding them that NO one is ever going to truely know what can counter it or even wether thier fleet is really that good. Ninja's attemped and 6 bil Bhaalgorn down.\n\nSo Ruri you said I hijacked, I really just think I asked the deeper question and maybe hit at the strongest problem associated with Tornado fleets. Rote flies them.. they are good at them.. does that impact your ability or desire to fight against it. Nough said.. *pant*\n\nTo answer andersons question, since it is well thought out and deserves a reply: at least from my prespective:\n\nThere is a huge difference between the gang we took on PIZZA with and the gang you faced in S-U. First of all, we had numbers around 25 against Pizza, who were brave and decided to face us with about 20 people in total, half of them in thrashers. Kudos to them for engaging. In S-U, i believe there were 5 Deimoses and a Muninn against your 20-30 man Tornado gang. Secondly, our fleet against PIZZA had a Proteus and two webbing Lokis, meaning we actually had a chance to catch kiters without relying on scrams. Thirdly, the fight against Pizza was at gates, leaving us with a GTFO ability should things go sour. Yeah, we know that you guys have more experience with the gang, but the reason the fight was declined in S-U (without me being there) was primarily about the two gang comps, not psychology. Sadly, your US TZ is bigger than ours, while our EU TZ is the same to yours. Like i said in my previous comment, if the opposing Alphanado gang has enough Alpha to kill you while chasing or regardless of how many you tackle on a gate, then there really is no point to engaging, now is there? At least against an opponent that you know knows how to fly these gangs.\n\nAgainst PIZZA, they were reforming and we were setting up for round two with a better lineup for them, numbers wise, but then we had the misfortune of accidentallying their bonus Loki, so no fight for us. I won't mind testing Tweed against Alphanados, but I won't take the fight unless I think we can win it. My decision to take the fight depends more on getting favorable terms in the form of positioning and fleet comps than whether we are fighting Rote, someone totally bad or someone unknown. We don't really care who you are as long as we're reasonably sure we won't get hotdropped to death.\n\nI think I can address the issue of the non-fight in S-U. It was essentially the same matchup (in both fleet comps and numbers) as another fight we'd had with Rote a few days earlier:  In that earlier engagement, we couldn't catch any Tornadoes, but the Tornadoes were able to alpha our ships, so we were forced to jump out. Brent even acknowledged the mismatch at the time, saying in local \"hold on, we'll come back with something you can fight.\" Which was pretty cool of him.\n\nSo, when we had a similar situation in S-U, I think our FC realized it wouldn't even be a goodfight, just a slaughter. I've seen Bamar leeroy us into Rote in the past for goodfights ( and I know he's not very risk-averse, so he must have thought it was a pretty bad situation. In fact, he was right: it was worse than the earlier fight because it was not on a gate (so we couldn't deaggro and jump out), but rather on a Rote shield repping carrier (so even if we could catch a Tornado, we couldn't have killed it). I think nobody in their right mind would have taken that fight. But I understand how it looked from Rote's POV: with Agony as just one of three forces in the system, they probably felt pretty outnumbered.\n\nPersonally, I'd rather find another gang to fight than gimp my setup to be able to counter one particular gang type. If you need tracks or damps, bring a couple of Ishtars instead of Arazus. More tank and they actually deal damage.\n\nThe whole idea was that you don't need specific counters to win against Tornados, you just need to not be a gimmick setup and use good space tactics.\n\n\"Winning\" spans many conditions from simply not letting the enemy get kills to keeping them out of a particular system to completely destroying every ship and their pods. In order to kill Tornados you need to meet a few criteria, but there are even more ways to drive them off."

We stuck it out there for 5 awesome months, but the lack of US TZ activity, particularly in the last couple of months as the other US TZ corps were leaving for more active alliances, left us a rather lonely bunch flying solo as THORN Syndicate during US TZ.

The damage card now makes all hard turns red.\n\nFirst you had a basic ship, then you upgraded it with an R2 unit which improved maneuvering, then you got critically hit so that your ship wont turn properly. The damage card is last, so its most relevant to the final result of the sum of all effectsI understand that in logical terms this is nebulous. However, the intent seems clear to me. The damage effect replaces the turn icons on the wheel with red whether they were green from an astromech or white by default.\n\nAlso, the rules do say that if one card allows something and another forbids it, then it is forbidden. Astromech allows green moves, damage forbids white and green hard turns (requires red).By that reasoning would that mean that the damage card allows you to use red hard turns?\n\nWouldn't it be more correct to say that since your hard turns are green to begin with the damage card forbids you from using those green hard turns ever again?I don't think that requires any FAQ, Ion cannon disables you from performing a maneuver therefore you couldn't perform a green maneuver and remove stress. That is one of the most efficient ways to use Ion cannon.\n\nIn general this is true. The ion effect causes you to do a speed-1 straight maneuver that is white. However, the R2 Unit upgrade changes all speed 1 and 2 maneuvers to green. Currently, there are no solid rules to determine how to resolve conflicts like that. I think most of us assume that the ion cannon (or critical damage card, in the other conflict that's come up like this) will win out, but there's nowhere in the rules we can point to prove thatGood thinking, but alas, when ionized, you still \"execute\" the straight-white-1 maneuver. If R2 Astromech turns it green, you still execute a straight-green-1 maneuver so you'd still remove the stress. Now, both the ion cannon and the rulebook section on removing stress use the word \"execute\" or a variation of it to refer to performing a maneuver. Therefore, Y-wings do not prevent you from \"executing\" a maneuver, or as you say, \"performing\" a maneuver. All ion cannon does is force you to execute a specific maneuver. But since R2 Astromech treats all 1- and 2-speed maneuvers as green, do you still get to treat the maneuver as green? It really depends on whether the ion cannons and Damaged Engine critical hit cards come before or after R2 Astromech makes them green.\n\nBut I'm reading the card again, and ion cannon says, \"The owner moves the ship as though it were assigned a straight-white-1 maneuver.\" This sounds like you are not executing a maneuver so should not, as you say, get to turn it green. However, immediately after that sentence it says, \"After executing this maneuver . . .\" which uses the term \"execute\" that is referred to by the rulebook and R2-D2 to mean moving your ship. They shouldn't have used the word \"executing.\"\n\nmy friends and i have went outside game rules to resolve conflicts lime this (ion v. r2) that arent very clear, we think of it in terms of what would actually happen to a starship is a real dogfight… (which opened a new can of worms really, but ill cover that in a minute) when shot with an ion canon, yiu are not executing anything, your ship is dead in the water as it were… even though the card uses the word execute at the end… your pilot, if stressed, would stay stressed due to the added stress of being next to helpless… seems to me that is closest to rule set and \"reality\"\n\nnow, the new can of worms- in space you cant slow withouy reverse thrusters, so you should move straight at whatever speed your last manuver was… which also would mean yiu shouls be able to barrel roll or target lock either… target lock i accept more, but a barrel roll in atmosphere would be fine woyhout thrusters, but in space you dont have rudders for turning… (but thats just symantics, lol)"

Banshees are the safest way to kill infestors, but that fails when the zerg has lots of infestors and some mutas/corruptors/queens/hydras. Battlecruisers fail spectacularly at killing infestors; their attack is too slow and close ranged, and their yamato is easily countered with a neural. There's really nothing the other races can do to out air a zerg with only air units.\n\nYou can get HSM off while the neural is charging at the raven, which I believe depletes the energy or most of the energy for the raven. This also does splash which kills units outright rather than applying a DoT.\n\nEssentially, the terran has more firepower, with HSM being ridiculous with aoe damage if it gets off. The zerg needs to split their units extremely well to mitigate HSM damage. And don't forget that Ravens and Banshees have the same tech path, so a couple cloaked banshees flanking for the express purpose of taking out infestors when the battle begins are extremely effective.\n\nYou're not worrying about out-airing a zerg, you're worrying about beating a corrupter/infestor army with skyterran. If there are infestors in the battle there's no reason you can't have ghosts cloaked, flanking to EMP the infestors. By the time you're worrying about maxing out on battlecruisers and ravens, you're in a plenty good enough position to have 5-10 ghosts as well.\n\nNeural has a range of 7, which outranges HSM by 1. Fungal has a range of 9, which means it's effect is slightly farther. Certainly depends on the positioning and spread of units on both ends, but infestor counters raven. You also can't spare the gas for ghost tech as well, and if you do, it's simply a matter of swarming your ghosts with ling/bane before bringing in the infestors. This build is plain bad and gimmicky, relying on your opponent to be of significantly inferior infestor micro compared to your raven micro to work. It's fun once in a while to pull off, but I don't think it should be one's main TvZ build."

The argument for this statement is that moons are basically ATMs, you plant down a structure and receive money, an awful gameplay mechanic.\n\nSeleene commented that he agreed to the assessment that it is an awful gameplay mechanic but pointed out that moons and their resources is a great conflict driver and perhaps it would be better to 'upset' the balance by adding alternative sources of moon-goo rather than removing the current source entirely. He then asked, \"How would you go about doing this?\"\nCCP Soundwave responded that the initial plan was replacing the current moon mining function with ring mining, but it was decided to place POSes higher on the priority list than ring mining and thus that plan is currently on hold. There will however be a change done regarding moon-goo in Winter 2012, but it hasn't been decided exactly how that change will be done. There is also the matter of how to go about doing this change gracefully regarding the community.\n\nTwo step asked why the composition of the tech II components is simply not changed to remove the dependencies of specific moon materials. It would be quick and easy to do and could be done several times to keep balance on moon material value until ring mining is done.\n\nSeleene and UAxDEATH both stated that this would not change anything in the end, at least it would not be a conflict driver, if anything it would perhaps just increase the workload on diplomats to organize deals between coalitions.\n\nTwo step pointed out that some of the moon minerals were more regionalized than others and currently the one in the highest demand was mostly present in the north. Changing the requirements of tech II components would make 0.0 entities move around more and create fights.\n\nUAxDEATH said that this was not a correct assessment; resources are not as big of a reason for fighting as personal vendetta (or hate).\n\nElise pointed out that when alchemy first came out it did wonders for the then-problem of R64s (but created the current problem). It not only did it bring about a certain balance in the pricing of those resources but it also encouraged smaller entities to go and fight over moons that provided the goo that is possible to alchemagic into R64s.\n\nSeleene said that while that solution was good, it was almost that he wished the change had never gone through due to the effects it had (the Technetium situation).\n\nTwo step added that every ship uses Tech and as such it is of course the prime candidate to control, plus the aforementioned localization of it makes it much easier.\n\nElise said that moons were a huge conflict driver for one month of the year, the eleven other months it is not.\n\nIf you want more than that, just hit the PDF and read from page 42 on.\n\nAlso:\n\nCCP Unifex wanted to explore the topic of conflict drivers a little bit further and asked, if moon minerals are taken off the table, what is it that drives conflicts in EVE?\n\nSeleene responded by saying that these days the major players in each alliance all hang out in the same jabber channels and conversations after fights are more akin to chat after a friendly match (even though titans and super caps were destroyed) rather than 'hatred' – everyone is so filthy rich that losses really don't matter. The 'romance' of old times, where hate and animosity where driving factors are largely gone. The sense of loss has turned from 'damn, now I have to go and mine to afford all this stuff again' to 'man, now I have to go to the market and spend money.'\n\nRaketefrau's quote from the minutes is entirely true. There is too much isk flowing into the system steadily right now at the alliance level. Ships used to be paid for by individuals, when a fight was lost, there was anger. Now they just post to the killboard and wait for the check from the alliance SRP program. The SRPs of today have reduced the grunt level hatred that used to motivate leaders to war and drive tensions between groups. Re-evaluateing the volume of moon goo required to build t2 ships to devalue moon mining could result in the reduction of SRP programs.\n\nSure, by reducing the demand, the profit of each moon drops, fuel costs are high and as such would result in less moons being mined. This would push up the price per unit, but the overall lessened demand would result in less isk flowing into moon holder's wallets.\n\nI believe a reduction in SRP programs would drastically reshape the face of nullsec. I may be wrong, but I think that reinstating the personal loss and expenditure of old would do wonders to increase the volume of conflict.\n\nThe only thing I dislike about the ring mining is it seems like they intend to force it to be a fleet effort. If it's like an incursion where you can't really solo, then the idea that it pushes isk from the alliance level down to the grunt is incorrect. It shifts the location of the alliance income and makes it necessary to actively grind (yay?) but the same people will be the beneficiaries. People still won't buy their own ships.\n\nOther than somewhat extensive blue lists (OTEC is not/was not and extended blue list as NC. roams were more than a common occurrence in Deklein, even before the recent silly business) I don't really see how these two are mutually exclusive. SRPs ensure that there are ships for those who want to fly them. It motivates roams and camps to go out and shoot at things with the knowledge that when they lose their ship they can get paid a portion of the cost, buy a new one and go shoot more ships. The one motivates the other. It would seem more likely that without SRPs you would really end up with less ships out and about and thus less of them exploding as people would be much more careful about how, when and where they fly those shipsCiv 5 is also wizardry for some reason I always have ICBM around the year 1600 while they are running around in horses is quite entertaining."

      "text": "a system whereby you could take a bridge officer candidate and make him a duty officer instead.\n\nTo keep it balanced I think when making such a change Boffs would have to get reduced one level in rarity: i.e. a rare (blue) bridge officer would become an uncommon (green) duty officer if transferred. Also you wouldn't know what characteristics the Doff would have although since these are based on race you would have a general idea of what they will end up with.\n\nThis makes sense to me because you seem to end up with a surplus of bridge officer candidates that seem rather worthless. From a thematic standpoint it also makes sense because ultimately bridge and duty officers are all just crew members and they ought to be transferable from one post to another.\n\nWell, \"thematically\" you wouldn't demote the equivalent to a board member to a forklift operator, which is what going from a bridge officer to a duty officer is similar to.\n\nBut, I like the idea, its solid, I think you could even keep the rarity, since (correct me if I am wrong) BOFF rarity only affects what BO skills they have, and those wouldn't relate to DOFF skills\n\nI think an even better addition to this would be if you could pick what specialty the DOFF would have, so you could \"downgrade\" a tactical officer to a projectile weapons specialist, or energy weapons specialist, or assault squad, etc; and a science BOFF to a deflector specialist, or an matter/antimatter specialist, etc.. Being able to choose that would make it more enticing, and give more options.\n\nWell, \"thematically\" you wouldn't demote the equivalent to a board member to a forklift operator, which is what going from a bridge officer to a duty officer is similar to.In \"traditional' military hierarchy, a commissioned officer is a commissioned officer. Be it they be in transit to a new duty station or assigned one. In this case, a Boff candidate is in all intense and purposes a commissioned officer. He/she has gone through the required education and training to successfully perform his/her duties in their field of study. So technically the Boff candidate would be, in essence taking a demotion in job title if they take the Doff position.\n\nI think of Boff's as commissioned officers and Doff's as enlisted personnel.\n\nEdit: Actually, i would propose Boff's to accompany Doff missions to enhance the success % and rewards %. It is not uncommon for commissioned officers to managed an away team assignment."

It looks like you could do with spending more time on the missile though, it looks very simple compared to the ship. Also, why does it have fins, and a pointy nose?\n\nWhy not? The fins and nose mean it can be launched into the atmosphere and be controled, also the fin mechanism, when deploying, imprints side rotation of the missle, that definitely improves stability in an atmosphere, i don't know about space, but i guess if doesn't hurt either.\nAbout the details of it, well, it's just a big missile, what details?\n\nTo manoeuvre in space it'll need an array small thrusters, pointing in different directions to give a turning moment. And the fins and nose cone will reduce it's spacial abilities as they increase it's mass.\nAre you saying this ship can go in atmosphere? or just the missile is designed to fill a space to, ground, sea or air, role?\n\nJust the missile is for the atmosphere. That big of a ship will just fall like a rock in the atmosphere of small planet maybe it will float like a boat on some atmospheric layers on big planets like Jupiter or bigger, if it can resist the presure, but mainly i conceived it for space battles. But i thought it should have all it's angles covered.\n\non my many skeches(i didn't scanned none , my scanner doesn't work on win7, dunno why) i was thinking about a magnetic module\nyou can think to hundred roles for it\nas:\n\n-the magnetic field protects the crew from outside radiations\n-it can deflect any metal-based projectile as railgun ammo(witch must be magnetic)\n-it offers stability to the deflectors, small satelites that have a big mirror in the front and can deflect attacks as plasma bullets or bolt cannons\n-using a planet's own natural magnetic field, it can levitate in the atmosphere, eliminating the need of multiple thrusters\n-using star's natural magnetic field can reduce drastically the plasma compsumption for the engines\n-keeps enemy fighters away\n-etc\n\nRail gun projectiles don't have to be magnetic. They generate a magnetic field by having a large current pass through or round the projectile, so any conductive material will do. Generally the material used is plasma so there is no friction with the rails, which will dissipate soon after launch anyway.\n\ngenerally you mean in the sf stuff\nonly prototypes at the moment, using metal bullets\n\nwhen i said that, i mean that if the plasma can be launched, it must be magnetic. otherwise the cannon doesn't move it. by that, means also that the magshield can stop or reduce drastically the plasma's, as you said, velocity and minimize the hull damage\n\nBut the Plasma acts as a sabot for the bullet, it isn't part of the actual projectile. If magnetic shielding becomes commonplace then the bullet wil be made of a material that is minimally affected by a magnetic shield."

      "text": "The Imperium is repeatably noted as being \"the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable,\" which sounds to me like saying \"the Imperium is absolutely as bad as it gets.\" I don't expect it to be literally the case, but it is a frequently stated tagline.\n\nDo Chaos followers do bad stuff? The worst, most stereotypical followers of Chaos -- the sacrifice-happy crazy cultists -- are identical to redemptionists & death cult assassins. Sister Repentia are as freakish as any warrior of Khorne or Slaanesh, and cherubim, arco-flagellants and penitent engines are as twisted mockeries of technology and of the human form as any heretek creation. Celestians are heartless, uncontrollable psychopaths like Khorne Berserkers, and so on. An Imperial can seem to be an awesome hero saving normal humans from the depredations of chaotics; but a chaos follower can seem to be an awesome hero saving psykers from the Black Ships or muties from the Monodominants.\n\nAs FFG's article on chaotic morality states, there are no \"good guys\" in 40k, but there are good individuals.\n\nAlso in the fluff(codex,books) the IOM is always stated be less evil than Chaos. So why give Chaos a pass for his crimes and pound on the IOM ones?\n\nAs for psykers there are taken to the Black Ships so that they don't became portals where deamons will pass through and put every sentient being on that world to an eternity of torture. They are brought to training and those that cannot control their power are disposed. Without Chaos psykers would not be so tightly controlled.\n\nNowhere in the fluff do the Celestians behave like Khorne Berserkers killing their own allies. Sister Repentia are as freakish as any warrior of Khorne or Slaanesh are you serious?\n\nFrankly I would rather live in the IOM as a psykers than in your so called psyker paradise you make Chaos to be.\n\nEDITAs for Tzeench deamons they always plot for bad things to happen never for good things to happen to mortals. It is change but only change for the worse.I think they cannot. They're the emodiments of bloodlust. Acting like that it's they're own nature, it's what they're made of.\n\nSo why give Chaos a pass for his crimes and pound on the IOM ones?[/quote]\n\nBecause there's virtually no difference? It is exactly as easy to do a \"good\" or \"evil\" Imperial or Chaos game.\n\nIt states the ability of Celestians and Repentias to control themselves in the face of \"witches\" and mutants is nonexistent, so yes, that would involve friendly fire instances.\n\nI'm sorry about the whole Black Ship thing... I'm just not going to be able to sympathize with how when the Emperor eats souls its good, but when Khorne eats souls its evil. Nor am I going to buy that when the Emperor banned religions that did not worship him, or set the astartes to butcher and enslave people to his will, that he gets a free pass \"because he did it for good, not for evil.\"\n\nFinal point, as to the assertion that \"Nowhere in fluff a good chaos character appears...\" the most obvious example would be Magnus the Red, who blew the whistle on the entire heresy and indeed was simply shoved into siding with Chaos due to the space wolves heroically and nobly slaughtering everyone. One of the Black Crusade articles have covered all this before, that the elements of chaos have as strong good aspects as badWhilst most modern literature attempts to create settings with many facets, avoiding the cliché division into Good and Evil I've always perceived the 40k universe not as Black vs White, but as Black vs Grey. There are no good guys around, but there is Evil and there are the \"better guys\". Anything I've read so far seems to confirm this interpretation.\n\nthor2006 said:\n\nNowhere in the fluff do the Celestians behave like Khorne Berserkers killing their own allies. Sister Repentia are as freakish as any warrior of Khorne or Slaanesh are you serious?\"They are using live weapons…\" As the Sister Superior watched, one of the youths dressed up as a Sororitas inexpertly discharged a salvo of shots into a boy on stubby stilts, the heavy rounds ripping through the wood and cloth imitations of eldar armour. Blood was already pooling on the arena's sands where figures from both sides had been cut down.\n\n\"Holy Terra!\", the Hospitaller gasped, her hand flying to her mouth in shock.\n\nClose by, one of the merchantmen from the cathedral clapped and let out a guffaw. \"What a magnificent effort this year. This Blessing will be one for the ages.\"\n\nMiriya rounded on him. \"They're killing each other.\"\n\nThe portly man's expression shattered under the Battle Sister's leaden stare. \"But… But of course they are. That's how it is done…\" He forced a smile. \"Ah, of course. Forgive me. You must both be off-worlders, yes? You are both new to Neva and the festival?\"\n\n\"What kind of blessing demands you force your people to kill one another?\", challenged Miriya.\n\n\"F-force?\" said the merchant. \"No one is forced, honoured Sister.\" He fumbled in the folds of his robes and recovered a fold of long papers from a hidden pocket. \"The participants in the reconstruction are all willing… Well, except for a few irredeemables from the reformatory and some asylum inmates.\" One of the papers was a dark crimson, and he peeled it from the pack to wave it at her. \"Every citizen who received one of these dockets in the clerical lottery knows they are obligated to take part in the great re-enactment. We are all more than ready to do our part in penance!\"\n\nMiriya snatched the red paper from him. \"Then tell me, sire, why are you here and not down there?\" The Celestian jerked a thumb at the melee below them.\n\nThe merchant's face coloured. \"I… I was happy to present the church with a substantial forfeit donation in my stead!\"\n\n\"You bought your way out with coin? How lucky for you that your coffers are deep enough\", she sneered. \"If only others were so fortunate!\"\n\n\"Now see here\", the noble retorted, attempting to maintain a level of superiority. \"Those who endure the Blessing are praised and rewarded. Our finest chirurgeons attend them in the aftermath, and those whose fortitude is lesser are buried with honours!\"\n\nBarely able to contain her anger, Miriya turned away, her hand dropping unconsciously to the grip of her holstered plasma pistol. The sound and fury of the confrontation set her teeth on edge, triggering old, ingrained battle instincts.\n\nReally doesn't strike me as heartless. The local population's traditions, on the other hand ... :D\n\nits all a matter of point of view. IOM say`s its has the right too (cull mutans and cleans them, cull psyers and send them of too ether die for the emperor, do something useful for one of there agensys or become a live long living psy com person and lets not forget. 'all aliens much die\" (or expliotend) and and who resist this rightful rule must die\n\nthe loyal see this as a state that has been, shall be and must be the way that it is (with minor fights about the how its done)\n\na follower of chaos might see. untold slauther of friends and famely, taking of there local healer/protecter or whatever els the local wyrd was, killing of a useful trading partner they where using too get by when the imperium wasn`t around too provide. and the brutal overlord that will do anything too say in power!\n\nand don`t bring up the deamons, you don`t play as a deamon so they don`t count. deamons in 40k are just a manifestasion of the warp bond by ether a greater deamon or a sorcerrer.\n\nThe TheAye, definitively. That said, I have yet to see any hint in GW studio canon that Celestians are truly as inhuman as they were made to sound like here. For what it's worth, studio canon has always simply described them as veteran Sisters forming a Canoness'es honor guard - not more, not less. I've seen no hint for why they should be even more whacked than a normal Sister Militant.\n\nAnd I say this as the last poster that would deny the SoB's penchant for \"atrocities\" (mutant purgings, punitive expeditions against secessionists, etc) - but I certainly wouldn't put them anywhere near a Khorne berserker. Even they have their limits - which has to do with the Imperial Creed and what they are actually fighting for. Senseless bloodshed isn't on their agenda, it always needs a reason. And unlike Chaos warriors, the Sisters Militant probably defend and aid helpless civilians about as often as they burn them, which is at least something.\n\nReally doesn't strike me as heartless. The local population's traditions, on the other hand ... :D\n\nI was just taking the Celestian fluff in the Blood of Martyrs literally, which presents the idea that they are spastic in the extreme.\n\nLynata said:\n\nAnd unlike Chaos warriors, the Sisters Militant probably defend and aid helpless civilians about as often as they burn them, which is at least something.\n\nTrue, though to be fair, their article on chaotic morality states that \"a warrior of Khorne is as likely to be an honorable duelist as a blood-crazed berserker...\" which isn't really an impression you'd get much in the fluff, I will freely admit. I would have more expected them to say \"a warrior of Khorne is 1% as likely to be an honorable duelist...\" but hey, I'll go with it"

      "text": "February 25, 2010\n\nRecently Manasi wrote a post about skillpoints, what they mean, what they don't mean and a general guideline for newer players. He did an excellent job explaining why skillpoints mean that you may have a capability to sit in a ship, but it means jack. Support skills are always hugely important.\n\nI run into this many times with my gangs. I always ask what shiptypes they have/ are bringing. Some of my pilots I know their ships and skills. Some I don't. If I'm not sure I ask, how do you have that ship fitted. Every so often I will say \"dock that up and get me something you can fit right\". Or I will help them fit it correctly. This may be a bit harsh but its very true. If you are in a Falcon with crappy jamming skills you are not an asset. You are an expensive primary that cannot support the gang effectively. If you are in a Zealot with horrible gunnery skills you are an expensive liability. You have no tank to begin with, and your DPS (which should be pro) will suck, assuming your tracking even lets you hit your target. The list goes on and on and on. Manasi summed up this very well.\n\nI am writing about the other aspect that makes a good pilot aside from his skillpoints. This is something that cannot be taught. Sometimes trained but never taught. Its called intelligence. As a newbie pilot to 0.0. less than two weeks into EVE I was in a Drake (which I lost to two Vagabonds in less than a day :/ ) It was T1 fit and barely able to tank rats. In less than a month I was one of the top killers in my corporation. Given, it was not the greatest corporation for PVP, but I was out there making kills with the Alliance more than anyone else. I picked up on information very quickly and learned things that people don't know after years of playing the game. I have an ability to absorb massive amounts of data and sort it and issue orders based on what is happening. This works on the micro level as it pertains to my own ship. This works on a macro level as it pertains to FCing. Some people can handle this, some people cannot. EVE is not a first person shooter. Quick reflexes help, but quick wits win. As I progressed through this first year (I am coming up on my 1 year mark in April, believe it or not) the ships and modules I unlocked merely enhanced my ability to kill you. The mindset of a killer is something that comes naturally to some, and some may find later in their EVE life. I have people in my corp that are new, whether to the game or to PVP. Yet they are extremely promising. Given some good instructions and a shove in the right direction they will become cold and calculated killers. Then there are people, new and old, who you have to watch closely and remind frequently to prevent them from dieing, screwing up, or any number of bad things. They may be flying t1 frigs or command ships, yet I still worry for them. In fact, old players who have no PVP sense worry me the most. They usually are the ones that drop the super expensive faction fitted crap lossmails that I have to yell at them about.\n\nI guess what I am saying is that in addition to sitting in your ship, AND properly fitting your ship, you need to have the wits about you to use it effectively. You need the experience to understand the situation, know when to engage, how to engage, and how to function once engaged. Sometimes you even need to know when to GTFO. So basically I agree that skillpoints can tell you quite a bit, and help you in many different ways. But they also mean absolutely nothing at the same time.\n\nJust to pile on a bit, but it also sounds like you've exercised good basic troop-leading skills as well Those are also key to meshing pilots with various skill, as well as skillpoint, levels into a good team. There will always be a spread of both. A good corp with good leaders to identify and train those folks makes everybody's experience more effective and hence fun in the case of the game"

      "text": "AI War Base Game\n\nFrom ArcenWikiWhat exactly are the features in the base game of AI War?\n\nA: This topic is something of a moving target, as new features are added all the time in terms of free DLC, etc. This listing is current as of version 3.120 of the game.\n\nPlease bear in mind that this is also not even going to make an attempt to list all of the interface features, all of the facets of the AI, all of the possible activities, etc -- that would be an absolutely gargantuan task, and the rest of the wiki makes that pretty clear. Instead, the idea of this topic is to provide a reference for things like AI types, map styles, ship types, etc, which are easily to enumerate. It thus provides something of a referent point for comparison to expansion additions, for instance, or just serves as a plain old reference if you want to look up certain types of information.\n\nIn all, there are currently 293 different ships in the base game of AI War, not counting things like modular components or control nodes.\n\nBasic Ship Classes\n\nThese four basic ship classes are available to all players (human and AI alike) in literally every game. Almost all of the bonus ship classes are weak against one or more of these basic ship classes. In total there are 18 ships in the basic ship classes.\n\nFighters (I-IV variants)\n\nInexpensive, with a small attack range.\n\nBombers (I-IV and Core variants)\n\nInflicts high damage on heavy defenses. Best ship class for hitting force fields and the final AI command stations.\n\nFrigates (I-IV and Core variants)\n\nFires powerful, long-range missiles, but has a very slow reload time.\n\nScouts (I-IV variants)\n\nCrucial for scouting enemy planets and gathering intel data. Be sure to bring at least one scout with you on every raid, to make sure you can see the full Planetary Summary.\n\nBonus Ship Classes\n\nThe base game of AI War includes 27 \"bonus\" ship classes beyond the base fighter, bomber, frigate, scout quartet (see above) that is in every game. Here is a list of them, along with what makes each one unique. In total there are 117 ships represented between all the bonus ship classes.\n\nBulletproof Fighters (I-IV variants)\n\nStandard fighters upgraded with armor that repels all shell-based fire.\n\nTachyon MicroFighters (I-IV variants)\n\nTiny fighters best in swarms. Reveals any cloaked enemy ships they come near.\n\nRaiders (I-IV and Core variants)\n\nFast ship able to bypass many standard defenses such as mines and tractor beams.\n\nVery long range electrical attack. Protects nearby allied ships by reducing the power of incoming lasers to 1/4 their normal power.\n\nSpace Planes (I-IV and Core variants)\n\nCloaked fighter excellent for bypassing enemy defenses (such as mines and tractor beams), with special onboard radar-dampening equipment that makes it impossible for ships to hit it if they are beyond a certain range from the plane.\n\nEtherJet Tractors (I-IV variants)\n\nBlazing fast cloaked fighter that can grapple an enemy ship and drag it.\n\nForce Field Bearers (I-IV variants)\n\nDoes relatively low damage, but has high health and provides a mini force field to protect allied ships. Its force field does not reduce the attack power of protected ships.\n\nArmor Ships (I-IV and Core variants)\n\nWeak firepower but heavily armored; excellent against most small craft.\n\nAnti-Armor Ships (I-IV variants)\n\nExcellent for attacking enemy armor and other targets at high range.\n\nMLRS (I-IV variants)\n\nMultiple Launcher Rocket System fires multiple mid-power rockets.\n\nMunitions Boosters (I-IV variants)\n\nStrong fighter in its own right, it also gives an attack bonus to nearby ships on your team.\n\nTeleport Raiders (I-IV variants)\n\nFast raiders able to traverse space in an instant.\n\nTeleport Battle Stations (I-IV variants)\n\nTeleporting battle station fires multiple lightning shots.\n\nStarships\n\nStarships are oversized, expensive, powerful vessels for various specialized purposes. Most of them work better on offense, but some of them -- like the Riot Control Starships or Siege Starships or Leech Starships -- can be just as effective on defense. Almost all starships are built at the starship constructor, except for the few that follow special rules (see below). In all, there are 22 different kinds of starships.\n\nScout Starships\n\nNo combat value, but is cloaked, emits tachyon beams, fires counter-sniper flares, and acts as a scout.\n\nMid-strength starship with high firepower. Boosts the strength of nearby ships.\n\nAlien Starships\n\nZenith Starships\n\nAdvanced alien technology makes this a mobile fortress. Very strong against large groups of ships, and boosts the strength of nearby ships.\n\nSpire Starships\n\nA formidable starship using technology based on alien artifacts discovered years ago. Very strong against large groups of ships, and boosts the strength of nearby ships.\n\nCore Starships (AI Only)\n\nThe toughest starship in the game, this relic of the Zenith is a secret controlled only by the AIs. These core starships roam around the core and home planets of the AIs, but tend not to be seen anywhere else.\n\nSiege Starships (I-III variants)\n\nThis is not so much a ship as a gun with engines on it. It is expensive, slow, thinly armored, has a low rate-of-fire, and can't even fire upon most small mobile targets. But its artillery shells can do grievous harm to starships, fortresses, guard posts, guardians, and turrets.\n\nRaid Starships (I-III variants)\n\nSmall, lightning-fast starship with powerful lasers. Excellent for long-range raiding. Can pass/shoot through force fields, and is exceptional at destroying ships with a high armor rating.\n\nLeech Starships (I-III variants)\n\nReclaims enemy ships it kills (reclaimed ships have health = half damage inflicted by reclamator). Very low main attack, but strikes huge numbers of ships at once (marking them for reclamation if any ship kills them).\n\nRiot Starships (I-III variants)\n\nSpecializes in disabling and destroying large numbers of weaker disturbances to the peace. Has three advanced light hardpoints, two medium hardpoints, and two heavy hardpoints.\n\nBomber Starships (I-IV variants)\n\nFast, armored starship that inflicts very high damage on any one target. Great against anything with high health. This is an experimental class of starship that is normally only used by the Mad Bomber AI type. There are also Fabricators around the galaxy that allow the human players to build Mark I Bomber Starships.\n\nDirectly-Constructed Ships\n\nThese different categories of ships represent the different tabs in the command station or mobile builder menus. Rather than being built through a looping queue (as with the military ships and starships noted so far), these ships are directly placed into space and are constructed in-situ. The grand total of these kinds of ships is 83.\n\nEconomic Ships\n\nEconomic ships are, simply used for maintaining and extending your economy, or for doing engineer-type repair/cleanup/rebuilding duties. There are 14 economic ships in all.\n\nEnergy Reactors (I-III variants)\n\nGenerates a moderate amount of energy at a moderate cost-to-benefit ratio. Efficiency goes down by 20/40/80% (by mark level) for each new reactor of this type built on the same planet.\n\nHarvesters (Metal and Crystal variants)\n\nMines crystal or metal found amidst rock deposits or debris fields. Crystal and metal are needed for constructing units.\n\nManufactories (Metal and Crystal variants)\n\nExpensive method for generating crystal or metal by converting one into the other. Useful when access to deposits is limited. Will automatically activate when your supply of one resource runs low, or when storage of one resource is full but the other is not.\n\nScience Labs (I-III variants)\n\nResearch and unlock new technologies. Also gathers up to 3000 knowledge per planet. Mark I and II are mobile but cannot gather from hostile planets. Mark III is immobile but can gather from hostile planets while in supply, which enrages the AI at that planet.\n\nEngineers (I-III variants)\n\nRepairs damaged ships or can accelerate construction done by other ships. Unless issued a specific command by its controller, it will automatically repair nearby allies.\n\nRemains Rebuilders\n\nCleans up exploded ship remains and builds replacement ships in their place. Each ship it rebuilds costs half the normal metal/crystal/time, and it prevents players from having to manually rebuild them. Unless issued a specific command by its controller, it will automatically rebuild nearby remains.\n\nCleanup Drones\n\nRemoves exploded enemy ship remains, to prevent them from being rebuilt by enemy Remains Rebuilders. Also able to dismantle enemy mines on allied planets.\n\nCommand Stations\n\nThere are 18 different kinds of command stations in all.\n\nHome Command Station (Humans)\n\nThe first team to destroy all their opponents' home planet command stations is the winner. If one player controls multiple home planet command stations, destroying one will destroy them all. However, while one player controls multiple home planet command stations, the ship caps of the player will be increased.\n\nEconomic Orbital Command Stations (I-III variants)\n\nEconomic Command Stations have very little defensive quality, and absolutely no ability to attack enemy ships, but they provide the largest income in metal, crystal, and energyLogistical Orbital Command Stations (I-III variants)\n\nLogistical Command Stations provide very little in the way of economic gain, and can't shoot at enemy ships, but they vastly increase the speed of all allied ships and halve the speed of all enemy ships in the current system. They also have middling armor. The highest mark version also stops enemy units from teleporting while they areMilitary Orbital Command Stations (I-III variants)\n\nMilitary Command Stations provide very little in the way of economic gain, but have much more health and the ability to shoot at enemy ships, along with some specialized immunities like the immunity to blade attacks. They also emit tachyon beams (the highest mark version providing planetary tachyon coverage) and an attack boost to all alliesOrbital Command Station - Warp Jammer\n\nCosts significant ongoing resources, but prevents any warps from being initiated against its host planet.\n\nHome Command Station - Core (Humans) (I-III variants)\n\nThis is the core from a destroyed command station. When a player's home planet command station is destroyed, and that player still has surviving allies, this core warps to the allied home planet.\n\nAI Orbital Command Stations (I-III variants)\n\nNerve center of every AI's planetary base. Destroy this to greatly hamper the AI's ability to reinforce itself (although certain other structures, like Special Forces Guard Posts, also need to be destroyed to completely prevent the AI from reinforcing a planet). +15 AI Progress if killed.\n\nCore Command Station (AIs)\n\nAI Home Command Stations cannot be damaged until all of the AI Core Guard Posts on the AI home planet and all of the AI Core Shield Generators in the galaxy have been destroyed. The first team to destroy all their opponents' home planet command stations is the winner. +100 AI Progress if killed.\n\nConstructors\n\nThere are 6 different kinds of constructors that can be directly built, but there are many other types of constructors that are actually under the Capturables section (Advanced Factories, and many types of Fabricators).\n\nSpace Docks\n\nCreates the fighters, bombers, frigates, and other ships that will comprise most of your fleet.\n\nMercenary Space Docks\n\nCreates mercenary ships. Mercenary ships are vastly more expensive than their non-mercenary counterparts, but they have a much larger ship cap.\n\nStarship Constructors\n\nGenerates starships over a long period of time.\n\nMissile Silos\n\nGenerates powerful (and expensive) warheads over a long period of time. Nukes in particular are very dangerous to use, and should only be attempted by advanced players. Detonating any warhead causes the AI Progress to increase by some amount (the amount varies by the warhead).\n\nMobile Builders\n\nAllows you to build economic and defensive ships at planets your team doesn't control. Crucial for establishing beachheads in enemy or neutral territory. Note that ships which require supply will not function outside of supply.\n\nColony Ships\n\nSend to an uninhabited planet to build a new Command Station and capture the planet. Wanting to upgrade an existing command station on a planet? Don't scrap it! Just build the new one and it will replace it without impacting harvesters, reactors, and ownership of the planet.\n\nDefensive Ships\n\nDefensive ships serve a wide variety of purposes, and some of these are even more useful on offense rather than defense - but they all tend to have a support role of some variety, and more often than not are best either used away from the action on enemy planets, or else in the thick of the action on your own planets. There are 21 ships in all in this category.\n\nRally Posts\n\nAllied ships that are sent to this planet will gather at this rally post, which can be moved around at will. If there are multiple allied rally posts on a single planet, entering ships will pick one of them at random.\n\nAdvanced Warp Sensors\n\nProvides better warning of incoming enemy warps to a planet. Wormholes through which a warp will arrive will flash on the minimap, and will turn orange in the main view.\n\nTachyon Drones\n\nWeak, mobile ship reacts with nearby enemy cloaked ships, making them trackable for a short while.\n\nDecloakers\n\nFast mobile ship with moderate attack and the ability to reveal any cloaked enemy ships in a wide arc.\n\nMines\n\nEnemy ships coming too close to these invisible traps will incur heavy damage. The minefield is also damaged, and eventually destroyed, in the process.\n\nMobile Repair Stations\n\nSimultaneously repairs all nearby allied ships. After moving, it must recharge for 60 seconds before it can start doing repairs again: it's best to find a good position for it and leave it there until you're ready to deploy it in a new locale.\n\nTransports\n\nCarries up to 200 units (cannot carry certain very large units). Heavily armored and defensible, this is ideal for slipping past minefields, ion cannons, or high-level enemy planets. If the transport is killed, all of the ships inside are ejected safely just before the explosion. Every wormhole that the transport goes through outside of supply drains its health substantially, but it also regenerates health quickly on a friendly planet. Unloading is instant in friendly territory, but only 10 ships per second in hostile territory. Cannot be scrapped in hostile territory.\n\nFortresses\n\nExtremely large, powerful, and expensive mobile defensive structure. Can store up to 500 units inside itself to protect them during attacks. Also repairs all nearby ships. After moving, it must recharge for 60 seconds before it can start doing repairs again. AI Fortresses are immobile.\n\nForce Field Generators (I-III variants)\n\nCreates a small, mobile force field that provides protection for nearby ships. Ships firing out from under the force field do 75% less damage than normal, so it is best to build defenses around the field.\n\nHarvester Exo-Force Fields\n\nPlace on metal or crystal harvesters to create a tiny shield bubble around them. As long as the exo-shield exists, it will take all damage that would have been dealt to the harvester. Ships that are able to fire through normal force fields can't ignore an exo-shield, as it becomes an extension of the protected ship itself. However, the other effect of having this protection is that the output of the harvester is halved.\n\nTurrets\n\nTurrets are, in general, much more powerful than their mobile counterparts. The downside of turrets is that they are immobile. They are thus very well suited for defense (and sometimes for offense, either in creating a beachhead or otherwise), but typically work best when either augmented with mobile ships or tractor beams / gravitational turrets. There are 33 turrets in all.\n\nBasic Turrets (I-III and Core variants)\n\nInexpensive, basic defense for planetary bases.\n\nFlak Turrets (I-III variants)\n\nFires bursts of hundreds of canisters each in turn containing hundreds of secondary explosives. Blankets an area with light damage that is extremely effective against melee ships but equally ineffective against heavily armored targets and starships.\n\nReacts with nearby enemy cloaked ships, making them trackable for a short while.\n\nHuman-Only Ships\n\nThese ships represent technologies that the human forces have developed after the AIs took over the galaxy -- and so the AI forces do not yet have access to these tools. This can prove very helpful in counterbalancing all of the new tools that the AI has developed (or bought from alien sources) since humanity was pushed to the brink. Of course, humans have the advantage of being able to steal most all of the different types of AI technology in some fashion or another, but the AIs are unable to steal the human technologies. There are 8 different human-only ships, not counting control nodes, which aren't really ships per se.\n\nWarheads\n\nLightning Warheads (I - III variants)\n\nEmits a mid-power explosion of lightning that damages enemy ships in a wide arc on detonation. Can be given a direct target that it will chase and then explode near, or it will explode on death. +1/2/3 AI Progress if killed or scrapped.\n\nArmored Warheads (I - III variants)\n\nArmored version of the standard Lightning Warhead. Almost impossible for enemy ships to destroy, so it is highly likely to reach its target. Emits a powerful explosion of lightning that damages nearby enemy ships on detonation. Can be given a direct target that it will chase and then explode near, or it will explode on death. +10/15/20 AI Progress if killed or scrapped.\n\nEMPs (I - III variants)\n\nDoes a small bit of localized damage and causes a planet-wide electromagnetic pulse when destroyed by enemy forces or by scrapping. Temporarily paralyzes most ships, disables cloaking, and disables force fields and mines on the planet on which it is set off. EMP effects last for 30/70/120 seconds, and affect your ships as well as enemy ships. Does not affect mark V ships or starships. +2/4/6 AI Progress if killed or scrapped.\n\nTachyon Warheads (I - III variants)\n\nDoes a small bit of localized damage and causes a planet-wide tachyon pulse when destroyed by enemy forces or by scrapping. Reveals for 5/8/12 minutes all cloaked ships (enemy and allied alike) on the planet on which it is set off. +1/2/3 AI Progress if killed or scrapped.\n\nNuclear Warheads (I - III variants)\n\nCauses a massive nuclear explosion when destroyed by enemy forces or by scrapping. Destroys all resources and most ships within its area of effect. Does not affect mark V ships or starships. Also causes supply to be permanently lost for all teams within its effective area, meaning you then cannot use science labs, docks, etc. Mark I destroys the planet on which it is detonated. Mark II destroys that planet and any planet connected to it via wormhole. Mark III destroys every planet in the galaxy. +50/500/5000 AI Progress if killed or scrapped.\n\nMercenaries\n\nMercenary Fighters\n\nInexpensive, with a small attack range. Identical to the Fighter Mark IV, except 10x more expensive and with a much larger ship cap.\n\nMercenary Bombers\n\nInflicts high damage on heavy defenses. Best ship class for hitting force fields and the final AI command stations. Identical to the Bomber Mark IV, except 10x more expensive and with a much larger ship cap.\n\nMercenary Frigates\n\nFires powerful, long-range missiles, but has a very slow reload time. Identical to the Missile Frigate Mark IV, except 10x more expensive and with a much larger ship cap.\n\nControl Nodes\n\nThere are currently 23 different types of control nodes, but they are less ships and more behavioral control quasi-interface elements. They are completely invisible and inert as far as the AI is concerned, and only the humans can build them.\n\nCapturables\n\nExcept for the cheats-activated ships, all of these capturables tend to be found scattered around the galaxy, waiting for humans to come make use of them. There is a fair amount to capture in the base game, but one major focus of the first expansion to the game was adding many new capturables. In the base game, there is a total of 15 types of capturables, including the cheats-enabled ones.\n\nGeneral\n\nData Centers\n\nServer farm. Destroy to damage AI Progress by 20.\n\nAdvanced Research Stations\n\nVault of advanced AI technology. Capture to gain a new ship type for your team to build at space docks. Never destroy these, but if it dies sometime after you capture it, you won't lose the technology you gained from it. Can gather knowledge, but not from hostile planets.\n\nAdvanced Factories\n\nCapture to build Mark IV versions of any ship types in which you have already attained Mark III. Never destroy these!\n\nCore(MkV) Fabricators\n\nThere are 9 types of these in the base game, one for each of the Core ship types included in the base game. Capturing these is the only way that human players are ever able to build Core/Mark V ships. Each fabricator only allows you to build a single type of core ship by controlling it.\n\nStarship Fabricators\n\nThere is only one type of these in the base game, allowing you to build Mark IV Bomber Starships.\n\nExperimental Fabricators\n\nThere is only one type of these in the base game, allowing you to build Anti-Starship Arachnids.\n\nCheats-Activated\n\nOmega Drive\n\nThis ship is only available via the \"Activate The Omega\" cheat. It is severely unbalanced and just for fun or testing.\n\nAI-Only Ships\n\nIn the time since the AIs took over the galaxy from the humans, they have been hard at work developing new and stronger technologies as well as buying technologies from aliens the next galaxy over. In many of the ship categories above, from the bonus ship types to the starships to the turrets, there are some ships that are typically only available to the AIs unless the humans capture the technology (and a few of which are technologies that cannot be captured). That pattern holds in this section, but this section lists the more unusual ships -- including special weapons -- that are AI-only (though a number of the weapons in particular can be captured for human use). In all, there are 30 ships in this section, counting the ships that are specific to minor factions (third party AIs).\n\nGuard Posts\n\nMisc AI Ships\n\nAI Force Field Generators (I-III and Core variants)\n\nCreates a force field that provides protection without reducing attack power of ships underneath. Attack with several dozen Mark I Bombers (or better) to destroy.\"\n\nWarp Gates\n\nDestroy these gates to prevent AIs from initiating new warps of raids and reinforcements. Or, is automatically destroyed when the AI's command station is destroyed. The ship production facilities of the AIs are somewhere outside the galaxy -- cut off their ability to warp in raids against adjacent planets by destroying these gates. Note that if all Warp Gates are destroyed, the AI can still bring in ships across normal wormholes, but you won't get a warning.\n\nExo-Galaxy Wormholes\n\nThis one-way wormhole leads to somewhere outside the galaxy. A mysterious force prevents your ships from going through. This wormhole cannot be destroyed, and it will continue letting enemy ships into the galaxy until you finish off both AIs and win the war.\n\nSpecial AI Weapons\n\nAdvanced weapon which insta-kills most ships equal to or lower than its Mark level (and many ships with no Mark level at all). Cannot fire upon ships immune to insta-kill.\n\nAI Troop Accelerators\n\nAdvanced AI technology allows the AI to add reinforcements to this planet at double the normal rate. Destroying this causes the AI Progress to increase by 10.\n\nCounter Spies\n\nAdvanced weapon insta-kills cloaked ships.\n\nSuperFortresses\n\nIncredibly powerful fortress with a massive range. Only bombers and tanks have any chance against it. Immobile. Also repairs all nearby ships.\n\nAvengers\n\nThis ship only comes into play as part of the Avenger AI Plot. A massive, moon-sized space station created by the AI as the final defense against the human onslaught. If the AI Home Command Station to which it is assigned is destroyed, the Avenger will live up to its name.\n\nPlanetary Cloakers\n\nA highly advanced cloaking device. All team ships on the planet which this resides are utterly invisible, even while firing, even if they normally would be visible. They are also immune to tachyon beams and tachyon missiles.\n\nAttrition Emitters\n\nEmits precisely-tuned pulses to drain the health of any enemy ships in the local system.\n\nMinor Faction Ships\n\nRebelling Human Colonies\n\nA formerly captive city filled with living humans. AI progress will skyrocket by 100 if this is destroyed. These civilians have decided to rebel, and have erected a temporary invisibility cloak while they call for aid. When the cloak dissipates, they'll be vulnerable to attacks from the AI, and surely won't last long. When the city is captured by the humans, your entire team can use their facilities to build rebel ships. While you hold the planet on which they are located, their invisibility cloak will remain at full power.\n\nMarauder Buzz Bombs\n\nHostile human vagabonds who live in deep space will occasionally send these automated bombs at human and AI settlements to destroy what they can so that they can escape with the resulting scrap. The buzz bomb fires high-impact grenades that explode on contact with its target, dealing area damage. They won't attack any AI ships that human players must normally manually target.\n\nMarauder Dagger Frigates\n\nHostile human vagabonds who live in deep space will occasionally send these extremely long-range frigates at human and AI settlements to destroy what they can so that they can escape with the resulting scrap. They won't attack any AI ships that human players must normally manually target.\n\nResistance Fighter/Bombers\n\nPockets of human allies who still live in deep space around AI planets will occasionally send these versatile fighter/bomber hybrids to aid you in the fight against the AI at their local planet. They won't attack any AI ships that human players must normally manually target.\n\nResistance Frigates\n\nPockets of human allies who still live in deep space around AI planets will occasionally send these very long-range frigates to aid you in the fight against the AI at their local planet. They won't attack any AI ships that human players must normally manually target.\n\nAI Types\n\nThe following 26 AI types are included in the base game.\n\nEasier\n\nEntrenched Homeworlder\n\nPlanets are heavily defended, and they do moderate attacks on the players.\n\nUnique Units: Captive Human Settlements\n\nFortress Baron\n\nPlanets are mostly moderately defended, but the core planets are incredibly heavily defended, and they do moderate attacks on the players.\n\nUnique Units: SuperFortress\n\nSledge Hammer\n\nWaves slam into one player planet after another, with potentially fatal effect.\n\nTurtle\n\nPlanets are all very-to-incredibly heavily defended, but they do no waves against the players (Cross Planet Attacks and border aggression still happen).\n\nTrain Master\n\nUses many, many astro trains.\n\nExtra Units: Double the normal number of astro trains.\n\nMine Enthusiast\n\nPlanets are all moderately defended, but are heavily booby-trapped with mines.\n\nThe Tank\n\nPlanets are all lightly defended, and they do slightly heavier-than-average attacks on the players.\n\nExtra Units: Has tanks and armor ships from the start, as well as whatever other ships they might unlock.\n\nModerate\n\nVicious Raider\n\nPlanets are all moderately defended, and they do heavy attacks on the players.\n\nExtra Units: Has raider ships from the start, as well as whatever other ships they might unlock.\n\nMad Bomber\n\nNon-core planets are all very lightly defended, but does extremely brutal attacks on the players.\n\nUnique Units: Bomber Starships\n\nFeeding Parasite\n\nUses parasite raids almost exclusively (which can be highly damaging).\n\nExtra Units: Has all parasite ships from the start, as well as whatever other ships they might unlock.\n\nStealth Master\n\nUses stealth raids almost exclusively (which can be highly disconcerting).\n\nExtra Units: Has all ships with cloaking from the start, as well as whatever other ships they might unlock.\n\nCounter Spy\n\nPlanets are heavily defended, and advanced scouting is almost impossible because of the counter spy defenses on each planet, which insta-kill all cloaked ships.\n\nUnique Units: Counter Spy\n\nTeleporter Turtle\n\nPlanets are all very-to-incredibly heavily defended, but they do no waves against the players (Cross Planet Attacks and border aggression still happen). Specializes in teleporting ships, which are particularly powerful in defensive postures.\n\nExtra Units: Has all ships with teleportation from the start, as well as whatever other ships they might unlock.\n\nBackdoor Hacker\n\nPlanets are all moderately defended, and they have a permanent path into each player's home planet (so creating the usual defensive perimeters won't work).\n\nExtra Units: Has a permanent Exo-Galaxy Wormhole on each player's home planet.\n\nAssassin\n\nPlanets are all moderately defended, and they harass the strongest player with prejudice.\n\nBully\n\nPlanets are all moderately defended, and they harass the weakest player with prejudice.\n\nHarder\n\nAttritioner\n\nPlanets are all moderately defended, except that each one has an Attrition Emitter, which drains the health of any human ships in the system. Does heavy attacks on the players.\n\nUnique Units: Attrition Emitter\n\nScorched Earth\n\nHeavily defended planets. Whenever it loses control of a planet, it destroys that planet and all the resources there. Ships will survive.\n\nShadow Master\n\nLike the Stealth Master, except every planet is equipped with a powerful device that keeps all ships permanently cloaked, even when firing, even if they wouldn't normally have cloaking. The only sign of this enemy is the device itself, which can be difficult to reach what with all the invisible enemies firing at you from the nether.\n\nUnique Units: Planetary Cloaker\n\nExtra Units: Has all ships with cloaking from the start, as well as whatever other ships they might unlock.\n\nSpecial Forces Captain\n\nOnly has special forces guard posts -- no regular guard posts. This makes for a tremendous number of ships patrolling around the map at any given time.\n\nTechnologist\n\nTechnologist Homeworlder\n\nLike the Entrenched Homeworlder, except the enemy uses only the highest-technologies right from the start (these are quite a formidable foe).\n\nUnique Units: Captive Human Settlements\n\nTechnologist Raider\n\nLike the Vicious Raider, except the enemy uses only the highest-technologies right from the start (these are quite a formidable foe).\n\nExtra Units: Has raider ships from the start, as well as whatever other ships they might unlock.\n\nTechnologist Sledge\n\nLike the Sledge Hammer, except the enemy uses only the highest-technologies right from the start (these are quite a formidable foe).\n\nTechnologist Turtle\n\nLike the Turtle, except the enemy uses only the highest-technolgies right from the start (these are quite a formidable foe).\n\nTechnologist Parasite\n\nLike the Feeding Parasite, except the enemy uses only the highest-technologies right from the start (these are quite a formidable foe).\n\nExtra Units: Has all parasite ships from the start, as well as whatever other ships they might unlock.\n\nThe Core\n\nPlanets are all lightly defended in terms of the number of ships at each, but all ships of this AI are deadly Mark V/Core ships.\n\nRandoms\n\nNormally when you choose a random AI type you cannot see which type was actually chosen until the game ends. However, there is an AI Modifier in the lobby that allows you to make them visible from the start, but still chosen at random. You can also use the disabledaitypes.txt? file to exclude specific AI types from being chosen (if you've already played them, say, and are trying to work your way at random through the whole list -- or if you simply don't like a specific type of AI).\n\nRandom Easier\n\nChooses one of the easier AI types at random.\n\nRandom Moderate\n\nChooses one of the moderate AI types at random.\n\nRandom Moderate/Easier\n\nChooses one of the easier or moderate AI types at random.\n\nRandom Harder\n\nChooses one of the harder AI types at random (technologist AI types are all considered harder, so this includes them).\n\nRandom Harder Non-Technologist\n\nChooses one of the harder AI types at random, but specifically excluding any of the technologist types.\n\nRandom All\n\nChooses one of AI types at random.\n\nRandom All Non-Technologist\n\nChooses one of AI types at random, but specifically excluding any of the technologist types.\n\nMinor Factions\n\nMinor Factions are a pretty hefty topic, so they are covered in way more depth on the Minor Factions wiki page. Here's a list of the ones added as part of the base game, though:\n\nHuman Resistance Fighters, which occasionally show up to help the player against AI planets.\n\nHuman Marauders, which occasionally show up at player or AI planets during large fights to attack both parties.\n\nHuman Rebelling Colonies, which occasionally call for aid -- rewarding the human players with income and new ships if they answer, or causing an AI Progress increase if the rebel colony perishes.\n\nAI Plots\n\nAI plots can be enabled through the lobby, and provide varied endgame scenarios.\n\nAvenger\n\nAn avenger space station spawns on the death of the core command station of the AI with the avenger plot turned on. The Avenger is incredibly powerful, and will go straight for human home command stations.\n\nMap Styles\n\nThe following map styles are included in the base game:\n\nRealistic\n\nConnections between planets are much more complex, as real wormhole networks would more likely be.\n\nThis mode tends to create more interesting maps, but the visual complexity of them can be intimidating to new players.\n\nRealistic - Hubs\n\nConnections between planets are complex and plentiful.\n\nSimple\n\nConnections between planets are simpler and easier to see.\n\nThis is the recommended mode for new players, but it will result in fewer unique maps.\n\nSimple - Hubs\n\nConnections between planets are simpler and easier to see, but very plentiful.\n\nMusic Tracks\n\nIn all, there is over 50 minutes of music in the base game. The specific tracks are:"

      "text": "I've recently been having a lot of trouble with Assault Marines, particularly when backed up by the Apothecary but even with no commander around. I can't figure out how to counter them - they melee Scouts or Tacticals to death easily, absolutely maul Devastators and seem to be able to take out my Force Commander without too much trouble, as long as they get the jump on him (haha).\n\nI suppose massed shotguns could work, but the power cost of getting more than 2 shotgun squads is prohibitively high. On the other hand, using Assault Marines back could work if I waited for them to jump onto other troops and then jumped onto the enemy, but the time it takes to gather resources for my own ASM squad is huge. Teching to T2 and getting a Razorback seems good in theory, because they won't have meltabombs by then, but the heavy bolter on the Razorback seems to be a bit wussy against power armour, and it takes a good five minutes to kill the buggers. Getting a Dreadnought costs way too much power to even consider.\n\nSo, how does a Space Marine player counter enemy ASMs?\n\nPhyre\n\n27th Jan 09, 10:34 PM\n\nFunny, I was just about to ask the opposite question. I just played a few SM mirror matches and Tacs seemed to do pretty decently in melee against my ASM. My computer lags a ton though when I play so I might have missed something like a shotty scout team nearby but as far as I could tell it was his 3 Tac squads + Apoth vs my 2 ASM squads + Apoth and he came out on top with a small number of Tacs left.\n\nAgain, I might have missed something because it was lagging so bad but I was going to ask about people's experiences with Tacs vs ASM in melee.\n\nOP: Personally I've found the most annoying thing is a shotty scout squad supporting the enemy army. Between the shotties and the nades my ASM get roughed up pretty bad unless I Jump on the scouts first.\n\nFaust\n\n28th Jan 09, 12:22 AM\n\nSo, how does a Space Marine player counter enemy ASMs?\n\nTactical squad, rush tier 2, get a sergeant, pop ATSKNF when you are in combat and the squad is receiving damage.\n\nLaugh when the other marine player's ASMs lose to your tacticals in melee.\n\nIf you don't want to do that, FC with thunderhammer and the warcry active will do an aoe knockback every hit.\n\nstreak\n\n28th Jan 09, 12:57 AM\n\nYou can scare them off with a large amount of focused fire. The apoth's bolter upgrade also knocks them around, I think, as do shotguns. Wiping out the entire squad is another matter, but that's hard to do to any SM squad.\n\nnyyti\n\n28th Jan 09, 3:03 AM\n\nFaust has the right idea here. ATSKNF is probably the best you can get against ASM.\n\nIn T1, meleeing the ASM with your commander, kbacking with scouts shotties and supporting with tacs + little dance moves (retreat if necessary). This way you can buy time to get your own ASM, and finish the enemy off."

      "text": "Welcome To 6th Edition...\n\nWell, what to say other then the book is in hand and WOW. So where to start with all this? I had to \"reboot\" the blog when going from 4th to 5th, and now from 5th to 6th as it is a completely different game, and for the better, even if allies makes me cringe with what the WAAC guys are going to do with them...\n\nWhy do people apply the nickname \"Flying Circus\" to everything nowadays? A flying circus was a group of Harlequins in a Falcon tank, which once was a pretty scary and common thing, as strange as that seems today and thus deserved a nickname. Harlequins are clowns, clowns are circus artists, so that made sense. Necrons in a transport are not a flying circus. I know that this is nitpicking and pedantic but c'mon.\n\nYeah. When they screwed Banshees I thought: Well, at least we still have the Harlequins and Rending didn't get nerfed. If the Meta Game swings back to infantry armies, that might make Harlequins more interesting again. And what do they do? They nerf the sh** out of them for absolutely no other reason than to give one more middle finger to us Xeno playing weirdos. It is not based on another rule that doesn't exist anymore and it doesn't create an unwanted advantage in combination with a new rule. There simply was no reason to change it.\n\nyes- but that is actually +3 to cover, so it's 4+ in the open, 2+ in most area terrain. Since Harlies can move through terrain for free, it's a bit of a double-edged sword- they can always get shot now, but they have a high save to make up for it. The biggest issue is that they can't start in a Wave Serpent, so they need to be in Falcons...\n\nFritz- I'd be interested to see how you are building armies for the start of 6th Ed, now that: - Fast Attack are important for 1 mission - Heavy Support are important for 1 mission - You can only reserve up to half of your force, so no more Null-Deployment - Hull Points.\n\nIf you are talking about Veil Of Tears, from all I know the English FAQ is the only one where they made that mistake. All the other language FAQs clearly get rid of the 2D6x2 thing. So I guess it is only a matter of time till they \"correct\" the English FAQ.\n\nHow bout the changes to sychic powers? wtf is up with that! you can't choose or buy them anymore? I really can't get my head around that section...tbh in my games im gonn ignore this section because sychers don't just use random powers and is frankly one of the dumbest rule changes as I play eldar as well so that basically screws saim hann, well any eldar force using farseer powers to buff.\n\nThose new generic rule book psychic powers are optional to psychers. You can either use your codex Eldar powers like you did till now, or you can chose to replace them with the new ones in the rulebook. You can play one Farseer with codex powers and one with rulebook powers or two with codex powers or two with rulebook powers, you just can't mix them"

There's been many, many times where we warped away to set up a pounce spot or get in position for our optimals, while the NC was en route with their 70-80 dudes to fight our 25-30. On the occasions I've taken to listen in on MM comms, it always shocked me that the FC would always say, \"They're running guys, these fucking pussies, I hate Black Legion, they never fight, they fucking suck, they're soooo scared of us.\" The thing that amazes me about it is that we've fought these guys time after time, usually 2-3.5:1. Sometimes we lose a few and bail, sometimes we come out on top but with a couple losses, sometimes we just completely dominate, but nevertheless, if we do run, the NC FC immediately takes the opportunity to gloat to his guys about how we're terrible and how we're pussies.\n\nWe have a former R.A.G.E guy in corp now who's actually a pretty chill brosef and I asked him recently if people actually believed their FC when they said things like that and he said a good amount actually do.\n\nI just don't get it.

Both will get down and blow any BL member if they could. It's easy for them to talk a bunch of shit but god forbid anybody ever saw them in a fleet.

Would it not make more sense to do it on a Thursday or Friday, so that it can be killed over the weekend when it can be alarmed clocked?\n\nAfter all that effort, they failed to kill the towers, lost 3 titans, whole lot of support ships and lost few high-end moons since than. Why would anybody want to waist their time like that? Who is running things over there? How long before the grunts say, ďFuck this, Iím going out and enjoying the summerĒ?"

Second, if you don't give a player a colonized planet, they get an automatic game over. What you can do though is give the player an otherwise useless dead asteroid right next to the uncolonizeable planet and then spawn ships in the uncolonizeable planet.\n\nCould you go in more detail, I have mostly only touched abilities and ships, but as long as it is a \"planet\" type with no population.\n\nI have found a solution to the technical problem I had before, but having the spawn their mothership/star base at a planet with inhabitants would kind of go against their ideal/agenda.\n\nSure, in a non team match at least, if you don't have one planet under your control, you automatically lose. Now this planet can be anything from a fully developed Terran to a dead asteroid that has no population or economic benefit, it doesn't matter. You have to have one, so you can't just spawn ships in an uncolonizable gravity well and start a match.\n\nThat was me Harpo and it works fine if implemented as given. I have been tweaking it constantly while playtesting it and it still functions. Many of the forum examples are dated or inciomplete with no clarification of needed changes--get Harpo's map...it's an essential.\n\nI guess that means that it will be for the first player (no mather which race) from your answer and my little past experience of galaxyforge. This means that if you choose to play as any of the other races, then it will give them a disadvantage. Seems like I have to edit their ideals instead of all of the maps :/\n\ngruntmaster if you use a template for the starts, you CAN have similar spawns depending upon the race of the player and not fixed spawns, and read the template of the map I posted a link to and you will see what can be done as in one race gettin a particular cap, and another race getting several frigates with the third race getting different frigates, and if you want you can EVEN spawn most structures(only exception is starbases and envoy cruisers with the standard galaxyforge)\n\nIt's essentially a \"work around\"...the game doesn't allow a lot of things--especially without modding. I am working on a map now trying to balance out the disparate starting conditions but it requires a lot of thought as to world type and placement, jump paths, pirate/militia positions, relative income/tech progression, etc.--basically a boat-load of playtesting required."

Yes - I can manually fly away and get lose faster, but this lame pathfinding is the kind of routine you'd see from a 10th grade programming class.\n\nShip's way is blocked. Try flying away at a slight angle for a couple seconds. Fly forward again. Ship's way is blocked. Try flying away at a slight angle for a couple seconds. Fly forward again. Ship's way is blocked. Try flying away at a slight angle for a couple seconds. Fly forward again. Ship's way is blocked. ... ... ... ARRRRRRGH!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWhy is this braindead routine never replaced with some decent freaking pathfinding AI? Hell, I last programmed in Pascal ten years ago, and I could do better. We may be flying in space, but it's not all empty.\n\nFor me, the biggest problem isn't so much the path finding as much as the ridiculous collision boxes for things like the acceleration gates and asteroids. You can be a couple of km away from any solid object, but still run into their collision box, and weird things happen when collision boxes overlap or intersect (in asteroid belts, mostly).\n\nBut yes, the pathfinding needs some work. Rather than just bouncing into the object repeatedly, the ships need to be able to move an object when they run into it.\n\nAnd hey, I don't expect pathfinding around an object in the way to be as fast as flying free. Obviously being blocked plays an important role in PvP combat. But at least make ships fly slowly (75% reduction in speed when in contact with an object?) around an object in a semi-intelligent fashion, and for bonus points have objects' collision boxes better reflect their model's size (I understand the later would be a larger undertaking, but you could always tackle it model by model, a few at a time in each point upgrade).\n\nYou must have an intern or two you can put to work on this. A better pathfinding routine is hardly ground-breaking code. I know this from my own work, which is why the fantastically bad routine in Eve is so frustratingI so support this. I can't tell you how many times the pathfinder would not be able to get around an asteroid or even get away from it so I could manually do it. Oh whats best is getting stuck in the groves on an acceleration gate while you fleet members are dieing because they're in need of your help\n\nOriginally by:Idami RaptorThe whole collision code is full of related, but less obvious issues^^This.\n\nI'm not so much for a pathfinder as for collision boxes actually fitting their objects properly. Thinking I can fly close and safely pass the object then finding myself having collided with the object even though there is a clear space between it and my ship, is very annoying. Forces me to over compensate when flying past a station or whatever in order to tackle that stupid battleship on the other side.\n\nThis thread is older than 90 days and has been locked due to inactivity."

      "text": "Obviously I get more metal for my energy when I keep the overdrive rate at a constant. Not when energy storage is kept at same levels.\n\nThe idea is to use surplus of energy for overdrive, not all.\n\nAnd you get more metal the more energy is used by overdrive.\n\nCmon... Of course you dont overdrive energy you need, I'm not stupid. But if you overdrive same amount of energy at a constant rate or variably according to storage... Naturally it is better to get the best rate available, if you can plan your economy for that.\n\nQuote:\n\nAnd if Im m stalling it would make sense to not keep unused energy stored for nothing.\n\nIf you stall m you automatically aren't used all your e -> more e available for overdrive. And you probably want to have a reserve for all the things that need e: weapons, d-gun, reclaim etc.[/quote] Maybe I want but at other times i dont. How does the game know what i want...\n\nAfter osme playtesting it kinda seemes like the the amounts of metal mined have been increased somehow. Ive checked the source and the overdrive equation is the same though. Maybe it felt that just because people porced more because they wanted to play with pylons, dunno.\n\nAnyway, I loved this new featue on paper, and at the moment i cant say there are any real issues making it bad, other than forcing people to do a few more clicks. The problem is that CA gameplay doesnt focus on territory control, with most of the economy concentrated in the main base and only defenses and mexes being located outside. After the first few minutes when the borders are decided, the combat revolves mostly about controlling the wreckfields and reclaiming, not controlling the mexes. And the games with few players on large open maps usually dont go beyond basic overdrive level as well, so i cant think of a setup where controlling and maintaining your energy grid and raiding the enemy one would be really important. And since bases are usually concentrated in small spaces, i dont think making factories depend on energy grids would do anything other than force players to do more clicks.\n\nPlus i still dont fully understand how exactly the system works, here's an example, please explain how energy wiill be distributed in the following setup: fusion and 1 mex unconnected to any grids.\n\nThe amount of energy available to a local grid through local energy sources is only used to calculate the maximum amount of energy that can be spent on overdrive for the local metal extractors.\n\nThat is, your 1mex3fus vs 3mex1fus? If the total free energy (due to spending on construction and units) is less than 1/3(fusions) * fusionE * 4(mexes), then the same amount of energy is spent on all of the overdriven mexes. If the total free energy is greater than 1/3 * fusionE * 4, then the 3 mexes located in the 1fus network will hit their cap (1/3 of a fus) and the remaining free E will go to the 4th overdriven mex (the one that has 3 fus on it and thus has an overdrive-cap of 3*FusionE.\n\nAnd of course, the mex outside the grid gets no overdrive, and the fusion outside of the grid can't contribute to the overdrive-cap.\n\nBasically, think of the energy-sources on the network as the energy that is *available* to use for overdrive on the local metal extractors... the energy will still be allocated in the most optimal way, but that availability provides a local upper-limitQuote:\n\nQuote:\n\nIf you stall m you automatically aren't used all your e -> more e available for overdrive. And you probably want to have a reserve for all the things that need e: weapons, d-gun, reclaim etc.\n\nMaybe I want but at other times i dont. How does the game know what i want... mex unconnected to any grids.\n\nFirstly the sum of squared mex output is used to determine the most efficient way to overdrive, I think Evil4Zerggin did the calculus a while ago. Only the overdriven mexes contribute to the sum.\n\nMex squared sum = (10^2 )*4 = 400\n\nexcess energy = 3 fusions - 150 = 150 (Note: I misread and only saw 3 fusions, I cannot be bothered recalculating it all, the only thing the 4th fusion would do is add another 100 to excess energy)\n\neach grid is then looped through. Lets say the 1 mex + 2 fusion is first.\n\nLoop through the mexes in the second grid. ( mexE = excess energy*(metal^2) / Mex squared sum = 150*100/400 = 37.5 energy Overdrive = -1+(1+(37.5*0.2))^0.5 = 1.92 extra metal = 19.1 ) x 3 on the third loop the grid notices that it is trying to spend 112.5 energy (37.5*3) on the mexes in the grid when it only has 100 energy connected. All the previously calculated extra metal does not count towards the overdrive output as the efficiency is wrong (except previously maxed grids as they are unaffected).\n\nI don't think most people can easily grasp the efficiency rates of overdriven mexes. Though the pylon system itself (e available to overdrive any one mex is capped to a max of whatever is connected to it via the grid) is pretty clear.\n\nI really, really agree with Yogs point here. The game is already quite reclaim heavy, and by centralising the economy and re-emphasising mex control, we make it even more reclaim heavy. I dont have so much of a problem with slightly more centralized econ (less landgrab) but on the whole, putting overdrive beyind a pylon means we've lost a lot of metal from non-reclaim sourcesThis is ridiculous. I dont need to have constant e production nor e spending, to keep overdrive rate constant. And it doesnt mean I'd necessarily excess e either.\n\nNo you don't need to. But it's harder and you'll have to stop spending e on other things once e spending increases (and it will) or e production changes. Having a constant overdrive rate is not the optimum.\n\nI still think that even needing E-store is counter-intuitive. You build e-storage to give your E more room to optimize your overdrive, since excessing E still means that E is somewhat wasted (it is spent on overdrive inefficiently). This is non-obvious to the user - most players never build a single E-store.\n\nalways wondering this, overdrive gets less effective at higher rates, correct? so if i have a full e storage, would it blow all the energy instantly, making like +100m for a half second or does it make +50m for 10 seconds, which would mean more m produced in the end? how will this change with the new system? numbers are made up obv.\n\nAlways did. The \"Overdrive\" system involves a logarithmic diminishing-returns function. Now, because it makes diminishing returns (IE overdriving 2E/mex gets you more Metal-per-E than overdriving 4E/mex) it means that you want to avoid spikes in overdrive - keeping overdrive a nice constant low (IE, I have 10 E over 5 seconds... better to spend 2E/second for each of those 5 seconds than to spend no E for 4 seconds and 10E in 1 second) means that the system managing the overdrive must be pretty complex to give the player optimal performance"

      "text": "Milestone 9\n\n\"Hey\", you are thinking to yourself, \"you're only on Milestone 5, why in the world are you starting a thread about Milestone 9????!!!??\"\n\nGood question. Here is the answer. In a roundabout way....\n\nA number of times in the past I've railed against the concept of a Design Doc. The basic reason was that, by it's very nature, it locks you guys out of the development of the game. All the base decisions are made when writing the thing, and it pretty much becomes the bible for development. And that's a concept I hate (the part about you guys not being able to contribute). So, for a long time, we didn't have one. And in actual fact, I think that was a good thing. If I had written a DD right at the start, MD would be a whole different game, and not nearly as good a game, for that matter.\n\nBut let's face it, ultimately I was wrong. It may have been good to have the game in an evolving state for a while, but at some point we needed to lock it down and say \"THIS is going to be the game\". Having a DD was the best thing that ever happened to MD. It keeps me focused. It keeps me from burnng out because there is a clear light at the end of the tunnel (even when we are far from it). It keeps feature creep from happening. It keeps things *moving forward*, and that's important.\n\nBut, it does keep you guys out of the loop. And I still hate that.\n\nWell, here's your chance to get back in The first item in the M9 overview table is \"Technology Data Input\". M9 is all about the research screen. And for that, we need to know what technologies will be there to be researched. And that's where you guys come in. It's not too early to start thinking about this. In fact, we are probably a bit late.\n\nYou are still going to be constrained by the DD. I'm not putting in any systems that are not already listed in the Milestone Overview section, so you can't suggest any technologies that lead to systems that are not already there (although I admit, the overview can be vague, so if you need clarification on anything, do feel free to ask).\n\nThe format is going to be thusly:\n\nThere will be some number of catagories (originally I had planned on 8 of them, but that's not set in stone). In each catagory there will be some number of breakthroughs. Each breakthrough will have some number of advancements. What the exact catagories are I'm going to leave open for the moment until we start to see patterns in the technologies.\n\nThe catagories are just there for organizational purposes. Players don't research a \"catagory\" nor are they a prereq for anything. They are just there to give the player a tool to keep things from getting too overwhelming. Basically you get one research tree per catagory.\n\nBreakthroughs are things players research. They do not give out a toy of any sort (I'll define \"toy\" in a bit). A breakthrough may have another breakthrough as a prereq, but it should not require any advancement to be finished in order to research the breakthrough. Breakthroughs form the backbone of the research tree (the branches). Every breakthrough should, at a minimum, have at least one advancement that it is a prereq for (otherwise, what is the point of the breakthrough?).\n\nAdvancements always have at least one breakthrough as a prereq. They may have more. They may also optionally have other advancements as a prereq. All advancements give out ONE \"toy\" to the player. Advancements are the leaves in the research trees.\n\nResearch is done by the players via research points (determined by your cities, buildings in your cities, and leader skills [and maybe a couple of other misc things]). You can select any breakthrough or advancement to study as long as you have the prereqs for it. Once you have invested enough research points into a particular breakthrough or advancement, your Civ gets that credited, which gives them a new toy (in the case of an advancement) and/or fulfills prereqs for other breakthroughs/advancements.\n\nYou get one (and only one) toy for every advancement you research. Toys fall into a number of catagories, but in general are always something the player can use in some way in the game. They are (if I don't forget any catagories):\n\nResource Type: Gold, Oil, Coal, etc. Causes the appropriate resource stacks to appear on the map and allows the player to begin collecting that resource.\nUnit Template: Tank, Ship, Warrior, etc. Gives the player a blank template which they use to design their units. Each template has a set of characteristics and types of components that fit into that template.\nUnit Component: Machine gun, Diesel Engine, Body Armor, etc. Gives the players items that they can put into their templates when designing new unit types.\nCity Building: Things players put into their cities which modify the city characteristics (may give more research points, or allow building of certian types of units [e.g shipyard], or add to defense [walls, AA batteries], etc).\nLandscape Item: Things you build not within cities that modify the landscape (roads, bridges, dams, oil platforms, bunkers, etc).\nLeader Skill: Allows you to train you leaders with new skills, which in turn modify what they are capable of doing.\nEspionage Mission: Adds new types of espionage missions (sabotage, technology theft, and so on).\n\nI think that's all of them.\n\nNow, a lot of this I will design myself (that is, after all, part of my job), but by all means I'd love to get input from y'all. If you have an idea for a technology, send it in!\n\nWhen thinking about a technology, ask yourself:\n1) Is this a breakthrough or an advancement?\n2) What are it's prereqs?\n3) What sort of toy does it give out? Why? (i.e. does the toy make sense with the given advancement?).\n4) Does it fit within a given catagory? If not, perhaps it is the beginning of a new catagory?\n\nAlright, I'll stop here and let you guys get to thinking about it.\n\nLast edited by RonHiler; 08-26-2008 at 01:08 PM.\n\n\"They laughed when I said I was going to be a comedian ...

I know EVE is kinda that, but I'm talking full-on, Wing Commander type space combat rather than the massively interactive spreadsheet that is EVE.\n\nThe game could have procedurally generated \"go through this jumpgate and kill all the pirates'\" missions that would be a cleverly disguised instance. It could have actual aim-based shooting so that player skill is more important than min-maxing. It could get away from standard classes by letting people outfit their craft however they wanted to based on their play style and ability. Plus, the EVE style economy could be worked in (though I'd recommend toning it down a bit to make it more accessible).\n\nSeriously, every time I think about this game, I am amazed that it hasn't been made yet. I have it all planned out in my head if there is a game company out there who wants to hire me."

Less competition for being first.\n\nCollect your fleet credits, help out a Fleet who needs it, and everyone is happy?\n\nDear DEVs,\nI am starting to get tired of people within my fleet to make themselves an alarm every time just to go online to spend everything they have to obtain the most fleet credits... Is there anything planned towards that?\n\nHere is a tip. Stockpile energy credits like mad. What is currently slowing down progress are the overpriced exchange commons. Regardless about how much people contribute, the price of common items is killing everyone. Since when has a white common duty officer gone on the market for 1,000,000 ec? Its insaneI wholeheartedly agree. As with my fleet, being the leader, I have refrained form constributing too much to allow other fleet members to make their contributions. I routinely try to also team with my fleet members only so that I can help them learn the missions and do them to earn their credits.\n\nIf others stopped being so greedy and trying to be the \"first\" to have a tier1 starbase, the rest of their fleet would be much happier."

      "text": "Basically eve consists of a ****load of ships with tiny issues that means they dont actually see active play. I really dont get what the big problem about adjusting all these subpar ships a tiny bit to boost them to a level where they are able to compete, this doesnt have to be that big even. Reduce mass on one ship, increase base resistances by 5% on another, add a single slot to some of them...\n\nI know people like to think this would open up a huge can of potencial worms. But if CCP actually had the cahoonies to adjust on a patch to patch basis it really shouldnt be impossible to get 70 or 80% of the ships in this game to a level where theyre worth using. And it wouldnt get any worce then it is today, yeah maybe people would stop flying a couple of the current ships in favor of the newly boosted ones but if you can put 10 more ships in to active play by loosing one or two, then really. What are you waiting for?!\n\nWhat the heck are you talking about? Im not saying all ships should be just as good but all ships should be worth using. Having a game where atleast 50% of the ships dont see active play is not a good thing.\n\nOriginally by:ElapidaeGetting rid of the tier system would be a nice start.\n\nThis. The best argument I've heard for not doing this has always been that it would involve changes to build costs for a lot of ships - which would artificially \"create\" a lot of minerals as breachers were refined at the same refine rate as rifters. Then again, I've always said \"I don't care...\".\n\nOriginally by:ElapidaeGetting rid of the tier system would be a nice start.\n\nWord. Give each ship in a class a solid well defined role it is supposed to perform and be damned with 'oh you have x racial ship skill trained to 3 so why bother with anything not tier 3' that is the current way of things. I would provide examples of said ships but I can't be arsed to type for the next half an hour to list them all. I should add that this mostly effects the frigate and cruiser class as the rest all have fairly usable ships in all tier levels.\n\nAll of that + 10m3 bandwidth so it can field a useful number of drones...\n\nmmm 550+ dps at 22km, plus better align time and faster speed...\n\nAlso, IIRC the phantasm is down one slot to the other faction cruisers, so we could gain a low without having to lose a utility high. With 4 turrets, single utility high, 4th low, and shield/PG boost it'd be a real beast.\n\nEvery sansha ship has two utility high slots, and gains an effective turret as it goes up in ship class. As a phantasm pilot myself, I think that's a very nice pattern. What the phantasm really needs, however, is an extra low slot and more speed. I can't even catch up to the battlecruisers in my L3 missions! The nightmare is an unusually agile battleship. Why not the phantasm?!\n\nFrankly in order to make up for the lack of DPS compared to the cynabal we need more than one more damage mod. I wouldn't mind if they just mildly boosted the speed and increased DPS/EHP where it has a clear advantage over the cynabal, but to leave it doing less dps, HALF the speed, and having PG issues to fit the utility highs is just not acceptableWithout insurance you had a point, however in principle every BS (and other) hull has same price, 0 isk. So they got different bonuses, which is all nice and fine. However the higher base amounts of hp (and number of slots) make the higher tier ships often better. In the BS department it isnt that bad, for smaller ships the difference is too large, rendering the tier 1 ships useless.\n\nI dont think insurance changes will be sufficient to correct this, so the difference between tiers need to be decreased or removedBS are fine for the most part. They are fairly well balanced just some minor niggles.\n\nNow if we move down into cruisers and frigates. Here we start to see serious balance issues and strange roles ( mining cruiser thats also a logistics ship....?!?!? ).I cant seriously say that I've ever seen another tech1 logistics cruiser on my overview other than the Osprey, and those mostly only for POS repair. Honestly if you want to be usefull in tech 1 cruisers there are only 1-2 ships to choose from per race.\n\nTake the Bellicose, its almost decent, but just lacks the wow factor compared to the rupture. It has issues when you try to fill in the high slots with low fitting cost weapons and kitting it out with something that lets you survive 10 more seconds in a fight. It also lacks the apparent usefulness that the other E-WAR forms haveLook at smaller ships then: the battlecruisers are obvious, but in cruisers and frigates it becomes even stronger.\n\n andThe tier system matters a lot at every level below battleship. Its effects can even be felt at the battleship level though. When was the last time you bought a Slasher to PVP in? A Condor? Executioner? Breacher? Yeah, those ships artificially suck because of the tier systemThis sounds like an idea that could work.\n\nThis thread is older than 90 days and has been locked due to inactivity."

He also loved to cross that line with jokes that made people uncomfortable. Like once he went on a hiking trip with a couple of friends and a larger group of people that he didn't know. He broke out the dead baby jokes the first night because he just delighted in discomfort. He told these jokes at work in the army and everybody laughed, including one guy who was a little, um, dull. This guy couldn't actually remember the jokes but thought they were funny, and one time on break he was like \"Hey, tell those dead baby jokes, they're funny.\" The problem was that a guy standing behind him had just come back from the worst time in his life. His family had gone on vacation to a condo and their toddler crawled out of the doggie door and drowned in the pool. The poor guy walked away silently instead of pounding the dullard into paste.

Once you've bought what you want check out other star systems in range that don't produce the thing you just bought. Fly there, sell the goods, buy more goods and repeat. I trade alot when just moving around the different systems, e.g. if I need to get to a new system to forward the plot or get an artifact I will buy and sell along the way.

Hyperspace there and then save the game straight away. Fly to the station and try to avoid police, if they bust you just load your save and try again. A cargo jammer can save you're bacon but they don't become effective till later levels.

In which Cryptic could add various hiding spots for Federation ships that could hide a player (such as \"behind the moon\", \"above the magnetic pole\", nebulas, or asteroids fields.\n\nFree Rank Open PvP: Where any rank can PvP, but players are still either Federation or Klingon. So a Negh'var can go pick on a Miranda or a 2 B'rels going toe to toe with an Excelsior. (Zone would be limited to a population cap of 10).\n\nTerritorial PvP (Space): Simlar to Capture and Hold, but on a greater scale.\n\nWhere territory is controlled by capturing points. Where each point is at equal distances on the far corners of the map. And to capture the point, you have to beam on board the station and accomplish certain tasks to gain control. So PvP can take place in Space or on the station.\n\nPopulation limits set to either 10 or 20, to ensure strategy.\n\nStation Defenders can have access to base defenses to delay attackers.\n\nTerritorial PvP (Planetary):\n\nSpace Zones are Open PvP of unlimited population and open to all ranks with various hiding spots in orbit.\n\nPlayers can beam down, to safe locations to respective bases. Then they can gear up and then proceed to their choice of battlefields. For instance:\n\nTo the North can be a Swamp Battlefield.\nTo the South can be a Mountainous Battlefield.\n\nAnd players must make their way to the center (between the two bases), in which players fight over control over a central base, NPC village, or Ruins. Where whomever wins, can gain control of the planet.\n\nPvEvP - Battle for the Loot: Similar to the above, instead of gaining control of a world, players battle for rights to access to a PvE dungeon, where you go to battle a Boss-level opponent for the chance to acqure a rare unique drop.\n\nPvEvP - Antagonists: Where two players on opposite sides are sent on a PvE mission (can be storyline driven), where they act as each other's antagonist.\n\nFor instance a Federation player might be tasked to escort a Freighter to X, while a Klingon player has to either board or destroy that frieghter."

I'd prefer it that way because it gives you something definite. Offroading always sucks at the same level so I don't have to reevalute the situation with every new tech I get. I won't have to check my enemies techs every other turn to see if starlanes still act as choke points or if they are more or less worthless already. The main idea behind starlanes was to create some sort of \"terrain\", do we want to remove that in mid- to late game?We went over the fact that starlanes would be permanent in the very early days of freeorion...i think mainly because we wanted to give terrain and shape to the galaxy. Think of starlanes as like mountains and deserts in Civ, they're always there, so live with it. (note I said \"Civ\" and not Civ 2 or 3....you can change terrain in those versions a la engineers and workers)If starlanes connect only neighbouring stars, that would considerably decrease their importance as terrain, since it is easier to go to neighbouring stars anyway. I think both the length of starlanes should be bell-curved.\n\nMaybe also the number of starlanes per system - this way it would both be easier on the AI maybe? What do the AI guys think?

MOO3 has a similar option where you specify starlane length and the number of them.\n\nNightFish wrote:\n\nIs the number of Starlanes per system completely random, meaning that a system with only one starlane can occur everywhere and not just in the outer rim?\n\nIf you can think of any other things we need to know about starlanes, feel free to add them.\n\nI think the answer to this depends on your first question. If we have starlanes only connecting close planets, then one would assume that you'd have only outer rim systems with one starlane. If they're fairly random, then I don't see why we couldn't have \"dead end\" systems in the core. I personally favor this second idea.\n\nWe definitely should limit the maximum length of a starlane, though.

I thought this was too much work to see exactly the geography of the galaxy and I'm glad we decided to go with 2D for FO.\n\nAbout the A to B, whilst intersecting C.......good question. Here are some thoughts:\n\n- We can simply not allow this to happen during universe creation. We do a check to ensure that each starlane intersects with two and only two systems.\n\n- We represent said starlanes as beziers, and curve them around the systems in question (not recommdended)\n\n- We can represent these starlanes as a line that darkens or lightens based on how close it is to the intersected planet.

Shift+click to open a new window. Drag that new window somewhere else and pin it. It will remember the window was pinned there and always open it for you in station.\n\nNeither pinned or unpinned do the newly created windows stay in placeHaha I think Torshin has become unable to cope with Kesper North having beat him to the punch on this thread.

I also remember when people were super ultra mega mad over the new font which no now even remembers was changed until I mention it.\n\nI was neutral, tending towards positive, about the new inventory on Sisi, because there was a pretty nice degree of customization possible so you could set it up to basically be the old inventory system. The isk value, new sorting options (meta level sorting is joyous), etc. are all fairly nice.\n\nWhen they put it on TQ they'd stripped out the ability to customize your setup, forced everything back to default every time you session-changed for what little you could customize, and then I noticed that corp hangar no longer allows tabbed browsing between all the individual hangars. Also, open any inventory inside a deathstar POS and grab a snickers, because you're going to be there for awhile.\n\nThe trailer itself didn't live out to my expectations. I'm extremely unhappy with this new theme they picked for the trailers starting with Crucible. I miss Dominion/Tyrannis style, those were very good and inspiring. New ones don't capture the feeling the old ones didCompletely agree with not being able to see them. Made a post about it but people are dumb.\n\nI just logged in last night for the first time in almost a week (too busy getting neck-deep in your mom v0v) and noticed three things, 1) I'm rich for some reason 2) the INFERNO banner no longer pops up on top of my windows when I hit 'Play' in the client so that's neat, and 3) new KMs look pretty cool, no complaints there.\n\nfuck the new inventory system and the myriad annoyances that it's created...if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n\nthat is all.\n\nChances are they needed to rewrite how the game handles inventory stuff anyway, they're on a huge \"get rid of tarballs\" high right now. But that said they did get plenty of feedback beforehand that they were about to deliver a massive turd but they went ahead and did it anyway because they are CCP.\n\nChances are they needed to rewrite how the game handles inventory stuff anyway, they're on a huge \"get rid of tarballs\" high right now front end is usually easy to modify and is what we all see. The back end is what I think jimmy is talking about, which probably did need a rewrite. In the end, they'll need to modify it and it will likely have to do with lowering the amount of queries or query size"

They will usually swoop in, drop the TALDS, (DUCKS AWAY!!) circle back and re-engage. While there has been a lot of controversy on the effectiveness of TALD, the net result was that AI SEAD flights took a long time to get the job done, even if they finally did it, so it was ineffective to \"REQUEST WEASELS\" when pretty much over the target, or have a SEAD Flight alongside when you enter the target area and expect much assistance (or have a SEAD and TALD armed element in your flight given an \"ATTACK AIR DEFENSES\" Command as you reach the target area) Far better to have the SEAD flight precede the STRIKE by some time...(or give the element ATTACK AIR DEFENSES while the STRIKE ELEMENT circles back) as has been covered, but then you run the risk of SAM/AAA that were missed by the SEAD folks being awake and alert when the STRIKE flight came sauntering in.\n\nI don't believe so. The custom loadouts for Player aircraft don't appear in the Dropdowns in the Mission Builder.

In this scenario, picking off the weaker opponents while utilizing powers on the Commanders is an effective strategy.\n\nIn close quarters combat they are capable of causing higher amounts of damage which can be problematic if they still have shields.

I figure there should be an influx of noobs like me with Incarna so hopefully I won't stick out quite so much.\n\nI sort of picked my character at random and finished the first basic tutorial area, pretty straight forward. I'm supposed to head of now to meet a few more agents with more specific tutorials, which is good because I have no idea yet what I want to do in the game. I love Sci Fi and I'm hoping to just sorta soak up the environment for a while, maybe shoot some bad guys or haul some goods.\n\nAny general advice for a casual noob? Do all the tutorials and early missions, maybe join Eve UniversityYou can have them all on the same email account. You can even send the \"buddy invite\" to the same email. I have done it. They do not care as long as they get there money.\n\nDecided to log in and check out this new stuff. CQ is kinda nifty, though I turned it off because it's far easier to use ye olde interface plus that way it doesn't sit and load it.\n:edit: Also, I was disappointed when you couldn't climb into that pod at your balcony.\n\nNew turrets are pretty boss, makes shit feel more dynamic. That said, did I accidentally poke the wrong button, or did CCP accidentally delete the visual effect you get while warping?\n\nMost people that run wormholes do all the scanning themselves, and if it leads to anything good that people are living inside of, you can expect the residents to be shutting down the exit asap once they've done any hauling for the day.I would sale off the crap you don't ever use then ship only the stuff for your fits and some spares of things like cap rechargers and what not. if you don't mind repackaging it really is not that bad to ship stuff out there. Even not repacked it is not that bad. There are enough JF services making jita runs that you can normally get what you need within a day. Plus the market is really hit or miss for stuff you might need out there.\nDon't forget corp mates are also handy if you need something immediatelyMy suggestion: Leave one or the other ship so that if shit goes tits-up/you unsub for a few months and we move across the universe again, you have more than just your wallet in terms of accessable assets. JF/sell the rest.\n\nSo if I've got a pile of crap in empire, how much of it, if any, would be worth attemptingThat's what I did, outside of some random crap not worth selling. I highly suggest doing soWe will not and cannot focus on virtual sales only within the Incarna environment, nor build that environment around such sales; rather, we will effect a universal strategy of micro-sales throughout the EVE experience.\n\nOn the opposite end of the scale to vanity goods are performance* based items such as weapons. They are consumed through gameplay, making them a potentially powerful source of renewable income. Selling them for real money is very tempting. They are highly desired by the player audience and yield lower development costs, as variation can be achieved through numbers rather than unique art assets. Selling them though, is highly controversial. We are planning on doing so. I would be tempted to say it is because we are fearless, but the real reason is that we have strong evidence that selling performance enhancers, in moderation, works.\n\n\"Cosmetics are the easiest form of virtual goods sales to discuss, but they're not the only ones. Items that improve the player character's capabilities are some of the most effective at converting free or trial players into paying ones. According to Jon Selin, Lead Designer on\nWorld of Darkness, metrics from other games that sell virtual goods indicate that overall enjoyment increases\"\n\nThat's why the Captain's Quarters is being forced on everyone. To encourage MT.\n\nIn Eve, you can save the fitting configuration for any given ship you have so that you can fit out another one without dragging all the modules in one at a time\n\nNot to detract from the WTF CCP??? line of thought, but how does one do this? I'm annoyed that it takes me several minutes to fit new ships and had no idea this was possible. Also, having played the game off and on for 4 years, I also feel kind dumb not know how do to this (or that it was possible)."

Found an example:  ... 9,r:15,s:0 Here the right one is the mesh, on which you apply the textures to change how that character look.

You make a bunch of fake ships to distract your attackers. From a role-playing perspective you're simply confusing your foes sensors to make it seem like they're being attacked by multiple ships. It's saved my life more then once.\n\nIf I'm to understand correctly, Photonic Fleet is actually a result of combining the holographic emitters that now line almost every corrider of starships now, and the sensor arrays of the ship. In essence, turning the exterior of the ship into one big holo-emitter. It's not that you're confusing enemy ships; they're still taking damage when the photonic ships fire on them. They're very \"real\" holograms, but with the safety's off. And a phaser beam is still nothing but particles of light and heat, so rather easy for even a \"fake\" phaser to be very deadly, lol.\n\nI like Cosmic_One's explanation. I have to admit, I've always found the idea of sentient holograms kinda stupid. (Red Dwarf'sd Rimmer is the only one I can take with a grain of salt) Why bother building ships when you can just send a fleet of holograms?\n\nLike most hologram stuff in ST, it's quite silly when you think about it (phasers I can almost understand, but how do holographic torpedoes work?) but its a useful skill. They do decent enough damage, especially if you're lucky enough to summon multiple escorts.\n\nIHah, that's my problem with this ability as well.\n\nMatter of taste, obviously.

It should also make negotiations smoother, when the knowledge of the exact length of the contract is known beforehand.\n\nSo, yes, they're aware of this potential exploit, but it isn't a significant enough up-front issue to delay the launch. What you're describing is an edge case which they're planning on fixing, but isn't a wide-spread enough problem for them to put off everything else and delay the launch for it.

Training and good equipment will make any man worth so much more. The more your troops survive the more experience they carry on with them, and can impart to others. So in essence I've always felt armies like Cadians or whatever were... short sighted, and lacking personality. Not to say I don't like the list, dont get me wrong.\n\nThat were Elysian come in. High tech elite soldiers with air power. I can no longer wait for FW to do their thing, because they are company first and not hobbyist second, they are out to make money. Plus whatever they put out new, still dont think they'd match my idea of what elysian are like. Like jet packs, why aren't their jetpacks in their friggin army list? (I would go as far as to say why are there even jet packs general rule, when only tau have the rules, but whatever). Jetpacks just seem like a no brainer to me for elysians. plus, why would they have commissars?! they are elite after all, and shooting your own elite soldiers that you've spent a lot of money to train it just... stupid! counterproductive!\n\nEven more so, none of the current list shout 'elite' to me. Especially the Taros Campaign. Looked more like cut and paste job to me. The D99 regiment get closer but the point cost is RIDICULOUS for these guys, hence no one uses them (often, cant say always).\n\nSo I want to make my own. I need your help though, I only got fluff from the imperial army books. is there more out there? don't care if its fan fluff either i can throw that in as well.\n\nHere's the general idea of what I am going do for the army list, which i want to flesh out. Help me refine it, maybe suggest units I should add, what I should take away, or what should be replace with a more rational unit."

They will turn, exposing their backside and then turn AGAIN when they get to the position.\n\nThen that's a pretty big weakness for vehicles that already aren't very durable. Other races' armor can back up from close combat troops while still firing - if their speed/maneuverability was upped to compensate it would make sense, but that doesn't seem to be the case."

That Babyknight vs Dimaga game had zero excitement and it was due to the unit composition with its ton of free units (and Fungal Growth) being unbeatable by the standard Protoss army. Swarm Host (and Broodlord) = zero micro = zero excitement. At least in WoL you had to use your Zergling / Roach support units in the correct way and micro a bit back and forth, but Swarm Host just produces free units you can lose without that being a problem.

      "text": "quick question for you guys. First off, no I'm not into the tribble thing and have been offing the little buggers as fast as I pick them up.\n\nbut\n\nWell, I've started doing the Borg stuff so I went ahead and snagged my assimilated tribble thinking that any little bit helps.\n\nWell, with no food (and considering that he's been assimilated, was kind of hoping the thing had been neutered).Cargo space is always as a premium.\n\nSome Tribbles heal, some give regen buffs, some give damage buffs, some give damage resistance buffs. Some even give you multiple types of buffs at the same time. You can give them to your BOff's, where they will use them and get the appropriate buff from the appropriate tribble.\n\nI refer you to this flowchart found in this thread. It should outline how to get the specific Tribble you want. Your assimilated Tribble apparently behaves the same way as the \"Rivera\" Tribble in the middle of this chart for the purposes of breeding.\n\nthe discard button actually\na) if you are in space, it depending on preferences of captain\n1. neuters them and lets them roll around the many corridors of a ship rather than taking space in the cargo bay like a hampster in a ball happily\n2. puts them into longterm buffer thing storage (we know that tribbles do not take anywhere near as much room in buffers as other creatures because in the Tribble With Klingons mission you beam up several million (to quote Doctor Jones) tribbles at once) for the next time you visit a station. When you visit a station you will find the tribbles you discarded in the \"tribble adoption centre\" room which looks a bit like a children's ball pool lol\n\nb) if you are on ground, releases the tribble which then rolls off slowly in the direction of the station adoption centre (all stations have one since there are so many tribbles and starfleet considers it inhumane to kill them just because there are lots in the same way you wouldn't genocide planets) lured by the smell of food (they are only actually given the food when they are neutered tho it's put behind a grill so tribbles can smell it from anywhere in the station with their food senses tho sometimes they get lost and you see them hiding behind consoles on the floor in the bank room etc).. they haven't put in the animation for releasing tribbles yet but I'm imagining it probably will look a bit like a combination of the \"pet tribble\" animation and the animation when you \"crouch to scan mission objective\" objects (you remain standing for scanning anomalies), crouch down, stroke them a last time and let go to roll off\n\nThe ones that breed directly off of a Borg tribble are worth more than the basic tribbles, and have higher buffs as well. Higher resistance/damage/regen when you're in ground combat is worth the slot for the higher tier tribbles. If you don't want to keep them yourself, onsider donating them to fleet mates, or selling them on the Exchange. You can make some decent money from selling Stacy, Howe, Deangelo, and Cavallaro, all of which breed directly from Borg. You won't get rich off of it, but it never hurts to have some extra spending money."

(would look supreme)\n\nYou can make some nice perpetual motion gags with it, but that's it. The impact system only functions with fighters.\n\nYou can fake it, but it will be highly sensitive to system performance. Anyone with a chugging cpu will never see it go off right. Set up two periodics from target ships, one pulling ships from the surrounding area, one setting a kill order on a very small area, close enough that they will be touching when it triggers.\n\nDo a bounce back to the last spawner(ApplyBuffToLastSpawnerNoFilterNoRange) from the kill order and set a delayed explosion there as well. They'll get sucked in, trigger them self destruct, set the target to blow, and poof. Set your delay up right and it should look ok.arhhh!!! is there any way to make the buffs instant... delaytime 0.000000 doesn't seem to cut it... it's like the the entire game engine is running in cycles of seconds... is the any way to make buffs react every 100th of a sec??\n\nplease help, cause the ships bump into eachother like they are supposed to, but some of them doesn't blow till way afterApplyImpulseFromSpawner is another force application like magnetize. It's applying force over time(the definition of impulse when one isn't having an apocalyptic brain fart) so the mass of the object is going to alter how fast it moves. Each ship has it's own mass value.\n\nSee Telekinetic Push for the vanilla implementation of the function, the one that blows away fighters.\n\nThe predictably consistent one is InitializeMovementTowardLastSpawner, BuffRepulsionFieldTarget is an example of this one. All ships will move at the same rate, something you're in dire need of in order to time their explosion.\n\nThe problem with things being delayed using the OnDelay trigger is that you're not accounting for the game design. Each tier triggers independently. Your buff reference inside another buff is triggered at a different time, it has a delayed effect. To have things coincide, they have to be on the same level. For two separate files to enact simultaneously, you would trigger them from the same parent. Getting them to enact at the same time as their parent is simply impossible.\n\nBecause if this, you're always going to have a delay on child actions. So, you have to time it. You have to apply and set off the explosions at the correct ranges to get them to line up, and it's going to be hellishly fun. As soon as you run it on a slower(or faster if yours is inadequate for maximum performance) computer, it's going to be wrong again. There's no good substitution for magnetize with it's impact code.\n\nIf you want an example of buffs with tolerances, download the SOA2 mod and peek at my work. The Jem'Hadar specific buffs on Dominion capital ships, a lot of the Borg abilities, I have lots of interconnected systems that alter or prevent usage entirely. The tolerance is how wide the delay time has to be on things for them to actually interrupt in the appropriate conditions. Too short, and your ships magically receive gifts they weren't supposed to get, mysteriously blow up, switch sides, all kinds of wonderful stuff that isn't intended.\n\nIf I weren't on a stone age computer my curiosity to see it work would have it done already, but alas I can't get something like this to function locally. It was hell just getting fighters to self magnetize for the Borg.\n\nIt has a movement speed, you can weapon effect it as well. Things like the ion blast and whatnot are all travel. Applications without travel are instant, where instant equals when your computer gets around to it.\n\nYou have to use one with travel for bouncing something back off your target because it's the only one there.\n\nIt shouldn't be demanding, it's just that timing doesn't work out real well on say.. a 3.0ghz Pentium 4. There's too much lag in processing actions. If you're applying a buff and blowing a ship up with it in a tenth of a second, it's just not going to happen that fast on lower end machines. They could be blowing half a second late, or missing the application entirely."

      "text": "Have you tried the second edition of the game? It plays much faster than the original and there's no annoying 15 minute set up. I'd recommend giving it a go. A starter and a few boosters are all you need to make a competative deck.\n\nI used to play several CCG's. Start Trek, Star Wars (I have Darth Vader's SSD, though I can't remember it's name. I refused to let my friend talk me into trading him that one), Magic: The Gathering, and (of course) MechWarrior.\n\nHowever, it has been several years since I played any of them, and I'm not sure I really remember how to anymore. Was the card you showed the link to from the 2nd edition ST:CCG? If so, then that's what I played, since the card layout looks exactly like what I hadthe Tech is the same but the use is diffrent in Star trek the use their main MAM reactors to create a similer KF field but inb BT they use solar sales for this (as it is lees demanding then using 100;s of tons of fuel fore a single jump) the sip in the card uses the sail as a Staionary collector that does not use all the power is collects\n\nI don't think the technology is the same. Mainly because the Star Trek warp drive enables a ship to actually travel at speeds faster than light, whereas the K-F drive in BattleTech basically brings two points in space together and the ship passes directly from one point to another.\n\nWhat I was referring to being similar was the uses for the sail. Both in Star Trek and BattleTech, the ships use the sail for the same purpose, to collect energy (albeit collecting different kinds of energyNo matter which way the idea is used Both drive use the same principles. <b>bend two points between space through the use of a hyperspace tunnel(wormhole)</b> the difference is the Starships in Star Track can go for a virtually unlimited distance and time because of the power plant they use. In battle tech the Jumps are limited to five minutes and take almost a week to charge and they are limited to 30 Light years. In relation to what I have said before Because of this M/AM reactor in Star track they do not need to use a Solar sail for FTl travel like in Battle tech that ship on the card is a power plant for other ships to use\n\nas for FTL: velocity is relative from one point to another in a certain amount of time Ftl is defined by a greater relative distance/ time than 300,000m/s a 30 light year jump in five minutes or 4 light years in a few minutes(here to nearest star) is over this lmit science no object can travel faster than light there must be a use of hyper space with this 30 light years can be turned into an actual distance of a few atomic diameters\n\nThat's never been dealt with in the series. I suspect it would be considerably less troublesome than a ship actually impacting a planet at x times the speed of light, but everyone aboard would probably still be killed, and the planet would be pretty thrashed, too dunno if E=MC2 is applicable here, but something hitting a planet at the speed of light is indeed going to do major damage. So a warp shuttle becomes a potenital planet buster, unless they come up with some explanation that Warp is pseudo velocity and an impact would cause minimal damage.\n\nActually, the reason why noone warps in too close to planets is because the warp drive tends to have rather nasty accidents if it is engaged within a gravity well.\n\nIIRC, the initial warp drive concept was nearly canned when they tried to test-fire it on the moon and it ended up vaporizing a small section of it. Or something like that. Or maybe I'm thinking of a different sci-fi universe. God, I can't keep these things straight"

      "text": "Like Warp, Overload is one of those powers that you almost want to have access to do during any mission. Overload is very effective at taking down shields, which most enemies have on the higher difficulties, but you'll still be seeing tons of shielded enemies even on casual. In addition to taking down shields, it is also deals heavy damage to synthetic enemies. While Overload is great, it is dwarfed by Tali's unique power in Mass Effect 2; Energy Drain. Energy Drain does exactly the same thing as Overload, except in addition to taking down enemy shields, it refills the user's shields. What this basically amounts to is stealing the enemy's shields. Shepard can gain this ability through advanced training, which I always do for my tech characters, given that it is the ultimate version of overload.\n\n4. Stasis (Biotic)\n\nIn both Mass Effect 1 and 2, Stasis sucked. All it did was freeze an enemy in place, preventing it from attacking and regaining health or shields. This seems useful, it had just one fatal flaw; enemies in stasis were immune to damage. What this meant is that stasis was maybe useful to give you a chance to heal up and recharge your shield while a difficult enemy was rendered momentarily inert, but other than that, it was pointless. However, playing as Asari Adept in the multiplayer demo, I learned to love the new stasis. It does the same thing as before, except now enemies can take damage while in stasis. You can even level it up to create a stasis bubble which holds multiple enemies in stasis while you and your teammates shoot at them. In addition, you can even generate biotic detonations by using certain powers on enemies held in stasis. Stasis has gone from one of the most useless powers to one of the most powerful, and I finally feel like I have a reason to put points into it.\n\n3. Singularity (Biotic, Adept)\n\nSingularity can produce some pretty crazy situations, and I often find myself laughing at the situations it creates. Singularity creates a ball of biotic energy, complete with its own gravitation pull. Enemies caught in the vicinity are pulled toward it, and end up weightless, basically orbiting the singularity. While it is hilarious to see enemies floating around the singularity, it really gets interesting when you combine it with other powers. Hit floating enemies with throw and they go flying off into the distance, hit them with warp and they explode in a biotic detonation, damaging any enemies caught in the singularity and sending everyone else flying in every direction. You can even just shoot them down, hit the group with a grenade or heavy weapon, or just watch as they eventually just fall to the ground.\n\n2. Tactical Cloak (Tech, Infiltrator)\n\nThe Tactical Cloak is the infiltrator's unique class ability in Mass Effect 2 and 3. Like the name suggests, it gives you temporary invisibility. The works perfectly with sniper rifles, which is the infiltrator's main weapon. The cloak allows to sneak around undetected, but is most effect in giving you those precious seconds to line up a headshot with your sniper rifle. What makes the Tactical Cloak even more effective is the damage bonus it provides. If break the cloak by firing, as opposed to letting it run out, you gain a massive boost to damage for the shot that broke the cloak. What this means basically is: Tactical Cloak + Sniper Rifle + Headshot = most enemies die from one shot. This, combined with the infiltrators time dilation ability (when scoped), makes the infiltrator one of the most powerful classes, especially on higher difficulties.\n\n1. Biotic Charge (Biotic, Vanguard)\n\nBiotic charge is simultaneously the most fun, difficult, rewarding, and risky power to use. The Biotic Charge is the Vanguard's class specific power, and can be a powerful tool in the right hands, or instant death in the wrong hands. The Biotic Charge allows to to instantaneously teleport to any enemy you can target. When you reach your destination, the enemy will be knocked back with extreme force, leaving them vulnerable to a melee attack or shotgun blast. The charge also fills recharges your barrier, making it a great tool for defense as well as offense. The biotic charge gives you great mobility, allowing you move effortlessly around the battlefield. This comes with a risk though, as unrestrained charging can very quickly put you in a bad situations, far from your teammates. If you use it intelligently, the Biotic Charge can be the most power to use, but it requires careful consideration to avoid being overwhelmed."

It's a pity I couldn't send you one of them. If you want to try a compatible ship, this website has them in the . Xsp format: blackpanthergroup. It's a German site I think, with loads of ships. I've downloaded most of them! Sorry it's not a direct link, I'm on my IPhone.\n\nOMG you have a Vulcan Ship!!!!! I am really surprised that the Star Trek Mod doesn't have a mini mod where its from the Enterprise Series, and you have the Enterprise, alond with all the Vulcan ships and Andorians!\n\nI have a 7th Race in now. Been testing all day with no problems or mini dumps. Loaded bailknights mod and the total effects mod with it. My question is at the player set up I can still only choose 6 player pictures. What do I have to do so I can see all 7 races?You don't need to add texture files to brush.manifest or any other manifest. In order to change hud icons and the like you need to make (or edit) one of the brushes files under Window like Picture-Planet.brushes for example. Then you edit the ship entity HUDIcon (forget exact spelling) line so it calls the icon, like PICTURE_FRIGATE_SHIP."

Why can they shoot us through the node when we are on the opposite side? That gets very frustrating.

      "text": "Gratuitous Space Battles right now is probably best thought of as a very complex, expanded and pretty versions of the space battle segments of a 4X game.\n\nIn other words, these are just battles, fought out between similar fleets with similar objectives, in the same way. It's kind of like chess. In chess, the map never changes, the pieces are set in stone.\n\nIt takes a loooong time to perfectly design and balance the 'sandbox' that allows games like this to remain fun over a long period, nd its definitely my aim to get to that point. Howver, I'd also like to introduce a lot more variety and options to keep things interesting. I can always describe more ideas than I have time to implement but here are a few:\n\n1) More unlocks, and modules in general. Although I sympathise with those people who dislike the whole unlock concept, I think there is some good middle ground. People who are very good at the game have lots of spare honor, and as long as there is nothing too game-brekaing, I think some extra, expensive modules might be a good idea\n\n2) Scenario variety. Right now the 'terrain' options are quite limited. They aren't really major in terms of changing tactics (25% range reduction isn't really earth-shattering), and there are many more possibilities. Maybe a nebula where plasma weapons just do not work? or one where radiation levels mean that no fighters can survive?\n\n3) Modding. There has been little in the way of formal mod support so far. I have some very primitive tools, instructions and general information on how to do stuff like add ship hulls. I should write this up and make it available.\n\nThat's what I'm currently thinking of, and hope to add to the game. So if you think the missions are a bit samey and the ship design options too limited, this will change. If people have similar suggestions, please throw them out there. I love hearing peoples ideas.\n\nLooks like the game was updated to version 1.10 today. Great work on the updates Cliff.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\n1) Unlocks are great for the SP game, but I don't thinks so for MP. IMHO there should never be any unlockable modules that are simply superior to locked ones. Each module should be balanced. Ex. there should not be a Shield Generator IV that you can unlock that is in every way better than Shield Generator I. Sure Shield Generator IV should offer better protection than Shield Generator I, but this should come at the expense of a much higher… expense and much higher power reqs and higher weight, etc. If this isn't the case, it nullifies the point of having so many modules, and it also makes MP less interesting , because everyone will just use the top-end unlockable stuff, and forget about the earlier stuff.\n\n2) For sure, sounds good . My two cents: I love random elements in game, so what about throwing one into in the map? For ex., a map in an asteroid belt — once per game a big asteroid flies through the map, wrecking ships in it's [randomized] path. 'nother idea: You can go super old-school (or ancient school as the case me be) like SpaceWar! and have an object in the middle of the map that affects gravity and introduces possible strategies, such as the object collects missiles (from a gravity well) or something.\n\n3) This game would be a wonderful game to mod with. If people could upload there races and hull designs… oh man it would be great.\n\nMy random idea of the day:\n\nI think starship speed doesn't play enough importance ATM. As far as I can tell, there is hardly any disadvantage of ignoring engines, or not giving your ship fast engines. You can just wait for the enemy to come to you. I'm not sure if it is factored in already, but perhaps you should subtract damage done by beam weapons against the speed of the larger craft ; the faster the ship, the greater the beam defense. I.e a speed of 2.0 equates to a %20 reduction to beam damage.\n\nOr even a cooler and more fun idea on the same page: A Super-Death Ray weapon. ( — No , no hear me out.) The Super-Death Ray beam takes 2 or 3 minutes to charge. When it fires, it completely wrecks ships. It also takes a great deal of power to charge. This weapon is cool because a:) it would just be tons of fun, ; but more importantly b:) it acts as a counter strategy to people (like myself!) who have turtle slow ships (because you'd have to be able to shoot the Super-Death Ray ship down in 2 mins or less, or you'd get fried.)\n\nOh sry bbot I didn't read your comment first. Ya I was thinking pretty much the same thing, in regards to an planetoid or other object right in the middle of the map. I think it would be too much work for Cliff to have gravity affecting everything, but maybe just missiles.\n\nI am not sure that gravity object is good, unless we have more control on where ships should go. I would require Cliff to code a fair bit of new AI and orders (how far an object is allowed to come close to an object).\nHowever I could see there some good opportunities for strategies and use of engines (to counter gravity if moving closer to gravity object).\nAn other type of object with impact changing in proportion to distance could be a sun : it light could damage ships getting very close, add power to ships with solar panels,…\n\nBut from the present state of the game, and knowing that cliff is alone we should take the best of the existing engine. The idea to have special effects on the whole map is probably best (no need to have heavily update the IA). So what could special effects be ?\n- Altered potential for a specific weapon (reduced or increased)\n- Altered effect of a weapon (plasma when fired explodes straight away, or creates ECM)\n- Energy leeched by nebula\n- ECM effect on ships with inadequate equipment\n- Countinuous damage (countered by shield or armor). Could be caused by small particles (inpact increased when moving very quick), or radiation (speed won't change anything)…\n\nThis would give opportunity to increase the range of modules. Or refine those already existing…\n\nI would also like to see siege weapons (aka Super-Death Ray Beam) included.\n\nCreate a new class of ship, say Jugernaught or Leviathan (something that sounds impressive). It still uses cruiser class weapons but on the hull you have one or two slots that are in the shape of an octagon. . . that is your siege weapon slot.\n\nIncrease the size of the turret so you can see visually that the ship is packing heat. Keep the tracking values low so it can't hit faster ships like fighters or frigates and add some extra animation effects for the gratuitous nature that is the game. (i.e. light particles gather at the muzzle of the turret before it fires :)\n\nYes, everyone wants more stuff but that's not always feasable especially for an indie developer so maybe you should leave stuff for add on packs and later versions.\n\n****\n\nAside from that the biggest thing that I, personally, would like to see is race specific scenarios.\nUnless I've missed it, you go through the same scenarios for all races?\n\nUnlocking specific scenario sets for each race would definitely add to the fun.\nAllow the player to play on them with other unlocked races to by all means but only unlock them once you've unlocked each race.\n\nDifferent scenario modifiers is nice to have too but not essential.\n\n****\n\nMore weapon and unlock variety is a nice to have but actually I would actually say increase the price of the current unlocks by a factor of 3 to 5.\nI'd unlocked almost everything before I even reached my second race.\n\n****\n\nDarkstar's death star siege weapon (above) sounds very cool but would require a lot of balancing at this stage so I would suggest you leave anything that breaks all the hard work you've done with balancing until post-release.\n\n****\n\n@random, it's currently pc-only but if it follows cliffski's other releases he'll be porting to mac once the game's released\n\n[Excuse my English]\nDiversity in the mission's \"objective\" would be nice to add interest to the single player.\n\nSome of the thing we see in \"classical\" str could probably work well in GSB.\nEscort mission, Mission requiring to resist to a really powerfull fleet for a set time, \"boss fight\" ( mission where you have to destroy a unique powerfull ship/station Death Star's style )…\n\nIf you add a few basic objective and mix them with special terrain it could open a lot of diversity opportunity.\n[/Excuse my English]\n\nPut in AI-controlled ships that try to pass by the enemies side and make the goal having the player try to protect the ship as it moves through.\n\nHave the AI controlled ship be the commander ship, while you are a lower general and are tasked with defeating the enemy, while keeping damage to the mothership to a minimum.\n\nHave a non moving enemy space station and give the player the goal to destroy it within a certain amount of time.\n\nHow about location specific events directly on the map, e.g. a local asteroid belt that limits the effectiveness and speed of heavy ships, but fighters shine in there. Also capital ships shooting through the asteroid belt have a higher chance of missing.\nOr a local nebula that hinders small ship sensor systems and renders invisibility shields ineffective due to you being able to see the pushed away nebula front.\n\nAlso if I finish on expert, the hard-difficulty should be completed for me too, right? I do not want to play each map 3 times, just to get all medals at the bottom. 1 or 2 times at normal/expert should be enough. :D\n\nThere is one aspect of this game that is just a bit off at the moment. The metagame itself….\n\nGSB is incredible in design and execution, and cliff has summed it up, its an awesome segment of the space battle portion of a 4x space game. Now while I don´t think there should be an entire CAMPAING. I do believe it would be quite nice to see continuity of ships, experience ratings, maybe a flag ship type of thing. Maybe a small strategic portion where you have a random sector in a random world (to keep with the gratuitousness mind you) and simply exploit that small star system and take over another one (in a turn based mode for example).\n\nYou would have RESOURCES in the area, and basically defend and attack using those resources (making lopsided, uneven and overall awesome battles possible).\n\nAs the game is right now, there is always duality, equality, and similar circumstances. But wouldn´t it just be a kick in the balls to be able to defend against a HUGE onslaught of enemies, with say, nothing but fighters because in the system in question you have many pilots but not half as many resources as you would have needed to build a capital ship.\n\nI couldn't find anyplace else to submit this, but I've purchased and have beaten all the battles on expert, I've got mucho honor. So yes, more unlockable modules, and how about unlockable ship hulls, unlockable maps, etc., etc.\n\nNow, thoughts on UI changes:\n– how about a 'delete' function within ship design UI, to clean up old designs.\n– if you could figure out a way to make assigning 'formations' through orders easier…I often use frigates as support for cruisers. Right now to assign an order to one or more ships, the chain goes select ship(s) by left clicking, add order, formation, assign target, left click on target, ok. That's a LOT of steps, and must be repeated for every separate formation.\n– Lasso selecting does not update to whatever ships you're trying to work with. Only left-click selecting does this. When dragging a box around ships, and then trying to issue orders, the order status seems to still default to the last ships that were left-click selected.\n\nOn the MetaGame : Someone probably mentioned this before, because it would fit so well with GSB.\n\nGreat idea for a MP metagame: There is a giant space map, separated into hexes. Players can initiate these maps. We will call them 'universes'.\n\nOn each universe, players can join different player run factions. So I might start my own faction, and call it 'The Freaky Xenons'. Players choose how many people can join there faction, or have no cap.\n\nTo take a hex of the space map / universe, one faction/player fights the AI for a square. And of course, other factions will join in the game, and then there will be faction version faction warfare on the universe map.\n\nYou can spruce things up a bit : some hexes have strategic resources that generate credits. Credits gained go to a faction pool that are used for reinforcements after battles.\n\nYou could also incorporate map-specific stuff , like nebula, as 'sectors' / hexes of your space map.\n\nNot to toot my own horn or anything but I think this is a FANTASTIC idea for a future meta game. It wouldn't be incredibly hard to program — it incorporates mostly stuff you already have Cliff — and would make for endearing, really cool way to play the game.\n\nAlso: players can set the amount of possible battles per day. So more casual groups can set it at only 1 battle per day, more hardcore players 6 battles etc.\n\nGSB is really cool in the sense it is a throw-back to PBEM mail games.\n\nWell that's my idea. I got it from watching this awesome documentary called Darkon last night, which was on LARP'ers . The meta-game for their role-playing battles goes in a similar way.\n\nThose ideas all seem good to me- id love more unlockables (new wepons not just upgraded old types) i think it needs a bit more variety in fx- could you change the big blast effect of ships a bit for each race maybe? add a few more types of particles flying about etc\n\nOh, related to the level mods- you mention the -20% range in a map- this seems to cause issues- you set ships max range by clicking the wepon range thingys, but they arnt reduced by that 20% on those maps.. unless you yourself remember the 20% and deduct it the ships hang back too far and cant even shoot realy- or at least that seems to happen. the wepons max range should be lowered to reflect the -20% of that map.\n\nGuy: Having to design a ship around a single weapon system might be kind of interesting, and simply having massive crew / power requirements would be a simple way to do that, so I'd piggyback on that suggestion.\n\nPersonally though I wouldn't want them to be significantly stronger than regular weapons, just different and interesting. Maybe a long-range shield disrupter beam, maybe an Area of Effect weapon.\n\nModules I'd like to see, personally, would be more fighter and frigate things, modules that blur the lines between the ship classes (WITHOUT erasing said lines), and modules that do things nothing currently in the game does.\n\nI'd like to see more interesting options for fighters / frigates.. Perhaps cloaking modules with different behaviors / conditions than cruiser cloaking modules, like a frigate that's stealthed so long as it hasn't fired in 5 – 15 seconds, or a fighter that's stealted until it's close. Accuracy-boosters that help allies with other weapons not just missiles. Maybe tractor beams that slow, not stop, ships of their own class thus making it easier to hit said ships. Weapons that damage or disable specific modules– maybe fighters can have ion blasters that hurt the generators / weapon chargers on ships so long as they can hit the hull directly. Maybe frigates can have torpedoes that increase the mass of other ships and so make them less maneuverable.\n\nMaybe some kind of energy-absorbing phase generator where the more damage a frigate takes the harder it gets to damage, but also the less effective it is offensively– like maybe it gets time-phased so all its devices and weapons recharge slower and it moves slower the more the phasing comes into effect, but it's almost a good tank (not as good as a cruiser but more options = good). More effective anti-missile / anti-fighter stuff on frigates would also be nice.\n\nFor fighters, more specialist dog-fighting gear, specialist anti-cruiser gear (disrupter torpedo launchers that make the fighter slower but give them an effective anti-shield option in large numbers). The way I see it, a navy would experiment more with fighters because if it doesn't work you lose a lot less money than if you make a weird experimental cruiser and it fails– or you might try out weird experimental technology on a fighter or frigate first, then scale it up later.\n\nSpeaking of, what about fighter or frigate modules that have a /chance/ to cause damage or destruction of the fighter or frigate that's using it? I don't want to call them kamikaze modules, because that implies they'd be powerful enough to be worth the ship /definitely/ dying. I'd rather they be just a little better or cheaper than otherwise but come with a risk that balances it out.\n\nSo anyway, my thought on the meta-gameyness. I'd love anything that allows for good, interesting tactical battles. Having to fight over space online for your favorite faction, just for the glory of it– losers shouldn't have less points or less abilities, they'd just keep losing if they did and lots of players (jerks) would probably quit if they were losing then — might be worthwhile though I'm not sure if I'd have the time for it.\n\nOr you could keep it simpler with an offline metagame to string together battles. How about an option for 'campaigns' of several missions where you have to choose how to spend your resources throughout the whole campaign. The resources shouldn't be a static number, you could increase them for getting a resounding victory / having lots of surviving ships.\n\nMaybe have objectives like just staying alive for an amount of time or taking down the enemy to a certain percentage. Have multiple objectives each mission so sometimes you can actually lose a mission but continue the campaign.\n\nLike for one mission if you're able to survive for 5 minutes you can continue the campaign if you lose because your reserve forces were able to flee. Give it the feel of divergence, don't MAKE us lose after the 5 minutes, let it be a choice — if we use a smaller fleet that can't survive past 5 minutes, we saved resources and therefore have more to spend on the next mission, but if we made a very economical fleet that still won we'd have even more points. If we made an expensive fleet that won easily we'd have less points than if we'd just lasted 5 minutes and ran.\n\nThat way you'd have some important decisions to make in the campaign, beyond the obvious 'do as well as you can in the fights' (which would still matter a lot).\n\nAt the end of the campaign, give us lots of statistics, 'achievements', whatever you want to call them. Maybe different text for each faction based on a resounding A-rank victory or a close C-rank. It would be neat if we didn't have to win all the missions in order to continue and finish the campaign (all games do that = boring), we just get a better score depending on how we do.\n\nThere could be some procedural / randomness so that these campaigns can add to replayability. Since it'd keep spitting out 'unique' missions, they couldn't be worth honor (not with the way the honor / unlock system works now) since then there'd be less reason to play the campaign. And yet it's also more work to make it worthwhile some other way … Meh, game design is hard, I have to leave it to Cliffski to decide, obviously, I'm just throwing ideas out there and seeing what sticks.\n\nA campaign where you're restricted to 5 – 10 pre-designed ships for the duration of the campaign. So, yeah you can mix and match, but you need a very balanced stable of ships to survive. This would be a great ship design challenge.\n\nAnother spinoff on that, a campaign that asks us to win 3 random missions in a row with us using the same ships. We can change their formations and orders, and we start fresh each mission, but we can't switch them. The ultimate 'balanced fleet' challenge!\n\nthat last idea is great. A mini campaign (random) that forces the player to use the same ships for periods of time would OBLIGATE the player to use hefty amounts of tactics (honestly I just spam heavy plasma cruisers and have absolutly NO tactics placed ever and it works). I love the idea!\n\nI just picked up the game last night but my 2 month old decided not to let me play. However I'd like to suggest a \"campaign\" type feature which stays almost entirely within your current methods.\n\nBasically you start out with a bunch of available missions (attack or defense) on a normal \"galactic map\" but each one has some relatively low number of resources available for the battle (Whatever you use to limit ships in a particular scenario now, again, I haven't played yet, but manpower and money seem to be what I'm seeing). As you complete missions, you bring surviving units up to the new \"battle line\" and gain the resources of that system. So as time goes on, battles become larger and more epic and your fleet grows in an organic kind of way with older or damaged units mixed with new units based on new ideas.\n\nIt would have several positives:\n1) The actual frame game is relatively small and there is no technology tree/resource gathering required.\n2) The enemy fleets can vary over time forcing different strategies and meaning that from the beginning, you have to plan for your future needs and cannot just lump all of one kind of ship together and expect to win at the end (where a large portion of your fleet can/should be holdovers, or environmental changes making certain weapons systems useless would require adjustments to tactices)\n3) You could allow technology \"capture\" if you wanted meaning both sides start with different technologies allowed and as you win in systems, you capture enemy weapon/shields etc and can put them into your own ships at that point. Giving a rudimentary, but not research or money based technology system.\n4) It could be played by email vs an opponent if you wanted to. Since all rounds are started and then watched, it is easy to allow both sides to build their fleet, give their orders and then see the result, all by email."

      "text": "Take a look at the Hull and shields numbers between a BoP and a Raptor, then look at these numbers for a Fed Escort (the ship with the lowest hull and shields on the Fed side) you'll see that they are lower for the Klingon ships. The BoP was in Open Beta and I do not believe it has changed 5% less hull than the Fed Escort.\n\nThe Klingon NPC who tells you about ship types does say that the Raptor and BOP have a negative to shields and a boost to weapons. He's not specific about the values.\n\nSo yes, I think if a BOP and a Fed Cruiser equip the same shield, the BOP will get less actual hit points out of it. Should ask around next time a match is over and people are waiting to leave.\n\nProblem is it might be hard to find a Fed using the same shield Klingons have. I imagine most of them are using quest reward/loot drop shields that may not match the stuff Klingons can get from vendors.\n\nOk, let's just say it was super hard to let go of the MKII fed shield that I mailed to my Klingon, I exchanged that green shield for a blue MKIV that had 200 less shields but about 20 more regen... So yes, klingongs get bad shields compared to federation. Also, bird of prey has universal BO's so many people running with a bunch of engineers to stay afloat. This lesser shield in power (not regen) is the strongest shield we can get in T2 as a KlingonYOu have way more hull and shields than us.\n\nSO you have what you want in the game.\n\nGO play klingon if you want to know how underdog they SORT of are at the moment.\n\nWe dont have half the luxuries that the Fed players have to gear up and stay levelPaper thin hulls. Also if a klingon pilot invested in the BO skills to out last a fed, he sure as hell is not going to kill you before your buddies show upBad Idea. Better cloaking detection would mean you have to increase the damage klingon ships do 10-15% because you're negating the dps they would do during the element of surprise. Then the feds would ball up again because they die too fast out in the open and back to square 1."

It murdered anything and everything it would come across, especially pirates and Xenon. I just recently found out it was meant to jam weapons and use ECM, whatever that does.\n\nso, mixing long range and short range guns, in turrets, is usually a bad idea...\n\nI've always wished that there were more turrets of fewer guns each on the ships.\n\nInstead of 8 in the L turret, I'd like 2x4, so you could tune the ship better and have some anti-fighter coverage even if you had 6 GPPCs on that side. You could mix 2xFLAK 6xGPPC, or 4/4, or whatever you felt was appropriate for where you were headed. But I suppose it eventually runs into a lot of processing for the 'puter to do - yet another reason we need multi-core support.\n\nYeah first off as your shooting all the guns in the turret and only the long range ones are in range! Thats wasted energy! Also Mixing weapons with different projectile speeds is bad too. What happens is the fast one hit the target first causing the aviodance manuvering thus the slower shots miss when they get there."

      "text": "One of our kickstarter goals was rather oddly labeled as \"Hedgetrimmers\". The stretch goal was a system of organic living treeships, with the hedgetrimmers being used to shape their growth. Nezumi and I have finished the basic tree blocks and inserted them into the game.\n\nI don't have the growing code done yet, but I figured I'd take a brief break to explain what the heck I'm creating, and why.\n\nLet's use this reference image:\n\nOn the far left you can see a curiously blue-green seed pod. This is the seed of one of three kinds of treeship, and would sell for quite a bit on the open market. It will be found somewhere deep inside an asteroid, waiting for some lucky soul to stumble across it.\n\nPick it up and find someplace hospitable to plant it - A patch of dirt will do nicely, although an asteroid would be even better. A happy little seedling will sprout up - Find him some sunshine and he'll start growing.\n\nThe heart of any treeship is its heartwood - This reddish brown material grows at the base and core of the tree, and any wood separated from it will sicken and die. It's quite sturdy, rivaling aluminum in its melting point, and withstanding quite a bit of flex before breaking. Outside of its heartwood, treeships are quite resistant to hollowing, happily growing even when the majority of their interior tissue is removed.\n\nThe type of wood for the majority of the tree is determined by its tree type - Cherry blossom tress get a light balsa wood, deciduous trees get a tough mahogany wood, and pine trees get softer pine wood. The woods grow and self-repair damage at different rates - Mahogany is slow, balsa is middling, and pine trees are quite speedy. The tree pictured is a deciduous.\n\nAfter some time being exposed to light, treeships will produce a bud somewhere on their exterior surface. If this bud is in a poor location, it's the work of a moment to trim if off. If it's left alone, however, it will eventually grow into a small branch coated with leaves, pine needles, or cherry blossoms. Branches left to grow long enough will thicken to the point that they can be hollowed out.\n\nTreeships need a lot of material to grow, and will extend roots into asteroids or ships they're planted on to get it. They'll also remove carbon from carbon dioxide to grow, adding oxygen to any interior atmosphere. (Fun fact: Trees on earth actually get MOST of their mass from this process - Trees are almost entirely built out of air!)\n\nTreeships provide electricity (via sunlight hitting their leaves), and will happily transmit materials through the small pores in their trunks - Any equipment connected to a treeship will automatically be a part of the ship's electricity and supply network!\n\nEach type of treeship has its positive and negative points - Cherry blossoms trees grow fruit for their crew to eat and are lightweight, but are poor at photosynthesis and can be fragile. Deciduous trees are quite tough and hard to burn, but have fragile leaves and flex poorly. Pine trees flex well and regrow damage faster than other trees, but burn easily and don't photosynthesize as well as deciduous.\n\nTreeships will grow over their entire lifetimes, slowing down as they get larger. Tend to one well and you could easily have a kilometer long battleship on your hands.\n\nAs you can see, I've got quite a bit of coding ahead of me! Wish me luck!\n\nBlockade Runner does look like a good game. Scrumbleship will be better when it's at the same stage in development as BR, however! The complexity of the damage modelling, the power of the physics engine (with heat transfer, structural stress, and more) make this a game with unbridled potential. And it's getting better all the time.\n\nPlus, you can make ships out of butter that melt when you turn on the engines. What other game can say that?\n\nThis game looks AMAZING. I can't to start building battleships and battling against others. It's awesome that this will be multiplayer.\n\nQuick question from a noob - what will the \"world\" look like? Individual battlefields rendered for each distinct battle, or a more persistent solar system that players build and fight in at their pleasure?\n\nFor the time being, it will look more like individual battlefields. As we get closer to launch I'll be able to stitch more and more of the world together and it will begin to look more like a persistent world."

This turns the away mission into a mini-game, makes it more fun, less frustrating, and more Star Trek like.\n\nOr, make it possible to re-calibrate the tricorder so that the anomaly detector locks on mission items instead."

They are built to do nothing other than Destroy, Kill, Murder, Pillage, then Destroy some More, with some **** thrown in for good measure (Exception Being the Industrial Ships)\n\nI respectfully Disagree, but have a bump for good measure.\n\nHeh, thanks.\n\nBut people seldom destroy and kill for money alone. Such people are called \"pirates\", and certainly they exist, but there are also 4 whole civilizations in EVE that have their own culture, lore, life, symbolisms, etc., etc. And - they are rich, they don't have to scrimp and save to make stuff to kill.\n\nAmarr can afford gold and pointless ornamentation on their spaceships.\n\nGallente can afford flamboyant sexualized designs on their spaceships.\n\nCaldari are utilitarian because their culture is corporate/fascist (Zaibatsu) - i.e. it's an ideologically driven reason.\n\nAgain, as with the other respondent above, yes, the Minmatar could be said to answer to the philosophy you're outlining. But again, they are also proud, proud of the fact that they've broken Amarr chains and are carving out their own space.\n\nSo for all the spaceships to be Caldarified, and the avatars to be Minmatarified, just doesn't suit the lore.\n\nThis is not, and never was meant to be a simple arena PvP game, it is and was always meant to be a multiplayer Elite, with a whole, complex cultural background to the Universe, which ought to be reflected in 4 unique design philospohies and looks.\n\nIf not, then let's just chuck the whole thing in the bin ffs, forget all the virtual world building crap, let's just have a pew-pew arena with a chat lobby, with spaceships that just look totally like unimaginative, unevocative symmetrical generic movie science fiction spaceships. Who cares?\n\nBut so long as there is a virtual world in New Eden, so long as there is a lore, then I'd say it's objectively the case that the art design is falling short of what it should be to represent that - it's on track to becoming bland, homogenized, and dullWe need those useless(or were they?) visors and bad hairstyles. The Minmatar characteristic chin, that Khanid look that was almost klingonish. Outlandish clothes like the Gallente womans top that looked like clear plastic, the iconic Amarr head dress.\n\nAll these things made Eve - EVE! The styles and looks are actually just todays clothing now. T-Shirts, jackets, trousers and skirts. There is literally nothing that looks totally scifitastic any more.\n\nThe ships today I actually do like and wont complain about (apart from the new Vagas lack of ears and the police light on my Comet grrrr)\n\nBring back visual scifi, crazy hairdo's and dodgy clothes headsets, visors and head dress that look liek they 'do' have a purpose but no idea what it is. It is science FICTION, not some projection of todays stuff in a few decades time.Trust me, I almost know what I'm doing.\n\nYes, there are 4 Civilisations, and i fully agree that they should not all be the same ('Caldarified' as you put it) But remember the bitter conflict betwqeen these civilisations and everything surounding them. The Caldari hate the Gallente, are at war with Minmatar because they are allied to Gallente, and, while not at war with amarr, they do dislike them. Not to mention the Pirates (Especially Sansha) Now, back to ships and Modules (They are, after all, the basic building block of EVE) IMO, 'Goofy' would detract from the overall look and feel of EVE. Each ship should appear Menacing, in its own (Racial) Way. 'Goofy' Isnt menacing, 'Goofy' isnt a threat. 'Goofy' is silly. In my own (personal) opinion, 'goofy', while not bad, is not what EVE is. Take, for example, the Naga, and especially the Talos. Both, IMO, sucessfull Designs that Illustrate Racial philosophy. Both highly menacing, in their own different way. Neither of them are necessarily 'goofy' Now take, for example, the Moa. The Moa isnt menacing. The Moa is the height of Goofy. I Take one look at it and wonder 'Why? It could have been beautiful' As Peta Michalek said, Spaceships are Serious busness, and the designs should reflect that. I struggle to look at a Moa with a straight face, and I believe this reduces immersion. Loss of immersion is bad, and, therefore, the Moa is bad. Going back to your final paragraph in your OP - I still agree with it, but I beleive there is something Missing. Make some things look like thety have an Obvious Function Make some things look like they dont have an obvious function. Make thigns look like they could believably function, regardless of whether that function is obvious or not. Three Examples: The Talos, for one. It simply looks like it would work. Second is the Moa. It doesnt appear to be able to function properly. If it could fly at all, it would fly in circles. Third example is sort of straying from the others in that its a Turret (Alot of them, actually, but ill use one) Some of them could function properly, yes, some of them couldnt (Looking at you, 650mm Repeating Artillery) yet the vast majority looks like they would, at best, be only able to fire a few shots before running out of ammo and being unable to reload. They are goofy and non-functional because there is simply no way to reload them in space.\n\nTL;DR Some 'goofy' is good, but in limited ammounts, and ONLY when it doesnt impede beleivability and function. Even if we dont know what something is supposed to do, we should rest assured at night that it can do it. Moa is Bad. Function leads to menace and beleivability, which leads to immersion and enjoymentCOPYRIGHT NOTICE EVE Online, the EVE logo, EVE and all associated logos and designs are the intellectual property of CCP hf.

Doesn't really make much sense, does it? That's not likely a series of missions that a Dominion faction, nor one with Dominion members, would be given access to. And moreover, as a Dominion faction they'd get access to Dominion gear, and their \"ultimate sets\" would dispense (with grind) via STFs like they do for the KDF and UFP.\n\nWell, I imagine that the story can be rewritten to tell it from the perspective of the Dominion.\n\nKeep in mind, the Dominion is actually 2 centralized power bases, the Alpha Dominion and the Gamma Dominion.\nAnd while they work towards towards a common goal, they function independently of each\nother.\n\nGiven that the game is based in the Alpha Quadrant, your Dominion Captain would be an Alpha Dominion.\n\nSo, the mission could be rewritten along the lines of the Alphas having to contact the Gammas to resolve this issue to their mutual benefit.\n\nAnd the Starfleet angle could be explained much the same way, you are negiotiating with the Federation to retrieve your Founder and they get their station back.\nIt's an alliance of convenience.\n\nAlso, it was stated in STO lore that the Alpha Dominion is not overtly hostile towards the Federation, they have a neutral stance.\nSo it's not improbable that they would work with Starfleet to their mutual benefit."

Each house had other worries and internal matters that needed both the attention of their military and the rulers themselves.\n\nGiven that the Wolves and the Falcons had entrenched heavily on their conqured worlds and had the infrastruce to support their conquest and keep homeworld holdings under control means that it wasn't going to be a walk over to take them out. Also the Bears had a few tricks up their sleeves and their sudden change to embracing the Rasalhauge lifestyle and nation as part of their own would make it that they never gave up and would have boiled down into gurrillia war, add in the fact that the Rasalhaguers don't like the Kurtians, you have one hell of a bloody mess for the SL to deal with as they strove to remove the Bears.\n\nThen let's not forget the other Clans, like the Horses and the Vipers. They could at any minute jump in add more issues to the SL (House Lords new toy)and their attacks could lead to the SL being cut off.\n\nPlot wise, TPTB felt the only way to get business and sales a boost was to wipe out a faction, and so they did. What we got was a scenario pack, and some novels. Nothing major in sales there. What could have been done was a bunch of scenario packs, more novels that took us into the whole fight, not just the main points. and they could have also made it more of a fight for both sides. As it was everything was stacked against the Jags. From not having enough troops on Huntress, to having to use caputred mechs to police Huntress etc...I think someone at FASA was to into reading about the fall of the Third Reich and the later years of WW2 and went cool let's copy...er use this for our template for the whole war to remove the Jags. More could have been done to make it believe able on both sides and as I said in the Old School Thread, what happen was someone also read a book on how warfare has changed and wanted to incorperate the new theories (which by the time of BT's setting and events would be old school itself) and in doing so lost all scope of what they were coming up with.\n\nBottom line I don't think the combined IS militaries as given could do anything more then what they did.\n\nQuote: Given the overwhelming force put into Operations Bulldog and Serpent could the Inner Sphere acting in concert have removed the Clan threat altogether?\n\nPossibly. It depends on whether or not the targeted Clans begin working together and/or begin using their warships on a large scale.\n\nQuote:Smoke Jaguar had several strikes against it: 1) It had never recovered from Tukayyid's losses thanks to constant to Combine raids (its touman was smaller than that of other Clans) 2) No other Clan moved to help the Smoke Jaguars; some moved against them. If the Inner Sphere displays an effort to stomp all invading the Clans, they might work together. 3) Jaguar Warships didn't really get into play. If all the Clans are losing in the Inner Sphere, that might change. 4) Operation Bird Dog dispersed Jaguar forces on their planets looking for rebels and guerillas, leaving them poorly placed to resist a major invasion. That might not be a repeatable trick.\n\nPersonally, I think something like Bull Dog is repeatable, though it wouldn't quite be the same as the first Operation Bull Dog. The Inner Sphere would have to be careful in its approach.\n\n-------------------- Mike Miller, Materials Engineer\n\nDisclaimer: Anything stated in this post is unofficial and non-canon unless directly quoted from a published book. Random internet musings of a BattleTech writer are not canon.\n\nThe first thing I would like to point out was that I answered this post yesterday and as I sent it either my system or the sarna system had a brainfart and wiped it. I was less than impressed.\n\nI am surprised that people disagree on this as I thought the answer would be a certain 'Yes!'. that's not to say theat you are wrong you've just looked at it differently than me. I am surprised that the IS leaders didn't cash in on the \"latent nationalism\" that must have surged through all of the border worlds on the Clan Occupation Zone when the Bulldog/Serpent Teams returned and said \"We've won!\". The masses of displaced peoples must have thought \"The Smoke Jaguars are gone now it's the turn of the Jade Falcons/Wolves/Ghost Bears\" and yet the IS stopped. Can anyone see a parallel example in the 1990 Gulf War? And we ended up going back later to finish the job having given the bad guys time to rebuild/entrench. Because of this feeling the Alshain Avengers situation was inevitable and I am surprised not an awfully lot more widespread. There surely should have been an equivalent attempt in Lyran space , I can't think of a more nationalistic race than the Germanic peoples and when you factor in Heimdall, an attempt to retake worlds is inevitable. The other issue concerning Clans Wolf and Jade Falcon is that they do not feel bound by the peace obtained by the Trials on Strana Mechty. Simply put they are a time bomb in the IS waiting to go off. As rabid crusaders their only goal is Terra and that has not changed. Therefore the solution is to deal with them now either one at a time or together ( I think the Ghost Bears are a different question that may be solved diplomatically rather than militarily) . After the Refusal War and the split of Wolf in Exile these are two of the most numerically inferior Clans although their quality is right at the top end. I don't know the exact size of their toumans but figure at approximately 10-12 Galaxies each or the IS equivalent of about 15-18 regiments spread out over an enormous amount of space. Plus they must garrison their homeworlds as well. Consider the IS order of battle after Bulldog and Serpent. Here is a list of SOME of the units that would be used:-\n\nTake a moment to study that list and think of the numbers, experience level and technology base that these units have. There are enough IS WarShips to counter that threat and we haven't started to add in the numerous house troops that would be a part of any assault- Lyran Guards , Crucis Lancers , Davion Guards, Legion of Vega , RCTs etc ad nauseum When Victor turned up at Coventry with a fraction of the above the JFs ran away sharpish as they knew a pitched battle would destroy them win or lose. When the Clans first appeared their success was based upon them attacking down an invasion corridor that was weak, still using lvl1 equipment and completely unprepared for the whirlwind blitzkrieg assault that is then clan way of war. As the IS learned successes became more difficult and now the Clans find themselves trying to prepare for two types of war- Internecine Clan squabbling Major IS assault The two do not gel and it can only strengthen the IS cause to have some Clan units facing off other clan units.\n\nThe best reason for this liberation not happening would be the prospect of leaving Sun Tzu, Katherine Steiner and Word of Blake unattended for any period of time but even they must fear the reprisals of a victorious SLDF\n\nchez\n\nps. Take another look at that list\n\n-------------------- \"In order to stab someone in the back it is first necessary to get right behind them\" Sir Humphrey Appleby\n\nThe idea that it could have happen to the other Clans was possible only if the entire IS was in on it full, a unified and united IS with ALL but the bare bones units left behind hitting the Clans all at once could do what you are suggesting, but do you really think the IS could unite like that? Even in the time of the original Star League they had their petty feuds and raids and back stabbing and their lust for power was all still there. Then think about this, the Clans SAW what happen to the Jags, so wouldn't it make sense for them to dig in, fortify their holdings, and in some cases ease the pressures that they had on the locals? Also if IRC some of the worlds were doing better off under Clan control then ever did under their respective house control. SO for those worlds I doubt the populous would be willing to change hands again.\n\nYes you listed an impress munchy group to take on the Clans, the main line authors favorite units and groups. But look at it like this, they would also need garrison units for the planets, Wolf's Dragoons and the WiE had no desire to fight to the death against the Clans or fight to the homeworlds, so beyond taking some planets and in Phelan's case reclaim the Wolf holdings for his Warden's I doubt he would do much and ignore anyone telling him other wise. The Dragoons had other things to worry about like Outreach and keeping the other mercs honest and trying to figure out who and what they were now in an IS that was now different and hostile to them as a whole. The Kell Hounds, why would they need to much since they had all the goodies of being first in line for everything and Morgan's son was also their next biggest ally, so their taking part would be only if Victor begged and pleaded and convinved Morgan that it was worth it and that it could be done without to much lost, add in all of the other issues in the FedCom and you can rule out Morgan.\n\nThe Combine you might get, but again logistical issues come in to play and they would need time to work the Nova Cats into the Combine so you can cross them out. Also Teddy has a lot internal issues to deal with and those will show up no matter HOW the population of the combine feels about things.\n\nFree Worlds League, some how I don't see Tommy (fake or not) support full scale war just to free some Lyran planets. He wouldn't gain much and his internal issues would wreack the hole FWL before anything worth while could be gotten from the war. So the FWL is out.\n\nThe CapCon...well here it get's tricky...Sun Tzu wants revenge against Davion, he also wants power for his relam and want to expand, so helping take planets on the far side of the IS from his holdings wouldn't mean much to him, and what captured war machines and tech he could get, doesn't mean he has them in production once he has them either, also he wouldnt want to be fifth fiddle to something like this and would want more control over things, so I am sure the other powers would either not ask for his help or treat him like the red head step child, an issue that both FWL and the CapCon rasied in the original Operations as to how their troops would be used. So we could and should rule out the CapCon.\n\nComstar...they have issues with the WoB. They are also in Victor's backpocket, they are also expending capital (is money and material) faster then they are getting it in, again something FASA and even FP is still forgetting, is logistical and monatery issues are killing point for miltiary operations. One or the other is going to bite the grand idea in the butt and cause it either fail or fall short of it's gains.\n\nThe Clans had internal fighting amongist themselves even while fighting the IS, they raided each other all the time and the Home Clans didn't care to change how they fought and the IS Clans weren't going to roll over and play dumb, not if FASA expected to sell more stuff and keep the fans interested in the game.\n\nBottom line is to much was going against them doing this on any larger of a scale and even with what they did they set in motion for things to happen like the FC civil war to finially come to a boiling point as well as Sun Tzu's crap with the attack on the Compact and the other not so nice things that have happen.\n\nOn the Heimdall issue, one thing Morgan Kell is a big deal in Heimdall as is the the Stiener family, so throught that Victor, also Loki is their biggest enemy, so Heimdal wouldn't be doing much without getting the okay from their holier than thou leadership.\n\nAnd you said it your self, going after the other Clans would have given the enemies of the Houses involved the chance to do even more damage then was done.\n\nHmmm... don't forget that many of the IS elite troops were ripped up on Huntress. Also, the Jags were caught unprepared for an assault, their Omni's not configured for a defensive array. Also, the IS has surprise on their side. Due to the Combine's news blackouts, no one really knew what was going on other than the leaders themselves. In other words, I don't think another Operation Bulldog would come off with the same degree of success.\n\n-------------------- \"Even after all these years, walking through the ranks of 'Mechs still gives me the chills\"\n- Intelligence Secretary Justin Xiang Allard\nOutreach, 21, Sept 3051\n\nNo I am not forgetting how convientent it was for the IS...sorry but the whole wiping out of the Jags was poor storyline planning and the then Line Developer and authors wanting some major to happen to generate sales.\n\nThe whole plot was so weighted in favor of the IS from the start that the outcome was forgone conclusion.\n\nHow can the Omni configs be a factor? The weapons work at all ranges, and a decent commander can defend better then they can attack something. As for whole surprise issue, again I point to storyline. IT was awful convientent that the IS is handed everything they needed without having to force the Dragoons or WiE to aid them in finding the Homeworlds and in a nut shell made hash of a lot of the up to that point, sub plots that had been hinted about in the sourcebooks and else were.\n\nBut you are right, another Bulldog won't happen, because the story already has it's future mapped out..."

      "text": "OK, I played a game this Monday and winded up with a draw. What was frustrating was this was against Daemon Hunters who was running two Land Raider Crusaders. he said he has never lost with them and I saw why. He also was playing with inducted guard as well.\n\nThe grand knight HQ didn't help since he killed two of my fexes. But the real problem with his army was the two landraiders. The power of the machine spirit was getting on my nerves. When I get a 1 or 2 result it did nothing. On a 3-4 it helped but not enough. The crusader have way to many weapons for my taste. But destroying most of the weapons and immobilizing the two land raiders i was barley able to squeeze in a tie to kill his troops lying on the other objective.\n\nI was shooting the land raiders with my 3 zonathorpes ans my two sniper fexes which tied up all my heavy shooting. In this game I realized that I may have to retire the venom cannon. My most effective results was when my carnifex assaulted the land raider.\n\nI want to still use the barbed strangler as a weapon with my fexes. but I'm thinking of making them a bit more hand to hand and durable. I usually keep my heavy fexes in the back sniping away.\n\nMy point is what a man to do. I'm asking how everyone else fair to the new land raider rules and how they deal with them.\n\nLand Raiders are insanely tough to kill, even with tau railguns! Warp blasts are almost as good so start with them. Under 5th edition rules don't expect to kill anything with a glancing hit from a venom cannon. If you're lucky you'll get an immobilize, but don't expect to finish it off.\n\nWhat about sicking an assault carnifex or hive tyrant on it instead? Whatever their strength is plus 2d6 for armor penetration shouldn't have too much trouble beating 14 armor. Sure the land raider is about as fast as lumbering carnifexes, but if it's trying to stay away from them at least it won't be shooting much! I'm not a tyranid player, but could you send in a flyrant with warp blast and some big claws to kill a land raider?\n\nI definitely think assaulting is your best bet. S10 CC fex with 5-6 attacks can easily get a number of pens on a LR. If you don't destroy it that turn, you can charge it again the turn after and it'll be dead for sureI have to disagree. I run very shooty Nids and win. You just need to strategize better in the sense that you have to pick your equipment wiser and choose your battles effectively and accordingly.\n\nVenom Cannon is still a tough customer versus vehicles regardless of what anyone else will tell you, the venom cannon DOES work much better than any other anti-tank shooting weapon we have. This includes warpblast because you only get 1 shot at 18\" range, while the VC has 2 shots at 36\".\n\nIn any case I think you should drop the sniper fexes for mixed fexes, that's what im going for nowadays because let's face it the Barbed Strangler sucks majorly against vehicles and at least for me, the scattering is a major turn off.\n\nA MIXED carnifex with a venom cannon and a pair of talons is much more effective against against AV14 than a sniper fex or a CC fex. You can continously shoot your VC hoping to immobilze or armament destroy your target while moving up to assault it and finish it off.\n\nThe mistake many players are making is that they feel that the VC SHOULD be there to destroy the vehicles while they sit happily in the back lines. This is not how you play Tyranids that's strategy at it's worst, as you are relying on a weapon that can't take out vehicles that well but that can impair them instead effectively. So just keep that in mind and plan better. Really try a mixed fex witht he 'move and shoot' strategy in a few games and see for yourself if it works or notBS alone just isn't my cup of tea personally.\n\nAnd yes i know that some vehicles can ignore stun/shaken because I actually run Monoliths and Land Raiders in my armies. So i know exactly the extent to which i can depend on those and vice-versa if im on the attack.\n\nThe strangler is completely worthless against AV14 vehicles in comparison to a venom cannon. Thats why i love mixed fexes.\n\nYou dont need to try to destroy every weapon on the tank just move forward adn shoot it every turn until you reach it. If you get armament destroyed on it then take out it's strongest guns first.\n\nThe crusader has the hurricane bolters, big deal those things need 24\" range i doubt he wants to bring his land raider so close to a carnifex. His other weapons are the actual threat so just armament destroy his longest range first so he cant shoot ur other guys and keep movign forward towards him.\n\nAlso remember Crusaders are used mostly to transport stuff so that makes it easier for a mixed fex to clip him midway.\n\nGive ur mixed fex chitin and exoskeleton and you can in most cases walk him across the whole board without getting him killed before he takes something big out.\n\nI believe I just noticed something... Are you thinking each bolter or pair of bolters counts as a seperate weapon? They don't. Each Hurrican bolter (6 bolters/3 pairs) is a weapon. So a weapon destroyed would take out an entire Hurrican Bolter.\n\nI believe I just noticed something... Are you thinking each bolter or pair of bolters counts as a separate weapon? They don't. Each Hurricane bolter (6 bolters/3 pairs) is a weapon. So a weapon destroyed would take out an entire Hurricane Bolter.\n\nHope that helps! and if I misread then sorry ;D"

Theoretically such spots have have planets (though i've never seen one, gal gen probably needs to be tuned, or that part is broken), and it would be unhelpful to have multiple planets named \"Deep Space I\".\n\nOn the plus side Deep Space \"systems\" have no title on the galaxy map, so it eases up on the visual clutter a little.\n\nAt first i was thinking that numbers or letters could be appended to distinguish them: i.e. \"Deep Space Gamma\", or \"Deep Space 9\". But that seems a bit wordy.\n\nI think the solution is simpler -- name the deep space \"systems\" just like any other. The current names have no particular significance -- they are arbitrary designations. Nodes in the great web of starlanes are about equally deserving of names. If you want to be picky, i suppose an additional list could be drafted for empty \"systems\", to avoid using star names like \"Fomalhaut\" for emptiness, but that doesn't seem especially important. Chances are \"Fomalhaut\" is attached to a star of the wrong color/classification anyway.\n\nDeep Space systems actually do have names, but it's not shown unless there's a planet in a system. If a planet is present, the name shows up, and the planet is called Fomalhaut I or Asteroid Belt or similar"

Then you have a higher defense bonus, and are therefore getting hit less often.\n\nIf you're constantly slowing your Nebula, or even reversing it, in order to bring targets into your front 90* for some of your sci powers, or running lower engine power in favor of aux, then your bonus defense is dropping, and you're taking more hits.\n\nIn the latter case, it may seem that your shield is less efficient or weaker, but it's simply the math of accuracy vs. defense that's getting you.\n\nActually the Nebula fly's faster because its lighter and it turns faster so I don't have to reverse and stop to put things in my target arc.

      "text": "174\n\nEdit:New factionalized version [link] -------------- Dark force Devourer,destroyer class war ship, its about the same size as a standard Light force destroyer. And yes there are going to be 4 in all , hunger ,devourer, pestilence and black hole classes.\n\nI tried my best to bring out the main parts of my idea, the smooth polished rock like front end the asteroid like back end and the tentacles.\n\nThis ship is broken up in 3 parts , the main part is the smooth front end. Its covered in a smooth dark skin that enables it to not only spread dark skin when it rams into something but absorbs massive amounts of energy. The interior of this section is like a living organism and is grown not built.\n\nFighters launch from dark skin covered hanger bays.\n\nThe smother area can also easy fire dark skin spikes which pierce through most metals like a hot knife through butter they also spread dark skin corrupting anything it touches.\n\nThe asteroid part is filled with tunnels leading to bio machines that build and launch dark skin spires. They act like large missiles that can fire dark skin spikes as well as spread large amounts of dark skin on impact.\n\nThe asteroid part is part of an asteroid that was infested with Xai'irthi (insect race of ambiguously insane male warriors, think DBZ but more powerful at times) then its taken and infused with dark skin and used as a launch base for dark spires, warriors and even space ship fighters.\n\nThe tentacles are grown from dark skin and connect the first and second parts of the ship together.They act as engines moving the ship. They also are used in combat constricting the flow of energy through mass absorption and crushing whatever is left.\n\nLight Force ships can not be crushed, however once a section has been covered in dark skin it may be weakened enough for dark skin to seep in through the seams. When a section has tentacles attached too it it can not generate enough energy and unless they are removed the ship will be quickly covered in dark skin then devoured from the inside out.\n\nNearly anything can be transported through the dark skin when enough seeps into a light force vessel troops and Xai'irthi can go in and take out any resistance.\n\nDark skin can be held back with energy force fields but you need enough power to block it off, dark skin alone is not enough to take down a fully equipment light force vessel, Devourers must attach themselves to a covered light force ship in order to finish it off.\n\nEdit Forgot to mention just how LF defeats a DF vessel, they basically gang up on it and burn off the dark skin using their main cannons. Dark skin can spread through absorbing energy but at certain points it grows weak enough to where a bit more energy will burn it away. Once a ship is strip of its outer layer of dark skin its only a matter of time before its filled with so much energy that its structure collapses.\n\nIt takes 50-60% of universe destroying power to deal with a normal dark force devour/destroyer, twice as much for the next class 10 times as much for the last class and half as much for the lowest class.\n\nThere is not a lot I can do with it with my skills, its more a placeholder or my attempt to draw it out, I hope to have commissions done based off my doodles. But other than that could you elaborate more? Do you mean emblems, racing/detailing strips and what not?\n\nGood thing you asked as I am making up things as I go it helps to have someone ask questions. I want to say there are no factions in current Light forces but even if they are, none use emblems persay (energy signatures sure but no obvious visual markers as LF is on the bland tried and true ultra modernized look,hell the cities are gray and unremarkable but for the entertainment/market districts.) One of the reasons for this is during the first war of creation you had more factions and less general unification, during the current 2nd more bland and darker era of the war of creation Light forces is less rag tag and much more organized and standardized to stifling proportions.\n\nNow dark forces is a bit different their Generals(who make up a counsel/congress of darkness of which lead dark forces by general non compete pledges that they get out of by showing how weak the defeated are lovely back stabbing bunch they are, I think light forces is ran by a counsel of adjudicators/judges but I'll have to check my notes....or just add to them..LOL ) As I was saying generals are more outspoken and indevendaul. So there should be clear marks of identification, I am thinking unqie ram horns/skulls popping up in the designs maybe on the front and sides of the base ship design. *steals some ideas from rage's bandit factions...lulz* I'll see if I can factionalize the current drawing some as a 2nd revision"

      "text": "Author\nTopic: What do you do with surplus resources? (Read 1812 times)I'm generally building a lot of fallen spire stuff, which eats resources like the cookie monster eats... well, cookies.\n\nBut if the m+c is creeping towards the cap and nothing obvious springs to mind: 1) Fill out any turret cap if I know where I want them. 2) It's time to lay out more space docks, more engies, and speed build a fleet right into the face of whatever AI planet I want dead next. In extreme cases (or youngling/autobomb cases), FRD'ing straight from the docks into the enemy. 3) If I'm really desperate, turn on the ZPG that's generally under construction from the Trader from early in the game. A group of engies can make 2M m+c disappear real fast doing that.\n\nDon't bother with Mercs because they use up energy and are so expensive I'd never dare to send them to the fight. Don't bother with building unnecessary turrets because I don't need them.\n\nSo yeah. My school of thought is ye olde Dock-On-FRD-Into-Enemy-Territory; quite possibly with redirector posts on the enemy world sending them onwards to further locations - thereby keeping multiple systems cleared.\n\nI always use my spare resources to build martyrs. Can't have enough of them. or send my botnet to some enemy worlds to make some extra zombies, meaning I will have to repair the botnet after. That'll drain your resources.\n\nWhen I build mercs I usually just let them sit deep into my territory until I have a sizeable force. They cost a lot, but don't underestimate the beam frigates, they will give you a huge edge if you get more than a few.\n\nOn another note, it would be awesome if you could randomize the non triangle ships available from the merc shipyard every game (or atleast the option to randomize). It has gone far enough for me to expect the beam frigate to be a part of my army late game, the phantom 4th member of the triangle you could call it, though it's probably because of my turtle like playstyle which allows me to get them almost every game, but still...\n\nSit on it and wait 5 minutes. If I still don't need it, wait 5 minutes more. If I'm still at 1M each, build a fort. That deals with that for 30 minutes. Why? Half my fleet died while I was building it.\n\nMercs are too expensive. Z Gen I go out of my way to build or ignore utterly. My money's in motion. If it's not, I'm already playing wrong or I need to wait a few minutes.\n\nStarships, ZPG, Mercs - Yes, they're expensive. however, mixed in decent amounts with your fleet ball, I lose very few of these. Even when going at Mark IV worlds I never lose more than maybe 10-20 of each type if I have them all loaded, and that's under poor conditions. They require a huge investment and patience to not be tempted to take the few of them you do already have and send 'em into battle too early. And i fthat fails... FRD Space Doc Assaults.\n\nForts and mercs will use up money fast. You can scrap the fort later and get an infusion of emergency resources if you need it.\n\nIf my cash is like 800k or above I'll build mercs, and stop when it gets down to a few hundred K. Who cares how much they cost? Mercs are much more cost effective than wasting unused cash. If you don't play really fast and aggressive you are probably gonna make use of mercs, since you'll probably hit resource cap a lot. Don't be scared to use them, either. You're never gonna \"get your money's worth\" out of mercs, priced as they are. Just think of them as kind of bonus ships that make your fleet a bit scarier. Or, hoard them like kuresuti does until you have a significant force of them.\n\nAnd obviously if you have zenith traders you can throw down all sorts of goodies, pause them, and continue building when you have too much cash.\n\nAbout the Zenith Traders... one should always start building 1*players ZPGs before they capture one.\n\nMost useful amongst others is counterspy if you encounter cloaked unlocks. Blackhole machines next on a fortressed world, followed by armour remover and tripler. Orbital Mass Drivers are so-so, and only significant if you lack serious firepower against lead ships (you won't technically need one, say, if you already have a spire city.)"

I like things that are a tad uneven, they seem more real and more thought-through (and often they are, here and elsewhere). Big round numbers make me nervous.\n\nAnother possibility would be an AI only turret that they automatically build in response to deep transport raids, and gives a warning similar to the Ion Cannon when it has been built and your transports start getting shot up by it.\n\nOh I think that's a good general strategy - it's just not good when it consistently sends waves that *can't* damage/destroy the special fast enough to do anything. So instead of destroying resources and delaying our fleet rebuilds at least slightly, it throws away a wave trying to destroy a target that it's ships simply aren't suited to\n\nNow, I've seen it use forcefield ignoring ships to destroy stuff under the orbital command FF, which is funny, annoying, and effective, but I've also seen it get hung up on a planetary special and constantly send the waves that go into that system to attack the special, even though it failed miserably the last 5 times (I'm assuming there's no memory of success/failure, only target priority)\n\nTo be clear, the Core Warhead Interceptor isn't the only special I've seen this behavior, it's just the most notable because it has so many HP (and so many of the AIs regular waves would get completely distracted by it)\n\nUnfortunately I don't recall which other items the AI would get hung up on regularly. In general, the AI going after relatively tough specials with non-bomber ships seems like a bad idea, it'd be better served just raiding resources and then planet hopping when there's no easy pickings left.\n\nSo in our current game, 3 players vs difficulty 7 Peacemaker and Bully, we probably _should_ be dead at about the 10 hour mark.\n\nWe got hit by a 4000 strong cross planet attack of tech 2 ships, and they quickly wiped out my homeworld, and about 1400 ships began to rampage.\n\nBut then a strange thing happened - about 400 got stuck in one system, and about 1000 go stuck in another.\n\nWe go look, and both are busily trying to destroy Core Warhead Interceptors in each system... which have 150M HP.\n\nWe regrouped our shattered fleets, sent them in, and wiped out every ship without taking any casualties, because the AI was obsessed with destroying these (useless) structures.\n\nThis isn't the first time we've seen this behavior, during normal raids, they'd often get obsessed with targeting those, but during other games/in other systems, we've also seen the AI prioritize really useless planetary specials, over raiding more useful targets.\n\nWe're talking about multi, not single - no defenses isn't a problem, we defended for him. Remember, it was functionally a 3 player game with a fourth player operating a free, extremely overpowered fleet\n\nWe've never made progress that quickly in any game before or since, which is why I'm pointing out the abusive potential early in a multiplayer game. You can't get away with it in single player mode, as you lack the ability to build or defend, but in multi, that's not an issue.\n\nCome to think of it, we didn't try powering down the fleet, that would make it even more abusive, as you could disable it, build up, then activate it to stomp another world for free.\n\nThis may have been discussed and/or (ab)used a lot already, but we ran into an interesting event earlier\n\nWe decided to show AI War to another friend who'd never played/heard of it, so we started up a 4 player game. He only had the Trial version, so I picked the most 'normal' of the Easy AIs on difficulty 7 (Sledgehammer and Zenith Descendant I think), to avoid playing a match filled with turtles/miners/shielders, and to hopefully have us all die in a hilarious fashion to some mistake he made.\n\nWell, he made a mistake, but not what I was expecting.\n\nHe picked up the basics fairly quickly, but during our very first planetary assault, he destroyed a Zenith fleet container. Oops.\n\nHe was now -400k or whatever in the red for Energy. Except, he had a giant fleet of Mark IV Zenith ships. And as far as we could tell, while he could no longer build up his empire, he was still perfectly able to rampage with his fleet.\n\nConsequently, we had him simply ravage every world we wanted taken with his massively overpowered fleet, while we built up behind him. No AI world that early in the game could stop the fleet, and at that low of an AI Progress level, the waves sent against us were laughably easy to defeat.\n\nNote that we actually lost this game, but it was mostly due to another newbie mistake he made, I'm pretty sure had that not happened, we would have been knocking on the AI's homeworlds in short order (we had them both scouted, and within a few jumps of our systems, inside about 90 minutes of play!)\n\nYou wouldn't be able to get away with this abuse in single player, because you wouldn't be able to build the necessary defenses to protect against AI waves while using the fleet, but in multi, it didn't matter - he killed, we built.\n\nYeah, I've noticed this in a few games - a really noticable, annoying clicking noise in the background. I first thought it was a friends cruddy mic picking up his mouse clicks in the background, but then I realized it was always occuring.\n\nI don't know what units were causing it though - I know it wasn't MicroFighters, we didn't have those in any of our games.\n\nI'm inclined to agree, I already find the control nodes to be a pretty cludgy solution, and space tugs are definitely awful, but dealing with engineers + cleanup engineers + rebuild engineers + now engine engineers is getting a bit excessive.\n\nI'm not sure what the elegant solution is, but I know the current implementation feels a bit messy."

I think the old Jack Stone figures were called \"midifigs,\" for either \"middle\" or \"medium\" (I'm guessing), but they were useless because they didn't come apart. The big Knights Kingdom and Bionicle figures should have been called \"maxifigs,\" but instead got the name \"constraction,\" meaning they were about to give birth (I think).\n\nI had a funny plan to have a KK minifig battle where we kept the maxifig versions off to the side to track armor damage and wounds etc., but no one ever really got excited enough about the idea to bother. It'd've been a lot of extra work for not a lot of extra fun.\n\n(Kind of like all the math in Vanguard . . . . . . . . bam! You totally didn't think this post was going to turn around and be on topic! SURPRISE!)\n\nWell, yes, but that's why we make fighter/bomber type vehicles practically worthless. Meat shields, something to take hits for your \"uber-galacto-mothership\". They wouldn't be able to do much damage except to other fighter/bomber type vehicles, and they'd be cheap.\n\npiltogg wrote:exactly. ship to ship combat in space involves so many fighters and bombers that keeping track of them is far too difficult for a normal human being. instead, you get a fleet of... oh, say 3 or 4 large ships that when converted into minifig scale would easily be at least 10 feet long. then you just duke it out with the smaller ships being meatshields with very little individual power, and fire off the massive ship guns at eachother. i actually have a small fleet of nanofig scale ships that i've made, and they have ridiculous weapons, such as a main gun being a size 27 weapon. ahhh yeah.\n\nYes, as I said, nanofig scale stuff is fun... I'll start making some ships of my own soon. As in, within the next few hours. I find it's easier to formulate rules for something if you have a couple models to look at.\n\nConverted to brikwars... massive fleets... scales... no wonder you all think this is so freaking complex. You are putting way, way more thought into it then I ever did.\n\nNot any of that is needed. First, why start with massive battles? Second, the mystique about newtonian physics being complex needs to end. It's pretty simple.\n\nCalculating fuel loss for speed change is no different then calulating hit points, accuracy, and ammo. And we should probably begin with some in system gunship skirmishes over asteroids and shipping routes. Simple, easy, and we still have those wonderful fusion driven wars and explosions. Then we begin stepping it up with bigger ships and more ship varieties.\n\nI know for a fact once you see how easy this is you will whine about it being too simple. I have alternate warhead lists and crew rules waiting to go.\n\nand i ain't worried about individual Newtonian physics stuff at all. the thing that bothers me is that in reading only a third of a page, i was bombarded with calculations, acceleration laws, and all sorts of those things of that nature. and 300 pages of this? it makes my head spin wondering what kind of other things they want us to calculate!\n\nYes it does not use hitpoints, oh silly person. But it has it's own way of them. Though you are right on the ammo.\n\nAlso, was not fingering any specific game. Just, that is something people tend to shrug off as standard and a newtonian physics calculation is slightly simpler since it uses constants without the variable of accuracy.\n\nThat .pdf is a little rough. It's only about 30 pages and, like I said, it does a weird job being more complicated then the game it tells you about. I'd have to say its creator is just a very well educated bad writer."

As someone stated in this thread ship building is harder than it used to be and takes longer, so people are having to make choices based on the current market.\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2009 Server: Antigua Society: St George Squadron of the White Nation: British Career: FT and NO\n\nI have faith in a free and competive market.\n\nShip prices have come down and selection will improve now that migration has been fixed and soon new accounts will be too.\nThis will improve the server populations and the economy.\n\nThe biggest threat to good access to ship deeds and everything else at a reasonable price is a lack of FT's engaged in the economy......this is directly effected by server populations.\n\nAnd also there are some that are pushing for much more dangerous hauling (forcing it into the red), using smaller ships for hauling and reducing the amount of econ slots.\nThis would cause many FT's to do something else or quit altogether and dramatically reduce the supply of raw materials and goods.\nWhich would drive up the prices of everything including ships and limit selection.\nThose advocating this are easy to find here in the forums.\n\nIt's not just the ship builders, tho. It's the fact that ships cost so much more to make now.\n\nWhen the game gets back to the point where it's accepting new sign-ups, I REALLY hope we see a serious attempt to bring in new players. And if this happens, then the price of low and mid-level ships MUST decrease. A LOT. By 3/4 in some cases.\n\nBecause there's no way in hell a new player following the storyline and side quests is going to have 40,000 dabloons at level 10 to buy a Curieuse Snow, or 50,000+ at level 12 to buy a Van Hoorne, a ship that used to cost 12,000 dabloons on average...\n\nSo either the income needs to go up drastically or the costs of shipbuilding need to go way the hell down. Back to where they were.\n\nDon't complain about ship prices unless you've actually looked at the cost to build....and, just like the OP, factor in the fact that even a lowbie ship now takes over an hour of hauling. How much is your time worth to you?\n\nFor me, unless it is for a soc mate, I'm going to charge the AH for the timesink of watching my ship sail around the OS at 40kts for a couple hours in order to build anything.\n\nYou think I'm overcharging? Build your own Dolphin and see if it was worth it.\n(BTW, I only build lvl 50 ships for AH, lowbie ships only for soc mates, totally not worth my personal time)\n\nReminder: the OP was about how much hauling is involved in building ships now that the recipes have exploded with goodies, and how a person's time can factor into the sales cost in Dbs.\n\nAgree.\n\nThe idea of these ship changes was to drain the vets money (step 1) and therefore make it easier for new players to compete (most likely we will end up seeing all existing ships retired) and all ships requiring AH parts (step 2-3). The problem is said vets have so much duras and because they are vets they loose dura at a much slower rate so it ends up hurting the newbies more than the vets.\n\nThe plain Stralsund actually was ~9k, Stralsund MC was ~20k. 400% insane? Well, how about this. The click cost for 3 deeds of a plain Stralsund was 2k, now for 1 deed it's 32k. That's 4800% per deed (no typo!). Make of that, what you like...\n\nPfft what credit crunch\n\n__________________\n\"Pirates are overpowered because they have Too Mean To Die\" - British Naval Officer\nMOV FARMING Since 1720\n\nMaybe they won't impact established, super-rich players quickly, but they're really going to screw over new players or those that aren't super-rich..\n\nA new player's certainly not going to get involved in PvP if they can barely afford their next ship as it is, and when they reach 50, assuming they stick around that long because they can't afford the ships needed to progress to 50, they certainly aren't going to risk their shiny new million-dabloon ship that they could barely afford in PVP..\n\nA long time ago, someone thought it was cute to say \"If you can't afford to lose it, don't use it.\"\n\nWell, now, with these ship price changes, pretty much everything is too expensive to lose, and thus too expensive to use, for a new player..\n\nThe end result is going to be less PvP..Or at least less new blood in PvP.\n\nInsurance might help, but as a whole, these massive price increases were bad for the game."

      "text": "point of autocannon heavy bolter predator ?\n\nIts only 85pts...And large numbers of little creatures do not die in close combat against marines (I'm assuming vanilla here). Basically when faced with a choice of devasator squad or Predator the Predator is much cheaper. But they are used for different things. One is anti-horde/AV10 vehicles, the other is anti-monstrous creature and Transport.\n\nI ran 2 in the lastest tounrey I took part in. Proved very good against marines in cover (where weight of fire trumps plasma) and against a Nid wall of little critters. I have however just bought 2 Auto/Las ones to try out. Also it must be said with Auto/Bolter they aren't a target priority for the enemy. Only lost them in one game (against the nids - by zoanthrope).\n\nRe: What is the point of autocannon heavy bolter predator ?\n\nAh thats awesome thanks. So say a bunch of 4+ or 3+ enemies fall out of the transport. You can't get through their armour with a heavy bolter. What do you do then ? What if marines fall out of the transport? You won't be able to kill them. What do you do then ?\n\nRe: What is the point of autocannon heavy bolter predator ?\n\nTarget them with something else :P\n\nJust because they still get an armour save doesn't mean they won't fail it. Also the Predator would have a supporting unit nearby (in my case I had a plasma toting 5 man tactical squad and a plasma razorback) that can deal mwith marines. Basically nothing is an isolated unit. In the army I ran with 2 Dakka Predators if I'd taken out a marine transport then they'd recieve 7 krak missiles (if in the open or frag in cover) to the face. As I tend to run Typhoons (and at the time ran 4 missile devastators).\n\nAlso worth pointing out my new list that I'm giving a go on Tuesday has 2 Auto/Las Predators, 1 Dakka Predator, 2 Rifleman Dreads and a TL Lascannon/Fist/Heavy Flamer Dread. That way it has a metric smeg load of shooting before adding in my fast attack choices :P\n\nRe: What is the point of autocannon heavy bolter predator ?\n\nI played in a tounament where a guy pulled out his unit of TH/SS Terminators. I made a point of wiping them out with bolter fire.\n\nI want to buy a third Predator so I can have 3 with Autocannon/Hvy Bolter, and I want to run them in the same army with my 3 Landspeeders with 2 hvy bolters each. I don't care what kind of save you have, that will hurt alot for fairly cheap.\n\nNote: my Landspeeders with the 2 Hvy Bolters, have always preformed well just by sheer volume of Strength 5 shots.\n\nRe: What is the point of autocannon heavy bolter predator ?\n\nAs other posters have pointed out, the Dakka Pred is incredibly cheap for an eight shot AV13 vehicle.\n\nThe problem with the AC/LC Pred is that generally sponsons aren't very good. They're much lower on the ground than a turret weapon, and thus have los blocked or cover given to sponson shots more often. You can of course move, but then you're either firing one gun or not shooting at all.\nDakka Pred doesn't mind any of this, because it's sponsons are cheap and doesn't suffer too much from cover being given to it's HB shots.\n\nRe: What is the point of autocannon heavy bolter predator ?\n\nagreed think of it this way if you pop the marines transport and they are in cover they are going to use their armor save. SO if we math this out\n6 s5 at BS 4 = 4 hits\ns5 on t 4 = 2.666667 wounds\n3+ save= 0.888888 dead in cover\n\nRe: What is the point of autocannon heavy bolter predator ?\n\nIts ok, but as the two weapons have different functions for the most part, you tend to be wasting the usefulness of the other weapon whatever you shoot at. Autocannon and heavy bolters are a lot cheaper and have a similar function, so its not as bad(they have more shots too which reduces the effect of any misses). What is the point of autocannon heavy bolter predator ?\n\nYeah, it doesn't make much sense. The lascannon turret is expensive, and is basically only efficient against heavy armor - but the heavy bolters are useless there. With an autocannon/heavy bolter combo you have a cheaper option and both guns work together - you specialize in putting wounds on infantry or suppressing light armor (rhinos/razorbacks, trukks, light speeders like vypers/rhinos/piranhas, anything DE etc).\n\nIf you want an anti-armor predator, consider having an autocannon with lascannon sponsors. The lascannons can punch through anything, and the autocannon works ok against most vehicles (as in, anything not AV 14)."

      "text": "*crosses fingers*\n\nby combing character skills and bringing your skill into the equation aswell wont make this an FPS, it will mean combat will seem more action packed (so FPS like) but it wont be harder than what there is already. If you can move a cursor too a NPC, im sure you can move thetargetline too it aswell. I share your concern, but after playing a game with it already, I know that the style of combat will not turn this game into a fragfest.\n\nOk I think I get what your talking about... but just because a game has a hybrid or twitch system does not mean the game is geared toward combat, it just means that when combat happens thats how it happens.\n\nI, to, dont think this game should be geared towards combat. But I do want to have combat in the game!\n\nThat is exactly what im getting at! Youwillbe using your mouse and keyboard to crouch, jump,s trafe etc when you are walkinga round a starship.\n\nFor example, you walking towards the Bridge from your quarters. You walk there manually (you dont click locations>Bridge etc and it automatically takes you there).\n\nCombat when it happens should seemlessly occur, so you have all the basic controls, but with click on the mouse you shoot aswell. Its about as talented as opening up word and changing the font.\n\nRemember, this is JUST the combat side of things, the way we walk will be the same anyway. If you played SWG, imagine that, but aiming a rifle and shooting manually. You may have an off aim, but your accuracy stat will mean you hit anywaym, or visa versa.\n\nBeerMeal, you didn't play Neocron, did you? Clicking to shoot at a creature is about as difficult as clicking on a monster in a dice rolling MMO. It is not incredibly twitchy by any means.\n\nAs for the accuracy stat, since there is talk on that, this is how I imagine it. Your reticule expands when you move around and contracts when you stay still. When your reticule is more expanded, then your shot has a large randomness factor applied to it. When it is fully contracted, it basically goes where you point. All your accuracy stat would do is reduce the time it takes your reticule to contract.\n\nImplementing a system like this would kill FPS-based security issues. Why should you aimhack when it is so easy to hit a monster? The problem is skillhacking, modifying your skills to artifically be better. How do you propose Perpetual deals with that? o_O\n\nWith that out of the way, I suppose a question of why have such a watered down FPS system remain. Simple, because I want more control. Even if aiming and clicking primarily involves character skills, there are many other factors that do not! I get to decide where to take cover, I get to decide when to risk shooting, I get a chance to dodge shots, and the list goes on. Plus, I believe FPS is more exhilirating and exciting. Has your heart really been pumping watching your guy hit a monster with a sword for the bajillionth time or has it been pumping when you are looking through his eyes, frantically trying to fight off a horde of creatures? Regardless of balance, I do believe FPS is more exciting."

      "text": "Originally by:ZartraderI think CCP's continued insistence in defining nul sec as being 'end game' despite it just being one of many ways to play the game no matter how many SP's you have indicates they consider that is the reward. Of course this assumes we all want to fly Titans and join Alliances.\n\nI'm fairly new but I would not have an issue at all with some players getting a loyalty reward. As someone said, jealousy of what others have belongs in another game, not EVE where effort and loyalty should be rewarded. I don't agree all the patches have been about new players though, far from it, the last patch did precisely nothing for me at all which I was fine about. The Op is being VERY selective which does not help their argument at all as it's obvious and messes up the argument for rewards. That may also explain the adverse responses to an otherwise reasonable request.\n\nI didn't ask for loyalty rewards, just additional skills that we can train that contribute to our gameplay (and not training stuff we never use). Also i didn't say that every patch contains something for the newbs. It's about where CCP focuses in order to build up their playerbase. Currently we have ~300k accounts with an average playtime of below 1 year.\n\n---new players--->[300.000 active accounts]---leaving players--->\n\nIn my opinion CCP concentrates too much on the green arrow, and not so about the red one. Maintaining a sense of progression is vital in MMORPGs and could keep more vets excited and continuing playing the game.\n\nI currently have 130m skillpoints. Amarr only skills. I refuse to train other races skills. During the last year I have trained lots of dumb science skills etc because of attribute remapping. I had to go for intelligence/memory skills because gunnery (lasers only), missiles and most of my ship skills are already maxed out.\n\nYes, there are still plenty of skills I could train (veldspar refining etc) but I think the vast majority of skills I have trained during the past 2 years I will never use. Next skill in my queue is jump portal generation 5 and I am not a great fan of black ops. The Redeemer is not really my favourite ship.\n\nCCP already had shown a solution. T3 skills you could train and loose and retrain and loose in an infinite loop. That's a lazy solution. Bad game design.\n\nI am not looking for the 'i pwn u all' skills but after training archeology, hacking and whatnot it would be fine to train something I could really use. Give me master gunnery skills. Rank 30. The first 4 levels give nothing, level 5 gives 1% more damage. I would train it. It would be better than veldspar refining.\n\nWhat's the matter of training skills if we all have the very same skills in the end? And this 'end' is reached pretty fast. With attribute remapping you can be a maxed out battleship pilot in a ridiculous short amount of time. We need a lot more skills. Specialization is only something special if not everybody without exception is 'specialized' in the very same skills.\n\nIf CCP wanted to keep vets interested, they'd make the endgame harder. Its incredibly easy to have your wealth grow over time as you play, with no particular increase in skill or effort. Being able to rise to the top is great, but so is being able to hit rock bottom.\n\nA lot of consequence and fun in warfare is thrown out the window once you pass a certain threshold and all options are effectively on the table. Because everyone always has the capability to do what they want regardless of circumstances, no one has the ability to control or affect others.\n\nAt best, wars devolve into one side getting bored or annoyed enough to go away - not capitulate or surrender, just disperse or scatter. Corps and alliances aren't worth protecting because they don't really offer the individual things they cann't already get themselves.\n\nBit melodramatic I know, but thats how I roll at the hour of the wolf ¬_¬\n\nBut to put it another way, I guess it would be keeping their promise/vision of giving power to the players.\n\ntbh id be happy with anything, weather it benifitted me ingame or not, perhaps just access to a title in front of your name, every year you get an additional title unlocked. Militery based would be a start, perhaps confusing against actual player corp/allience roles but heh, better than absolutly nothing, not even a \"thanks for giving us money for 7 years you mug\" reward t shirt.\n\nOriginally by:Rawr CristinaWell it should only be some gimmick that's fun but not game affecting, like a title or something (as was said). Its not really what EVE does though and other games are full of this stuff, it is quite lame if not done well.\n\nOriginally by:DemolisharYu, dude, are an asshat, troll, missed the point and deserve to be steamrolled by the South.\n\nOp was about, say, you only want to fly one race. And you wnt to pvp. And you want to do so sub-cap. In that case you run out of options on the long run in, let me guess, 2.5 years? Op has a point, maybe introduce some rediculously hard to train skills that give boost to one race only. For the vets. Or lol let me get crzy introduce some **** that lets you channel skillpoints into it for some kind of boost like overheat or whatnot.\n\n orOriginally by:Arderich or100% signed, that's exactly the same way I see it (and I'm FAR from having 130 mil. SP).\n\nEdited by: Slade Trillgon on 09/04/2010 22:27:54 I do not think that the following is really necessary considering vets have the experiance which trumps all other things in EvE. Also, how would all you vets feel about getting something, and then someone that gets a lot of isk quickly, and then buys a high skill point vet? Do they get the treat also? That being said here is something that, in a similar form, I would not have trouble swallowing.\n\nThe following skills should only be available if you have only trained one races ships and have level 5 in all, so you could not train the Advanced Friate Command skill until you have trained Frig, Cruiser, BC, and BS to 5, and you must reach level 5 of the lower tier ASC skill to open access to the next higher ASC skill. I am no game balancer so the tiers of the skills may not reflect what is/is not resonable.\n\nOnce a pilot trains all 5 ASC skills to level 5 they can train other races but will never have access to the ASC skill for the other races. They can also stop training the ASC skills at any point to switch to another race, but once another races ships show up on the pilot's skill list then further ASC skill training for the initial race will be locked.\n\nYou could also do something similar for each weapon system with a .20 damage modifier per level and maybe even a set of skills for EW. All with the similar single race distinctions.\n\nOriginally by:Arderich... Now I have reached the limit of useful sidesteps because I refuse to train other races. Instead soon my only option will become to train annoying skills such as veldspar refining. ...\n\nMy heart bleeds for you and your self-imposed game play conditions. You could train for other race ships, and fly something like a nightmare?\n\nQuote:I mean the difference between a t2 pulse laser with scorch ammo compared to a t1 pulse with radio crystals is immense.\n\nYou're killing me. Perhaps you should compare Scorch to Ultraviolet instead? It gives you longer range, worse tracking, and a bit more damage. In addition it wears out faster.\n\nOne way of solving the problem of clones becoming too expensive is, perhaps, to not train so many skills? You've reached your cap, train up your alts to do something useful rangeThese wouldnt do anything for your combat skills, they would open up certain titles which in turn can open up something in a specific LP store, nothing fancy but something like a Royal Heat Sink for the Amarr. Same as the normal faction heatsink or maybe like 0.01% more damage. Same for the other races.\n\nHeck I am getting close to 10 standing with State again with my other char, and if I don't get miffed again I might not blow my standings again after camping on 9.99 for ages. Something at the end of that rainbow, not necceseraly an item but something like a special title would make such a goal worth working for.\n\nSame for other things I mentioned. It's not asif the vet's want a PWNmobile, but more as to something to train which atleast lies somewhat in line with your character and not being forced to train stuff totally unrelated and never going to be used on that char rangeyour so called 'game limitations' are self imposed.\n\nlike others have said, you can cross train into different races and fly different ships requiring different racial sub-skills. start opening up other tree skills then the game becomes a mystical nightmare for the newer players. there are enough skills in the game as it is - and i still remember my first undock years back thinking 'wtf do i do now' - game is complicated enough without having to factor in uncertain skill trees for 'specialisation' thats dependant on too many factors for new players to comprehend without reading up on resources that arent known until you have played the game for a while."

Neuts I might need a cap booster if I'm in a very cap heavy setup for instance. However with ECM I can't just stay out of Range (Webs) or move closer (Damps) I have to pray that the dice falls my way.\n\nDude you contradicted yourself. You said, \"I can do something different for other EWARs\" then fail to mention that their are both high and low slot ECCM modules, rigs (which I would never use), and implants which will lower your chance to be jammed. That and Falcons fly at about 1km/s so almost anything you'd roam in is faster and you could very easily escape deep into ECM falloff.\n\nAll of the counter options are gimmicky, expensive, effort, etc, but how else do you expect to beat someone using two accounts with one account otherwise?It's sort of the same logic as 'if we keep our fleet orbiting 20km off the anchor we'll be fine against bombers' because it's 1. not true and 2. a great way to welp a fleet.also viribus, you've got marlona sky in your corner, which has always been cause for me to step back and seriously re-evaluate where i went wrong in life.\n\nYeah it sucks when the happens, on the other hand, according to Kugu I believe that falcons are the best solo ships in eve and that I fly around in crucifier-only gangs that get rolled by entire fleets of griffins.\n\nIt's like arguing with children. It's hard to argue your point when you can't even sit them still long enough for your point to actually get through to themYes, you're right. Except that the anti-ECM mods/implants/rigs do absolutely nothing for your ship except for making it less susceptible to ECM. Scan res means you lock faster, lock range means your... why the fuck am I explaining this to you. Obvious fucking troll.\n\nIf you knew there were counters, but choose not to use them, why did you say there weren't any?\n\nBased on this and your whole \"HURRR BCS!\" I'm thinking you're just flat out bad at this game.\n\nPretty sure he said:\n\nThe number of counter-modules specific to ECM is a testament to how badly ECM needs to be changed, not the reason it's okay.\n\nFor this whole \"discussion\" thing to work you need to actually read posts before responding to them.\n\nPlus ECM counters all suck anyway. Even a drake with a full set of HG Talons, two firewalls and an ECCM has a 44% chance to get jammed by 3 caldari jammers from a falcon. And there's the whole idiotic idea that it's expected to sacrifice slots to fit mods which help your ship in no other way except to counter a single kind of electronic warfare. How the hell can anyone convince themselves that this is good game design?"

Am I just being negative or have other long-time Tyranid players been turned-off by the new codex?\n\nHoruswasduped\n\n29th April 2010, 14:55\n\nI don't think they designed it for beginners, other than the slight simplification by removing options. but when they take away, they usually give back with new. IE losing all the variants of carnifexes, spiperfex/godfex/dakkafex/ etc and gaining trygon/mawloc/tryprime/tyranofex was sheer genius from a model sales standpoint.\n\nJesterSinistry\n\n29th April 2010, 15:25\n\nExactly, good for GW, not for the people actually playing the game. I know that a lot of Nid players wanted to have the big big guys introduced, butSo after spending 3 codexes fine-tuning the army, they've waded in with a load of new models and completely changed the dynamic of many of the established models.\n\nI also don't feel massively motivated to model/paint a new Hive Tyrant and newer big guys, especially after spending a shed-load of time, money and effort on my winged hive tyrant and 2 carnifex models.\n\nGW does continue to test my patience!\n\nAngelofblades\n\n29th April 2010, 15:49\n\nSo after spending 3 codexes fine-tuning the army, they've waded in with a load of new models and completely changed the dynamic of many of the established models.\n\nGive this man an award, he's onto something here. /sarcasm\n\nHonestly, it's not about 3 eidtions of fine tuning, it's about keeping up pace with the current edition rule book. Also realize that though the dynamic of the established models may have changed, the tactics of the army really haven't. More tactical options have been introduced, while unit options have been taken away. Give and take, perfectly reasonable.\n\nIt makes total sense, new codex, new dynamics. There hasn't been a codex release to date, since the Chaos codex, that hasn't forced people to buy new models, to convert new units and try new things.\n\nobliter8or\n\n29th April 2010, 16:06\n\nIt's not just tyranids, it's every army that's getting 'simple'. Chaos is a good example.\n\nWith the new codex I was waiting for the ability to completely customise my bugs, something like:\n\nThe point is, I loved to be able to really 'evolve' my gaunts. Now I'm stuck to 2 kinds, while the essence of the tyranids to me (especially Gorgon) was adaptibilty and rapid evolution.\n\nLanceWarrior\n\n29th April 2010, 16:16\n\nbutYou were trying to be hugely sarcastic here right?\nNids players who dislike this codex are players who are dissatisfied that they have to actually use tactics to win games with this codex IMODurandal\n\n29th April 2010, 16:24\n\nWhile I have some disagreements with certain rules/stats/points, it is a solid 5th edition book.\n\nobliter8or\n\n29th April 2010, 16:37\n\nTrue, it's a solid 5th edition codex.\n\nThe thing I don't like about it is it's too simplistic for me, apart from a few minor things like, as Durandal said, the overpriced carnifex, old one eye, etc.\n\nI would've liked something more than just poisoned attacks and furious charge.\n\nMadMage\n\n29th April 2010, 19:26\n\nUhm... all of the Codicies that are coming out have been streamlined into pretty much straight up 'stock' units.\n\nYou can look at it as 'dumbing down' if you want, but personally I enjoy the simplified version. The old Chaos Codex, for example, just had too much crap and became confusing to read. \"Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to remove.\"\n\nPyroSikTh\n\n29th April 2010, 20:32\n\nNow where's my Tyranid Complaint topic gone :P\n\nMC Tic Tac\n\n29th April 2010, 20:38\n\nI'm going to stick my neck out and say..........\n\nOther the known issues with how the Doom works, this current nid codex is perfectly fine.\n\nOnly people I hear whining are old Nidzilla players.\n\nedmundblack\n\n29th April 2010, 20:43Durandal\n\n29th April 2010, 20:54\n\nSomeone who likes their heavy support be more then a bullet sponge?\nEDIT: Not that Trygons are bad, but their uses are limited.\n\nLanceWarrior\n\n29th April 2010, 22:07*Follows this line of thinking*\n\nJesterSinistry\n\n29th April 2010, 22:18\n\nI'm going to put it down to new book syndrome and play some games to find out what works and what doesn't. Actually writing out a few extra lists has given me a slightly better look at what's possible. I'm still going to use a winged Tyrant and just adjust my tactics.Nids players who dislike this codex are players who are dissatisfied that they have to actually use tactics to win games with this codex IMO.\n\nI quiteI do agree with this though, my thoughts would have been to introduce one different type of gaunt. thereby having something in between termigaunts and the old hormagaunts. But as I've said above, I'm going to give them a go and stick with it. The Nids have always treated me well.\n\nThe_Peacemaker\n\n30th April 2010, 01:37\n\nTo OP:\n\nGive the codex a try. This is one of the codex's where whats looks good/bad on paper differs from the actual gameplay.\n\nTips:\nWinged hive tyrants work fine, you just can't blinding move him forward. When he gets shot down remember to look at who did the shooting. Was it a 70pt IG infantry squad? or was it 800pts of Infantry/tank/special units.\nThe Tyranid Prime with boneswords is basically a mini-hive tyrant.\n\nNo frag grenades:\nThis is really what makes the nids need some tactics. You have very high Initiative all around so you will go first when your enemy is not in cover.\nRe-read the wording on assaulting into cover. Its says if the assaulting unit has to make a difficult terrain test then the count as Initiative 1. So watch for the lone marine or guardsman who is sitting on the side just outside of cover, charge him!\nIf your opponent wants cover so badly then he has to bunch up his units inside that ruin which means barbed stranglers hurt more. He has to decide which is more threatening.\n\nThe codex is very balanced. It does need an FAQ, and I personally think they limited the carnifex a bit too much. But thats more from a fun perspective.\nIf you cast feel no pain on him then he becomes a real monster.\n\nMadMage\n\n30th April 2010, 02:25I don't really run any Carnifex's and only had two before... but I'd still like to see the points cost a tad more reasonably balanced.\n\nTo be honest, I had never played a game with my nids yet. I got into them over a year ago, painted, made background stories, THE WORKS. The one thing I never had time to do though, is actually play a game with them. I have no idea what Nidzilla is, and I don't really care. With new rules comes new strategies! Why use old strategies that are extremely faulty now? With those of you who, unlike me, have played tons of games with the old nids, I recommend one thing: Forget old tactics. Come up with something new that the enemy won't expect.\n\nI do think that the codex has been simplified but like MadMage quoted:\n\n\"Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to remove.\"\nNow that there are new models out too, there are so many possibilities.\n\nDurandal\n\n30th April 2010, 02:51\nMadMage\n\n30th April 2010, 05:49The not having models things really agitates me. I hate when they put an option in the book that you can't even friggin field because I'm not a goddamn scupltor. Luckily, I have the perfect idea for WarriorPrimes - it's just an expensive idea.\n\nTarion\n\n30th April 2010, 12:06\n\nI quiteThere's a difference between \"requiring tactics\" and \"being bad\". And competitively, 4th edition Tyranids were bad in 5th edition, unless it was Nidzilla. They had no decent anti-tank, Fearless effectively crippled them in combat and they were hideously overcosted in comparison to Orks. There's only so much you can do with tacticsThere's a few reasons that this isn't a viable argument.\n\nMostly, it comes down to comparing in a vacuum. And that's exactly the mistake they made with 4th edition 'Nids. The value of tough creatures is related to how many you can take. When you can spam them, as the Tyranids are -very- capable of, they are much tougher. A mixed army, such as the Eldar are forced to run, can't abuse this.\n\nAlso, you need to look at what slots they're competing for. Wraithlords are competing with Fire Prisms, Falcons (Remember, its a 4th edition codex. Falcons were godly) and other, fairly good units. In the Tyranid codex, the Carnifex doesn't fall as far behind the other choices as the Wraithlord does behind the Eldar tanks.\n\nDurandal\n\n30th April 2010, 16:06\n\nIt was more to say that Carinies are slightly too much. I'm not saying they should be 90 points, but they cost more then a kitted out Prism, which seems a lot for a 4 wound T6 melee unit that can't get cover as easy.\nHell, another point- an 8 man squad of sternguard can kill a carnie in a single RF turn, cost the same, and are more versatile. Which is my point, how versatile is this very expensive monster you are buy? Naked, it isn't that great, it gets rerolls to hit, but it still has to get to something, and a single T6 model isn't hard to take down at range (use those kraks missiles you have for mechs). So then do we buy the upgrades, making it more expensive, or just spend the points on something else?\nMore to the point, it means the people with 6 carnifexs couldn't use a couple because the options changed, couldn't use another 2 because it isn't point effective at best, and have to go get new kits to build/convert the new, more useful options.\n\nAnd let's be fair, Falcons were godly because they took advantage of every rule they could in 4th :P .\n\nspediesteban422\n\n1st May 2010, 21:11\n\nI honestly think they were tired of people exploiting certain models (mostly the dakkafex) and wanted to keep that from happening again. They did a fairly good job, although they made a lot of things that used to be OP (fexes, flyrants, ect.) very VERY hard to use effectively.\n\nSure, they made some big changes to make a crapton more money (broodlord buff, completely changing the troop balance (spines to termies, gargoyle spams, ect) but they DID buff the models.\n\nIf you're looking for customization, there is over one metric crap-ton of different army styles you can build. Just look at every new unit (save pyrovore, because that guy deserves no love). Special characters are fun to use, Tyrannofex makes you think about what your MCs should be doing, tervigon has spawned (HA!) a ton of different strategies, trygon/mawloc have added a whole new element of thinking to strategy, hive guard have added some much needed anti-heavy (I'd say they are infinitely better than the old sniperfex) and the changes to old units make them basically not the same units at all.\n\nSure, you can't put 50 upgrades on your hormogaunts, but did you honestly want to? Since 2nd edition died the fun things you could do with biomorphs were almost gone, except saying just how much you wanted to customize something (like how many biomorphs you wanted on your flyrant or if you wanted to give your fex an extra point of something with your leftovers)."

      "text": "He's totally right. This is a beta, they should use the beta to try out different units, try reavers, try lurkers and goliaths if they turn out to be broken so what? Its a beta nobody cares. This is the time where you could still make significant changes, no, this is the time where you have to make significant changes to the game and try everything out to make it the best game possible.\n\nYou have to be very careful. If you give the community reavers and then take them away because they are imbalanced a lot of the community will disagree and will want to hold onto the reaver for nostalgia's sake.\n\nLook at the carrier. IT currently doesn't serve a useful role in the StarCraft 2 meta game. So they try to replace it with other units. Everyone flips their shit.\n\nDangling carrots in front of a community when you know that there is a low chance you will give it to them is a bad idea. Just let them do what they do.\n\nAt a non-BW perspective the Carrier is garbage. Just a big a-move capital ship. At least, Tempests require positioning and proper target fire. They promote other kinds of gameplay instead of making an army and dumb attack. What keeps the Carrier on the game to me, it's their relationship with the Tempest. You can use Tempest to get Carriers, and use Carrier to compensate the low DPS of the Tempest (just see the last Day9 daily, Nony made some sweet gameplay with those two ships).\n\nFor Swarm Hosts, they have a lot more potential than a completely figured out unit like the Lurker. There are a lot of cool mechanics that are appearing and making the unit more interesting (stream vs wave, splitting locusts, \"burrow, make locusts and move with locusts\", etc).\n\nWhat people don't understand about BW unit is that they can't be compared with these new unit. Lurkers, Goliaths an Carriers are units fully explored an mastered in another game. Swarm hosts are just starting to be used and explored. Even if they fill similar roles, they can't be compared, they're in situations too different.\n\nThe Carrier sucks because of Colossus. Anti-Air units in SC2 is hyper strong because they need to be able to kill Colossus extremely fast, which in turns makes balancing of capital ships like the BC and Carrier nearly impossible.\n\nLook at the carrier. IT currently doesn't serve a useful role in the StarCraft 2 meta game. So they try to replace it with other units. Everyone flips their shit.\n\nIt does serve a useful role in WoL, it just isn't a very good option since colossi are easier to get with robo being a requirement for detection and once your opponent have countered your colossi, (s)he's already countered a tech-switch to carrier.\n\nIf stargate can provide a viable alternative to robo (with oracle providing detection) - and afaik the goal is for this to happen - you can get carriers faster and may skip colossi completely.\n\nWhat happened with the carrier was that they were trying to make the tech-path it's in a viable option and then removed the sole reason we want that path to be a viable option in the first place. Sure, they introduced the tempest as a replacement to the carrier, but tempests can't replace colossi in the late-game the same way carriers can.\n\nI agree that making the stargate a more viable tech path will naturally make the carrier more viable. My point is many people don't want it to leave because of what it means to starcraft. People have that same emotion toward reavers.\n\nYeah, I've mentioned it before that I actually like the Tempest, it may be underpowered (not sure if the update changed this) but I think it's a cool idea. You can put pressure on your opponents from afar without sacrificing anything. The warhound on the other hand could be balanced, but it's a bland unit anyway. When it comes to it, it's much easier to balance any unit than it is to come up with an interesting unit.\n\nI would go back to playing Starcraft seriously if they brought back the Lurker and trashed the Swarm Host. Either overhauling or removing the Colossus would help too. Bringing back Reavers would help a ton as well.\n\nMore than anything though, Zerg needs Lurkers. I would fucking switch to Zerg if they just brought this unit back. The Swarm Host is just...I dunno. It's awkward. It's like a shitty, way less cool Lurker.\n\nHave you seen this and to a lesser extent other communities? People violently flip out every time something happens, even in the beta, that seems even slightly unbalanced or that they don't like for whatever stupid reason. Sadly, betas these days are PR exercises. For Blizzard most of the \"real\" work has already been done, and this beta is for small tweaks.\n\nFYI I am not FilterSC. I just posted this on his behalf so that his input can be added to the ever changing HoTS beta discussion. Whatever your opinion of his words it's only meant to be part of the conversation. The beta has already been proven to be very conscious of the community voice and FilterSC, at least on my opinion has always been an amazing voice of insight.\n\nIf you haven't already check out his Terran Bronze to Masters series as well as his Zerg Bronze to Masters series which he is still working on. (still praying for that protoss bronze to masters when he's finished with Zerg).\n\nGreat video. Fantastic analysis, unfortunately I think it's largely lost on people who don't know how to discuss game design without discussing balance. I used to be someone who supported the new units in WoL, but after several thousand 1v1 games I really feel that the core issues at the heart of WoL gameplay stem from poorly thought out replacements for BW units. Colossus/reaver is the purest and most obvious example, but the fact that the swarm host is just a lurker-wannabe (and widow mine, and warhound to an extent, etc. just being mimcs) speaks volumes.\n\nI especially love the fact that you noted that the reaper was a fundamentally broken design concept and still is, which is something still lost on the majority of SC2 players. A terran infantry raider unit simply has no place in the game at that tech level - such a unit is actually better suited to zerg (if it can even be balanced at all). It either becomes broken or useless with Terran, much like what happened with the Warhound.\n\nSame thing with the marine. The marine is the absolute definition of an imbalanced unit by design. That doesn't mean Terran is overpowered by any means - but you're absolutely right that the stats of that unit FORCE ridiculous shit like colossus and fungal from other races, which makes for a dumb game overall.\n\nThe fact that archon toilet is essentially the pvz endgame speaks volumes about the degenerate state of gameplay SC2 is currently in. You're absolutely right in that Blizzard needs to try new ideas, not try to balance broken ones - and unfortuantely I completely agree with the fact that the biggest holes in SC2 now are very BW-shaped. I never went into SC2 wanting BW2.0 - I wanted SC2. But after thousands of games, the units I missed most in ladder were lurker and scourge and for very good reasons.\n\nWhat frustrates me is we had incredibly in-depth and well thought out videos and posts like yours throughout the WoL beta, but they get drowned out in the sea of noise. WoL was especially bad on the zerg front - EVERYONE from all races thought zerg felt unfinished especially with the lurker cut (we all thought something would be added but zerg launched with only 9 units, including the hydralolisk). I even made many posts both here and on TL saying that if Blizzard launched with Terran in such a \"complete\" state design wise (with P in a near-complete but still rough state, and zerg highly highly underdeveloped - just look at what had to happen to the infestor in order to fix the balance) then when the expansions rolled around Blizzard was going to find that the Zerg holes were bloody obvious (no cloaked attacker, no ground control unit, no good \"initiator\" spellcaster the way the defiler was) - more importantly, they would find that they simply couldn't add anything to Terran as it was so \"complete.\" That's exactly what's fucking happened. They can't find shit to add to Terran because the race is stupidly well designed (they started on it, and spent the most time on it) meanwhile Zerg has design holes the size of the fucking Chicxulub crater since it was a rush job.\n\nI think he makes valid points. He mentions having old units isn't such a BAD thing. I mean we have marines, mutalisks, and HT, right? No one complained. Why not reavers, lurkers, and goliaths? I don't think they break the game and since balance is nearly impossible to perfectly achieve right away, just throw them in and see what happens. It's still beta so let's focus on gameplay and mechanics. This subreddit is so bent out of shape on what I think are pretty decent opinions all the time.\n\nWe need to bring more of the \"micro-y\" elements back, like the Carrier, i like the new spell caster zerg i feel like it is a step in the right direction. Units that get more out of the more you use them is key.\n\nRe-adding BW units would make thing far more interesting, but over all i feel Blizzard team need to put more focus on making fun \"micro-y\" units, not A-move friendly units, because that's not fun to play or to watch.\n\nWhile I don't exactly mind what the carriers do regardless of if they go BW style or WoL style I think that was just a mistake with BW programming that they \"fixed\" with WoL. If we bring that back I say we bring muta stacking back too.\n\nSarcasm? I am just pointing out it is simply a bug that people utilized as they did with the carrier tricks. Like I said I don't care what they do either way but I would love for them to bring back some of the old bugs.\n\nNo sarcasm at all, sorry if it came off that way. I loved that bug from BW. Call me crazy, but ZvZ in BW was my favorite match up to watch. Jaedong's Muta mico was amazing, and I loved towards the end of BW how Zero revolutionized late game ZvZ. I'm all for them bringing this back.\n\nAlthough I think he almost puts bw gameplay as the ultimate goal, I agree with a lot that he has to say.\n\nGameplay wise sc2 could be a lot better. Also I've always loved the idea of making units have a larger forced distance in between each other; it makes the battles longer and more entertaining instead of armies getting demolished in a second.\n\nBut damn. All those changes are so massive, I doubt blizzard would do any. I love sc2 but I really wish there was an alternative big rts that was better designed\n\nThe first several minutes of his diatribe are incomprehensible nonsense. CS and BW weren't \"trying\" to be difficult games, they were \"just fun\"? That is not analysis, that is viewing the past through rose-colored hindsight lenses. They were designed to be difficult games in that they had steep learning curves, intricate mechanics and nobody thought to ease that curve or reduce the complexity of play. Tutorials in a game have no bearing on the \"easiness\" or difficulty of the game. That depends purely on the mechanics. For instance, if Bliz takes out a-move mechanics and instead relies on micro-intensive counters, that raises the skill-level, and therefore difficulty of a game. It doesn't matter how many tutorials they slap unto it, you still have to master a more complex set of maneuvers and strategies to be effective. Had to stop playing the vid because the first five minutes were entirely meaningless.\n\nHonestly, am I the only one that thinks this? Blizzard sorta put themselves in this dilemma by shooting for the \"3-expansion\" installment set for SC2.\nI can't even fathom units that Blizzard will have to pull outta their asses for the last installment. It's like they're being forced to create new units..\n\nI think the beta is a great forum for trying out new units in the game. But to go for the old broodwar units right away? I'm not so sure about that. I like new stuff. New units that add different playstyles from what we've seen before.\n\nWhat about a warhound that has a small anti-air splash? What about making the Thor's 250 mm cannon anti-mech?\n\nyou could give protoss a fast shooting unit like the hellion but with it's own appeal. that would open up different harass options. You could balance the game so toss don't have to use forcefields to rely on survival. It's kind of a make-or-break-unit.\n\nThis is what I've been saying! I vote for trying this. Nobody ever gets that upgrade, why not simply replace it with the ability to give thors haywire missiles as a casted ability to break tank lines.\n\nAnd this works with TvP mech too cause thors then would be good against immortals and Tempests would be good against thors with their +massive. (that's assuming by release balance will be done just like FilterSC says it will)\n\nI'd love to see the Thor upgraded with some rocketpacks that let it hop short distances. Not like up a cliff or anything, of course.\n\nI'd really like to see either/or upgrades for things. You can either get ground haywire or air haywire missiles, for example, but not both. kinda like the mutas > corruptors > brood lord evolution tree.\n\nI have watched the video and I have to say I agree wtih almost everything.\n\nI have always, always said that Blizzard NEEDS to add those old school BW units and not throw in random stuff. I have made countless thread saying let's replace Colossus with Reaver; Let's add Warhound and remove the Thor (as it turns out both of them would work well atm). Tanks should do twice the damage they do but should overkill (focus fire, bitches). Tempest/Sc2 Carriers? NO, BW Carriers+no minerals for interceptors + faster build time.\n\nAnother idea I had in past is: Force tech for upgrades. What does that mean ? Zerg is forced to get Hive for 3/3.\nLet's make Protoss/Terran forced as well. How? Well, in BW you had to get Templar archives for 3/3, right (I might be wrong). What was wrong with that? Let's make in SC2 that you have to get Fleet beacon for +3 at Protoss and Fusion Core for +3 at Terran. Also last but not least. Merge the ship&mech armor upgrades. Why? Tech transitions, that's why. Zerg/Toss can do this kind of stuff (more or less), but Terran is forced to the one thing they started in early game (some air transitions, yeah, but almost never in a normal game)\n\nThe one thing I didn't approve is the stacking of units. That's the way it is right now and what should happen is the following thing. Don't just make the units unclump manually. Make the player forced to split them otherwise they'll die. Make the clumped ball die to even lower supply of clumped units. Basically nerf the death \"ball\" and buff the death \"spread\".\n\nI don't have time to look it up right now, but I seem to remember someone made a custom where they slightly increased the units' separation and it was like a completely different game. It discouraged \"death balls\" and felt a lot more BW-esque.\n\nI prefer the option of adding new units, rather than recreating BW; that being said, Blizzard's current team doesn't seem to be capable of that level of ingenuity and would do well to at least consider reavers and such.\n\nI like the upgrades fine the way they are. I like that the three races have different upgrade paths. I'm fine with having an all-mech, or all-air army if it's viable. The races already have too many similarities as it stands: every race has an AOE spell caster (HSM sucks but EMP functions as an alternative in TvP), every race has a dedicated air-to-air fighter (granted, the phoenix kinda sucks), and with the additions of the tempest and swarm host every race will have a long-range siege unit. I want to have every race be as different as possible, and unifying the upgrades, just \"because the other races have it easier\" takes the game further from this.\n\nLets make it happen. We have the map editor. We should build a map and make it possible to choose different bw units that can be toogled on and off before a round and will be avaible for that round, to test them out!\n\nMaybe they'll add these ultimate BW units in the last expansion to make it buying worthwile. If we put BW units in Hots and the game would be perfect, then what are they gonna do in lotv? That would mean that they have to fix something that is NOT broken(=BW units in sc2). That's the only downside I see when adding BW units in this stage of the game.\n\nLiked this video, and I also agree on the points of how fundamentally broken the design ideas are, and one dimensional.\n\nThe discusson of balance often when discussing with people that are smart often understands that the design is whats wrong not the balance, infestors atm, is so fucking powerful it's kinda boring. But then again, if we look at the others races zerg really needed that, the deathball from tosses and marines balls etc.\n\nIf they just swallowed their pride and started looking into the design of it self rather then trying to patch every hole that popes up it would be a better game for it.\n\nJust remove all bad designs, couloousses, infestors,thors mothership,broodlords and make siege tanks stronger again (and/or the marine / maruder). And find replacements for those units in some shape or form, and it would be all better for it. In so many ways, spectator wise and specially for players.\n\nOk, so I only watched about the first 5 minutes of this video because I wasn't willing to spend my time watching all 20 minutes of it so maybe he changes his tone toward the end.\n\nGuess what. The reason he and his friends found Brood War so fun was because it came out when he was at a young age and could spend hours of his time on it. There are currently young people who are loving SC2 just like how he loved Brood War because they can spend hours upon hours every day playing it.\n\nIt's weird to me that none of these crazy Brood War fanatics have yet realized that the reason they loved Brood War so much was because it consumed their time as a free young student. I wasn't a brood war fanatic, but I had my own games of that kind. I loved to death Battlefield 1942 and other games, but I loved them because I had limited money and wanted to get good at specific games.\n\nYes, there are genuinely some things that Brood War did better than SC2 but honestly this whole \"Oh my god make SC2 like Brood War because I grew up playing it!!!\" is getting old.\n\nAttention people who grew up playing brood war, you are now old. Currently, there are people just like how you played Brood War playing SC2. Just because you have grown up and can't dedicate all your time to a single game like you could as a high school student doesn't make one game worse than the other.\n\nTLDR: If the only reason you think that Brood War is better than SC2 is because you could spend hours upon hours playing it, but can't do the same with SC2 then it's not because SC2 is a worse game, it's because you grew up.\n\nBrood War and SC2 are two totally different games. I love a lot of what SC2 has added to the mixture. I talk a lot about BW in the video, probably too much actually, but the main reason I talk about some of the stuff is I think some units would integrate into sc2 and how it's played extremely well.\n\nThe point of the video though is that Blizzard should be exploring it's options and not simply putting a black curtain over old BW stuff. Guess what half the units in SC2 came from BW anyway, so why draw the line against units from that game now?\n\nI don't want BW with better graphics, I want SC2 with better gameplay. Right now Blizzard seems very focused on balancing HoTS instead of exploring their options for gameplay mechanics. I would love the development team to put in and try out some of the old BW units, declumping of the small units etc and see how it all plays out.\n\nAt the end of the day I want a better game. I don't like the current approach of balancing units and trying to balance HoTS. I'd rather Blizzard tried many different things and worked out balance as things progressed.\n\nTerran/Zerg/Protoss has to\n1)Make Vikings/Corrupters/Colossus\n2a)Engage without having his main army hit much, while killing the Colossus\n2b)Engage in a better concave than his Protoss opponent\n\nReaver Example\nProtoss Makes Reavers\n1)Do I load them in drops and risk losing them?\n2)Do I have a big deathball that does tons of damage?\n3)Do I keep my stuff spread out with mutliple attack points, using the reavers to wreck mineral lines at base a and b?\n4)Do I use a small taskforce to take out his forth while using my reaver heavy main army to prevent an engagement through the choke at his natural?\n\nTerran has to\n1)Have Turrets to defend against drops\n2)Keep good map vision to avoid exposed bases being raided by small groups of units\n3)Stay spread out and not fight in chokes to take on the main army\n4)Does NOT have to make a specific counter to Reavers, but has to play smart and positionally/skillfully sound.\n\nZerg/Protoss have to do similar things to avoid Reavers, but I won't go into too much detail.\n\nWhich is more exciting to watch? What is more fun to play with? What is more fun to play against?\n\nHoTS is a huge chance for SC2 to fix some of the issues the game has and be even better going forward. I really hope Blizzard can maximize the potential the game has.\n\nI agree with a lot of what you said, I think that they should not be rushing to get HOTS out, I think they should take more time to test things out. I don't know how I would feel about the reaver but it requiring more micro than the COL is a good thing.\n\nI have to say though, the game being more fair/balanced does make it a lot more fun for me.\n\nI want them to either make the other races harder (adding units that require more micro and lose if they don't micro them correctly) to play or make Terran easier (balance warhound instead of removing it). We can't all have pro micro.\n\nI like knowing that if I have more skill than someone else I'm probably going to beat them and not lose because they have easy units they can attack move into me while I have to micro to try and trade evenly.\n\nDont you seriously think blizzard allready tried all this stuff out? There actually have been so many Alpha Build of WoL allready with so many units in that that have been removed later on. Reavers for example, or even another version of the tempest. And I'm totally sure that they tried similar stuff for HotS allready.\n\nAnd don't forget: This beta is meant to balance the game to a degree that it can be shipped in a reasonable amount of time. Experimenting in ways like you describe is simply not realisitic if they want to release the game in the next few month, since it can throw of balance a whole lot.\n\nAnd yes: Units are made to counter other Units. This is what makes for a good competitive game. This is what distinguishes games like Starcraft from other good RTS game, which arent really good for competitive play because they followed another philosophy.\n\nIf you could just make the units you desire, because they are fun to use and would still be able to win, then the game has no inner balance and the skill ceiling would be lowered significantly because decission making is one of the most important aspects that make a good player.\n\nThis is not to meant to take anything from you. I agree on most of these point and yeah, I would really love to get the colossus removed from the game, since it is a really boring unit. However, just because it is beta, it doesn't mean you can do whatever you like to try, since you have at least some rough timing schedules to keep in mind.\n\nI never played BW growing up, I played CS 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6 and competed on a national level. I just started playing SC2 about a year ago, and I would much rather that SC2 would be more like BW. The way this game works right now is \"build these units, because these units beat the units the other guy can build\" not \"build these units, because you want to use them, because they are fun to use in the following ways.\" Honestly, do you think people build colossi because they are fun to use? they sure as hell don't look fun to use. You control group them, and press a, then click the ground. Sure you can micro them a little, but essentially, thats what you do with colossi. And why do they get built so much? because they are really good against what terrans, and zergs build. In other games (like the ones Filter mentions later in the video) you bought guns because you wanted to use them because they were fun to use, you built units to use because they were fun to use etc etc. You didn't simply build the unit, or buy the gun, because you wanted to have the better unit or the better gun. It is incredible how in SC2 there is such an obvious skill ceiling between the three races. And why is that? because the units for each race are designed with \"countering the other unit\" in mind, not \"we designed this unit to do this thing, and it does it really well, and that makes it fun to use.\"\n\n90% of what makes SC2 hard is the mechanics not the micro so i don't see how making the collosi easy to use lowers the >>>>unreachable<<<< skill ceiling. This is a strategy game aswell so building units that are fun to play isn't going to be smart and I don't know any good strategy game where building what is the most fun unit is supposed to be viable, that nor do I think they should balance the game so that all units are equally good versus all units just so that you can play with the most fun units, it is just plain stupid.\n\nno one is asking for all units to be good versus all units. I'm asking for better game design on the units that are currently in the game. Units like the colossus were created because protoss needed an answer for terran's bio forces (i.e. they were created as a counter to marines). The colossus wasn't created with gameplay in mind, it was created with \"we need to have something for protoss to use that deals with marines.\" This is a bad idea when it comes to gameplay because of the problems it presents with actually building colossus. If you build colossus, you can't actually use them independently, they have to have gateway support units, and those units have to be nearby, which limits your options in what you are actually able to do with that unit during the game, which makes for a more boring game.\n\nMy friend and I complain about this very topic all the time. So many of the units within SC2 are so one dimensional. They fill a specific role they were designed for and for the most part can't be used creatively in other situations. This causes the units to be boring.\n\nExample: lets make battle hellions so tarren can 1a them with the rest of their bio...man that sounds really fun...really interesting. Not a whole lot of creativity here.\n\nThe same thing goes with the majority of the spells in sc2 vs broodwar. When a spell is used in broodwar its places the the user at some type of advantage which the other player can then react to in hopes of mitigating the spell. That doesnt occur at all in SC2. Fungals, Forcefields, Emp, Vortex, Viper Pull, etc. all these things just happen. And once they happen the end result is in. The other player cant do anything once the spell occurs. Its not interesting to play against and its not interesting to watch.\n\nnot going to happen. even if the points are valid which thy are for the most part and blizzard probably knows that. its to late you would have to redesign the whole game. because everything is balanced around spells and game ending units.\n\na unit that spawns free units in an economy based game fuck yeah. and now we get another one wooohoooo.\n\nbut the carrier has to pay for the units because thats how it worked in bw and there has to be a reason for it right?. but for the brood lord and wannabe lurker we throw consistency and basic rules out of the window.\n\nand then they talk on forums about consistency.\n\nbut hey they stick to the 3spells caster mechanic... yeah im mad because such vods remind me of how the game could have been -.-\n\nBased on Dustin Browder and David Kim's recent posts, I feel like they are finally \"getting\" what is wrong with SC2. Unfortunately, they're way too far into the HOTS development cycle to do much about it now.\n\nI'm already writing HOTS off and pinning my hopes on LOTV. Here's hoping they throw everything out the window and come up with a worthy successor to BW.\n\nHe didn't say balance shouldn't be a consideration. What he's arguing for is that game mechanics, such as how each race works mechanically, is being overlooked as part of the process with the ever-changing HoTS.\n\nI think his primary point is that instead of focusing on JUST balancing units and unit compositions that taking a good look at the gameplay mechanics will actually enhance the discussion around balance and help solve some of the key fundamental issues that people have been complaining about for along time. They have a good opportunity to do so with HoTS.\n\n\"Thors are bad anti-air.\" This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.\n\nEDIT: sorry to insult you. I agree with most everything you said. Just thors are soooo sooo strong in anti-air, against all units not just mutas. I would say that just adding another unit rather then changing the thor is best.\n\nFor the cost of the unit, its bulkiness, and its overall versatility, the Thor is pretty weak. Against mutas or banshees sure, but the Terran's other options are Marines or Vikings which are Terran's options against air.. vikings are a hard counter to any air unit, and while you CAN transform them into a ground unit, it's slow and bulky and so weak that you'll lose half of them by the time they're finished transforming. Thors are bad anti-air, especially when they're your only counter to brood lords other than having a massive count over their corruptors with your vikings.\n\nso it has the highest dps ground and air in the game... it two shots all the light air units... repair scv's and helions stop zerglings from attacking it... how is that weak? its area effect means it rips all air units apart. its range means it hits broodlords before their broodlings attack, so thus they kill broodlords 1 for 1. how is that weak?"

      "text": "Warhammer 40K Forum\n\nHas anyone used dark reapers in 3-man squads just to take an exarch with a Tempest Launcher and perhaps crack shot, hide them behind a building and just indirect fire the tempest every turn. My brother told me the Tempest does not need line of sight, so such a small squad effectively becomes like a shorter ranged, easier to conceal, more powerful hit than a 6 man Imperial Guard mortar squad (for about twice the points cost).\n\nIt seems to me that the typical 5-man squad of reapers is a bit of overkill, and requires line of sight (which they will undoubtably be denied if your opponent has any common sense). It is horribly expensive, and likely will not win back its points, whereas using the squad as an excuse for the tempest will, firstly, keep it out of LOS and most likely survivable, and secondly, always have a shot. The addition of Crack shot means that nobody within 36\" is safe. Does this seem like a good idea?\n\nIt does work. However remember that you will be rolling scatter when firing the Tempest Launcher. 2d6 taking the highest for enemies that are not in LOS and 1d6 for enemies that are in LOS. It is a high risk high reward. Personaly while Reapers are excellant MEQ killers they are also a #1 target. They are hard to protect.\n\nMy general use for Reapers is long-ranged point of entry denial. You can't easily target Reapers that are 5\" from the table board when every other unit in the army is in front of it.\n\nAs for Reapers being overkill: ...lolwhut? Five-man Fast Shot Reapers squads are only 11 shots. On average, that's only 3-4 wounds on a Marine squad a round. I've even added an Autarch to the squad just to make it 13 shots on occasion.\n\nGuiding a Reaper squad is evil. Aside from that, I find that they don't hit enough, despite hitting on 3's, to be of use in small numbers.\n\nAnd I've contemplated the whole \"Crack/Fast Shot Tempest Launcher\", but wounding Marines on 4's doesn't cut it for a big upgrade like that. Also: Scatter. I'd rather take an EML and Fast Shot to tankbust over that. Reapers are pretty survivable for Eldar units, and if you're firing from in cover, they can be rather annoying to try to killAnother option might be a 3-man squad with exarch lugging a missile launcher. Obviously give him fast shot. This makes that squad a threat to armor as well, although you do need LOS :-\\. The range on the weapon makes this acceptable, however.\n\n__________________\nI find that bringing a .38 to battles greatly increases my army's effectiveness against TEQs and Monstrous Creatures...\n\nif you give 5 reapers LOS of a lot of the board no one will go there.\nOr if they do they will be hit so bad that that the models fly of the board and hit the wallAnd I've contemplated the whole \"Crack/Fast Shot Tempest Launcher\", but wounding Marines on 4's doesn't cut it for a big upgrade like that. Also: Scatter.\n\nAgainst marines, I'd use crack shot instead of fast shot. One less template, but ignore cover and get a re-roll on the wounds. Don't forget the pinning check too.\n\nFor a three-man squad, with upgraded exarch, you're looking at just over 150 points. They're not going to die, as they're deployed out of line-of-sight, and with AP3, they're going to kill some stuff during the game. Victory point denial is a valid strategy. In a cleanse mission, they secure your home quarter. They serve as insurance against opponents that are hopping from terrain to terrain.\n\nI don't think this is a bad way to run them at all. The fact that they're not easily targettable means that they only have upside. Unlike normal reaper configurations, which can be blasted off the board by long-range fire before they ever fire, these guys are sticking around, they're points that your opponent won't be earning."

      "text": "I've said it before, and this time, I'm going to write an entire blog post about it. Titan guns are massively, stupidly, annoyingly, ridiculously over-powered. One of my beefs with Perpetuum Online when I was writing about it here semi-regularly was the fact that larger robots targeted just as fast as smaller robots and they had many more mid-slots in which to fit the PO equivalent of Sensor Boosters. So, the larger PO robots got the ability to double-dip: they had more guns to fire and they had the ability to target those guns more quickly than a smaller PO robot could counter-attack. This was a dumb mechanic. I haven't revisited PO to see if it's been fixed.\n\nIn the meantime, we have the same thing going on in EVE Online with Titan gun tracking.\n\nI sometimes play a miniature war-game that involves man-size targets, vehicle-size targets, and warship-size targets all on the same battlefield. In this game, when a vehicle attacks a man, it does so at a large penalty. This happens despite the fact that the vehicles are presumably quite advanced, with excellent computer-controlled targeting systems. When a warship-size target attacks a man-size target, the very large penalty is doubled, making a hit essentially impossible.\n\nAnd let's be clear here: a Titan solo killing a dictor with its guns is roughly the equivalent of a battleship solo killing a Warrior II with its large guns. Or a warship in the miniature war-game I play shooting a parrot off the shoulder of a man-size target.\n\nI'm annoying Seleene here because when I pointed out this kind of kill to Seleene, he made a very large production number of the fact that while the Titans were applying DPS, it was allied Loki and Proteus strategic cruisers applying target painters and webs that made those kills possible. And while this statement is factual, it isn't really true. As super-capital ships, Erebus Titans have six mid-slots, equal to or more mid-slots than any other Gallente ship in the game. And Erebus pilots fill those slots with Tracking Computers. Oh my, do they ever. An unbonused Titan gun tracks at 0.0067. Slot four good quality Tracking Computers into those mid-slots, pop a Drop booster, and this rises to 0.022 or higher.\n\nOr put another way, that's better tracking than my tracking enhanced Tornado and nearly as good as my tracking enhanced arty-fit Hurricane.\n\nDear Heaven, does this need to be fixed.\n\nOh, and just in case someone says \"Jester, you tard. That kill is a fluke. That Flycatcher pilot was obviously doing something dumb. It was just blind luck that that Titan soloed it.\" Uh huh. Right. What were you saying?\n\nFirst, given the fit on that dictor, I think it's reasonable to assume that the pilot wasn't using top-notch manual flying to maintain transversal as he moved. In fact, I'd be willing to bet he was either burning directly at the titan or sitting still. Idiots in bad fits dying in stupid ways don't have any implications for game balance one way or another.\n\nSecond, the titan's guns have a signature resolution of 1000 whereas BS turrets have a sig res of 400, i.e. the BS guns have a built-in 2.5-fold tracking advantage* that isn't apparent if you just look at the rad/s values. Unfortunately, the word 'tracking' has two different meanings - there's the definition used in the tracking formula, which loosely equates to the speed at which the turret can be rotated, and there's the more general concept of tracking as \"the ability to apply damage to a moving target.\" While a Titan may have similar tracking to a BS in the first sense, the difference in signature resolutions means that it is much, much worse in the second (and more important) sense.\n\nThis same Titan pilot has solo kills on more than a dozen smaller ships: dictors, cruisers, and small-sig tier3 BCs. I find it difficult to believe that all of them are flying stupidly. It would also seem to indicate that he's not having a signature problem with his guns.\n\nTitans in combat use an overview ordered by transversal, meaning that the pilots flying stupidly or standing still appear at the top of the list. When you are faced with hundreds of hostile ships at a time on a regular basis, finding a few dozen badly flown targets over time isn't hard.\n\nBy the way I do think that sig radius should be made more important in the tracking formula, and that nerfing titan damage projection would be one of several significant benefits of that change.\n\nI just disagree with how alarmist and weakly informed (compared to your generally high standard of posting) your statements on this issue are.\n\nThe comparison to a battleship hitting a warrior II is apt, as long as you take into account that the battleship has no tank mods fit and the warrior II is MWDing towards it. (In which case I could easily blap warrior IIs all day in a geddon)\n\nJester, there is a simple solution to the problem, the current tracking formula uses tranversal speed and signature radius as two inputs to create a single hit/miss result.\n\nIf you decouple these two inputs, and first use the speed to determine if a titan can follow with its gun a small ships like a interdictor, it makes a 2nd pass to see if its HUGE ammo size can actually hit squarely such a small target. Its been discussed to death on FHC btw\n\nNo. This is incorrect. Pretty much your entire post is incorrect. Sorry to say it.\n\nThis kill was an instance of massive stupidity on the part of the flycatcher pilot, incredible luck on the part of the Titan pilot, or both.\n\nWhile you can get the nominal tracking of the guns above 0.02 and paint the shit out of the target, this doesn't mean that even cruiser-sized targets are easy to hit.\n\nSmall, medium, large, and x-large guns all have this attribute, uniform across the entire size class, called Signature Resolution. For small guns, it's 40m; medium: 125m, large: 400m, and x-large: 1000m. This is the UNIT that the turret's tracking is measured by. When you look at a gun's tracking, its tracking ability is proportional to that number of radians of transversal per second AGAINST A TARGET WITH THAT SIGNATURE RADIUS. Essentially, a Hurricane with 720mm artillery, using Tremor ammunition, no tracking-enhancing modules, and no skills WHATSOEVER still tracks TWICE as well as a blaster-fit titan with the tracking speed you described.\n\nI reiterate: This is a very silly kill. Seleene was right. This is by no means an expected result, and you can by no means compare Titan tracking ability to that of a smaller ship unless that ship has as little tracking as you can possibly get. If you do in fact go full-retard with webs and painters, it is possible to get a Titan to hit relatively small targets, but it takes considerable doing as anyone who actually uses tracking titans can tell you.\n\nOh, and as a final note, you may notice that the Lachesis has 7 mid slots, one more than the Erebus.\n\nAgain, this same Titan pilot has more than a dozen solo kills against small sig targets. I find it difficult to believe that all of them were flying stupidly. And that's just one PL Titan pilot. I'd bet I'd find hundreds of Titan solo kills against small targets if I looked.\n\nSure, ordering targets by transversal as Raivi points out above is one reason... but I find it hard to believe it's the sole reason.\n\nThe simple fact is that Titans have no business gunning down small targets. You can justify the opposite as often as you like, but it doesn't change that simple fact. The USS MISSOURI's main battleship guns should not knock an attacking aircraft out of the sky except perhaps once in that ship's career, and that by stupid blind luck.\n\nYou can't keep guns from killing something. If it's theoretically possible to use a really damn big gun to destroy something for cheap, someone's gonna figure out how to do it. You're getting overly worked up about something that really isn't a big deal, or even very surprising.\n\nI mean, for Pete's sake, this kill hardly occurred in a vacuum (  ). There were numerous supercapitals on the field, probably spread quite far apart, and if he's being careful and watching for it, it is completely feasible for him to pick them off when they're at range without transversal. It's damn near impossible to keep low transversal against everything on the field. Nor am I surprised that he's the only one on the mail; PL isn't known for firing on targets willy-nilly when they should be focusing on primaries.\n\nThis is a pilot taking some initiative to pick off the tackle around his supercap buddies and the rest of his fleet when he has the opportunity, and I think you are vastly exaggerating and over-sensationalizing the whole thing. Until you actually do find \"hundreds\" of solo-kills of post-Crucible titans gunning down lone Sabres, Hawks, and Stilettos, I should think it's best you let this one lie.\n\nAnd the titans do all the work... The onyx doesn't have any damage on a single kill.\n\nA scimitar got molested by the titan, and I know for a fact that A.) the pilot of the scimitar (despite being on the account of a not very good isk ratio toon) is a very good pilot and does not make egregious errors that would allow a titan to track and kill him. In addition, I know the pilot of the scimitar was running a BOOSTER dropping his sig radius down even further (I believe he said his sig radius was below 70 or 60 with the booster running).\n\nHow does a titan hit that? There is something fundamentally wrong with Titan guns that can track that.\n\n• Reduce minimum damage (from 50% base to, say, 5%?). Problems: will fuck with like-on-like battles, especially at the lower sizes where transversal is a bigger factor. Actually, I think the effect will be so asymmetric across size classes it's be a nightmare to balance properly. • Add another, independant, damage mod (sigrad/sigres post-multiplier, capped at 1.0?). Problems: Kind of a blunt instrument. Feels a bit static. Also blurs the line between turrets and missiles, but I don't really think the two systems are close enough for us to risk screwing the poodle here. • Rejig the turret formula. Something like H = 0.5^((ωp/ts)^2 + (pr/as)^2 + (max(0, r - o) / f)^2) (ω = ang velocity, p = sig res, t = tracking, s = sig rad, a = some coefficient, r = range to target, o = optimal, f = falloff), perhaps. Problems: Complicated. Difficult. Probably a huge number of unforseen consequences in every area of the game. Side benefits: we finally disentangle tracking from signature, so that \"I can hit fast things\" is not coterminous with \"I can hit small things\".\n\nHonestly, I think we need to ask ourselves first whether we have a problem with tracking in general or just with XL guns, because if it's the latter all we need to do is increase their sig res by a few orders of magnitude (and adjust capital sig res accordingly ;)). Target painters/tracking links are stacking penalised, right?\n\nNo, dude. Besides the fact that it seems you might not have the firmest grasp on the way turrets work now, this is a terrible idea. You seem to be asking simply that all tracking equations be squared, or that all turrets be turned into missiles, in equations that don't even make sense when you think about them. The current turret equations actually make sense, as a basic simulation of guns tracking and hitting moving objects more or less directly.\n\nMy understanding here is that there are two issues: first, there's the game design issue of \"should a titan be able to hit something cruiser-sized or smaller, ever\", second there's the attitude of \"that's how it works, dumbass.\"\n\nWhat I see in these comments is people jumping straight on to the \"that's how it works, dumbass\" issue before bothering to think that Jester's actually trying to address the \"should this be possible, from a game design point of view.\"\n\nThere's not denying that Titans are currently capable of shooting frigate-sized objects out of the sky. The question is: should this even be possible from a game design perspective?\n\nNote that applying an inverse-square reduction of damage based on the difference between weapon sig resolution versus target size isn't really going to help: one round of antimatter charge XL from an Erebus is going to do somewhere in the order of 1000 damage in the first place, and the Erebus has 6 of those. If the Erebus can hit you at all, that Flycatcher is going to be taking significant damage.\n\nThere's a sister issue to the \"should it be possible\" which is \"how possible\". If an Erebus can hit a Flycatcher or Scimitar, should it be able to apply a significant amount of damage?\n\nWith a signature resolution of 1000m and a target size of about 100m, the damage should be reduced by about a factor of 100: this is the ratio (1000m)^2 / (100m)^2\n\nPerhaps the tracking formula needs to be tweaked too: rather than simply dividing the two numbers, the inverse square needs to be applied.\n\nI reiterate how PL was able to camp in an Alliance into a station using only two Titans, a mobile bubble anchored on said Titans, and an Interdictor. Sure, the reason a big fleet didn't form was due to the high probability of every PL character showing up the second it undocked, but those two Titans killed just about everything that undocked and didn't properly redock.\n\nHonestly, I don't understand why Titan guns need any tracking. Sure, they're supposed to be able to shoot \"small\" capitals like carriers and dreads, but that's like shooting rockets at icebergs. Make them choose; damage-fit for structure bashing, and this \"tracking fit\" to bring their tracking up high enough to hit a carrier in transversal and pretty much nothing else.\n\nTitans should be great at Structure Bashing. Should be great at shooting Supercarriers, Dreadnaughts, Carriers. Titans fit with a tracking mod should be good at hitting battleships. Titans fit with 2-3 tracking mods should be ok-good hitting battlecruisers. A 4th tracking mod makes them consistently hit battlecruisers. Anything beyond the 4th tracking mod should give no extra bonus. A titan with 4 meta-14 tracking mods should only be able to hit a cruiser at speed about 1/25 times. 20 Cruisers with logistics should be a threat to kill a Titan that has little to no support. The titan should not be able to have a field day.\n\nThere is a tiny piece of information that you forgot to include in your math Jester, and that is that an XL gun will track as good as you mentioned - against an XL target. EVE tracking formula 101 you know? An XL gun tracking a small target will have abyssmal tracking and nowhere close to your numbers.  from about 5:00 :)"

      "text": "Thanks,\n\nDuncan\n\nI have wanted a game like that forever. It would be awsome. I don't know of FFG has any plans for it, but I would buy it.\n\nAs for capital ships like Star Destroyers and MC80's, I would like to see fighter opperate the way they do in Axis and Allies War At Sea. It really captures the fact that fighter don't opperate on the same scale at all.\n\ni would be happy with no collisions, as the game is representing a 3d area of space on the flat plane of a table. i would imagine that if a ship moves onto another ship after all movement is finished then they should move over the top of that ship, if they stopped when they hit the ship that would give the collision causer a very easy shot, whereas moving them over penalises them for bad flying.\n\nI totally get that. It's a valid point. [For those of you have heard the following before, forgive my repetition.] I think the 3D element is exactly why there should be no cover in this game. You should be able to shoot at any fighter as long as they are in range. None of this, \"You can't shoot him 'cause this guy's closer\" nonsense (except for Biggs, but that's a different story). However, the fact remains that we are playing in 2D, so if you move and your movement would place you on top of another fighter's base, you still have to put you fighter somewhere and justify why it's not ending where the movement guide says it should. I think declaring that a collision takes place adds more tactics because you want to close range to get attack bonuses, but you don't want to get so close that you crash.\n\nSo, I guess even if they chose not to do collisions, I'd still like to see some solid rules on how to place a fighter that is about to overlap another fighter's base. You can't just say, \"Oh, I'll shift him this way a bit,\" because like I said above, it's too subjective. They need hard and fast rules for how to deal with that situation."

Even the default AI design cannot be built(The base size is 745), and both building and maintenence costs are ridiculously huge. And this will only get worse as tech moves on(And becomes more expensive) rather than better.\n\nConsider that even a well armed and shielded base will cost around 5000. Why is the Resupply ship costing 200,000-300,000?\n\nA resupply ship is more or less simply a movable self-refueling base. Given that it is about as well defended and shielded (at least originally) as a small base, can move around AND can refuel itself and any needy ships, its pretty much a cornerstone of any fleet and therefore, pretty much justifies the cost. You can always resort to making a network of gas mining stations with loads of docking bays at strategic intervals as an alternative to the resupply ship but that will still not be as convenient as one resupply ship and not to mention, you have to fly your constructors all over the shop to make said stations which will take time.\n\nYou are paying alot for one resupply ship but the associated benefits such as time, convenience, mobility and mouseclicks that you manage to save or that come with it are well worth the cost."

      "text": "everything seems a hit or miss, me and my friend linty had very similar sci skill tree spec and had charged partical bursts that were almost 1000 in difference. same captain traits and ship gear.\n\ncome on cryptic... what the hell...Wait until you hit Vice Admiral and can't even spend all of the points you've accrued. It happened to us on Tribble, I think I had over 100 skill points left that I could never spend because nothing costs 100 points anymore.\n\nAll they've done is \"streamlined\" the process by removing a lot of skills and combining several into one skill. Since there are less skills, they charge more for them. So, you have to take it for what it is. It's a mess, but so was the old system. What they really need is better skill trees, like a lot of other MMORPG and regular RPG games have. (most have skills that cost one point or a few points, but you have to buy skills to unlock them) However, I doubt that's coming in the near future.\n\nBecause you never bothered to get the 50 extra points you needed via something as simple as a DOFF mission?\n\nI never had the problem of having extra points left over, personally. I can't really see how anybody could have.I've actually found that looking at science consoles via the information button when you right click give invaluable information on what skill tree powers effect what powers. It's still incomplete but more complete then the skill tree disruption itself\n\n- TSS is overly powerful and TSS3 would probably quadruple heal your shields all the way from 0 to 100, 4 times lol. I doubt this was intended.\n\nTSS's buff is truly incredible. My recently leveled tac/bop with TSS3 and two shield emmitter consoles is getting huge healing stats in matches. I actually led my team in healing in a CnH match with over 1.1 million in healing. Truly insane. At least sci vessels can counter my defenses with FBP3. That stuff is killer against me.\n\nVery often during the Tribble testing I had the feeling they moved parts of the code or the data (heck do I know which affects which) back to a much older state. The common item vendor inventory for example seems to be from a far older build. Maybe this is not really true and it just resembles older builds, but reading that FBP is back to its old strength basically... Weird stuff.\n\nI felt the skill tree changes weren't really well tested on Tribble. There was very little feedback overall, compared to other stuff (DOFF system for example), so it may not be a surprise there are plenty of errors now.\n\nWe should assemble a list of all the oddities we notice. (Please note t hat I am unlikely to notice any oddities myself right now because I am not really playing, just forum trolling these days.)\n\nAll the powers that effect healing in the lower tiers and damage powers in high tiers, wtf why?\n\nBasic FvK gameplay is that feds rely on healing and defensive, Klingons rely on damage and offensive.\nFeds defend, Klingons attack. Either Klingons knock down the fort or we fail and its over.\n\nSkill tree changes saw almost all defensive powers like heals go to lower tiers which benefit fed game play more than klingon, Shockwave stun duration took a nerf , not that it needed it as you can now eng and sci team while stunned, which is retarded. Brel took a massive nerf with these changes, all while defiant gets buffed with extra console slot making it completely outclass the already useless raptor.\nCan't get consoles to buff stuns duration anymore but i can get consoles that make my TSS and extends even more epically retarded than they are.\n\nTac shockwave bop is now impossible to spec as good as before, while federation heal boat all beam cruiser is easy as F**K to spec.\nFed gameplay doesn't need high spike to achieve victory, while klingon gameplay it is a requirement.\nSpike got nerfed and healing got buffed.\n\nThe change removing weapon type skills was pointless as non specific energy type consoles took a nerf, which means you need to run all of the same energy weapon type.\n\nSumming up, in my opinion all the changes suck and anyone who says otherwise lacks an in depth understanding of the FvK PVP game, which sadly includeds the devs.\n\nJust like in every build of STO, all the pathetic must win players switch out their builds for flavor of the month cheese. In season 5 its no different, With certain players loading up on duty officer multi grav wells, epic repulsors and insta kill FBP. Torpedo spread is no long flavor of the month, due to its nerfing.\n\nPVP in STO is a complete and utter joke and only good for pugging cheesefests. Premade vs premade is long dead due to the broken and imblanced game and don't get me started on the V word.\n\nTOR coming soon and hopefully end game PVP is balanced around player feedback and extensive dev playtesting unlike this game."

      "text": "I just read an article on ars technica about colour blind gamers, and it occurred to me that I haven't seen any thought about that issue here, I can't say I have the answers but it is something we should think about.\n\nOff the top of my head possible problems are distinguishing between growth (green) and production (red) for people who have severely red/green colour blind. Throwing in a category icon would help, but I'm not sure if this one actually is an issue, its pretty clear that orbital factories is production, and nanotech medicine is growth.\n\nDistinguishing between stars, no idea how bad this is without being colour-blind myself, differing sizes helps but the red and the brown(orange?) stars may be an issue (the pics on the article suggested that some people see red as brown). Possibly if we have a way of identifying the worst offenders* we could replace them with obviously distinct replacements in a \"colour blind mode\", say turn brown stars into symbolic 4 point star, or a different colour. Even if it looks bad it still doesn't interfear with gameplay. This defiantly could be improved: Possibilities include giving each empire a flag/choice of flags with a distinct visual motif, Ships icons could be a silised sprite based on the actual design of that races' ships. However those are probably only effective if you zoom in. Another option is an override empire colours, the player chooses a personalised set of visually distinct colours, no matter what colours the players choose for their empires, on the colour blind player's screen they come from the list.\n\n* Anyone know of a way to make X.org simulate colour blindness?\n\nThenI haven't seen any thought about that issue here, I can't say I have the answers but it is something we should think about.\n\nActually we are aware of this. It has been brought up in some cases and we favor to differentiate between shapes instead of color, if possible. However, that's not always possible and in many cases color has to be used in addition.\n\nThe thing is, we can't take every user into account. We have to simplify and create for an average user with correct vision, especially considering the very limited resources a project like this has access to. That said, the star images for example could be easily replaced by images with different shapes to represent different colors, but things like these are not a priority for us. I consider this poslishing or stuff for a mod, ideally done by people who have experience with those issues.\n\nWe've looked at this issue for Wesnoth, so the concern isn't new to me. I was somewhat surprised at the simplicity of the Ars article. There's not just one kind of color blindness, there are many, each with different weakness towards perceiving certain colors. A red-green weakness is the most common, but not the only type. Some cannot perceive color at all.\n\nHowever it is a generally good practice to distinguish things by shape, pattern, and/or luminosity, as well as color whenever reasonably possible. And for things that aren't \"reasonably possible\" i agree with pd that if there's sufficient interest mods can be made.\n\nTortanick wrote: .... ThenWith the zoomable galaxy map we have the ability to include more info when the player zooms closer. Adding Empire flags to stars in addition to empire colors at closer zooms in one reasonable possibility.\n\nI can't imagine that FO could ever be playable via a screen-reader. However, i don't think deaf people will have any problem. As it's a turn based game, sound-cues tend to nearly always serve as supplements to the visual cues.\n\nI don't know how to configure X.org for colour blindness simulations, but there are dozens of sites on the web, like this:  , where you at least can check screenshots. But I agree with pd thatmost of the adaption should be made in a mod, firstly because there are several forms of colour blindness, which all require different changes and secondly it would be a bit annoying to have a reduced set of colours for everyone. The colour of most items should be defined in some text files anyway (at least I think there is something like this on the programming work page), so they can be changed to differentiable colours for every type of blindness (even shades of gray for total colour blindness), you could add descriptions to each star describing the colour and so on, but all this is something for later and should be idealy done by someone with more knowledge about colour blindness. The real problem would be indeed totally blind people, there is probably the possibility that we could serialize the everything into text to be used by a screen reader but there is a huge amount of information in the gui, so later in the game completing a turn could possibly take a real long time, I don't think somebody is willing to listen to hour long drones of \"...food twohundredtwentyseven, mining twelve, production...\" On further thinking, apart from text adventures and some experimental stuff, are there computer games that can be played by blind players anyway? Have the blind people simply realised that there is no use trying and given up?\n\nOn deaf players: the only sound in the game is the backgorund music and some effects when something is happening that can be seen on the screen anyway, so I don't see any problem"

Paranoia might explain the rise in whine threads, but it most certainly saves ships. If people were as paranoid as that, we would see a hell of a lot more avoidance tactics being used and a far dimmer map… well, assuming people are bright enough to actually act on that paranoia, rather than just feel it and then complain when the obvious happens.\n\nCoincidentally, my observation is that the sentiment of a gank epidemic run very much in parallel with an increase in \"highsec should be safe\" threads.\n\nOf course, that could kind of prove us both right: ganks are on the rise, but they are just as uncommon as ever — the gank-per-person count is exactly the same, but the amount of people has increased, of which the same ratio of safe:unsafe behaviour same the exact same proportion of ships as before. Maybe we should ask for a \"ships destroyed in last 24h / average pilots in space\" filter…\n\nI'm just absolutely stumped as to why this is being discussed. The vast vast vast majority of folks live in high sec space. The amount of ships you're looking at that have been destroyed in high sec is a small fraction of those compared to the whole in high sec, whereas the fraction of those destroyed in null sec are probably much higher, considering most null sec systems are pretty much empty.\n\nAlso, those are just ships destroyed. There's no way to tell how they were destroyed. If you want to look at pods destroyed, it's pretty obvious most of them were destroyed in low/null sec.\n\nwow...

Originally (see Armada below) ships without shields at all took an auto hit, this was changed in the FAQ2010 to taking a hit on a d6 roll of 6 and you only have to test once per turn just like blast markers so down to one hit now (FAQ2010 below)Yes, but remember if you hit an enemy ship and place a blast marker your ships are slowed by 5cm and most of the nids are really slow already...\n\nAlso it just happens once per contact. For exampe a hypothetical squad of six tyranid cruisers would do the exact same things as the escorts as far as spores go.\n\nYes\n\nIf an enemy ship gets in base contact with\na Tyranid vessel it will suffer spore impacts, a\nblast marker is placed in contact with the two\nships' bases before any other effects are\ncalculated (effectively knocking down one spore\nshield on the Tyranid ship.) Unshielded vessels\n(including those only protected by holofields)\nsuffer an automatic hit instead (ie, don't roll a\ndice), the spore automatically causes one hit\n(with the normal chance of critical damage). Armada pg 86\n\nSpore impacts from moving in base contact with Tyranid vessels effect enemy ship movement, meaning enemy vessels lose -5cm speed and ships with zero shields (such as Eldar and ships with Shields Collapsed critical damage) have to roll a D6 against receiving damage on a 6. However, this test (if required) only needs to be done once per movement phase, regardless of how many Tyranid ships make base contact. The ship only counts as having blast markers in base contact if it ends its movement in base contact with a Tyranid vessel. FAQ2010\n\nRe: Tyranids and their spores\n\nWait, I thought the FAQ2010 thing wasn't eliminating the armada rules, but clarifying what happens in addition to the armada effects if the impact happens in the non-tyranid player's movement phase. Hence why that paragraph is mentioning the non-tyranid ships movement at the beginning and end of the paragraph.\n\nRe: Tyranids and their spores\n\nHum, my question then would be why would it be different if the tyranid ship is moving into an enemy instead of the enemy moving into them?\n\nWell (as I understood it) the difference is which ship is moving, and the FAQ seems to be saying that you have to deal with the blast marker effects as normal.\n\nSo if an imperial cruiser moves through a tyranid ship with spores you place the blast marker, and the imperial cruiser loses 5 cm of movement. Apparently it still counts as having the blast marker in base contact if its movement isn't enough to get clear of the tyranid ship.\n\nIf an eldar ship zips through a bunch it takes the autohit from each, but also has to make a single blast marker type test as it's moving through them.\n\nIf it were the tyranid player's turn and they were moving ships over the eldar vessel there would be an autohit for each ship, but you wouldn't do the d6 roll."

Vs Terran the problem isn't so grievous, but simple maath tells us that vikings llose to corruptors: 200:(2*(14-2))=8,1; 125:14=8.9;meaning they both need 9 shots to kill the other. Sadly, the corruptor ntakes 0.1 seconds less between attacks=corruptor wins. Vikings, voids and stalkers really need to be better against theese so please do something blizzard.\n\n@StarWars: all though what you say is accurate, and it shouldn't work like this, corruptors only have one use, to kill the air forces, after that they just buff your ground army just slightly. They had a right to buff them so much. I do agree, if their wasn't so much of a drawback of using thing unit in the first place.\n\n@TIGERMARINE: The reason Marines and stalkers arn't on the weak list is because of that they are ground units. Corrs can't attack it. That makes it unnecessary to write that since they can't get killed. They put air since corrs can attack air.. Guess no air zerg is good against it though ^^ That's why hydra is there\n\n@FalconPawnch: because the Over mind/Zerg Hierarchy controls them instead of self control, when un-controlled, they start going crazy and rabid and kill each other without reason, so they have no real brain as they rely on others brains to help control them.\n\n@DinoCop: cottupters are awsome, they should have a more valuable ability tough, its only useful on the units i don't kill in one shot. apperantly, corruption makes attacks deal more damage to immortals sheilds, but that is proberly a lie.\n\n@Dezuman: compare cost: Cruiser 400M,300G against three Corruptor for 450M,300G. Battle Cruiser loose. additionally Corruptors are one third supply and builds in two third of the time. BC will be roflstomped against zerg if scoutet 40 seconds before they enter zergs base."

      "text": "Starships\n\nIntroduction\n\nStarships (also referred to as spaceships, space vessels,\nor simply ships) are vehicles capable of travelling through space. Ships come\nin all shapes and sizes, which in Phoenix are defined by the items that go\ninto their construction. There are two basic parameters to a ship, from which\nthe general concept of the ship is derived. These are the type of hull used\nin their construction, and the quantity used.\n\nHull Types\n\nThere are four types of hull that span a range from large\nvolume but thin and weak through to small volume but thick and able to\nwithstand damage.\n\nHull Type\n\nInternal Capacity (mu's)\n\nIntegrity Loss Multiplier\n\nNotes\n\nHeavy\n\n30\n\n0.5\n\nThick and strong, generally used for warships and\nexploration vessels\n\nNormal\n\n50\n\n1\n\nUsed by freighters that see action from time to time\n\nLight\n\n70\n\n2\n\nWeak, used by standard freighters\n\nXtra Light\n\n90\n\n4\n\nUsed by freighters in very safe regions of space.\n\nShip Size\n\nThe quantity of hulls multiplied by the internal capacity\nof the hull determines the size of the ship. It can therefore be seen that a\nship constructed out of 100 light hulls will be much larger than a ship\nconstructed out of 100 heavy hulls.\n\nIntegrity\n\nIntegrity is a measure of how resilient the hull type is\nto day-to-day stresses. As a ship can only be constructed out of one type of\nhull, this value will determine how often a ship will have to be patched up.\nThis multiplier is applied to the stress level of any action to determine\nloss of integrity. Therefore, a ship constructed out of heavy hulls\nperforming the same actions as an xtra light ship will suffer integrity\nlosses at a rate of 1/8th that of the xlight ship. This is a very\nimportant factor when considering the type of ship to assign to a certain\ntask.\n\nInternal Items\n\nThe hulls of a ship are the bare bones. A ship needs items\ninstalled within it to make it functional. There are a number of basic items\nrequired in order for a ship to be serviceable.\n\nISR Drives – these propel a ship\nthrough interplanetary space. Without them it would take a ship from months\nto years to get from one planet to another.\n\nJump Drive – this is used to\nmove a ship from one planetary system to another (see chapter on Stellar\nNavigation).\n\nThrust Engines – these are used\nin order to perform manoeuvres in gravity wells such as around planets. ISR\ndrives cannot be used in these circumstances due to interference with the ISR\nfield.\n\nQuarters – crew and life forms need to have a\nnumber of basic living requirements satisfied. Quarters cover everything from\nsleeping booths through to mess halls and limited recreation facilities.\n\nBridge – while this is optional, not having one\nplaces a greater burden on the crew. As very small ships can easily have more\ncrew than are needed, they can often go without a bridge and accommodate the\ndrop in running efficiency.\n\nSensors – these are the eyes and ears of the ship.\nThey use a battery of scanning techniques in order to observe the region of\nspace near the ship. Further, they are used for specific actions such as\nscanning for minerals or other ships.\n\nCargo Bays – these are used for the transport of\nitems (see section on Interaction and Trade)\n\nCrewing a Starship\n\nAs well as a number of basic items installed into the\nship, there are several other requirements. The most important of these is a\ncrew to run the ship. Each item installed in a ship requires someone to look\nafter it. This is known as the crew factor requirement. For a ship all\nthese requirements are totalled giving an overall crew factor requirement. In\norder for the ship to run at normal operating efficiency (100%) the ship\nrequires a crew whose total crew factors equals or exceeds this requirement.\nWhile crew are the most able at running ships, other troops can also be used.\nThe table below gives the crew factors provided by various troops. Veterans\n(troops that have gained experience) are better than normal troops.\n\nTroop\n\nNormal\n\nVeteran\n\nCrew\n\n4\n\n8\n\nMarine\n\n2\n\n4\n\nMercenary\n\n1\n\n2\n\nSoldier\n\n1\n\n2\n\nScout\n\n1\n\n2\n\nStartrooper\n\n1\n\n2\n\nShip designs generally assume that crew will be used to\nrun a ship, therefore it is most often the case that there will not be enough\nquarters to run a ship using other types of troops.\n\nAs space is a premium on ships, more advanced items, if\navailable, such as bunks or cryogenic booths can be installed instead of\nquarters. This increases the life capacity of the ship per installation space\nused. Ships designed for war, for example may encounter boarding actions. For\nthis reason it is better to use marines as they are suited to close-quarter\nfighting. But as warships are made out of heavy hulls in order to resist\ndamage, space is tight. As a result they will often install bunks, instead of\nquarters. These are both more resilient to damage and cram more life forms\ninto the same space as quarters. Bunks though are both restricted technology\nand require the use of expensive minerals. As such they are generally\nconsidered a frivolity on a lighter hull ship.\n\nEfficiency\n\nMost orders performed by the ship take time - normally a\nset amount for a specific order. This however is adjusted by the efficiency\nof the ship. If there are insufficient crew factors to meet the requirements\nof the ship, then the time to perform the orders is increased accordingly.\n\nTaking shore leave, i.e. a visit to a recreation complex\ngives a boost to efficiency that means that actions take less time. This\nboost to efficiency however is short lived. There is no other normal way of\nboosting efficiency beyond 100%.\n\nHaving more crew factors available than the requirement\ndoes not make the ship run more efficiently, it merely means that other\npenalties such as a surly crew (one that has not had shore leave for over 30\nweeks), not having a bridge or attempting to fly an alien ship for example\ncan be overcome, allowing the ship to run at optimal efficiency (100%).\n\nCaptains\n\nA ship has a rank associated with it. This is generally\ncaptain. Under normal circumstances the captain is non-commissioned officer,\ni.e. one of the crew. With time however a crewmember could be given a\ncommission, using the 'Create Officer' political order (See political\nposition rules for more information). Once created, the new officer (a unique\nitem in the game) will begin to accumulate experience that will aid in\ncombat, and also give a boost to the crew factors provided by each\ncrewmember.It is important to note that the rank is\nassociated with the ship, not the officer. As such there is no\nreason why a ship without a commissioned officer cannot have a rank of\nadmiral, although the lack of experience may well deter an affiliation from\npromoting a ship to this rank.\n\nIf the ship's rank is increased, the ship will be able to\nhave greater autonomy over its choice of actions, including which enemies it\ncan select. Captains can only attack pirates and support and defend their own\naffiliation's positions (see appendix, Orders – add to enemy, add to support,\nadd to defend).\n\nWages\n\nWages are paid every week. These are drawn either from the\nplayer's political position, or from the individual ship if the player does\nnot own a political position.\n\nStandard weekly wages are equal to one stellar per troop\n(crew are classed as troops). The captain is also paid 5 stellars per week,\nsuch is the price for having somebody more experienced than the standard\ncrew.\n\nIf there are insufficient stellars to pay the crew they\nwill start to be less efficient.\n\nShould a player so desire, they can set the wages to be\nless than the standard amount. The primary reason for this is if the ship is\ntransporting troops. In such cases there will be vastly more crew factors\nthan the requirement of the ship. As such the drop in efficiency will not\nprove to be problematic.\n\nAt times however due to various events such as combat\nthere may be a shortfall in crew factors. This would normally mean that the\nship is running at less than 100% efficiency. Setting the wages to greater\nthan 1 stellar each per week can be used to increase the efficiency. For\nexample, setting the wages to double will double the crew factors available.\n\nIt is important to remember that having more crew factors\nthan necessary - either through extra troops or by paying extra wages - will\nnever increase the efficiency of the ship above 100%. Only a recreation visit\nwill do this.\n\nWhen a crew visit recreation complexes they will spend\nsome of the wages that they have been paid over the last six months. The\nquantity of recreation complexes present, as well as the amount of stellars\nthey own, will determine the amount of stellars that they will spend in any\none visit. All the stellars spent in the recreation complex visit go to the starbase\nowner. It is therefore in the interest of the starbase governor to build lots\nof complexes and entice ships to visit their starbase. They may offer\nincentives to visit their starbase instead of another.\n\nFor example, a warship with a crew of 200 marines will\nhave a wage bill of 5200 stellars over 6 months. Even if the crew blow only a\nquarter of their wages in a single visit, this is still well over a 1000\nstellars, or enough stellars to run 50 complexes for a month! Few governors\nare going to pass up on this.\n\nMass\n\nIn\nPhoenix, the term mass unit (usually written as mu – pronounced: em\nyou) is used to represent a combination of volume, mass and inertia. A single\nmu cannot be truly expressed in terms of cubic metres or even kilograms, it\nis a kind of compromise. It also takes into account other factors. For\nexample a single life form is classed as one mu. As well as the physical mass\nof the life form the mu also accounts for living space required by the life\nform, possibly tools of trade such as weapons and even an environmental suit.\nAn mu of ore on the other hand will include some kind of suitable storage\ndevice or cargo pod.\n\nItems\n\nItems\nalong with mass (mu's) have a vast number of other parameters. These\ndetermine what the item can do or be used for. Each specific item has a\nunique number for example . Metals = 1, while Human Crew = 505.\n\nItems\nthat have a number of common parameters or functions are grouped together.\nThis is known as their item TYPE. This determines what the item can be used\nfor, e.g. Metals has the item type ORE, this means that it used in building\nmany other items. Hulls on the other hand are used in the construction of\nships and are therefore given the item type SHIP HULL. TROOPS are used to run\nships, control ordnance and fight battles. Certain items also have a subtype.\n\nTime\n\nEach\nweek is broken up into 5 days during which turns are processed. This is\nnormally Monday to Friday. This allows for some freedom to move processing\ndays to accommodate bank holidays and general internet disasters. Where a day\nis lost the weekend will be used to bring the game back into line.\n\nDuring\na standard processing day, orders submitted for positions, including any\npending orders, will be run. Any special actions will be dealt with and\nstandard maintenance checks for appropriate positions will be performed.\nAfter these are all finished, battles will be conducted. Finally, the results\nof all of these orders, known as TURN RESULTS, will be emailed to the\nappropriate players.\n\nAs\nstated each week consists of 5 days and each day is broken down into 60 TIME\nUNITS (TU's). This means that there are 300TU's in every week.\n\nEach\naction performed by a ship requires a set number of TU's. In order to make\nlife simpler for the player however ships are able to stack TU's for up to a\nweek, effectively performing up to 300TU's worth of actions in one set of\norders.\n\nFor\nexample, a ship could buy some items, leave orbit of a planet, travel across\nthe star system and enter orbit of another world and deliver the items it has\njust bought to a starbase situated on the world.\n\nWhere\na player issues a number of orders that overrun the total available TU's, the\nremaining orders are NOT deleted.\n\nThey\nwill be saved. These saved orders are known as PENDING ORDERS. A list\nof the pending orders will be shown at the bottom of the turn result for the\nship.\n\nTHESE\nORDERS WILL NOT BE PROCESSED UNTIL THE SHIP HAS 300TU'S AVAILABLE!\n\nThis\nmeans that the week following the first turn, another turn will be sent to\nthe player with the next 300 TU's worth of the pending orders completed – or\nall the remaining orders. If there are still orders pending this will\ncontinue week after week until all the orders have been completed.\n\nAs\nstated above a ship can perform 60TU's worth of actions per day. This means\nthat a player can if they desire merely send in orders totalling up to 60\nTU's and have a turn sent back to them every day.\n\nIn\nfact if a player sends orders in, a turn will always be generated.\n\nThis\nmeans that even if there are orders pending, sending in more orders will\ntrigger the ship to attempt as many of the pending orders as time allows. For\nexample, if the ship has performed 300TU's worth of actions and still has\nsome pending, sending in more orders 3 days later will mean that the ship\nwill attempt to perform another 180TU's of the pending orders.\n\nStellars\n\nStellars\n(in-game money) are one of the most important aspects of Phoenix. It is used\nfor wages of troops and employees, it is gained from goods sold to world\npopulations.\n\nA\nstellar is a unit of currency. It is defined by a number of basic assumptions\nin the universe of Phoenix.\n\nIt\nhas a standard value equal to 1mu of luxury goods sold to a planetary\npopulation on the same planet as the goods originated.\n\nIt\nis the standard weekly wage paid to a troop or employee in a starbase or crew\non a ship.\n\nIt\nis the production cost of 1mu of an item. This does not include the base\nmineral cost.\n\nFrom\nthese defining factors, the relative value of any object or service can be\ndetermined.\n\nA\nstellar is not a physical item, but a rating of credit agreed upon by the\nExtragalactic Economic Monopoly (EEM). Every position willing to trade or\nperform any service registers (an automatic part of the game) and all stellar\ntransactions are passed via the EEM.\n\nPhoenix\nis a game not an accounting package. One generic currency has been opted for\nto make life simpler for the player – this feature is a game mechanic that\ncannot be circumvented or cheated. The EEM do not normally interact with\nthe game on any other level, nor can they be swindled or cheated.\n\nGenerating Orders\n\nNormally the order editor is used to generate orders for\nthe ship. These should be issued sequentially for the ship, as they are\nprocessed in the order designated. All orders require the use of information.\nThis could be anything from simple items through to other positions.\n\nData\n\nIn order to make issuing orders simple, all aspects of\nPhoenix use numbers to represent specific data. For example, the Yank\nStarsystem is number 146. Metal is item 1, a ship may have number 6654 and a\nplanet may have number 226. These numbers are all stored in databases both at\nKJC Games and within the front end application.\n\nWhen an order requires a specific number a player will\noften have a drop down menu, from which they can specify the ID so that the\nnumber will be filled in for them.\n\nCommon Data\n\nA new front end will have basic data already included.\nThis will have systems, common items, ores and affiliations that are known to\neveryone. To this list, a player should add any positions that they own and\nstarbases that they trade with.\n\nRestricted Data\n\nMany data numbers will not be known at the start of game.\nThis data is known as restricted data. Whenever this data is\ndiscovered during the course of the game, the onus is on the player to update\ntheir front end.\n\nKJC holds a database with a list of information that has\nbeen discovered by each player. If a player attempts to use information that\nthey do not know, the order will fail. In some cases they may well be penalised\nfor attempting to use this information. Restricted data exists in the game to\nlimit cheating.\n\nData\n\nThere\nare three levels to data.\n\nCommon\nData – this\ncan be used by anyone.\n\nAffiliation\nRestricted – this\nis data that is known by the affiliation and safeguarded by various means in\norder to remain the sole property of the affiliation. This may\nrequire the use of subspace streaming to use data off-site (such as jumping\ninto a restricted system), or regular purges built into the software of computers.\n\nAffiliation\nRestricted data can only be copied to other affiliations or political\npositions by issues raised and voted for by the affiliation.\n\nPolitical\nRestricted – this\nis data that is stored by the political office of the player. It is available\nto all positions run by the player.\n\nPolitical\nRestricted data can be transferred to political positions owned by other\nplayers, it can also be transferred to the affiliation.\n\nStellar Navigation\n\nWithin the galaxy are millions of stars. A star is a huge\nball of burning gas. It is generally the case that a star has a number of\ncelestial bodies orbiting around it. These celestial bodies could be planets\nlike our own or swirling spheres of cold gas like Jupiter. There could be\nasteroids or in some circumstances even another star present. Together these\nare known as a star system, or more commonly just system.\n\nA primary star always exists at the centre of the system.\nAround this, the system is broken down into 4 quadrants and 15 rings known as\norbitals. This map is not a map representing true location, but closer to a\nmap used in the real world by underground tube trains. It represents relative\nlocation not physical distance. In Phoenix, relative location is based on\niso-gravitational regions. These are effectively relative travel times for\nships moving from one location to another.\n\nEach star system is separated from other systems by\nphenomenal distances - so huge that it takes light produced by one star many\nyears to reach another. Under normal circumstances travelling from one star\nto another would be impossible. Scientists however discovered something\ncalled Inverse Spatial Resonance (ISR). This showed how one region of space\ncould be uniquely connected to another through the dimensions known\ncolloquially as subspace. The application of this at a macro level meant that\nwith the correct navigational knowledge a space ship could create a sphere\naround itself and be effectively catapulted instantaneously from one region\nof space to another.\n\nThere are two uses for ISR fields. The first use is to\nmove from orbit around one star to orbiting around another star. This is\nknown as 'jumping' from one system to another. Drives designed specifically\nfor this use as known as Jump Drives.\n\nThe second use of ISR fields is to move through space\nwithin a system. This interplanetary travel requires faster formation of ISR\nfields and many micro-jumps. The speed at which the field surrounding the\nship forms is related to the relative volume of the ship compared to its\nintegrity. As such ships that are relatively small compared to their mass\nsuch as those constructed out of heavy hulls are able to utilise smaller\nfields. This means that they can use drives that are able to create fields\nfaster, thus allowing them to travel through interplanetary space much faster\nthan ships that are built from xlight hulls.\n\nIt is therefore more sensible to create maps of systems\nbased on the use of ISR fields rather than actual distances. This allows the\nstar system to be neatly cut up into regions of relative iso-gravitation\nknown as orbitals. As all worlds have a direct impact on iso-gravitational\nregions within a system, in some systems it may be the case that some worlds\nin a low orbital are icy while other worlds in the same system at a higher orbital\nare in fact warmer. These though are quite unusual and it is generally the\ncase that increasing orbital means decreasing world temperature.\n\nJumping\n\nMoving from one system to another requires the use of a\njump drive. While the time to jump is instantaneous, the formation of the\nfield around the ship takes around two days. This field can only be formed in\nan under certain limits. The primary one is that there is little interference\nfrom the primary star. This invariably means that the starship is in at least\nthe 10th orbital ring. This means that jumps from one system to\nanother can normally only occur in the outer region of the system. If a ship\nattempts to perform a jump while in an orbital that is too low, the ship will\nautomatically attempt to move out to the sufficient orbital. If already\nbeyond the minimum jump ring, the jump will be performed in the current\norbital.\n\nOther celestial bodies also tend to interfere with the\nformation of the field and as such a jump cannot be performed while in orbit around\na world. Interference by other starships and such will also prevent the field\nfrom forming. As such a ship cannot perform a jump if it is involved in\ncombat. Fleets of ships moving together will always give each other\nsufficient space in order to generate a field.\n\nA jump from one star system to another will place the\njumping ship in the same orbital quadrant.\n\nInterplanetary Travel\n\nAs a system map is largely based on travel times, under\nnormal circumstances the use of the order editor will allow a destination to\nbe directly set. From this a route will be determined. This route will always\nbe the fastest route possible. Where the destination is in a lower orbital,\nthe ship will move directly inwards first, then follow the orbital around,\nchanging quadrants until it is in the correct one. Where the destination is\nin a higher orbital, the ship will change quadrants first and then move\noutwards until it is the correct orbital quadrant.\n\nCalculating time to move from one location to another is\nrelatively simple. Each ship has an ISR drive rating. This is a multiplier to\n'distance' travelled. To calculate distance travelled, add the current\norbital value for each quadrant crossed to the number of orbitals crossed\ne.g. if a ship is in Gamma 10 and moves to Delta 8, it will first move down\nto Gamma 8 (2 orbitals crossed), then move to Delta 8 (crossed 1 quadrant at\n8). Therefore the distance travelled is 10 (2+8). This is multiplied by the\nISR rating to calculate Time Units (TU's) used.\n\nThere is a normal requirement of 1 ISR drive per 10 hulls.\nA ship however can utilise less. This will place greater strain on the ISR\ndrives and can lead to overload. If the drives overload, one will be\ndestroyed and the remaining drives have to be reset. This is done automatically\nbut takes time. After they have been reset another attempt will be made at\ncreating a field.\n\nThe ISR drive rating effectively limits the size of the\nfield and formation time. As such the faster drives (lower ratings) can only\nbe utilised by certain hull types.\n\nHull Type\n\nISR Drives that can be used\n\nHeavy\n\n1,2,3,4\n\nNormal\n\n2,3,4\n\nLight\n\n3,4\n\nXtra Light\n\n4\n\nA ship with ISR 1 Drives will move 4 times faster through\ninterplanetary space than one with ISR 4 Drives. It is normally the case that\nescort ships (those that accompany freighter convoys) constructed out of\nheavy hulls will still install ISR 3 Drives, in order to avoid leaving the\nlight hulled freighters behind on long hauls.\n\nThrust Movement\n\nAs a ship cannot use ISR or jump drives while in orbit, it\nhas to rely on more conventional means of propulsion. Reaction drives are\ntherefore used in situations where ISR fields cannot be generated. This\nincludes manoeuvring around planetary bodies, which can be broken down into\nlanding, taking off, entering orbit and leaving orbit.They are also used in combat. Each engine\nproduces a standard amount of thrust. It is the total thrust against the\ntotal mass of the ship that determines its manoeuvrability. This in turn\ndetermines the maximum gravitational field that can be entered. A ship with a\nmanoeuvre ability lower than the gravity of a world will be unable to land on\nthe world, or if constructed on the world, unable to take-off aid.\n\nCombat Speed\n\nAs well as for manoeuvring within a gravitational field,\nthrust is used in combat.A ship with\na higher combat speed has the upper hand in combat. It is capable of leaving\ncombat when it so desires and is also capable of preventing a single slower\nvessel from leaving combat.\n\nAs combat speed is based on manoeuvrability and modified\nby the integrity multiplier for the type of hulls used in the ship\nconstruction, heavy hull ships often have greater combat speeds than lighter\nhull ships.\n\nEngines\n\nStandard thrust engines have a ranger of boosters from\nsmall manoeuvring thrusters used for quick bursts to flip and spin the ship,\nthrough to larger continuous boosters to accelerate and decelerate the ship.\nCombat engines have sacrificed long burn boosters in favour of small high\nintensity ones. As such they give much greater performance than standard\nengines but only count for combat speed. Landing engines on the other hand\nare primarily long steady burst boosters that are suitable only for\nnon-combat operations.\n\nWorlds\n\nMost worlds are in fact not spherical. Small asteroids may\nwell be oblong, while rocky planets may be slightly oblate, that is squashed.\nIn Phoenix the size of a world is represented by its X and Y values. Like the\nsystem map, these are relative to the time required to cross them. In the\ncase of a planet, each sector is roughly 1,000km across. Earth roughly\ncorresponds to a 36x36 planet. Smaller worlds such as asteroids tend to be\nmade out of localised mineral deposits of an inhomogeneous and generally very\nrocky nature. As such a sector may well represent only a 100km. Gas giants on\nthe other hand are little more than gaseous spheres. The surface of these\nworlds is considered to be the depth where the atmospheric pressure is\nsuitable for life (roughly equal to Earth's). As such the gravity at this\nlevel is also roughly equal to Earth's. As the surface at this depth is still\ninsubstantial a sector could easily be 5,000km in diameter.\n\nEach sector has a terrain type. In the case of gas giants\nthese will all be gas, but for planets, moons and asteroids, there are many\nother classes such as craters, mountains, ice, forest, sea etc.\n\nWormholes\n\nCertain regions of space contain peculiar phenomena in\nwhich the normal physics of the universe is twisted. These are known as\nwormholes. They are effectively rifts in space where one part of the universe\nis connected to another. A ship can journey through one of these wormholes in\norder to vastly reduce what could have been many jumps. Wormholes can however\npummel a ship reducing integrity. The likely level of integrity loss is\nrelated to the instability of the wormhole. An xtra light hulled ship passing\nthough a very unstable wormhole may not come out in one piece and the\nresulting debris will be scattered around the opening at the intended\ndestination.\n\nAs well as being unstable, wormholes may also be\ntransitional. This means that they may connect to different locations at\ndifferent times. Some are cyclic, in that they have predictable connections\nare different times of the year, others may well be random, possibly even\nconnecting one part of the system to another.\n\nStargates\n\nStargates are artificial rifts in the subspace fabric of\nthe universe. They cannot be seen, but show up on sensors as a localised\ndistortion of space. The ones in existence are very ancient, the creators of\nwhich have long since left the Peripheries. It is understood that they anchor\na point in space and use some advanced form of Inter Spatial Resonance to\ntemporarily connect with another stargate. The use of the stargate requires a\nkey to have been installed in the ship. This key activates the gate, causing\nit to resonate at the specific frequency of another gate that is attuned to\nthe one being opened. The two gates then form a node long enough for an\nobject in the well of the distortion to be transported through space to the\nlocation of the other stargate.\n\nEach key is specific to a stargate within a designated\nsystem. So using a key to pass through a stargate will not allow the ship to\ncome back the other way.\n\nStargates do not connect to all other stargates, they only\nconnect to specific ones. Some may form a ring, while others may be connected\nto a single part of the ring. Some may be closed. If a stargate is closed it\ncannot be used even if the key is installed within a ship. Ships entering\nother stargates cannot exit through a closed stargate even if they would\nnormally be connected. Failed stargate entries will leave the ship in the\nlocation of the stargate it attempted to enter.\n\nUsing a stargate can also cause integrity losses, although\nthese are much less severe than using wormholes.\n\nOther Phenomena\n\nAsteroid Belts\n\nCertain regions of space can contain tiny rocks and ice\npieces left over from the formation of planetary bodies during the planetary\naccretion phase of a star system's evolution. These tend to be cold inert\nrocks that are very difficult to scan. Many are uncharted or follow chaotic\norbital paths. As such a ship moving though an asteroid belt has a chance of\ncolliding with rocks. The chance is not great and the experience of the\ncaptain also aids in avoiding damage. Should a collision occur however,\ndamage is inflicted to the hulls. This can be very dangerous for an xtra\nlight hulled ship of small size (see section of ship construction for damage\ncapabilities of hull types).\n\nNebula\n\nAlong with rocks there are regions of space that contain\nnebulae. The term nebula covers many types of clouds. These could be a band\nof gas left by a comet, outgassing emissions from a proto-planet with a low\ngravity, cold molecular clouds on the edge of a star system with a dim dwarf\nstar, or even a planetary nebula formed by a super nova. Stellar flare\nresidue and emissions from red giants are also responsible for the formation\nof nebulae. These gaseous particles are too small to physically damage the\nhulls of the ship - their effects are more insidious. They can freeze to the\nhull and then often burn off or become ignited around the ship. The general\neffect is to therefore to reduce the integrity of the ship.\n\nRogue Comets and Asteroids\n\nCertain small cold planetary bodies have an albedo that is\nso low, or follow an orbital path that is so eccentric, that they are not\ndetected during normal system scans. Their planet numbers are classed as\nrestricted data and as such only positions that know of their existence are\nallowed to enter orbit. Detecting them is done automatically during\ninterplanetary movement through the orbital quadrant. Scanning a location may\nwell also reveal any that are present. Once discovered, the planet ID number\nis added to the political position (or their affiliation's restricted data\nlist if the discovering player does not have a political position). From this\npoint onwards the planetary body can be interacted with just like any other\nplanetary body.\n\nTerminology\n\nSystem – the region of space\nsurrounding a star, enveloping a number of worlds and other satellites.\n\nOrbital – Each system is broken\ndown into 15 rings known as orbitals. These represent iso-gravitational\nregions similar to contours on a map. These relate to the use of ISR drives\nand only nominally correlate with actual distances.\n\nQuadrant – Each system is broken\ndown into 4 quadrants. Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta.\n\nOrbital\nQuadrant – This\nis used to reference the co-ordinates of any object within a system e.g. Mobile\nBay is in Gamma 13.\n\nEcliptic – Iso-gravitational\nregions are bound by relative location of the original formation of the\nsystem known as the accretion disc. As such ISR drives can only be used in\na relatively thin disc of space surrounding a star. Ships cannot normally\nmove\nabove or below the ecliptic.\n\nCelestial Bodies\n\nPlanet\n– These\nare rocky worlds. They generally have an atmosphere that in some cases can\nsupport life.\n\nGas\nGiant – A\nlarge gaseous world without a solid surface.\n\nMoon – A world that orbits\neither a planet or a gas giant.\n\nAsteroid\n– A small\nchunk of rock that is too small to be classed as a planet.\n\nNebula – a\ncloud of gas that reduces the integrity of ships that pass through them.\n\nAsteroid\nField – a\nscattering of small rocks with chaotic orbits. They will damage a ship\npassing through an asteroid field.\n\nWorld Parameters\n\nX,\nY – this\nis the diameter of the world at the equator and from pole to pole. This is\nmeasured in sectors. Sector sizes are relative to thetype of planet and are roughly\nproportional to the time required to move from one sector to another while\non the world. A world's size is usually described as \"XxY\"eg. 1x1 for a small moon or 36x36 for an\nEarth sized planet\n\nGravity\n– This is\nthe gravitational field strength at the 'surface' level of the world. The\nsurface for gas giants is roughly 1\n\nStandard\nAtmosphere.\n\nOptical\nDepth – This\nis the multiplier to any sensor scans conducted through the atmosphere of the\nworld. This ranges from 0 (totally opaque) to 1 (completely\ntransparent).\n\nAtmosphere – This is the list of\ngases present in the atmosphere, and their relative abundance.\n\nTemperature – The temperature of the\nworld is determined by a number of factors including real distance from the\nprimary star and optical depth. Worlds outside the tolerable temperature range\nfor humanoids will prove to be undesirable for colonisation.\n\nMoving Around\n\nThere\nare a number of ways of getting from A to B.\n\nLike\nevery action in Phoenix, movement is undertaken using orders. There are a\nnumber of approaches to deciding which order to use. The advanced movement\norders allow for a series of specific orders to be assumed. For example\nissuing the order 'move to planet orbit XXX' while located within a starbase\nwill lift the ship into orbit, leave orbit and move through interplanetary\nspace until it reaches the location of the planet in question, then it will\nenter orbit.\n\nThese\nadvanced orders are intended to make life easier. There is no reason why a\nplayer cannot issue each individual order. When undertaken, both sets of\norders will take the same amount of TU's to conclude.\n\nHowever,\na player may want to vary their route in order to avoid an asteroid belt or\nthe known location of a fleet of hostile ships. In this case the single\nadvanced order could not be used.\n\nOrbital Docks\n\nNormally\na ship will land in a starport and take off under its own power. Should the\nstarbase/outpost have orbital docks, these will be automatically used if they\nwill prove to be beneficial. This may be because it is faster to do so or the\nmanoeuvre rating of the ship is lower than the gravity of the world.\n\nMaximum\nship size (No. hulls) that can be orbitally docked is equal to quantity of\norbital docks multiplied by 25. Therefore 4 orbital docks can move ships of\nup to 100 hulls. It normally requires 40TU's to use orbital docks to either\nland or take off. There is no limit to the number of positions that can use\nthe orbital docks in a single week.\n\nLocation Terminology\n\nDocked\n– this\nmeans that the ship is in the starport of a starbase or outpost. It can leave\nthis location by either taking off, moving to XY (a sector on the world) or\nto another starbase on the same world. Using advanced orders to move further\nafield will automatically incorporate one of these orders.\n\nOrbit\n– the ship\nis in a geo-synchronous orbit around a world. It cannot be scanned by\npositions in space but can be scanned by other positions in orbit about the\nsame world. It can also be scanned by positions on the surface of the world\n\nQuadrant\n– the ship\nis in space, in the specified orbital quadrant.\n\nLanded\n– this\nwill be the XY co-ordinates of the specified world. A position on the surface\ncan be scanned by other positions on the surface and by positions in orbit.\n\nScanning and Evasion\n\nAs has been noted under Rogue Asteroids and Comets\nin the section above, not everything is immediately visible to the\nsensors of the ship, even if they are close by. Scanning works on three\nprinciples, these are range of detection, scanning power and the profile\nof the object being scanned.\n\nRange of Sensors\n\nThe first principle, Range of sensors is a fairly\nsimple concept. Space is large, so it is the case that the ship actively\nscanning may not even come within range of an object in the first place.\nThe larger the volume of space, the lower the chances of happening\nupon an object. When moving around a system from one quadrant to another,\nthe chance of coming within sensor range of all objects in the orbital\nquadrant is roughly proportional to the orbital ring. Further, only\nthe location moved into is checked, i.e. moving from Alpha 10 to Beta\n10 will give a 10% chance of happening to get within sensor range of\neach object present within orbital quadrant Beta 10.\n\nWhen moving across a system, from one orbital to the\nnext (inwards or outwards) as a much smaller area is crossed, so the\nchance of happening to get within range of an object is roughly equal\nto the square of the orbital being scanned. Again it is the orbital\nbeing moved into which is scanned, i.e. moving from Alpha 9\nto Alpha 10 gives a 1% chance of happening to get within sensor range\nof every object present within Alpha 10. Thus, it is much more effective\nwhen patrolling a system, if ships follow circular paths around the\nsystem.\n\nSensor Rating\n\nThe total output of the sensors of the ship produces\na value called the sensor power. This is based on the total output\nof the sensors installed on the ship. Increasing sensor numbers gives\ndiminishing returns, so the sensor power of 20 sensors is not double\nthe sensor power of 10 sensors. The conversion of output to power is\nthen translated into a value called the sensor rating and is measured\nas a percentage. This is the chance of detecting an object with a sensor\nprofile of 0%. Even a single sensor will give a positive sensor power\nresulting in a sensor rating greater than 0%. It is possible to achieve\nsensor ratings greater than 100%.\n\nSensor Profile\n\nEvery object, including ships, starbases, worlds and\nground parties have a sensor profile. This can be a large negative\nto a large positive. If an object cannot normally be missed it will\nhave a sensor profile greater than 100%.\n\nSensor profile is largely determined by surface area.\nThe lighter hull ships are designed to have maximum volume for cargo.\nAs such they have large surface areas when compared to ships that are\nbuilt from the same number of hulls, but incorporating a heavier hulltype.\n\nThe table below gives an indication of the basic sensor\nprofile of a 50 hull ship for varying hulltypes. Under normal circumstances,\nan xlight hulled ship is easily spotted, even at this small size.\n\nHull Type\n\nScanner Profile for a 50 hull ship\n\nHeavy\n\n25.6%\n\nNormal\n\n54.5%\n\nLight\n\n80.8%\n\nXtra Light\n\n105.4%\n\nAs increasing the number of sensors installed in a\nship will increase the sensor power of the ship, so too are there ways\nof decreasing the sensor profile of a ship.\n\nKorondite Plates\n\nAs detailed in the combat and ship design sections\nplates can be layered onto a ship during construction. Certain types\nof plates counter scanners. These effectively reduce the sensor profile\nof the ship. As the number of plates that can be fitted to a ship is\nproportional to the hull type, heavy hull ships can utilise the most\nplates. The table indicates the results of using standard korondite\nplates for each hull type.\n\nSensor profile for ships fitted with maximum\nkorondite plates\n\nHull Type\n\n50 Hulls\n\n100 Hulls\n\n150 Hulls\n\nHeavy\n\n-43.5%\n\n-10.3%\n\n22.7%\n\nNormal\n\n12.0%\n\n77.8%\n\n133.0%\n\nLight\n\n68.4%\n\n167.3%\n\n250.3%\n\nXtra Light\n\n98.4%\n\n214.9%\n\n312.6%\n\nThis means that a ship that gets within sensor range\nof a heavy hull ship (50 hulls) needs a sensor power of at least 44%\nin order to have even a basic chance of detecting it. There are even\nmore advanced versions of korondite plates that will reduce the sensor\nprofile of the ship even further.\n\nCloaking\n\nRelated to scanning and detection is the ability to\ncloak. All cloaking devices are advanced technologies, but as they\nare not uncommon their use is described here.\n\nCloaking devices make the ship completely undetectable\nirrespective of the sensor power of the scanning position. They also\neffectively make the cloaking position blind while cloaked, i.e. the\ncloaking position cannot scan.\n\nAll cloaking devices can operate for a limited amount\nof time. After this, the position has become charged with exotic particles.\nThese do not interfere with the normal running of the position but\nare easily detected, which means that the position cannot be cloaked\nagain until the charge dissipates. This normally requires 300TU's to\npass since the last activation.\n\nAll cloaking devices work on an optimum surface area\nthat can be cloaked. In ships, this equates to total installation space\n(quantity of hulls multiplied by internal capacity). If the size of\nthe ship attempting to cloak is greater than this value, the cloak\nwill not last as long due to the increased rate of exotic particle\nbuild-up.\n\nLocked in Combat\n\nWhenever a ship is scanned, a combat check will be\nautomatically initiated. If a ship is registered as an enemy, it will\nbe attacked. The attacker will attempt to get close enough to the target\nship that it can effectively prevent the formation of ISR fields or\ndisrupt attempts to land or leave orbit. This will be successful only\nif the attacking ship has a superior combat speed. While combat is\ncovered in more detail in the combat section, this point is very important\nfor scanning.\n\nIf a ship is pinned and therefore forced into combat,\nit loses all hope of trying to remain unnoticed. As such the ship,\nan in fact any other position involved in combat immediately has sensor\nprofiles of 100% and the standard sensor range check is ignored.\n\nIf a position is pinned, it cannot perform the cloaking\naction (see combat section on combat options). Therefore it cannot\nleave combat through the use of stealth of any kind.\n\nScanning\n\nOverview\n\nIf a scanning ship comes within sensor range of an\nobject there is a chance of scanning the object.\n\nThe sensor power of the ship is added to the sensor\nprofile of the target object.\n\nThis is the percentage chance of the ship scanning\nthe target object.\n\nModifications to Sensor Profile\n\nCertain locations will decrease the sensor profile\nof a ship, these include nebulas, the optical depth of a world's atmosphere\nand in fitting of special plates to the hull of the ship during construction.\n\nSimilarly starbases and outposts can build cave complexes\nthat will hide mass from sensor scans. As the sensor profile of the starbase/outpost\nis based on observable mass, this decreases their sensor profile.\n\nPlaces to Hide\n\nHanging around the outer edge of the system will reduce\nthe risk of being observed in the first place.\n\nLanding on a large planet with a high optical depth\nwill decrease chances of being scanned.\n\nCombat\n\nCombat alerts every position in the location. All positions\ninvolved in combat will always be scanned.\n\nInteraction and Trade\n\nOne of the key elements to Phoenix is the relocation of\nitems. This will be done for many reasons such as trade, colonisation, war,\nempire expansion and so on.\n\nIt is generally the role of the ship to accommodate this\ntransfer. This is where the cargo section of the ship comes in use.\n\nWhile most items can be carried in general cargo bays,\ndedicated transportation bays can be installed. There are restrictions placed\non each type.\n\nThere are a number of types of cargo\n\nLife Support\n\nThis gives the maximum mu's of life forms that can be\ncarried by the ship. These include sentient life as well as alien\ncreatures. Life form basically covers anything that would die in a cold\nvacuum. Life forms cannot be carried in Cargo.\n\nAmmo\n\nAmmunition will explode if destroyed. If it is still on\na ship this could be disastrous. Installing magazines gives some measure of\nsafety to the ship. There is no imperative to install magazines and\nammunition such as missiles and torpedoes can still be used directly from\ncargo. But Ammo Bays offer more protection to the ammo if the ship should\ncome under fire\n\nOre\n\nDue to its resilient nature, ore does not need custom\nfitted housing or life support or thermal regulation. As such, compared\nwith normal cargo bays, those designed for ore have greater capacity for\nthe same volume of installation space.\n\nSpace Fighters\n\nSpace fighters can only be launched from\nspecially designed bays. While a ship with cargo bays could transport more\nspace fighters than it is capable of launching. In such a case only the\nmaximum number of space fighters will be launched. However, should some\nfighters be destroyed in the day's combat, fighters not launched will be\nused to supplement those destroyed.\n\nCargo\n\nAny items, apart from life forms can be carried in\ncargo. The programs work out the best possible location for each item.\nThere is no need to specify where an item will be placed.\n\nTransaction Types\n\nThere are four basic transaction types. These are pick-up,\ndeliver, buy and sell. All of these transfer items from one position to\nanother.\n\nIf the quantity of an item specified in an order is\ngreater than the quantity available, then the amount transferred will be\nautomatically decreased to the amount available. Should there be none of the\nitem present then the action will fail. The ship will still be charged the\nstandard number of TU's for the action even if it failed.\n\nTransferred items are placed by default in the cargo\nsection of the destination position. Should there be insufficient cargo space\nfor the specified item in the destination position, the amount of item\ntransferred will be decreased to the maximum amount that will fit. If the\ninstallation option has been selected then the transferred items are not\nplaced into cargo but an attempt is made to install the items, bypassing\ncargo space. Again if insufficient installation space is available the amount\ninstalled will be reduced to the maximum possible. The program will then\nattempt to transfer the remainder to cargo space as detailed above. (see\nbelow)\n\nBuy and sell deal with starport markets. These will\ninvolve an automatic stellar transfer based on the price of the item. Should\nthere be insufficient stellars in the purchaser's account then the quantity\nof items transferred will be decreased in order to keep in line with the\nstellars available.\n\nPick-up and deliver normally require the use of security\ncodes for the position being interacted with. If the same player owns both\npositions, the security code is automatically assumed to have been given, and\nso a player does not need to specify these in their orders.\n\nInstalling\n\nWhen buying or picking-up items, presuming there is\nsufficient installation space available, the items can be selected for direct\ninstallation into the ship. This will always decrease the integrity of the\nship. If the ship falls below 20% integrity it will not be allowed to\ninstall further items until it has performed a maintenance complex visit to\nrestore lost integrity.\n\nIf an item cannot be installed, such as crew, trade goods\nand such then the order will ignore the install indicator in the order and\nattempt to place the items in the relevant cargo section.\n\nOnly ships have an installed section, so when delivering\nto non-ship positions, there is no need to use the install option.\n\nPick-up Authorisations\n\nHaving the security code for a position effectively allows\nany items to be pick-up without the consent of the position's owner. As such\nit is generally the case that instead of giving out the security code, the\nposition owner will give out authorisations. These effectively limit the\nrange of items that can be pick-up without the need for the security code.\nThe exact range of pick-up authorisations can be found on the order. Examples\ninclude allowing free access by all within the affiliation or possibly a single\nitem to be picked-up by a specific ship.\n\nTransactions using Item Types\n\nWhile transactions are normally for a specific item\nnumber, such as Basic Elements (2), they can also be for item types such as\nOres. The advantage of using item types is that a number of items can be\naccounted for in the same time period. If an outpost on the edge of known\nspace is mining a few different ores, then ships are not particularly fussy\nwhich ores they are picking up as all the ores present will be eventually\nshipped off to a starbase. As such the ship will issue the order to pick up\nitem type \"ores\" equal to the amount of cargo space present. By doing it this\nway the ship does not need to specify which ores to pick-up and if there are\nmore than one ore type present, the action will only take the time of a\nsingle pick-up.\n\nAn even better example of the use of item type is\nsalvaging debris. By using pick-up and deliver item type \"anything\" a cargo\nship can be ordered to undertake shipping runs effectively hoovering up the\ndebris and delivering it to a starbase or other position.\n\nImportantNote– deliver item type \"anything\"\ndoes not deliver any item which provides crew factors. This is to stop the\ndelivery of crew which would render the ship useless. It will however deliver\nevery other type of item from the cargo including space fighters, ammunition\nand such, so should be used with some discretion by warships.\n\nTransactions that use the item type parameter always start\nwith the item present in the largest quantity. Once this has been transferred\nup to the maximum number of mu's possible then other items are considered.\nFor example, picking-up \"anything\" from the debris of a destroyed ship may\nattempt to pick-up hulls first until the space present in the cargo section\nof the ship falls below 100mu's (the mass of 1 hull), then it may pick up\nquarters and attempt to fill the remaining cargo space and finally pick-up\nsome gattling lasers and troops until there is no cargo space remaining. All\nthis will cost the standard TU's of one pick-up.\n\nPlanetary Economies\n\nA player running only ships need not concern themselves\nwith the ins and outs of planetary economies, but understanding the basics of\ntrade is very important for making a profit and paying crew wages.\n\nMany planets produce unique trade goods, life forms and\ndrugs. By unique it means that although the item falls into an item type, the\nitem itself cannot be produced on any other world. As these are freely\naccessible to the planetary population the demand for the unique items is quite\nlow on the planet. On other worlds the planetary population will pay more for\nthe item. The increased value of the item is based on the purchasing\npopulation and the distance from the origin. As such, buying unique items\nfrom one starbase and selling them to another (either in another star system,\nor a distant periphery) can earn the ship a lot of stellars. However, as the\nship cannot sell directly to a population, they have to negotiate a purchase\nprice with the owner of the starbase they are intending to sell to.\n\nA small population will only be able to cope with a small\nmass of drugs and trade goods on a weekly basis, while a largely\nuninhabitable world will have few people wanting to colonise it. This should\nbe taken into account by the freighter captain when scouting out deals. As\nsuch it is generally the case that small shipments of very expensive goods\nshould be sold to starbases on worlds with low populations. Huge shipments of\nlow value goods should be sold to starbases on worlds with larger populations,\nand probably many starbases in competition.\n\nAlso, where possible a round trip should not be ignored.\nSwapping cargo or taking part payment in goods will mean that stellars are to\nbe made in both directions. A clever captain with a number of contacts could\neasily make good profits with only a small ship, ferrying goods across the\ngalaxy from one small starbase to another.\n\nRapid Trade Runs\n\nAs each ship can accumulate up to 300TU's a number of\nships in strategic locations can be used as a relay in order to get a\nperishable shipment from one location to another before the weekly attrition\nsets in.\n\nCargo\n\nA\nship has a maximum installation capacity. Certain items such as cargo bays\nand quarters can be installed into this space. Once installed they provide\nroom for items that are not normally installed, such as life forms or trade\ngoods.\n\nItems\nin cargo can be loaded and unloaded without danger to the integrity of the\nship.\n\nItems\ncan either be picked-up and delivered through the use of the specific item number\nor through item type. The latter will allow for multiple items to be\ntransferred at the same time, but with the costs of a single transaction.\n\nImportant\n\nIf\nitem type ANYTHING is used for a delivery or a sell, items with crew factors\nwill not be considered. This is to prevent delivering all the crew from the\nship by accident, which would render it useless!\n\nWhere\na number of transactions are carried out and there is uncertainty over the\namount of item present, it is standard practise to use quantities greater\nthan would be possible to pick-up, e.g. a ship with 500mu cargo space may\nattempt to buy 500mu photon guns, 500mu luxury goods and 500mu metals. The\ntheory is that photon guns are the primary purchase. After buying as many of\nthese as possible, the ship will then attempt to fill any remaining space\nwith preferably luxury goods, but failing that \"metals will do\", thus\nhopefully ensuring that the ship fills its cargo hold to capacity.\n\nHIPORTS\n\nStarbases\nand outposts can build links from the ground into orbit. If a\nstarbase/outpost has a hiport, a ship can perform all transactions while in\norbit (but not complex visits).\n\nPlanets\npurchase items from starbases. The amount they pay for standard items can be\ndetermined by the economy scan of the planet.\n\nThe\nonly way to actually sell to the world is through a starbase built on the\nworld. Even a planet without a population may have a life form market. This\nis the case for habitable worlds where the starbase is effectively being paid\nto act as a colonisation facility.\n\nAs\na starbase determines the items on its market, a ship owner will often have\nto contact the owner of the colony in order to strike up a deal for the\npurchase of specific items.\n\nAn\neconomy scan can be used in order to give a basic value for an item sold to\nthe planetary population by the starbase on the world. Further it will also\nstate the standard weekly mass that will be purchased by the population.\n\nPerishables\n\nCertain\ntrade goods are classed as perishable. These items go off. In game this is\naccounted for by a weekly mass attrition. Each week there will be a drop of\nup to 5% of the mass. When trading in perishable masses it is imperative that\nthis loss is taken into consideration on all trade deals. If the goods are\ngoing to be in transit for a few weeks this could vastly reduce the profit\nmargin.\n\nExploration\n\nExploration is an important part of Phoenix. It is used to\nsearch for new resources as well as determine where to build outposts.\nResources can be classified under three headings. These are mineral based,\nspecial and planetary population.\n\nSearching for Mineral Resources\n\nProduction converts ores into finished items. As such, new\nand better sources of minerals are always desired. Mineral deposits can also\nbecome exhausted over time, thus forcing searches for new ore sources.\n\nScanning a planet for minerals is known as Geological\nProbability Indication (GPI). What this gives is the likelihood of minerals\nof the type specified being present. The sensor power of the ship also gives\nan error range in the mineral abundance present. Increasing the sensor power\nof the ship will reduce the error range, giving a more accurate indication of\nthe ore present.\n\nThere are number of ways to GPI a world. The first is a\nGPI of the entire planet. This takes the average of the ore scanned for over\nthe entire surface area of the world. On a large world, the low general\nbackground will swamp a small number of localised deposits. A GPI scan of a\ndesignated area can also be conducted. This can be done in order to look at\nthe average over the area. A series of these can be used on large worlds in\norder to quickly zoom in on a localised deposit by a series of overlapping\nGPI scans. Scanning rows will allow a ship to sequentially GPI scan every\nsector in a row for the range of rows indicated. This is slow but does have\nthe advantage of being thorough. Finally a GPI scan can be conducted for a\nsingle specific sector.\n\nProspecting\n\nOnce a sector is designated as a location likely to\ncontain one or more minerals, a second operation can be carried out. This\ntakes much longer than a GPI and can only be conducted while landed in the\ndesignated sector. It involves taking samples of the rock, soil, subsurface\n(or even ocean floor) and determining the exact yields of various ores\npresent. It determines the vein, which is the mass or ore present. Finally\nthe prospect also determines the accessibility of the vein. This is the\nnumber of mines that can exploit the vein at maximum output. There will be a\n10% drop in the output of the mines for every multiple of this number, e.g.\nthe table below shows a yield of 100mu's and a 10% drop of 15.\n\nQuantity Mines\n\nOutput Per Mine\n\nTotal mu ore produced per week\n\n15\n\n15@100\n\n1500\n\n30\n\n15@100, 15@90\n\n2850\n\n45\n\n15@100, 15@ 90, 15@80\n\n4050\n\nFrom this it can be seen that if the yield is high but the\n10% drop is very low, setting up a large outpost to tap what seems like a\ngood yield on the surface may well prove to be a poor investment.\n\nAnother table, this time for a yield of 150 but a 10% drop\nof 3.\n\nQuantity Mines\n\nOutput Per Mine\n\nTotal mu ore produced per week\n\n15\n\n3@150, 3@135, 3@120, 3@105, 3@90\n\n1800\n\n30\n\n3@150, 3@135, 3@120, 3@105, 3@90, 3@75, 3@60, 3@45,\n3@30, 3@15\n\n2475\n\n45\n\nAs above with 15@0\n\n2475\n\nFor the first 15 mines this outpost will out-produce the\nprevious one, but this all changes when larger quantities of mines start to\nbe considered. A good explorer will take these finds into consideration when\nsearching for a site for an outpost.\n\nWhen looking at minerals it is also a good idea to look at\nthe range of minerals that can be produced in the sector. It is often the\ncase that a sector will have a number of overlapping ores or even possibly\nmore than one source of a single ore. In the above example, the two ore veins\nmay have existed in the same sector. This means that construction of an\noutpost would allow it to exploit ore from the 150mu yield to begin with, and\nthen with increasing numbers of mines start exploiting the 100 yield once the\nreturn on the 150 fell below 100.\n\nEach deposit has its own unique identification number\n(ID#). This is only revealed by the prospect order. This ID# is used by the\noutpost in order to exploit the deposit.\n\nWhen considering where to construct an outpost, the vein\nhas to be considered. There is little point in building an outpost in a\nsector where all the ores will be exhausted in a few months!\n\nSearching for Special Resources\n\nSpecial resources are those that cannot be found through\nstandard actions and require the ship to perform special actions. These are\nalways processed by a human moderator and as such have a real money charge of\n£1.50 per special action associated with them. Once a special resource is\ndiscovered however, it is added to the data for the game and given a unique identity\nnumber (ID#). Once this ID# has been discovered, it can be used by any\noutpost or starbase in order to exploit the special resources, there is no\nfurther need to conduct special actions. As such starbase owners are often\nprepared to pay for ships to explore the planet for them, rooting out new\nspecial resources.\n\nConducting an expedition to discover special resources is\nfairly simple. Mapping the surface of the world will produce a map of the\nvarious terrains present on the surface of the world. For simplicities sake\nall terrains of a specific type are considered to have similar ecologies.\nThere may be a few exceptions, although these will be obvious from the\nresults of the explorations.\n\nArmed with a map, ships can then land in each terrain type\nand perform a \"Surface Exploration\". This will give a description of the\nterrain surrounding the ship. This may include where appropriate simple\ndescriptions of the flora and fauna or possibly native activity as well as\ngeological features. A surface exploration will not normally reveal any\nspecial resources.\n\nOnce a surface exploration has been conducted, specific\ninvestigations of the features noted in the surface exploration can be\nconducted. What is believed to be worth investigating is very much open to\ninterpretation by a player. A general rule of thumb though is that abundant\nspecial resources are generally obvious. As more and more investigations are\ncarried out, the likely yield and 10% drop for the special resource are\nlikely to drop.\n\nExample of a series of\ninvestigations\n\nThe player first landed in a forested region of the planet\nand performed a surface exploration. From this the player then decided to\ninvestigate the trees and the creatures present. These led to further areas\nthat the player thought might be interesting. In the table below, the bold\ntype is the title of the special action presented by the player (they may\nhave put a note about how they intended to perform the investigation). The\nitalics are the results written by the referee.\n\nSurface Exploration of Forest\n\nThe\nforests of Trath are dark cool and humid. The cries of many arboreal\ncreatures can be heard far above in the canopy. There are localised stands\nof trees. Pine trees primarily forest upper slopes while deciduous trees,\noverlooking the many small streams, dominate the valleys.\n\nInvestigate Trees\n\nThe\ntrees form ancient groves and although pines are sometimes found in a grove\nof deciduous trees, the soil chemistry is generally responsible for obvious\nsuitability of each species.\n\nID#:12467\n\nResource:\nHydrocarbons (3)\n\nYield:\n120mu10% Drop: 5\n\nAbundance:\n100000muRestock: 100mu\n\nInvestigate\nMany Arboreal Creatures\n\nThere\nare many species present although for the most part they appear to have no\nexploitable value. One species appears to dominate the valleys. This\ncreature clings to branches, never descending to the ground.\n\nInvestigate\nPine Tree\n\nThe\npine trees growth to heights of a few tens of metres in height. Beyond\ntheir resource as wood, there is nothing specific about these trees. Most are\npinecone bearing.\n\nInvestigate Deciduous Tree\n\nThe\ndeciduous trees require plenty of water and considerable amounts of light.\nThere are many fruit trees present although it is found that the arboreal\ncreatures tend to prefer to feast on a fruit that looks similar to a plum.\nThe seeds from the fruit in general are largely voided through the\nintestinal tracts of the arboreal creatures.\n\nID#:22211\n\nResource:\nFruit (30000)\n\nYield:\n100mu10% Drop: 30\n\nAbundance:\n50000muRestock: 100mu\n\nInvestigate\nClinging Creature\n\nThe\nthick fur of these creatures proves to the be only part of the creature\nwith commercial value.\n\nID#:12241\n\nResource:\nFur (30010)\n\nYield:\n40mu10% Drop: 10\n\nAbundance:\n5000muRestock: 10mu\n\nInvestigate\nPinecones\n\nThe\npinecones contain an interesting compound that can be exploited as a drug.\n\nID#:\n21347\n\nResource:\nTrath Pinecone (30225)\n\nYield:\n5mu\n\n10%\nDrop: 1\n\nAbundance:\n200mu Restock: 1mu\n\nInvestigate\nDeciduous Plum Analogues\n\nThese\nare the favoured food of the arboreal creatures and prove to be a firm favourite\nwith the exploration team.\n\nID#:148711\n\nResource:Trath\nFruit (32170)\n\nYield:\n10mu10% Drop: 2\n\nAbundance:\n500muRestock: 5mu\n\nInvestigate Seeds\n\nThe\nseeds are collected by the team and after a series of tests are found to\nhave no commercial value.\n\nIn the example it can be seen that new avenues can be\nfurther investigated. There are the streams to look at, possibly some soil\nsamples to take. Further investigation into the other arboreal creatures. A\nplayer may even be interested in collecting seeds from the Trath Plum Tree\nand seeing if they can be planted on other worlds. This though invariably\nrequires the use of research facilities, i.e. the assistance of a starbase or\noutpost.\n\nThe player may even sell the information about the Trath\nPlum Trees to a starbase built on this world. This will require the two\nplayers to contact each other and work out some kind of deal.\n\nTypical World Survey\n\nThis is an example of the method used to survey a world.\nFollowing this will give a very good indication of what is to be exploited on\nthe world.\n\nPlanet Scan – gives map showing various terrains to\nexplore.\n\nGPI World (all ores) – reveals some basics of what can be\nexploited.\n\nOrbital Scan – always good to check for anomalies.\n\nLow Pass Scan – as above, may also reveal some important\nfeatures.\n\nGPI areas, rows or sectors for minerals.\n\nLand at each terrain type – then perform the following:\n\nSurface Exploration – gives some idea what to investigate.\n\nSubsurface Scan – geological surveys can prove useful.\n\nInvestigate XXX – where XXX is some interesting aspect as\nrevealed by the previous special actions.\n\nProspect – only if the sector has revealed itself to\ncontain minerals in abundances worth exploiting.\n\nNon-Standard Special\nActions\n\nFrom time to time there will be questions that need to be\nasked that do not fall into the basic special actions such as investigation.\nThese may include speaking to natives found on the planet or attempting to\nperform an action that just isn't covered by the normal selection of orders\nsuch as rounding up some natives and forcing them into slavery. These special\nactions are however dealt with in the same way as investigations. The player\nshould write what it is that is being attempted. The referee will then read\nthe special action, take into consideration parameters appropriate to the\nsituation and give a response.\n\nWhen writing special actions use the following guidelines:\n\nAll special actions should have a single goal.\n\nKeep special actions brief.\n\nAvoid any ambiguity.\n\nNever attempt to circumvent standard actions.\n\nThis is an example of a player attempting to round up a\nfew peaceful and pacifistic natives on a backward world and force them into\nslavery.\n\nSpecial Action\n\nUsing the troops from the ship surround one of the small\ncamps of natives and use overwhelming firepower to force then into the ship\nin order to make them slaves.\n\nResults\n\nThe 300 troops surround a small camp of around 50\nnatives. A quick and brutal display of firepower reduces a few protestors\nto charcoal and the rest of the natives to pliant captives. These are\nherded into the ship under close scrutiny where they are stripped, deloused\nand made ready for their new lives as slaves.\n\nThe player writing the above special action may have\nalready discovered that the natives were peaceful and without adequate\nweaponry so felt confident to pull-off the action with little or no problems.\nHad the natives been hunter-gatherers or slightly better defended, the\nreferee may well have given a very different result.\n\nNB-While Phoenix does not attempt to enforce morals on\nplayers; overly extreme actions will generally be toned down or glossed over.\nPhrases such as 'brutal things were done to the slaves' will be used.\n\nThis is a game and therefore should not be offensive to\nplayers.\n\nSpecial Action Fulfilment\n\nIt is sometimes the cases that a special action or investigation will grant\na chance of achieving a goal as long as a set of parameters are fulfilled.\nThis is fairly generic and should be explained by the special action.\n\nExample:\nHaving talked with some natives, they offer all their worldly wealth in precious\ngems for a single batch of personal communicators. A one-off special action\nwill exchange 1mu consumer goods for 50mu's precious gems.\n\nExample:\nCave systems extend for many kilometres through the mountains. These can\nbe sealed from the environments and used as a basis for an outpost. The\none-off exhaustive use of a special mineral extraction tech by an outpost\nin this sector will produce 200 cave complexes.\n\nTerminology\n\nWe try to explain things simply but over the years, there are a few terms\nthat have slipped in and become, if not common, certainly infrequent.\n\nOne-off: This means that the special action can only normally be performed\nonce. Subsequent attempts at the same action may result in failure or at\nbest a reduced return. This is sometimes tied to a location or a position,\ni.e. in the above cave system example, each outpost or starbase in a mountains\nsector can make a single use of the special action.\n\nExhaustive: This means that the item specified\nis deleted. The action presumed that the use of the item is such that it\ncan never be recovered afterwards. This word is normally only used\nin conjunction with Principles, Techs and Blueprints.\nWhen seeing this word, make sure before proceeding with the special action\nthat the results are actually worth the investment. Not everything is a bargain!\n\nIf the position does not have the items to be exchanged or used may have\nto wait until it has before performing the special action.\n\nGPI Scans\n\nGPI\nscanning is normally conducted from orbit. If the position is landed, then it\ncan only GPI the sector it is located in.\n\nOres\nfall into a number of categories. When GPI'ing the player has to select which\nore type is being scanned for. Only known ores will be scanned for.\n\nWhile\na deposit is considered to be situated in a single sector, it often extends\ninto the surrounding sectors. This is known as the dispersion factor of the\ndeposit. The dispersion value is the multiplier per sector to the original\nyield per sector distance from the origin. A dispersion of 0 means that the\ndeposit is truly a point source and can only be exploited from the specific\nsector. The other extreme is 1. This means that the yield is a planetary one\nand can be tapped from anywhere on the world. It is generally the background\nlevel and when present is usually very low in yield.\n\nA\ndispersion of 0.5 means that a yield of 100 for example would be 50 in an\nadjacent sector, 25 in the one next to that and so on.\n\nA\nvalue of around 0.6 is common.\n\nSpecial Resources\n\nThey\nhave the same parameters as mineral resources and once discovered are\ngenerally treated in pretty much the same way.\n\nThey\ngenerally also have a 'restock' value. This is the amount of increase in the\n'vein' each week. Where a yield is excellent, but the vein is poor, a decent\nrestock may well allow an outpost to exploit one resource for a period of\ntime until it has exhausted the resource, then swap to another, allowing the\nfirst resource to replenish itself.\n\nOrigin\n\nCertain\nitems producible by special resource complexes are classed as unique. This\nmeans that they are not found on any other world. As such they have an\norigin, this being the world they are produced on.\n\nItems\nwith origins have a variable value when sold by a starbase to a planetary\npopulation. The price that the planetary population are willing to pay is\nproportionate to the distance between the origin and world where they are\nbeing sold.\n\nStandard Investigations\n\nAs\nwell as Surface Exploration and Investigation, there are a number of other\nspecial actions that are routinely undertaken.\n\nSurface\nExploration – This\nis conducted while landed on a world. The special action will explore the terrain.\nTo keep things simple, it is assumed that all terrains of the\nsame type are approximately the same.\n\nInvestigate\nXXXX – where\nXXXX is a specific feature of either a previous exploration or investigation.\n\nSubsurface\nScan –\nThis again is conducted while landed and will reveal some aspect of the\ngeological processed involved in the formation of the terrain. It also might\nreveal some minerals that are not revealed by standard GPI'ing.\n\nOrbital\nScan – This\nis conducted while in orbit. It will generally reveal something about the region\nof space close to the world. It will detail rings if they are\npresent as well as other anomalous features.\n\nLow\nPass Scan – This\nis again conducted while in orbit. It will reveal some general aspects about\nthe surface and where appropriate the atmosphere. It will also check\nfor anomalies on the surface.\n\nBuilding Outposts and Starbases\n\nWhile trade is capable of supporting the wages of a ship's\ncrew, at some point it is likely that a player will want a more permanent\nsource of stellars. This may be from a regular mineral or special resource\nthat the ship can then sell to markets of other starbases. It may be the case\nthat the player has grander schemes and actually want to build more ships and\ncreate a shipping fleet – or a war fleet.\n\nStarbases cannot be built directly; a ship has to first\nconstruct an outpost. The outpost can then issue an order to be converted\ninto a starbase. A short overview of both installations and the method of\nconstruction follow.\n\nOutposts\n\nAn outpost is an installation that consists of one of more\ncomplex. A complex is an immovable structure that performs a specific task or\nhas a specific role. A command centre for example ensures a chain of command\nin order to maintain efficiency. A mine strips and processes minerals from\nthe sector in which the outpost is built. Special resource complexes tap the\nworld ecology. Along with complexes, an outpost contains many other items\nneeded for their smooth running. Employees are required to run the complexes.\nTroops and ordnance are often present in order to provide defence from ground\nattacks. Orbital defence platforms may have been built to counter-attack\nanything attempting to perform orbital bombardments. For all this though\noutposts are considered second-rate and as such all the troops and employees\npresent in an outpost demand double the normal wages, this being 2 stellars\nper week.\n\nPolitical Requirement\n\nRunning an outpost or starbase requires the player to\nfirst have a political position.\n\n(See rulebook on Political Positions)\n\nPolitical Positions generate a weekly report. They\nalso have weekly cost of £1.00.\n\nOutposts\n\nOutposts only generate a turn on request. When a printout\nis requested, the player is charged £2.00. Orders can be sent in without the\nnecessity to request a printout.\n\nIf the outpost/starbase is involved in battle, a battle\nreport will be generated at zero cost.\n\nUnusual Locations\n\nWhile it is normal to build an outpost on the surface of\na world in order to exploit planetary resources, it is not strictly\nnecessary. An outpost can be constructed either in orbit or even in space. In\nsuch cases the outpost is generally referred to as a space station. It has\nall the parameters of a standard outpost although for obvious reasons it will\nnot normally have any resources to exploit. There will also be other\nconstraints such as not being able to build certain complexes such as cave\ncomplexes.\n\nStarbases\n\nStarbases are effectively fancier versions of outposts.\nAlong with everything that can be done by an outpost, starbases can also\nperform the following:\n\nFactory Production – Factory complexes build items\nfrom minerals.\n\nMerchandise – Merchandising complexes trade with\nthe world population and can directly generate stellars.\n\nMarket – Starbases can have markets allowing ships\nto buy from them and sell to them. All interactions with outposts can only be\neither pick-up or deliver.\n\nStarbases also have the benefit of only having to pay 1\nstellar per week.\n\nConstruction of an Outpost\n\nNormally outposts are built on a mineral deposit\ndiscovered through exploration and planetary surveying. If the outpost is\ndestined to become a starbase, with production facilities, it is preferable\nto build the outpost on a good metals deposit with ready access to a\nreasonable basic-elements source as these are the primary two minerals used\nin building most items. If it is to remain an outpost, then exploitation of\nan uncommon or rare mineral deposit is perfectly reasonable. Careful\nconsideration of the maximum potential growth should be undertaken as once a\ncomplex is constructed, it cannot be dismantled, only demolished. At 1000mu's\neach, setting up an outpost for a few months is not normally commercially\nviable.\n\nThorlium while uncommon is used extensively in the\nconstruction of ordnance and other items that have to withstand considerable\nstresses, including ship hulls. Again, if the outpost is destined to be\nupgraded to starbase status with factory facilities, having a source of\nthorlium either on the planet or within easy shipping distance is definitely\npreferable.\n\nThe order to construct an outpost requires the nomination\nof the first complex to be built. This complex will be constructed out of the\nmodules present in the cargo section of the ship. This means that the ship\nneeds sufficient modules present that are suitable for the complex designated\n(see Starbase rulebook appendix – Complex Module Requirements).\n\nProviding that sufficient modules are present and the\nlocation of construction is viable, i.e. not on top of another facility and\nthe designated complex can be constructed, an outpost will be created. This\nwill have its own unique number and one complex. Once constructed a free\nupdate of the outpost will be sent out. This will detail the outpost, listing\nthe single complex as well as other data such as mineral resources that can\nbe tapped and the position present in the starport, i.e. the ship that built\nit.\n\nA standard approach is to build an outpost as the last\naction making sure that there are plenty of TU's remaining for the ship. This\nway the update and the ship turn will arrive the next day and the ship will\nstill have TU's it can use. The ship will then have TU's available to deliver\nsome employees to the outpost (at least 10 to run the single complex) and\npossibly some other basic items such as more modules and employees to run\nthem.\n\nAfter these deliveries it is then a case of issuing orders\nfor the outpost directly, running it as a separate position (see Starbase\nrulebook).\n\nMaintaining Ships\n\nPerforming actions such as taking off, or entering\nwormholes and suchlike causes stresses in the hull of the ship. These\nstresses and micro-fractures will eventually lead to the ship falling to\npieces if ignored. The current state of the ship is known as its integrity,\nthis is a measurement of its peak state. A ship straight out the construction\nyard will have integrity of 100%.\n\nWeekly Integrity Attrition\n\nMerely having a ship running day in day out will take its\ntoll on integrity such that even if a ship never moves, its integrity will\nslowly decrease over weeks.\n\nThe hull type used in the construction of the ship\ndictates the ship's resilience to integrity losses, both weekly and due to\nundertaking actions that place stress on the hull.\n\nHeavy hulls are the most resilient. Ships constructed out of\nheavy hulls only normally lose 0.5% integrity per week. Ships constructed out\nof xtra light hulls will lose 4% integrity per week.\n\nHull Type\n\nWeekly Loss\n\nIntegrity Modifier\n\nHeavy\n\n0.5%\n\n0.5\n\nNormal\n\n1%\n\n1\n\nLight\n\n2%\n\n2\n\nXtra Light\n\n4%\n\n4\n\nManoeuvres\n\nAll actions have a chance of reducing the integrity of a\nship. The chance can range from 0% through to 100%, i.e. some will never\nactually reduce the integrity of a ship under normal circumstances. Each\naction also has a maximum integrity loss. This means that should the action\ntrigger an integrity loss, the integrity of the ship will drop by a random\namount up to the maximum integrity loss. Before this loss is applied to the\nship however, it is first multiplied by the ship's integrity modifier. For\nexample, a ship landing on a planet may incur a maximum integrity loss of 2%.\nFor a ship constructed out of heavy hulls, the maximum loss will be 1% but\nfor a ship constructed out of xtra light hulls this could be as much as 8%.\n\nZero Integrity\n\nOnce a ship falls to zero integrity, it will break up and\nno longer be a ship. It will be reclassified as debris, effectively\nconsisting of a list of remaining items. Debris can be picked up by anyone as\nlong as they have the debris position number.\n\nLow Integrity\n\nEven if a position has not dropped to zero integrity, it\nhas a chance of blowing up but only if involved in combat. If a ship has\nsuffered over 50% hull damage then each damaging hit has a chance of forcing\nan integrity check to avoid blowing up. The chance of forcing an integrity\ncheck is proportional to the total damage sustained by the ship.\n\nAn integrity check to avoid blowing up is based on the\ncurrent integrity of the ship up to a maximum of 80%. Therefore having\nintegrity of at least 80% will ensure the greatest chance of avoiding blowing\nup in combat.\n\nInstalling/Uninstalling Items\n\nBoth installing and uninstalling items will reduce the\nintegrity of a ship. This is based on the quantity of items and not the size\nof them. Jettisoning the items avoids the integrity drop but has the\nunfortunate side effect of destroying the item. The theory is that the item\nis cut out, leaving the ship intact while uninstalling the item removes the\ninstalled item intact at the cost of the hull.\n\nRefit\n\nIf a ship is replacing items that are specified as being\npart of the ship in the ship's blueprint, then a refit order will be\ninvaluable if the ship requires many items to be installed. A refit order,\nconducted while in a starport will attempt to install items in order to\nreturn the ship to its original design. Presuming that the starbase/outpost\nhas patches, these will be automatically used to counter the normal integrity\nloss caused by installation.\n\nRestoring Integrity\n\nA maintenance visit will restore the integrity of a ship\nback to 100%. This will require the starbase/outpost to expend a number of\npatches based on the size of the ship and the amount of integrity restored.\nThe ship will be charged for the quantity of patches used based on the market\nreport. A maintenance visit will also recharge any shields, restoring shield\nfactors lost in combat.\n\nRestoring Damage\n\nCombat damages hulls, armour and items. If an item suffers\nmore damage than its mass, it will be destroyed and removed from the ship's\nitinerary. A repair visit will use patches to remove damage. The quantity of\npatches used is determined by the damage taken to the hulls and the armour of\nthe ship. A repair visit will also repair any items that have been damaged\nbut not destroyed. Destroyed items have to be replaced by either installing new\nitems or performing a refit visit.\n\nIntegrity\n\nZero\nintegrity causes the ship to be reduced to debris.\n\nDebris\ncannot perform any actions.\n\nDebris can be picked up by anyone even without using a\nsecurity code. Life forms will be classed as prisoners if no security code is\nused.\n\nDebris suffers attrition. This is normally a maximum of\n5% per week. This means that up to 5% of the items present in the debris will\nbe lost forever.\n\nInstalling Items\n\nDue to integrity losses only ships with current integrity\ngreater than 20% will be allowed to have items installed in them. At any time\ncurrent integrity falls below 20% any further attempts to install items will\nfail.\n\nIntegrity in Combat\n\nWarships and vessels likely to see sustained combat\nshould aim to have integrity values of at least 80% to avoid unnecessary\nchances of blowing up during combat.\n\nShip Use\n\nDue\nto the regular loss of integrity suffered through taking off an landing on\nworlds, survey ships should be made from heavy hulls, or possibly normal\nhulls.\n\nComplex Visits\n\nAll\ncomplex visits have to be conducted while in a starport. This is a location\nof the starbase or outpost designed to accommodate ships and other docked\nposition."

      "text": "eldar players produce nothing but two guards and one ranger squad, for all of tier 1. And they actually get away with it because of the insane imba of that Ranger squad.\n\nThis is a very short first post because I believe the answer is simple... nerf damage, totally. No damage from Rangers at their current price. They should break morale but inflict no physiical damage, not for their price. Either jack up that price to 60/5, or even 70/5, or no damage, especially not for 40/5.\n\nReducing their damage to infantry may be ok, but not an overall reduction in damage. However, wouldn't you think that their drastically high morale damage isn't worse?\n\nI'd think that if their damage is reduced in T1, then make the accuracy booster researches bump it up more than usual to conpensate (makes them scale better).\n\nThe probable reason that rangers haven't really been discussed much, is that just like with overpowered Khorne bezerkers, people will refuse to admit it & claim that their price is just right along with their damage etc because they hate tau or want melee > range or something.\n\nIf Eldar rangers were nerfed, I'd also like to see a nerfage in Khorne bezerkers too, particularly to their HP.\n\nlol reaper... stfu this isnt about chaos. (even though you are right =P)\n\nand yes i agree. nerf rangers damage to literally next to nothing like it was in vanilla DoW. the reason being that they make it all too easy for eldar to come into your base early on, kill your builders with impunity, and FoF the heck outta there. Not only that, but their range is retarded as well, 40... 40 range for a tier 1 FoF, cloaked unit.\n\ntake away their FoF, and 10 range, and damage, and theyll still be worth the cost they are now.. essentially they would be a 30 range cloaked flamethrower with the ability to instabreak any singe squad for 40/10 a member. thats less than the cost of even JUST a flamethrower for any race.\n\nNerf range in t1 and lengthen the cloak upgrade time a bit is all thats needed. Nerf damage slightly (though already they don't do much. Problem is their targets typically are cappers or small squads where the total hp is low). Maybe 30 range is fine.\n\nIf Eldar rangers were nerfed, I'd also like to see a nerfage in Khorne bezerkers too, particularly to their HP.\n\nActually I'd be happy if zerkers were nerfed/hard capped ANYWAY, with or without a ranger nerf. Those beasts' spam are more trouble than Flayed Spam!\n\nAbout the rangers... all the nerfs proposed are too much, imo. I really wouldn't use rangers if they were uncloacked, did no damage (it's crap already, except vs cappers, as SubakuGaara said) and had no FoF.\n\nAn 80% accuracy is the way to nerf Rangers, because 100% accuracy on a morale breaker squad is damn high. Other than that, they're fine.\n\nRangers are tantamount to an instant win vs. IG. the retard-high morale drain they cause means that once a squad (yes, even the command squad) breaks, it stays broken unless it can get away or a commie's present.\n\nIf, god forbid, the cloaked Rangers get discovered, they just FOF away. And lo, the pain in the ass continues. You CANNOT win against a good Eldar Ranger user on varied-terrain maps as IG.\n\nThere's no thread about rangers,because any sm/csm/ig thread becomes a nerf rangers thread eventually anyways ^^.\n\nIncrease infiltration cost to something signifigant. Given their range and heavy armor their tough as is. Irony permits me to say increase it to 150/150 (same as assassin infiltration) but 100/75 would be better. Or better yet,make it tier 2. Rangers are still dangerous,but atleast you can get at them and when heavy guns are being rolled out in tier 2 they get a bit of survivability.\n\nAnd turrets dont move,sure one can keep them out of your base,but they cant keep your cappers alive.\n\nI don't believe in increasing cost. just the timing. make the research take about 20-30 seconds longer even if it means moving it to a different building. I know that when my first rap gets there, his rangers just finish cloaking. make it take longer at the same cost. if you increase cost, you'll affect other things like eldar opening game and BOs which we generally want to keep intact.\n\nnerf range to 30 (restore with upgrade in t2), increase infiltrate research time and see how that works. I think that'd be a good start. Of course part of the problem is FOF but FOF is here to stay pretty much.\n\nnerfing accuracy is too much. they have long reload already. having them miss is too much. its the same complaint people have with assassin and I agree with them.\n\nNot really the same though because the Assassin is just one guy, Rangers are still gonna hit unless you're really unlucky, they'll just do a bit less damage / morale damage per volley.LOL!\nThese guys are tougher than slugga boyz (technically it's not a big deal). Shouldn't they be rather easy to kill, either lowering their HP to 200 or giving them Infantry_med armour.\n\nRangers should still get fleet of foot, but they should do less HP & morale damage in Tier 1. Both of these however should be significantly buffed by the accuracy researches however, so that Rangers scale better in later tiers.\n\n35 is the same range as a space marine heavy bolter, 25 is the range of a regular bolter.\n\nThough the numbers were slightly out, the issue remains the same. You have a long range FOF unit with stealth that's actually very durable. (nearly as tough as marines for cost) I did make a thread about rangers which covered many of the facts and figures. Especially their absurd damage vs Infantry Med- \n\nI HAS WRITTEN A BOOK!\nAs soon as the cover artist, proof reader and everything else I rely on other people to do is done, I'll let you know.\n\nlol.\nall eldar units have nearly as much health as their other race's counterparts. sometimes even more. reapers have 450 stock, i mean comeon.\nyou really dont NEED flight of foot, you just like it so you can dominate. Flight of foot is what helps your tier 1 units compete in tier 2 if they are outgunned.\n\nand in that lua it says their sight range is 40?? how bout keeping them as they are, and requiring a spotter ;-) heh sound familiar?\n\nJust make them glass nerf T1 damage.\nNerf HP and armor type\nNerf damage and accuracy until Optics upgrade\nRange? well they ARE snipers, and snipers ARE supposed to have long range.\nFoF, well they are eldar\nInfiltrate? they are rangers.\n\nBut Tough on top of that means that even if you spot them and focus fire they will be able to live through the shots until they run away. Make it so that they would die (ALL die) if they tried to run past a turret. If spotted a HW squad in range should be able to down them quickly, and regular squads should be able to inflict at least 50% causalties before they are able to get away.\n\nSo my proposal is 80% accuracy restored to full with T2 optics upgrade. and alot less HP and a lower armor type. and I forget whoo said it but hes right, 5 members firing at 80% means only 1 misses. thats 20% less damage and morale per volley. the assassin on the other hand is once out of 5 times he would do nothing which is retarded.\n\nIn my mind the issues are only really with the SM and IG matchup. Everyone else has a solid early detectors (tau, ork) or pretty much a morale immune t.15 / t2 (choas, nec)\n\nRangers range in t1 is a bit much. Dropping from 35 to 30 before first optics would achieve 2 things:\n\n1) let a CS tie them pretty much tie them up forever if they so choose (long reload)\n2) allow scouts to get into CC with them much easier\n\nBeyond that any issues are really SM and IG issues. SM's are average detection t1. IGs are cappper armour on their mainstay units, and crap morale.\n\nThe SM detection issue I'm sure can easily be resolved, possibly with a probe cost reduction.\n\nIG issue are harder to tackle. I don't know if you can look at a morale buff (maybe +20) for t1 GM without screwing up other matchups. If you could, I think that'd be the way to go, so GM don't insta-break from a single volley. I still think the range reduction goes a long way to fixing things. CS harass, pos with turret backup -> t2 hwt defence -> fast t3 is still really effective against eldar.. granted there aren't a lot of builds that are but I think sometimes people really do exaggerate how one sided this matchup is.\n\ndrcole... just about every tier 1/1.5 unit breaks from a single volley of ranger fire.\n\nOnly if you're talking a fully reinforced 8 man squad. An unreinforced squad won't even break GM in a single volley. Remember with infiltration that's 90 power for a single squad t1 - far more than any other incl heroes (or the same power cost as a GK squad). That's a lot when you consider Eldar need a further 200 power to slap the SS down (after they shell out at least 50 for FoF).\n\nHow about making infiltration research require a soul shrine (t2) ? Would that make rangers useless in T1 ? I suppose people would argue both ways, personally I don't want them nerfed at all because I really like playing Eldar and rangers roxorz\n\nI'd rather see an improvement to SM early detection like: lower price of skull probes, or make them come infiltrated by default without requiring an armory (essentially a buff to SM from 1.1 rather than the current \"fix\") Suppose that could create a new problem of spamming probes and using stun on buildings in T1, maybe make the stun not available until T2 as well.\n\nAs for IG... *sigh* don't they have a hard time vs everything in T1 I sort of doubt it is a ranger specific issue... T1 GM are the weakest infantry. Sure rangers own them, but scouts own them, cultists own them etc.. etc.. etc..2)nerf range to 30 range in t1\nLOL and remove hardcap of rangers all together..\n\nThat is a totally unfair comparison because:\n\n1) Those units are not harcapped at 1\n2) Rangers cannot be equipped with stupidly effective heavy weapons like nades and sniper rifles\n\n-Set up times should be much longer maybe the tripple.So that they cannot run around set up fire and run around again.Afterall they are using snipers.\n-Squads shouldnt break with first voley\n-Reduce the squad size or make them a bit more fragile so we can actually \"kill\" some of them before they run away.\n\nBut rangers should stay at level 1 cloaked.ıts whole idea of it.Maybe cloak could be harder to access but still I wouldnt like a tier2 ranger nor a hardcap removed one.\n\nArguing that an unreinforced squad wont break a gm squad is worthless because who DOSENT reinforce their ranger squad after building them? I mean really lets be constructive here.\n\nAnd for the hell of it a unreinforced ranger squad might not break a gm squad in one shot,but it DOES wipe it completley out in 3-4 (after the 3rd volley should be one GM with 80~ish hp left if i remeber correctly)\n\nAlso a 75%-100% full ranger squad will break the CS in 2-3 (maybe 3-4,havent labbed it recently) volleys.\n\nAnd yes you're always going to reinforce, but the point is the overall cost for a fully reinforced squad is pretty high.. compare that to say reapers where you may get an exarch but you're pretty unlikey to reinforce early, and also keeping in mind the power cost involved overall.\n\n1) Those units are not harcapped at 1\n2) Rangers cannot be equipped with stupidly effective heavy weapons like nades and sniper rifles\n\nWhat BS. 1 ranger squad is equally as effective as 4 sniper scouts or a few cults with nades. Ask any SM player and he'll tell you that while trying to strangle you from frustration; he'll say even if the rangers have a hard time to start, you can just use GUs to melee the scouts or draw their fire and then bring the cloaked rangers in the back. And hell I can't even do a cult with nades strat vs eldar cause\n1)rangers are cloaked in 20 sec and cults with nades strat has no t1 detection\n2)farseers immediate t1 spell kills the whole squad and her special attacks+FOF just destroy entire cultists squads in ways no other commander can\n\nI'm telling you the right answer about the ranger fix so listen to it and fully understand that it aims to change little. 30 range instead of 35 cause most t1 detection is only 25 range anyway. Increase infiltrate research by 20-30 seconds so that rangers can still contest for map control but not for total map control dont reinforce my rangers. I would set the research back a little bit of a tier to help detectors out. Troubble is that eldar dont have an armoury building... What about making the research come from a webway? It could cost 0/50... Perhaps a small range decrease as suka suggested too've tried. You'll lose the map because you can't afford rax+armory+enough cultists to contend for the map (on most maps. Sometimes you can cheat if its a map like quest triumph with turret use though).\n\n@hawilis\nReinforce rangers. Cause you won't be losing them for a while in general.\n\nRangers can fire at CS squad out of detection range . Thats one free volley right there,then you need to find the little red glow to signal where the rangers are,thats another volley and a 3rd one just before CS reaches them. Sure then their tied up,big deal,your CS is no longer keeping the FS or guardian squads raping your GMs busy. GG.\n\nWhy are you trying to hurt the rangers with the command squad? Why the hell do IG even need detectors??\n\nYou should be hurting them by attack-grounding the red dots with grenade launchers. Even if your guardsmen are broken, grenades have a 100% accuracy, and rangers won't exactly be doing a whole lot when they're broken, or being battered around by grenades.\n\nGL aren't tier 1.5 if instead of the infantry command, you put down a tactica, build a few (about 5) grenade launchers, add 1 or 2 commies, and hit the tier 2 button with mass execute up your sleeve. They come out at the same time as tacs, dark reapers, etc. If you're going to complain about GL being late, you're ignoring that ranger infiltration research + ranger building is horrendously slow.\n\nThe number two complaint behind rangers against eldar is that mind war instagibs one member of the command squad anyway. Why are you causing both problems with the wrong tech?\n\nThe last time I played ig, you needed an infantry command to produce commies\nand if you attack him with nades, execute(T2 costs shitloads btw and takes some time) from commies you cant build , what does he have?\n2 Guardiansquads and rangers?\nby the time you can get that army working, there is probably this funny little clown on the way to instagib you entire army O_o\n\nBleh, honestly rangers are only broken in MU's vs IG/SM due to poor morale for IG and shit tier 1 detection for SM...fix the other races and Rangers are fine. Tau have vespid/tc (which every tau player uses), Chaos has cultist nade (which does work but you go without barracks early) Necrons = lol, Orcs has the Mek + banners....And all these races have turrets which pretty much stop rangers from harassing an area all together. Fix IG...Everywhere, Fix SM tier 1 detection... Im all for range nerf for rangers as long as they get it back after optics1 but id rather see races fixed rather than nerfed.\n\nI think Rangers need only a slight range T1 nerf (put it back to 32 like it was initially), & have their HP reduced by 25%, so they're 210 HP instead of 280. Also nerf their armour type too.\nThat way, they're still lethal, but detecting them is far more efficient."

Messing with that balance should cause the reaction to stop, not go out of control.\n\nThat was my first thought seeing this post. Glad I'm not the only one who thought this, seems others have the same opinion/fact also.\n\nFusion reactors don't go out of control like fission reactors, quite the opposite. The process is delicate and finely tuned. Messing with that balance should cause the reaction to stop, not go out of controlFission is even less likely to result in any type of explosion/detonation. A huge amount of pressure is needed to maintain fission and as soon as the pressure vessel is ruptured the hydrogen is released and the fission reactor runs out of energy to burn and the pressure in which to convert it.\n\nYou can trust me..I'm a doctor, well not the kind that helps people, but a radiation health physicist.\n\nApart from the bit where you confuse Fusion and Fission?\n\nWe played table top with a reactor exposion rule once when multiple criticals occurred.\nA Salamander got toasted, criticalled, the engine went, the chain reaction of 'Mech explosions took out the 2 companies involved (both sides of the conflict), and wiped out most of the city we were defending. Why couldn't we roll like that for shooting :}\n\nEnd of campaign\n\nDidn't consider them \"nuclear\" explosions though. Just the usual result of dumping plasma at 4500K into atmosphereNo, it would lead to light mech kamikaze attackes to weaken the enemy while missle boats finish them off and other such tactics that i doubt anyone wants to see. Besides fusion reactors don't \"go nuclear\" and explode when breached, they just stop. I do think we should be able to cause some nice explosions from non-CASE ammo storage crits though!\n\nYeah well, the thing is that the whole thread seems to be misunderstood. Very rare explosion from a superheated engine, sitting inside an armor stuffed with weapons and ammo and hit by a missile or something is perfectly plausible.\n\nAn actual nuclear explosion (with EMP, fallout and all that stuff), as per the thread title, is just silly and unsupported.\n\nYou are correct. A Mech that looses to much shield have a small chance to experience a THERMAL EXPLOSION. There are to many safeties involved for a Mech Engine to actually go blow up.\n\nQuote\n\nFusion engines usually will only shut down if damaged, and they are absolutely no risk of being a fusion bomb. There have been a number of cases of fusion engines being \"over revved\" and exploding with devestating force, but this is more akin to a boiler explosion than a true nuclear explosion. More often a destroyed engine will be punctured by weapons fire. Because the plasma is held in a vacuum chamber (to isolate the superheated plasma from the cold walls of the reactor; contact with the walls would super-chill the plasma below fusion temperatures), a punctured reactor can suck in air where the air is superheated. Normal thermal expansion of the air causes the air to burst out in a brilliant lightshow often mistaken for a \"nuclear explosion\". The Thermal Expansion damages anything within 90 meters of the destroyed 'MechWhile this is true about mech armor, by the time the ammo is cooking off this means that section of armor has already been highly compromised. Also if about 10 hits in that area can make that ammo go critical and there are 200 rounds of ammo in it (a heck of alot more than the ten it took to make it go critical) the results should still look like the fourth of July.\n\nNo nuclear explosion, but plenty of fireworks and at least limited damage to something standing in the blasts.\n\nI think there should be a bit more to it than the present shower of metal debris. While destroying the fusion reactor should not cause a catastrophic meltdown and devastate everything nearby (because fusion reactors do not work that way), it would be reasonable to conclude that a sizable mass of high-density, high-temperature plasma is present.\n\nIf the containment field is breached because the reactor is damaged, then fusion will stop, because there will be nothing to hold the plasma in a constant, super-dense state (which is required for fusion to happen). The fuel cannot under any circumstances reach the heat and temperature necessary to fuse in an uncontrolled state.\n\nThe plasma in the reactor (since it will no longer be contained) will be free to explosively decompress and melt things. Would this effect do any noticable damage to a battlemech? Maybe, since it is functionally identical to a thermobaric bomb, but even under the worst of circumstances, this would be no more damaging than an SRM or two.\n\nOh it seems I have stumbled onto a science and physics based thread... I think the option should be there and a button mapped to shut it down, I.E. in the middle of your friends so it is less of an end all and of course Less team killing."

Annoying.\n\nMeaux_Pas: Is it fucking Taint Sunday or something? liza: Screw y'all, I'm going to the moon\n\n- Lower cost (350/250 + cost per interceptor is far too much) - Faster build time or lower Stargate cost (Takes the longest of any unit in the game to transition to effectively, especially because you wouldn't have Stargates already like a Terran would have Starports) - Restore BW micro. Without changing stats this would about double the effective damage output since the interceptors wouldn't return to the carrier arbitrarily. Would also create tension and skill differential making games exciting. - Reduce the shared weakness of the colossus and carrier to Vikings. The BL/Ultra switch or Colossus/HT works because one unit does not counter both and they fill slightly different roles. The Colossus and Carrier are both long range, low health for cost units that are countered by Vikings/Corruptors severely. To make a Carrier transition a viable strategy, those units need to not hard counter it but instead just be cost efficient against it. I suggest adding a kind of hardened shield or making it not Massive. The Terran counter should be, for example, marines (kill interceptors fast). SInce marines die to Colossus that would make a desirable strategic dynamic.\n\nThe Reaper wrote:Evolution is a really really really long run-on sentence.\n\nMeaux_Pas: Is it fucking Taint Sunday or something? liza: Screw y'all, I'm going to the moon\n\nWell, at least that's what Khaldor tweeted, to which moletrap replied:\n\nmoletrap wrote:Funny how people assume that Khaldor's tweet is word for word literal and official. -.- I'll try to get some more info out soon.\n\n@callmegoo well I'm glad at least someone decided to actually ask ME about it.

And Colossus building requires less resources to reach even if you have a stargate and no robo, and the robo is requires for mobile detection for Protoss.\n\n(300/200 + 150/150 + 350/250 + 100/0 to have a single carrier ready to fight, plus air weapons.

Robo+Bay+Colossus is 200/100 + 200/200 + 200/200 + 300/200 = 900/700 for your first Colossus and 180 seconds for Colossus #1 (50 more seconds before Thermal Lance upgrade).\n\nThe transition to carriers is insanely slow.

Brood War is the best balanced, most strategically diverse RTS ever made (I say this only having watched 2 games total, this is objective and any SC2 pro will agree) and has no hard counters. Every unit does pretty well against everything else, meaning that few battles are roflstomps and the game is decided by more than one engagement, leading to more excitement and more opportunities to show skill and come back. SC2, while I love it as a game, has a huge flaw in that you get certain amount of unit X -> you win.

After upgrades, that is 25 hits for shields and 40 for armor, for 65 hits per Colossus. Each marine kills on average of 1/65 of a Colossus per cycle, or 0.0923 supply of Colossus per cycle. At 0.57387 second delay, that is 0.161 supply of Colossus killed/Supply of Marine/Second.\n\nColossus deals 18x2 = 36 per beam attack. So it takes 2 hits to kill a Marine. So each Colossus kills on average of 2 per cycle, or 1/3 of a Marine per Supply of Colossus. At 1.65 delay, that is 0.202 supply of Marines per Supply of Colossus per second.\n\nAlso note that the Colossus did lots of blowthrough damage. Medivacs would be useless against it. Colossus also have a latency problem, but the time it takes for the Marines to close would more than make up for that latency.\n\nHowever, this is a supply-for-supply comparison. Not a cost-for-cost. Colossus cost 50 minerals and 33 gas per supply, and Marines only cost 50 minerals. And Colossus production facilities cost slightly more (200/100 instead of 200/50 or 300/0) than Marine production facilities (on a supply-produced-per-second rate).\n\nMarines melt Colossus because Colossus cost to much. In practice, a Colossus army consists of Colossus and Stalkers, or Colossus and Zealots, where the non-Colossus keeps the Marines from closing on the Colossus and they spend their damage output on cheaper units.\n\n3 Zealots instead of 1 Colossus is 300 armor 150 shields instead of the 200/150 that another Colossus brings. 3 Stalkers is 240/240. Stalkers both blink into position, can keep up with stimmed marines pretty much, and fill up space, preventing the Marine from closing on the Colossus. And the production facility costs of Stalkers and Zealots are much lower than Marines.\n\nOh, and if you really want to destroy marines, a sentry army makes it ridiculous. Guardian shield and force field let the Colossus simply melt marines without taking much in the way of damage. (But, once again, this is a ridiculously gas-heavy build).\n\nShort form: If you are building Marines to counter Colossus, you are in trouble. Colossus is a medium hard counter to Marines.

It starts with four and you can build four more. BW carriers start with none.\n\nBW carriers work, specifically in PvT, because it would skew the terran's composition towards goliaths. Goliaths aren't nearly as scary as siege tanks are in ending a game. Goliaths are pretty good against carriers, but since goliaths are a ground unit, they suffer from BW's poor pathing. That's where the micro battle comes in. The carriers are trying to exploit the goliath's immobility to whittle them away (not only to make the carriers stronger but to force more goliaths), and the goliaths are trying to do any damage that they can (usually hitting interceptors) to push away the carriers for the tanks to win the game.\n\nSC2 carriers are kind of... \"I'll kill you later rather than now.\" You can't build them unless you're ahead (unlike BW you're not delaying a slow siege tank push), and if you're that ahead you might as well continue with what you're doing and close out the game. Skewing composition isn't a very potent strategy against a fast producing and mobile army (MMM), and there's no AI/pathing to exploit against vikings... they just hit each other. The vikings will simply win cost to cost and are far quicker to produce as needed. PvZ is pretty much the same.\n\nCarriers are decent units in their current form, but they don't fit in the game in the way that people want them to. Reduce their build time and they're still a novelty unit that will be killed by corruptors/vikings. Reduce their build time and cost so that they can fight against corruptors/vikings and every protoss match is about carriers and stopping carriers. Somewhere in between and it's just another seldom-used t3 option (similar to the thor). It's never going to be as interesting as BW.\n\nI am terrible at this game. Any suggestions for dealing with spammed marines as zerg or protoss? Banelings and Infestors or Colossi and Templars?\n\nThe whole '30 marines and 3-4 medivacs' is obnoxiously OP in my opinion mid-game, you should focus on one anti-bio option. But in the late game, you should invest in the other as well, as it's hard for terran to deal with tech switches.\n\nBut speaking of TvP, I just played a very exhausting game where my macro really kinda just fell apart after an attack went horribly. Yet, somehow, I managed to cling on and eventually stabilize.

Even when you get Colossi, still be super defensive and use it to take more bases (i.e. more gases) until you have Colossus, Templars AND Archons in a maxed army. It's OK to take your time to get that super army, don't worry about what Terran is doing, you don't have to pressure much.\n\nThe Reaper wrote:Evolution is a really really really long run-on sentence getDecided to boot up SC2 for the first time in a while.

I can't see a specific weakness in Zerg accounting for it but Blizz said they are considering patching to improve early game scouting for Zerg in the last balance report.\n\nBut it's mostly that BW is the best balanced game of all time, with no complaints to be had by anyone the last 5+ years. Against that SC2 is very volatile. So the effect of the BW players joining will likely be intense balance flamewars on Korean forums from people new to SC2.\n\nBig announcement on SC2/BW PL tomorrow, jointly Blizzard-Kespa-GOMTV-OnGameNet.

      "text": "Friday, January 4, 2013\n\nAdvanced Skill Training: Terror Weapons\n\nA few weeks ago, I posted a skill plan for a Catalyst gank alt. The skill plan charted a course from freshly-minted althood all the way up to those level V gunnery skills you only train when trying to squeeze out the last bit of DPS for your pilot. For some of you, those skills are almost done training. People have asked me, what comes next--if anything?\n\nBefore you do anything else, get your Knight's skills close to maximum DPS for a Catalyst. No, I'm not suggesting you train Surgical Strike V or Small Blaster Specialization V; I'm not a monster, as I often remind people. But when you've just about finished running out of ways to enhance your Catalyst's DPS, the only thing left is to train Brutix and Talos skills.\n\nDon't get too excited, now. I'm not announcing a tech II battlecruiser reimbursement plan or any craziness like that. And it will take quite some time before our Knights can fly either of those ships with enough skills to make the cost worth it. But in the future, I would like us to have the capability of forming fleets with massive DPS. Enough to take down an Orca--perhaps even a freighter--under the right conditions.\n\nTwo quick points before I list the skills needed. First, people will occasionally say \"if we had X Catalysts, we could kill Y\". We don't have the manpower (yet). In theory, we could get 25 tech I Catalysts together and affordably destroy big targets. But it's rare to muster such large fleets. Manpower is always the limiting factor. That's where tech II Catalysts come into play and, in the future, perhaps occasionally tech II Brutixes or Taloses. When you look at those killmails from the Goons' freighter-ganking campaign, they used a mix of Taloses, Brutixes, and Catalysts--whatever they needed to use, with the gankers they had available.\n\nSecond, Brutixes and Taloses are expensive. One tech II Brutix costs about as much as 30 tech I Catalysts--but does about as much damage as 3 moderately-trained Cats, not 30. Taloses are even more costly. Any operations using these ships would need to be prepared in advance, just to move the hulls into the proper system. Thus, it would be impractical to use them on a regular basis.\n\nThink of these ships, or gank fleets containing these ships, as terror weapons. They're unwieldly and uneconomic, but when used in small doses they can send a powerful message. We may not use them often, but our having the capability would scare the living daylights out of miners across highsec. Naturally, we would maximize the propaganda value of such attacks by saving the killmails and flaunting them in local at every opportunity.\n\nThe use of terror weapons is a long way out, but since they take awhile to train, I thought I'd get the word out early. Now let's talk about the training.\n\nThe good news is, virtually every skill you train for the gank Catalyst is either a requirement or a very useful skill for the terror weapons. Start by finishing off your Catalyst skills. That means things like Gunnery V, Rapid Firing V, and Surgical Strike IV.\n\nTo fit 8 Neutron Blaster IIs, train Hybrid Weapon Rigging II. This reduces the powergrid drawback of your rigs enough to fit the guns. You can leave the midslots empty to save CPU.\n\nFinally, Small Blaster Specialization IV. It's a scummy little skill that gives you 2% extra DPS, and only to tech II guns. But it's a requirement for tech II medium-sized (heavy) blasters.\n\nJust to sit inside a Brutix, you must train Spaceship Command IV, Gallente Frigate IV, Gallente Cruiser III, and Battlecruisers I. No level V skills there, so it goes by quickly.\n\nSome additional skills you'll find useful: Evasive Maneuvering, so you don't take forever to align. Trajectory Analysis to fit tracking computers, and Electronic Warfare to fit ECCM and prevent faction police from jamming you. I haven't worked out the midslots on Brutixes yet; that will come in time.\n\nThere's a fitting issue when it comes to Brutixes with a full rack of Heavy Neutron Blaster IIs. At first I thought we'd need to get Advanced Weapon Upgrades, which requires training Weapon Upgrades V. But then I noticed that the stacking penalties on the damage mods are so great that the fifth one will give you less than 1% extra damage. To heck with it. Fit a Reactor Control Unit I instead. It's ugly, but it works. Train Energy Grid Upgrades II to fit the module. If you want to squeeze out extra DPS, put your training time elsewhere, like tech II drones, as opposed to freeing up the powergrid.\n\nUgh. Heavy Neutron Blaster IIs require Motion Prediction IV, which is no problem. But they also require Medium Hybrid Turret V, which will take up the bulk of your training time. After that you can train Medium Blaster Specialization, which lets you fit the guns.\n\nLastly, drones. Only a small fraction of your DPS will come from drones, but it's just enough to make it necessary. Since a tech II Brutix only does a few hundred more DPS than a tech II Catalyst, adding that extra 100+ DPS from drones can't be passed up.\n\nCarry 5 Hammerhead Is or Hammerhead IIs. Training Drones V lets you deploy 5 drones, plus it allows you to train Drone Interfacing, which gives you an additional 20% drone damage per level. (Thankfully, Drones is a rank 1 skill.) Combat Drone Operation will give you 5% per level, too.\n\nHammerheads require at least Scout Drone Operation I. To go tech II, which will give an additional 30% or so drone damage, you would train Scout Drone Operation V. Luckily, this is also a rank 1 skill. Training it gives you access to Gallente Drone Specialization II, the prerequisite for Hammerhead IIs.\n\nI would say train tech II drones last, since they're a help but can be done without.\n\nA tech II Talos costs around 130 million isk and does over 1,400 DPS. I'd much rather have four well-trained tech I Catalysts for 8 million isk total. But the point of the terror weapons is essentially to inflate the size of the fleet without getting extra pilots. Aside from cost, the bad news about Taloses is that they take a long time to train. The good news is that the requirements of a tech II Brutix and tech II Catalyst completely overlap the Talos requirements.\n\nThe only extra skill to get into the Talos hull is Battlecruisers III, but you should have trained Battlecruisers IV already.\n\nThe list of requirements for the Neutron Blaster Cannon IIs may make you want to vomit. This is natural. But you can subtract from that training time all of the training time you spent on Heavy Neutron Blaster IIs for the Brutix. Following the earlier pattern, you start with Medium Blaster Specialization IV to finish off the medium-sized weapon skills.\n\nNext, all you need are Motion Prediction V and Large Hybrid Turret V to gain access to Large Blaster Specialization, which lets you fit tech II large blasters. Just a couple skills, how long could that take? About a month on top of everything else.\n\nThe Brutix skills, too, will take around a month to train. Many Knights will not be able to take that much training time away from their mains, so it's clearly not for everyone. But if you have nothing better to do train, you can get it started.\n\nOnce again, the use of terror weapons will not (and cannot) be an everyday occurrence. Plans for their use are in the very early stages. But when the time comes, they may give our misguided Code-violating friends some fodder for the horror stories that they share around the campfire.\n\nYou're not the first and you won't be the last to compare us to Hitler and his National Socialists, however I suggest you actually study some history first, they didn't offer a Judaism permit, they simply carted that particular minority off to concentration camps and killed them. Of course the Jews weren't immortal, they stayed dead, unlike the miners that make squishy noises when they pop.\n\nCalling us nazis and the like shows a serious lack of imagination on your part, you could at least be original. Besides in the genocidal maniac stakes the nazis were rank amateurs, Mao Zedong and Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin each eclipsed the nazis by a factor of 10.\n\nWe don't do genocide, capsuleers being immortal prevents that. We will however continue to harvest your pods and exhumers unless you pay us our due.\n\nBecause the Jews allowed the NAZIs to restrict their liberty and freedom, giving the NAZIs success, did it fuel the NAZIs to go further, and so the Jews were not permitted to go everywhere even when wearing the Star of David. They were forced to stay separate when in bars, hotels and restaurants or sometimes were simply not allowed in.\n\nThe NAZIs did however respect the Jews for their work labour. Jews were welcome on fields and farms and even allowed to work in weapons and ammunitions factories.\n\nTowards the end of the second world war and before the invasion started were the Jews then forced into camps. They were not killed at first, but still used for their labour.\n\nOnly when the cost of the war rose too high and Germany itself started to starve did the NAZIs start killing millions of people in these camps.\n\nlol not really, I stated that the Nazis didn't offer a Judaism permit, which is technically true, the yellow star wasn't offered, it was forced upon them. I didn't say how the Jews were killed off, in short they were worked to death, experimented upon, stripped of all reusable resources (the hair was shaved and used in clothing and upholstery, gold teeth removed and smelted), gassed or died from exposure on the way to the camps.\n\n\"They were forced to stay separate when in bars, hotels and restaurants or sometimes were simply not allowed in.\"\n\nHmm sounds like the US and the segregation that was happening there for at least half of the 20th century\n\n\"The NAZIs did however respect the Jews for their work labour. Jews were welcome on fields and farms and even allowed to work in weapons and ammunitions factories.\"\n\nThe farms and ammunition factories were often part of the camps, when you have a captive workforce that numbers in the 10s of millions (I'm including Gypsies, Poles, Russian PoWs and the other so called \"undesirables\" it doesn't really matter when your \"employees\" die from industrial accidents or are taken out back and shot because it seemed like a good idea at the time.\n\nOwned? nope, not entirely clear in my original post because I was in a rush to get to work? Guilty as charged\n\nActually it's a pretty good analogy but just played out in pixels rather than IRL. As Alana says anti-semitism pre-dated Hitler. For pogrom you could read Hulkageddon.\n\nThe Nazi's saw themselves as a master race and Jews were a convenient scape-goat for the ills of Germany. There are analogies with James 315 trying to gain support by attacking a minority and believing gankers are superior (e.g. James 315 \"gankers are higher on the hierarchy\" - Highsec Miner Grab Bag #28); and de-humanising victims by conflating afk mining with botting.\n\nJames 315 even recently survived an assassination attempt, to strengthen the historical comparison to Hitler.\n\nThese larger ships ('weapons of terror') are much more expensive and significantly less agile. An unlucky faction police ECM be very costly. I wonder if these tools should be reserved for characters that have high security status (an occasional gank with an older character), instead of having criminal ganker alts train into them.\n\nWhy is it you know how to combine modules for a greater performance, but fail at doing the same with miners? Demand ores from the miners and pay them only as much as you want to, instead of demanding ISKs. Demanding ISKs instead of ores is like using blasters for long-range. You already know it will end in a fail!\n\nYour use of miners is then as fail as most noobs' ship fittings and like noobs, who ignore all advise on their fits, are you doing the same. Stop blogging about and get it right.\n\nIf you don't then the miners will switch into Skiffs or fit thermal/kinetic hardeners, because of your strict Gallente dependence.\n\nI touched on this point in the post, but I'll expand a bit on what these kinds of fleets would look like: They would be carefully tailored to the circumstances, i.e. what pilots we had available. Unlike the impromptu Catalyst gangs, they would be planned a fair amount. Even the target would be carefully selected, probably an untanked target in a 0.5 system.\n\nThe fleets would likely consist primarily of Catalysts (tech I and II), with a few highly-trained characters (perhaps some mains) in the bigger ships, as necessary. Some Thoraxes and Vexors could be used, depending on the circumstances. I didn't mention the cruiser hulls in the post since their DPS advantage over a tech II Catalyst is proportionately more reliant on detours (Gallente Cruiser V, Drone Interfacing V, and Heavy Drone Operation V for the Vexor). But again, the fleet would be tailored to the pilots available for the operation--rather than the other way around.\n\nUnfortunately I have to disagree that these are \"too expensive\". The problem is that cheaper ships needs more ships which is more man-hours. Man hours have ISK value and if you include that you find that T1 Catlysts are extremely expensive to gank with.\n\nI'll write a detailed post but in TLDR: if one can fit T2 Cata, he shall always do. Those who can't should always go for high meta.\n\nExcept for one thing Gevlon: shareholder value. Their return on capital is higher with T1/Meta than for T2. Assuming an average transgressor value of 200mil and all other factors being equal: 200mil/2m vs 200m/15m. Therefore, their investment ISK clearly goes that much further. But as factors are never always equal, the upgrade to T2 is sometimes necessary. Fortunately, T2 is simply not required most of the time."

      "text": "Feb 23, 2012\n\nFirst off I need to apologize for my absence. Between the holidays getting done with and school starting (and getting Modern Warfare 3 for Christmas) I have just been too tired or otherwise engaged to write, which means no blog posts. On the plus side I have gotten in a couple of actual games against an actual opponent (!). Granted, I lost both times but I am getting a better idea of what in my arsenal is effective and what I'm doing wrong, so things are going uphill.\n\nAnyway, I've gone over what the Black Templars' fluff is and how they are portrayed, but a question still remains: \"How do you make a Fluffy Black Templars list?\" Well, we'd have to check the specific unit entries in the codex to see any requirements or limitations on them that aren't applied in the rules, but first let's talk about basic structure.\n\nWe've got two obvious directions at first based on the tactics we are given: Drop Pods and Mechanized. Drop Pods are fairly straightforward, but for Mechanized you could argue between a close combat focus and a more shooty approach. You could also split the Mechanized lists into 'Heavy' and 'Light' depending on whether or not you are using Land Raiders.\n\nOkay, Drop Pod armies (including ones which have more Deepstriking than just the pods) are basically valid fluff-wise with exceptions for specific units which we'll look at later. As for Mechanized, it should basically function as a Space Marine army, but also have a predominant close-range focus. I don't mean you shouldn't take any weapons with a range greater than 12\", I just mean that, in general, your army should excel at Bolter range rather than farther away.\n\nNow then, let's tackle those specific units. Just from memory, I know that some units will be more available in larger forces, which raises an important question: \"Is a list the entire crusade/fighting company, or just one section of a larger battle?\" This is a valid question considering that it determines some crippling inclusions in your list. If you assume that it is the full force, then you need a Marshal, Chaplain, and probably a Techmarine, which aren't very efficient purchases, and taking all three will have lasting consequences for your list. So I'm going to assume that this is not the full army, but just the area that has the greatest importance on the overall outcome or something (think of a justification that you're happy with).\n\nI'll be going over the units as detailed fluff-wise in the codex (not in the order they are given for stats, but before that). Some of these have restrictions but those are almost never specifically stated, so be prepared for a lot of subjectivity to this (as there should be). Also be warned that no vehicles (except Dreadnoughts) are described, and thus I have left out; think of them as supportive elements and less important.\n\nInitiates. They are the backbone, so be sure to take some. :) And yes, most of them should have Bolters, but feel free to take a few armed for close combat. Assault Squads are mentioned here as well, and are basically intended to be your close combat units rather than Crusader Squads. This should be given special attention. In a truly fluffy list you will not have those Powerfist/Meltagun Crusader Squads. The Crusader Squads would be more all-purpose or shooty while the assault contingent is made up mostly by Assault Marines.\n\nNeophytes. You can have a few, but the codex isn't very clear on how much of the force are Neophytes. Only about a dozen per year are enlisted, so keep in mind that they are probably rare.\n\nSword Brethren. Once again, not many clues as to how many compared to Initiates, but assume not a whole lot. Terminators are included here, and remember that they are technically taken for their Powerfists, not their guns.\n\nThe High Marshal. Okay, one special character out of about 5,000 guys who are spread out over the entire Imperium. Just how important is your little 'battle'? Not a single significant threat to the Imperium? Yeah, he's probably not there.\n\nMarshals and Castellans. Not much requirements here aside from a general (and loose) rule of thumb that bigger armies should have Marshals while smaller ones should take Castellans. However, there I the one caveat that Marshals leads Crusades, Castellans lead Fighting Companies, so select accordingly. For example, I have a fighting company (plans on that sometime in the future) and so I should use a Castellan; Marshal Learoth has a Crusade and so can either use a Marshal or a Castellan (since the Castellan could be leading a single fighting company of the Crusade).\n\nThe Emperor's Champion. Yes.\n\nTechmarines. Not much to limit them, but you should probably keep it down to one of them, maybe two in a large force. They're technically supposed to basically be Initiates but with a strong loyalty to the Machine, so there really isn't much of a connection between how many vehicles you have and how many Techmarines you should have.\n\nDreadnoughts. Similar to the High Marshal in that they are really only brought out when they are needed, so this is situational but if you can think of cause to take them feel free because their numbers are already limited to three with no more than a single Venerable.\n\nApothecaries. At your leisure, but neither required nor restricted.\n\nChaplains. Kind of like Commanders, they're available. Nothing mentioned about Reclusiarch vs. Master of Sanctity, so choose at your own discretion (once again, however, size could affect this).\n\nLand Raider Crusader. If you're tackling (or going to tackle) enemy fortifications (or if you're fighting in a city, or something), then these become available. But they have a role that they play and it is not for every battle.\n\nGrimaldus. There's really not much I can say about him. He's almost like any chaplain you might invent, except he probably isn't in your army. I suppose there really isn't anything keeping you from taking him aside from the point limit in the codex though.\n\nSo when we've taken all of this, what would a fluffy list look like? Well, it could probably look a whole lot like pretty much any competitive Black Templars list out there, with PotMS and some Gunlines being potential exceptions because of their focus on longer ranges. But something such as my 'Best of Black Templars' list? Which is mostly intended to get 12-24\" away from the enemy? Yes, that fits all of the parameters rather nicely. Mechanized column, Land Speeders shielding the outskirts, close-range; except for the Dreadnoughts (which can be explained, though every battle could be challenging) and the standard size for the Crusader Squads (which is excusable), it's a fluffy list.\n\nHowever, to be fair a better example of a fluffy list would be Algesan's Deepstrike list. It's got everything and probably uses Terminators in their most accurate role, free use of Powerfists plus providing an important service in firepower.\n\nI hope that this entire series has been both helpful and interesting but until I get (or am given) another idea, this pretty much wraps up my posts about Black Templars Fluff (though you might be able to expect a few to come out a while after the new Codex). I've looked at it, analyzed it, and talked about applying it on the table. Not a whole lot left to do (I suppose I could find something to do with the Crusades, but that feels forced without having an actual idea of what to do). I've got some plans for what's coming up and I pretty much just need to finish a single Vassal game to get the next post almost entirely done."

      "text": "Warhammer 40K ForumThanks in advance, this will really help me out!\n\n1) No. In my opinion (and experience) the Chaos fast attack choices are nothing special, and generally over priced. Spawn are garbage (unfortunately), I won't even both picking them apart. Bikers are okay, but you spend twice as much as a normal marine just for an extra toughness boost and some movement benefits... eh... they can work pretty well for some tactics, but overall you can find plenty of other things to their job. Raptors are okay, fairly well priced. Biggest problem with both those two: Unit sizes. Raptor models are expensive ($$$), so it's very hard to acquire a decent squad size (10+) to use on the battlefield. They have the same number of attacks as your basic soldiers anyways, so unlike the Loyalists you have little motivation for them. Bike models cost an arm and a leg, to get a nice big squad of them it can run you close to $100. Generally, not worth it especially when you can find things more durable. Also, neither of them can capture objectives.\n\n2) Chosen are VERY cool with the new outflank rules. I would NOT recommend them if you're trying for a super competitive army, but they're fun. Outflanking CSM's is a reason to take a small unit of them in their own right, if you aren't worried about objectives. As for upgrades, they get VERY expensive. All power weapon or all plasma guns are IMO far too expensive to ever make their points back. All melta is debatable (though coming in from reserves those 5 melta shots will probably pop SOMETHING...). For me, I really like the idea of all flamers. A very affordable squad that is the absolute bane of any infantry unit. Again, they're a fun a characterful unit but not super competitive. Also, if you don't have a clear plan for them, leave 'em home.\n\n3) Special Weapons: I almost always recommend meltas. Hordes you can bolter to death or beat up in CC, while plasmas are expensive and can hurt you back. Meltas give you anti-tank/TEQ which is nice.\nAspiring Champions: I ALWAYS take an Aspiring Champion if I can, and give him a powerfist. Why? Well, the powerfist will give any nasty CC unit pause before assaulting you (even terminators and monstrous creatures have something to fear from S8 power weapons!), and give you solid tank popping abilities (S8 on rear armor is often more than enough). However, there is one reason above all others to take powerfists: Walkers. A 150 point Dreadnought can assault a 300 point squad of Plague Marines, and if the Marines don't have a powerfist they basically can't TOUCH the Dreadnought as it rips them to pieces. Powerfists give you a chance to deal damage against these guys when your infantry normally couldn't, hopefully preventing an expensive or important squad from being tied up in a combat that they simply can't win.\n\nHope that's what you were looking for If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!\n\nAspiring Champions: I ALWAYS take an Aspiring Champion if I can, and give him a powerfist.\n\nI've been shying away from taking Powerfists, because don't they attack at I1? To me, that seems like a really bad trade-off, despite the Strength boost. I mean, nearly everything strikes faster than I1, so that seems like a big risk to me. I'd rather have a Power Weapon and be assured of an unsavable wound (Barring Inv Saves of course) than be able to take down walkers and Tanks. After all, it's not like CSM armies lack for anti-Tank, and I usually take at least 2 Obliterators so I'm rather content on that account.\n\nPowerfists are worth their weight in gold, my friend. If you're being assaulted (or assaulting) something that can get to your AC and take him out reliably, you're going to be screwed no matter what weapon you take. The only squad I'd really reccomend giving power weapons are noise marines (I5! woohoo!) and, even then, a powerfist can be useful (especially if you're running an Emperor's Children list).\n\nOnly needing 2's to wound most things will also fill your heart with glee. After you've been charged by a walker, you'll suddenly be very glad you're not relying solely on krak grenades to take it out (especially if it's an Ironclad).\n\nSpeaking of Noise Marines, are they good? 20 points + the weapons cost seems really expensive to me, especially for troops. Also, is Huron Blackheart any good? He seems like a cool character fluff-wise, but I'm unsure on whether he'd be effective. Maybe with 5 Flamer Chosen in a Rhino, but that would nullify the boon of Outflanking/Infiltrating.\n\nAlso, if anyone would like to comment on My latest list, I would appreciate it.\n\nInitiative 1 isn't as bad as you might think my friend, as essentially the rest of your squad will act as ablative wounds for your powerfist. All your normal Marines will attack at I4, but those really strong armor-ignoring attacks DO count for something.\n\nNoise Marines are blegh. I don't like them, you spend a loooot of points for them, and they gain no added survivability like Plague or Rubric Marines. I5 is cool, but only useful against some armies. Others you'd strike before regardless, and some will STILL strike before you regardless. Plus, if you wanna get all the cool special weapons, the points really start adding up for them. I'd say leave them home unless you plan on playing strict EC.\n\nHuron Blackheart? I run Red Corsairs, so I've used him a few times. He's OK, but that's about it. He has a rather steep cost for his abilities, but being able to choose between a power weapon or a power fist is nice. The built in Heavy Flamer has some cool tricks, and the fact he can cast Warptime on himself is handy. My biggest issue is his lack of survivability, he still only has a 5+ invulnerable save at T4 which isn't anything impressive. If you decide to use him, he's a fun and solid character. If you're looking for more competitive/better options, there are certainly other things you can take that WILL do better than Huron. Don't get me wrong, he's in no means bad; the CSM codex just has better to offer.\n\nIf you put the 5x Flamer Chosen in a rhino, they still keep outflank as well (they just have to outflank in their transport). Still definitely a problem unit, and you have an impressive 12\" move + disembark + flamer range on the turn you arrive to kill things. I like them on foot, since they can charge straight onto the board, but a rhino is still a very viable option."

This includes dock traders, military supply TSs, and others, for now.\n\nOne thing I was thinking over the past few days was how the current economy cheats energy-wise.\n\nI have 3 choices:\n\n- Leave it as it is, and laugh at the player's desperate crystalplexes.\n- Remove the player's need for crystals, free energy! (Face it, SPPs are expensive enough as it is.)\n- Add crystal need for AI and see if my economic restructuring and growth algorithm convinces the AI that there's a huge shortage of energy... and food, and crystals, and silicon, etc. etc. And see if it all works out nicely.\n\nHeh. I like this thread. I'm aiming way lower in terms of complexity in my concept for a civilian economy for XTimelines (of which the far-more-talented-than-me modders probably have a very good reason for going military economy only).\nAnyway.\n\nEmperorJon wrote:\n\nThose are my ideas... but... what are yours'?\nWhat do you want to see? What do you not want to see?\n\nAs for ideas, I have some.\n\nTrade stations\nFirstly, and already mentioned, is that trade-station should be the main means of consuming produced wares.\n\nMy thinking on dynamic consumption would be to base the rate of consumption on how many sectors are owned by the race that owns the sector the trade station is in.\nRealistically speaking: Populations can't change that much in just a few (ingame) days.\nLimitation-ally speaking: Scripts can't read sector populations anyway.\nReason-ably speaking : The more sectors a race (or the player) controls, the greater its power, and thus arguably the higher the standards of living of its people (or at least the more arrogant and greedy. )\n\nMy intent, when I get around to scripting it (just started the EcoHog), is to define a global array for each race, for each ware that trade stations consume (planned specialised trade stations called planetary docks, that would all eat the same wares, both high-end and basic. It is actually meant for these docks.)\nThe arrays would be an array of floats[] (Numbers in X3) that specify how much of a product is eaten every 15 minutes by each planetary dock.\n\nFirst script will run on each planetary dock, eating NUM number of each ware every 15 minutes as specified by the global array for that race. A value less than 1, would mean that every eat cycle that ware has a (NUM*100)% chance to consume 1 ware. (So a consume of NUM=0.4 would mean that every 15min cycle there is a 40% chance to eat 1 of that ware).\n\nCode:\n\nfor i = 1 to Wares[].Size do\nNUM = Race[x].GlobalArray[i]\nif NUM >= 1 then\nWares[i].Stock -= NUM\nelse\nif ((random 0.0 to 1.0) < NUM) then\nWares[i].Stock -= 1\nend\nend\nendfor\nwait random 14.9*60*1000 to 15.1*60*1000 ms\nrepeat\n\nAdd in sanity checks for NUM>0 and Wares[].Stock >= NUM.\n\nSecond script\nRuns once an hour (maybe shorter?) and counts the number of sector controlled by each race. Then sets global array of NUMs for the wares for that race.\nHere you can also define 'random' events, that adjust the consumption for a ware (or wares). Since this per-race global array is used everywhere, random events can be things like 'double demand for Ecells at all Terran planetary docks for the next hour!' or some such.\n\nCorporate Strongarming\nAn idea I have thought of (and started poorly coding yesterday) was the idea of a Economic Hog (EcoHog). It might fit well with your companies... or not.\n\nIts purpose is to simulate supply contracts between stations (agreement to mainly deal only with one another), and mainly to make the player's life harder.\n\nEssentially acting like a station camper, an EcoHog would be given a homebase, target station, target ware(s), and buy/sell parameters.\n\nWhen selling, it would need its homebase to produce the product and will load up with as much of the product as possible and head to the target station. It will then proceed to continually sell as much of the product, keeping the demand at the target as low (or non-existent) as possible.\nIts default 'wait' location is at the target station, selling off anything it had until its cargo runs empty, or the target station is full and its cargo is at least half empty.\n\nWhen buying, it would go to the target station, buy everything it can, and dump it all at its homebase. Its default 'wait' location is at the target station, buying up anything it can until its cargo bay is full, or the target station is empty and its cargo is at least half full, or the target station is empty and its homebase is more than half empty.\n\nYou just can't include player stations in a hog like this, since the player can dictate the buy/sell prices of resources/goods at his/her station/stations.\nI/like/slashes///\n\nAlternatively, you could have AI companies 'cheat', and spent some of their credits to 'hire' an EcoHog to hog a ware a player's complex needs a lot of, or is producing a lot of. Though they don't 'own' the EcoHog, so they don't suffer the full brunt of the bad-selling and/or buying-tactics.\nMaybe.\n\nAgain, more aimed at hogging the key planetary docks stations, as those are the consumers. I figure a AI company would not mind too badly if a player only ever produced enough (and low tech enough) wares to supply the AI's factory resourcing needs, but never sold directly to consumers.\n\n[EDIT]I'm slowly brainstorming more ideas for corporate strongarming. If I think of any I'll post them in the mentioned thread, and if they might be applicable to you, I'll post them here.[EDIT]\n\n[EDIT]\nOh, yes.\nAI Company Bankruptcy\nIf a AI company goes negative, and does not recover, maybe first 'sell-off' some (not all) of their assests (stations and ships associated with those) as opposed to... not entirely sure what you do currently.\nSold assests would simply be dropped from their ownership array (effectively going to the government. Which implies the government is actually a bank, but anyway). The company receives the value (or a good portion thereof) of the assests, hopefully returning them to being 'in the black'.\nMaybe just reset their account to 50k or something for ANY station and its ships sold, so that big companies are really hard to kill off.\n[/EDIT]\n\nWell currently nothing happens, but the selling of assets was planned.\n\nAs for everything else, it seems to be more relevant to what you're doing than what I'm doing; don't get me wrong, it's interesting, but it's confusing me how you're jumping between \"This is what mine is going to do\" and \"This is what yours could do\".\n\nI'm currently trying to work out exactly how the new stations system will work.\nUsing the trade info function I can get necessary information on the storages of stations.\nMy original idea was to collect the storage information for every station in one race's sector group, so for example it would collect all the resource and product storage space in the core Argon home cluster around Argon Prime.\nIt would then weigh up these values to work out what factories were needed, for example if there was a total possible storage of Energy Cells as a product of 100000, and a resource storage of 200000, then it knows that if all the SPPs were full they'd only half fill all the factories once it got shipped out.\nThe issue with this is it pays no attention whatsoever to production times; it's all well and good seeing that the total storage space for Energ Cells being used equals the total storage space required, but factories, especially large weapons factories, use a few thousand cells every few hours... and XL SPP creates a few thousand every few minutes!\nDoes anyone know if the storage directly matches the factory size EVERY TIME, as if so I can work out the total storage in terms of sizes of S, M, L, and XL, and therefore the total output.\nFor example, if the total ore consumption is equal to 10x L, then I need 10x L's worth of mines, surely!\nI also have to consider the resources needed for the step below. For example, instead of saying \"I need ore, I'll find somewhere for a mine\" it'll say \"I need ore, but ore needs energy, there's not enough energy\" etc. and work its was down. It'll also have to notice a surplus and then suggest new factories which can exploit that surplus while making a product that WILL be used somewhere by something... It may involve recursion. Ew.\nAll in all, it'll work out what factories are really needed where, then add them to a list. The factories on this list can then be built by any relevant company. By this method, the companies and economy grow building their own factories, and the fact that it's actually centrally pooling data to find where to tell anyone build is hidden and irrelevant. It just simulates companies deciding to build wherever they want in a dynamic way.\n\nOn a microscale (in a complex) you have a small problem because after each production cycle there is a small delay. The more smaller size stations you have the longer the delay in total - not an issue for universe scale economy though\n\ndon't know , sorry\nBut i remember that lucike had a function in his CAG script where you could check your complexes and it showed the excess/deficits of all wares in the complex. Perhaps taking a look at how he did it might save some time.\n\nWhat you're missing is the role the stations are playing in your economy. You're looking only at stations and ignoring one of the major gameplay parts. Stations producing a ware are only bricks in the middle of nowhere They do nothing but converting items into another form. If they have no more ressources, or their storage is full of products, they simply stop. They can not produce anymore. If they don't get supplies, they are useless, regardless if there's a demand only 20 metres away.\n/edit: This post is about dependencies of traders and stations, and the behaviour has to be adjusted to the changes/scripts of EmperorJon\n\nThe most limiting factor on stations are NPC traders and THEIR behaviour.\nIt's NOT only a question of just placing them, i'll explain that later.\nFirst, you need to calculate the average speed of a given trader job. That means you need to look at the jobs file and identify the ship type and calculate its average speed. That means you need to get the total amount of ships used to transport the ware in a given race, the range of variants and their possible max speed. You can then calculate the possible average speed. But the tricky part is that the equip libs are giving them only a limited amount of engine tunings, so you need to have a look at the equip libs also, to get an image of how many engine tunings they get in average. Only then you can calculate the real average speed, and believe me, it's far slower than you may expect.\n\nTake a very close look at the flags on the traders, if they trade only in race sectors, if they are allowed to cross enemy territory and so on. The distribution of traders is a very tricky thing, and it'll take some days to get the distribution over all for just a single race.\n\nNow, the speed is so important for you, because it may take longer to ship the products from one station to the next, because the way is longer than the actual cycle time on the station itself. That means that you may need multiple traders doing the same trade run to keep the consumer supplied. Otherwise the production will stall. A NPC trader with a max speed of 70 m/s is only flying at 35 m/s, because it's flagged to use only 50% of its max speed in the jobs file. It it is supposed to fly 35 km.... well, let's say it'll take a while, and a 35 km wide sector isn't that uncommon. Now add to that that the gates have to e used, because the station is in the next sector, and the cycle times of a station are getting obsolete, because the traders are the limiting factor with their flight time.\n\nAnd now, here comes the hard part. NPC traders are independent and act autonomous. They decide on their own needs, and you have to place the stations accordingly, so you get a running economy between producers and consumers. NPC traders are rating trades by the amount of money they can earn in a given time range. That means they do look for the best trade and consider producer, consumer and the time they need to get there. You may have often wondered about traders with only 3 or 6 ore, although they could transport thousands of them. It was the best deal they could come up with in their range. And that may be only 6 ore. They calculate their current position to the point where they will buy for the best price. The ware is randomly picked from their job, but the calculation is not random. If the station is in the next sector, they calculate \"Current position->Rendezvous point gate->gate->Rendezvour point gate->Rendezvous point station->station\" That's the calculation for a single way. Stations and gates with extensively long docking ways (rendezvous point->station) have a decent disadvantage, because the speed is greatly reduced on docking. So TOAs and giant terran stations can get ignored, because the flight time can be longer than crossing an entire sector. Just measure the speed and time It's really true.\n\nIf the ship has reached its destination, it checks for the demand and buys accordingly to the demand. The same distance check is performed for the best sell run now. This is the point where you need to consider that the positioning of your station is critical, as the consumers must be near by. If it's located at the other side of a 70 km sector, but a gate is nearby, the way through the gate to the next sector my be much shorter, and all the ships will probably be heading there, because it's only 30 km through the gate, but 70 km in sector. This is the tricky thing behind NPC traders and distances, according to their behaviour.\n\nNow the second trickiest thing is demand and the NPC trader behaviour. Demand is CREATED by traders. Only if wares are traded, there's a demand over all. If the product storage is full of products, there's no demand for supplies. The station can not produce at all. Only if the products are sold, it will start to eat up ressources again, creating demand of ressources. So if no goods a re sold, there's no demand, and the demand is strongly tied to NPC traders and their ability and behaviour to trade. Once again you need to have a look at the job files and equip libs to find out how large the average storage room for a given job in a given race is. Then you need to adjust the size of the stations on the map itself, to create a lot of demands. The thumb rule is, the larger the station size (XL and up), the worse the economical performance is.\n\nThe goal is to spread the traders as far as you can to have roughly the equal chance to have a trader ready to do a trade run, wherever it is. If you place a XXL SPP somewhere, the storage and producing capability is so strong, that after a while all NPC EC traders will gather somewhere around this SPP. And they will all calculate their trades from there, resulting in a monopolistic trade behaviour. The storage room is so large, that the price is never high enough to make other, smaller SPPs attractive to them, simply because they're too far away. The price only rises if a good chunk of Ecells is taken away, and this is calculated as a percentage. If you only have 3000 storage on a trader, but several 100ks on the SPP, and the producing capability, it never falls. So after a while the outer regions of the races sectors are stalling, no matter what you're doing. The storage room on the NPC traders is the absolute limiting factor. If not, the distribution of traders across the sectors is completely messed up. The best example are the paranid sectors south of Loo'Manckstrats. With only exchanging the size of some stations (and adjusting their position of course), you can stabilize the whole region. It's a lot better to place M and L factories, especially M ones. This keeps also the original God engine from turning them down. It's design flaw, as the vanilla map is a complete mess, and most of the helpless tries to get better results are changes made on the map itself and not in WareTemplate. So it gets so clunky that the reasons aren't obvious. The last try to fix this where the company traders, but they failed due to not taking in consideration that upping the jump range also creates a massive flight time for a best buy/sell run.\n\nAnyway, if your just looking for demand and supply on stations, you're missing the fact that the wares have to be transported first, and the ways and storage capabilities are a lot more limiting the economy than you may think. Only in case of existing complex tubes you can calculate without these transportations. Consider placing stations, size of stations, amount of race traders/dock traders for a given ware, and their average speed/storage\n\nHmm, I believe you're missing something too...\nEach station belongs to a company. Each company hires dedicated traders. If a station needs more wares brought in, or more sent out, then it will get itself another trader.\nTraders that upgrade themselves to fly as fast as a player trader, use the jumpdrive, and so on.\n\nThe problem is, that you are creating centralised structures. If you assign a trader to a station, and he cares only about the problems of this single station, he has only a limited pool of suppliers and consumers. Theoretically you can get a map to work with this, but a single accident, some pirates blowing up a station which is a key element, and a complete region stalls. A single build mission somewhere placing an L Mine or an XL SPP and your map doesn't work anymore, because the dock trader needs to fligh further away, or the former consumers are supplied a lot faster than the actual station is able to do. /edit: If a key station is stalling, the whole error is cascading down (or up)\n\nYou will realise that the cunsumption of high end tech wares and weapons/shields/missiles is limited by your GOD engine eating up the products on EQ Docks and Trade stations. You can raise the efficiency artificially, but your system will be a lot more vulnerable. Relying on a chance based system and customised trader scripts is a lot more effective and the whole thing will be more flexible. You can, for example lower the priority for your GOD engine to respawn destroyed stations, you can reduce the time for the needed checks if your assigned traders are still existing, without the fear that a branch of sectors would stall.\n\nEr no... not quite. A single station is destroyed, and the game notices it needs to be rebuilt. The economy in that area maybe suffers whilst those who required that product need to go further, but well, that's what happens.\nI don't quite see what the issue here is that you're finding.\nFor example, you say it's much more effective to use customised trader scripts... which is what I said I was doing in the last post. The general basis of this is already hammered out, though I need to talk to some of the experts in this area.\n\nI do not want to change the outline of your project I want to point out that there's an inbuild weakness you may be able to work around, as you do not divide between stations and ships (traders).\n\nJust an example, if you have a station somewhere near the south gate of CEO's doubt, and it needs E-cells, then your station assigned trader will probably for the nearest source of e-cells from this specific point. It never changes, and if there's a bigger (XL) SPP in Cardinals Domain, he'll jump/fly there, every time, as the price of e-cells is always the lowest. If there's an enemy cruising around, he'll jump there over and over again, being destroyed every time. So you must include something that reminds a newly spawned trader that he was destroyed there. Kind of blacklist. All the other stations with similar distances will prefer this single SPP. Your trader losses will be relatively high, while other SPPs, although not that far away, won't be considered. Instead of this, if the starting point is random for a trader, the chances that this specific SPP is chosen as a e-cell source is considerably lower, so your losses of traders, because of this incident are a lot lower right from the beginning. Also the fact that other sources of SPP are contributing to the e-cell supply is keeping sectors from stalling. A station sleeping for only a single hour may result in a delay for several other stations which is a lot higher, because you have for your station : flight time to supplier+flight time back home+cycle time+flight time to consumer. If the station is supplying two others, the problem essentially doubles, resulting in a double amount of time for their consumers. This is cascading up, and it'll stall from a certain amount of time build up. Think of the war zones in AP for example, or highly frequented pirate sectors, race sectors with a fix pirate patrol route. Your ships would need to fly faster than the actual cycle time for your product to lessen the limiting factor of NPC traders. Even if you use the CAG strategy and jump your ships to 0,0,0, there's still amount of time to fly.\n\nNow you can raise the efficiency artificially by letting your traders fly faster, letting them jump closer to their destination and whatever else. The resut is that the trading delay isn't limiting production anymore, and you will find the the consumption of high end goods is the limiting factor. The vanilla God is pretty slow when it comes down to consuming goods, and you'll see EQ docks filled to the brim. You'd end up adding additional trade stations/EqDocks.\n\nONE solution, which i'm suggesting, is to handle the over/under production on the side of the traders and not on the stations, as this is the original idea behind the X series trading. It creates a lot less static economical progression. If you have a massive amount of goods in the bellies of trader ships trnsporting them, a single failed station (destroyed, straving, whatever) is not that important, as the traders are spread out, instead of using a centralised command. Centralised is more predictable from a scripts point of view, but it's also not able to handle problems flexible. Especially overproduction is a lot more hreatening then under production, as overproduction means only god removes goods from the economy cycle. Instead of this you can reduce it by having randomly destroyed NPC traders, delay through slower transportation, and so on. Have you calculated how much your god is consuming over all?\n\nIt's not that i'm insisting on this I'm trying to point out that there's a weak point in your plan, and you may save a lot of scripting time/load of scripts running, nothing more Streamlining the trader scripts and jobs gets a better result overall. But that's not a MUST, it's only a suggestion I'm not trying to force you to do so, even if it sounds like this. It's not intended"

Unfortunately, that usually means they then want those ships for their own, so I need to make stats.\n\nIf you've automated the whole generation process then adding in more information becomes much less dauntingparticularly considering that most Rogue Trader groups will only ever have one of them.\n\nI'm not willing to bet that this is true. Most may start with only one, but players in a long game are likely to gain more. It's like wondering why D&D had so many spells of 6th-level and beyond. Most groups never get that far, but for those that do, you need something substantial there to work towards. I'd ventrue to say that most RT groups that don't get beyond one ship are not the ones that buy heavily into suppliments and are less frequent posters on boards such as this.\n\nFor my own group, our first campaign had grown the fleet to 14 vessels (mostly transports). Our current game's RT is the grandson of the last game's RT (a still living, but mostly retired holder of the WoT) and is in command of a frigate to prove his worth.

      "text": "MOO1 bug with Combat Transporters? (and a few others)\n\nIn a recent game I was playing the Sakkras. This involved recklessly taking over planets for technology. Anyway, once I got Combat Transporters, I found I'd been ripped off. The product description said it would allow approximately 50 percent of my guys to make it past the guns protecting a planet, bases and ships. I therefore began sending Lizard Waves at enemy planets which were protected, expecting that a roughly 50 percent survival rate (or even 25 although I'm not sure if they had interdictors) would be enough to take over the planet. However, in ALL cases I got the message that my transports had all been killed. Does Combat Transporters work at all? Is this a bug or what?\n\nAlso, another question. This is not a bug, I suppose, but a part of the AI. The AI never attacks missile bases. I can have one missile base on a planet and they can have three Huge ships with Plasma torps and Stellar Converters, and yet, they retreat from my one missile base. Unless I have ships there, in which case of course they attack the ships but retreat if the ships retreat/die. This makes it pretty much impossible for the CPs to take over any of my planets and takes all the challenge out of the game. Do they not design bombers at all? Will they ever take over any of my planets? Is there some way to fix this, short of not building bases?\n\nNot sure if combat transporters is a bug or what, but you will not get pass a good missile base and of course if they have barrier shields no ground troops can pass them.\n\nThey will get by to some degree if they have only fair defenses.\n\nThe AI will surely blast down missile bases if it have good tech, otherwise it won't. What do you have for planetary defenses? Planetary shields can stop some things, so if is a function of you tech vs theirs.\n\nI have them attack my MB, even when they fail.\n\nAlso the level has some impact, I am talking about at impossible only."

I mean really what is the point of a ship firing on u if ur ship cant be destroyed?\n\nremember, people LIVE on these ships, people's stuff is in their cabins and you've possibly spent weeks or months of your time and energy upgrading these ships. There are probably a bunch of people who logged off in their cabins fully expecting to go on an away mission in the morning.\n\nand you want permadeath?\n\nI certaintainly can see harsh penalties. I can certainly see being dead in the water asking for rescue. I can even see getting boarded and having some of your upgrades stolen. but I can't imagine perma death for ships working.

I have a good feeling NPC ships with no players aboard; will be seeing big big beautiful explosions. with very little left from these explosions. No game is complete without explosions, everybody knows that.\n\nAs for what effect would defeat be?\n\nYour in a battle, how does the enemy defeat you?\n\nYour a Sabre class and your up against a warbird. They decloak and the first shot disables warp and subspace/comm. So you can't run and you can't call for help. They then rip you apart and shields are killed and like everything is knocked out.\n\nAbandon ship or being boarded and having your whole crew killed.\n\nIf abandon ship happens, you should have a choice of going for lifepod or shuttlebay. depending where you are. Bridge crew should be going lifepod. Lifepods should be untargetable. If person goes shuttle/fighter then they can leave minimal power on that way the warbird won't detect the ship, and they can hope that the romulans don't try to board. Or they can try to be quick and warp out to get out of the jamming subspace so they can get help. Chances are though, you might need a fleet to beat a warbird. Always leave in lots of option. Of coarse there can be the chance the warbird can target the shuttlebay and destroy it and everything inside, before any abandon ship.\n\nThen again chances are the warbird would be so strong that they could hit any shuttle that is trying to flee.\n\nNo.. there needs to be permanent ship death.. I dont care if I spent a year on a ship... if ships dont die... wars would be contradictory.. can u imagine being in the middle of a firefight and ships are firing on u... but u cant be destroyed, so u just sit there and wait for rescue while enemies surround u.. No permanent ship death is needed or the game will stand still and turn into a base/shell MMO which really sucks...\n\nIn any good rpg. There is always a chance you will die. I don't mind if I die. Growth only comes from suffering. Sometimes there is glory in it.\n\nHere's are possible NON-permadeth ship situations though.\n\n(super simplified)After your ship is destroyed you all end up in your orange spacesuits and you should have to guild together again and 'snap and click' the ship back together. If rescue ship arrives before completion ship fixed + 50% Total time: Fifteen minutes?\n\n(simplified)If close into UFP space as soon as a nearby ship arrives your ship is repaired 50% and you go on. Total time: 5 minutes?\n\n(sorta complex) From the wreckage you have to build habitation from snap and click modules and create a torus and put it into a zero gravity (Lagrange) point between the nearest stellar bodies. Crew 'classes' become super important in this situation. Guild training essential. You should also have to find and mine a water source. Then use shuttles and solar sail vehicles to collect collect mining content and put it in the center of your torus (zero gravity area: industry zone) Large prefab parts emerge (based on what ship you choose to build) As the predetermined number of starship parts comes out (spacedock parts first)...you all start putting them together until ship is rebuilt. At 50% repaired all long range communication is recreated.\n\nIt sounds harder than it is if a computer displays just where everything goes in your HUD. Literally like 'snap and click' model building.\n\nTotal Time...One hour to rebuild(unless you have lots of experience and then collective repair time could be a factor)?\n\nConsider this... Consider you starship is your HOUSE. It has your pride pocessions, your own decortions, and your own tweaks...Then everytime you use it you could die...and lose everything... Im sorry...thats NOT possible...No sane developer would want to PREVENT people from doing missions if it means you'll lose EVERYTHING. How many people BOTHER to do combat? I know I die lots of times when im a newbie...and well...how would i expect I will grow...when I lose my things everytime?\n\nThere a plenty of canon ways you can get around this...you could be knockedout and wake up at a starbase...with ur ship in drydock. You could be rescued..or you could automatically be beamed to ur escape pod\n\nI can see somewhat of an easy solution to the ship destruction problem. Since there is no character permadeath. The way around player death is have something where the players can go and save their game. Some kind of transporter which would hold their game data incase they die. So instead of starting over all over again they would revert back to their last \"Save Point\"\n\nAs for ship destruction. If your part of a fleet and you sent out a distress signal. Your fleets can come and salvage your ship and take you back to a drydock and your ship would be repaired within two hours or so. It may not be a solution but its a step in the right direction. It would be a penalty of sorts for them to wait for that long.\n\nIf not part of a fleet and if there are any surviving shuttles players may take them to a starbase of their federation/empire. And request NPC assistance for a salvage op.\n\nAs for decor and other items which are placed in your quarters. Maybe the player could put some kind of an insurance on the items. If they are destroyed or lost in space they can be replaced\n\nI can see the shuttle Idea being the same sorta. I think that the salvage op option working very well. Clans/Guilds/Fleets, or what ever you call them can invest salvaged materials and or perstige.money to building an npc scavenger ship. Which would be of basic design. When a salvage op is requested they ship will move out and recover about 90% of you ship, and you will just have to pay for the missing 10%."

However, unlike many other problems and complaints people have, Cryptic clearly already has plans to make shuttles useful in the near future.\n\nGiven they built a whole mission around the shuttle, I hardly think it likely they are going to leave them as the near - useless novelty items that they are currently.\n\nGiven the community's predilection for digging up ANY scrap of evidence that a Cryptic Dev said something would be done and it wasn't, I doubt a Cryptic Dev would make a bold statement like that unless it was already in the works.\n\nCaveat: Eventually does indeed mean never , but only for KDF side content.\n\nFirstly, my statement is borne out of years of observations of various MMOG developers. It is both reasonable and logical, but only if you have watched over the course of years promises of \"eventual\" content quietly be dropped, never to be heard from again. I only get excited about upcoming content once it reaches some form of beta, either open or closed.\n\nSecondly, do not assume that I am part of the \"I'm dissatisfied\" chorus. I am not. I would prefer if shuttle craft had a specific use outside of being a gimmick in one or two tailored missions, but I am by no means unhappy in their implementation, just their utilization. I have seen many such gimmicks introduced in other games, only to be quietly ignored shortly there-after by content developers.\n\nSure, the ability to go to your shuttle bay and pick out your launch would be nice. I would fully utilize this feature. However, it is not necessary, and would divert significant resources away from developing critical areas in STO."

There was a time where goons were 'hard' at the member level, but the jump bridge idiocy made the common member soft and complacent, something I'm in overdrive trying to fix. The wiki is ancient - it died and stopped being updated around the time that jump bridges rendered individual survival 'optional' and most of the fits there are utterly laughable, which is something I've been working on getting fixed with our new reimbursement directors and shifting peacetime reimb to specific fits.\n\nAlphafleet owns and our fcs who came up with it own; our allies who didn't adopt it when we offered it nicely to them are all dead - we tried to get the NC to take it repeatedly and they mostly turned up their noses at it or called it outright inferior to arty abaddons or whatever nonsense they were sent howling to their graves with. It doesn't require much individual 'skill' to pilot a Mael and blast the primary, all the same.\n\nI dunno. Since we don't have any recruiting requirements and are constantly educating folks entirely new to eve - and I have a 2005 mindset since that's where I began - I tend to think of us as the underdogs, fighting off better-skilled veteran players with more sp and better pvp track records. On a pilot-per-pilot basis that's probably true. Organizationally/politically, you're right - it's not fair to say we're incompetentThat's actually a solid point - the GSF directorate is full of frighteningly educated types who've been uncommonly successful irl. We have four+ lawyers, a couple of millionares, a champion poker player/lawyer, a gaggle of high-end computer types, etc. We also have some stereotypical nerds, but since I seem to be one of the few alliance leaders willing to fire people regularly (we lose a director a month, thereabouts) so we roughly approach a meritocracy.\n\nI hate firing people, it's the worst part of the job, especially when it's someone I know and play games with/am bros with.

It is not that they take the game ultra seriously, it is just that the leadership at present isn't as incompetent as it was previously.\n\nLike the old NC, it is not elitism that made them a powerful entity in their prime, it was the sheer numbers. If they can follow adopted minimum standards it just makes them more effective, not elite. It doesn't mean taking the game seriously either, it just means you have more of a chance of not getting your face pushed in.

At which point Vee warped us out and the entire grid desynced, we logged back in at destination or halfway between if we logged out first. Once people finally got back in, they were instructed to get to the POS as everyone was literally everywhere between the POS and the battle. We formed up back in there while waiting for Vee to get back on, and waited while listening to him being frustated at Eve not working and idiots keying up, It turned out mainfleet was broken so we made a new fleet... And then it crashed again. When we finally had a working fleet again, we warp to the gate to see them jumping out...\n\nBalls deep, throw caution? It's THE home system right? Any further battering of VFK after so much recent effort would have crucified grunt morale, losing a 1000 Maels would have been the least of their worries...\n\nI for one am mostly surprised how many people actually believe the bullshit feeded to them from their HC, and this is both true for Goons and NERP.\n\none of the funniest things as i get older in EVE TIME is that my position is increasingly secure and i know most of my 'enemies' from a very long ways back. so oddly enough i lie less and less, yet the more i'm accused of propagandizing vOvWe've done the math to see what it takes to jihad a super down. The most obvious template is your own throwaway Tempest fleet. It doesn't work when the enemy is in a blob and can be remote-repped en masse.\n\nAgain, you're arguing Gurren Lagann when the situation is one of raw mathematics. If there wasn't a problem, CCP wouldn't be loudly hinting at nerfing the damn thingsI believe this was your theory vs abaddons with drakes. How did that work out? there say you play the game for a long time and yet you still don't know there is more to it than just numbers. Sometimes you have to go out and actually take a risk if you wanna win. Nothing is unbeatable, there is only lack of motivation/preparation/skills there're absolutely right about this, which is precisely why we frustrate your super pilots by scarpering every time they get their dicks hard about dropping on subcaps. It doesn't impact our morale - we all know the game presently is comically broken - and it results in quantifiable sperg-posts by the 'victimized' super jocks. And, of course, 'different approaches' include political, diplomatic and meta-moves, all of which we've been undertaking zealously. If you think we've been sitting idly by, then perhaps you're like Hunter and think that I 'still don't know there's more to it than numbers' after all these years of constant war.\n\nOur Maelstrom fleets die with pleasing regularity. Sometimes we win, sometimes we welp. By and large, super blobs don't die, they just get larger and largerThey will mostly be in Titans. The thing that worrys me a lot is how everyone thinks Titans are fine. I will never forget my bc roam in Russian space where a avatar nearly 4 shot my moving BC and literally 2 shot necro in his BC. How anyone thinks this is fixed is beyond me BUT I guess if you take the OP SC's away from the cap rape at least the BS gang can rely on triage carriers more and it makes suiciding a BS fleet more reasonable.\n\nOur Maelstrom fleets die with pleasing regularity.

It is a sacrifice because nobody is going to pin a medal on your chest at the end of the day, but there is a lot of satisfaction that comes from putting that effort in and seeing things turn out okay.\n\nBeing a SA person from way back before I played eve, I know the type of people that come along, these guys play a lot of different video games and whilst a lot of them are pretty good gamers in general, eve has a massive learning curve and I found the information and direction GS had provided to noobs back in 2007ish era was pretty good because it let people who haven't invested years in the game to get to speed and be \"useful\" as soon as possible. I never joined goons in eve but I have experienced it in other games and mmos and people who haven't underestimate the community.\n\nBehind the bravado it is a pretty good community, can be drama filled from time to time but in a game like eve that community is a massive strength given that numerical superiority is often a greater advantage than skill and experience, especially if well harnessed.\n\nI think the goons of today shows the benefit of a leadership group that put the hard work and effort in and it is good to see. I think eve is a more interesting game with goons an active part of the overall community.\n\nIf having to turtle up every time a supercapital pilot moves his mouse isn't hurting your morale, why do you constantly whinge about it?\n\nBut by all means, keep throwing the ~broken~ line out there. Bit by bit you may or may not sway popular opinion and get CCP to fall in the direction you're looking for. I'm not sure which would appeal to your ego more - having the nerf take place, or thinking that you'd actually influenced itDid I mention time dilation?\n\nAt the moment the asymetrical counters to battleships don't work in the biggest fights because of lag. If CCP manage to get time dilation working as it should, it changes the game drastically for blobs. Imagine: bombs that actually go off where you want them to in a 1000 man fightBombers need to be used for their full potential. I cant believe its been ignored in the extent it has, the fact that 50 guys in waves of could kill 10x that amount of people if there is some competence on the bomber side. While lag and the fact 90% of your bombers will die is an issue, persistence could at least iron out some of the problems.\n\nAlso the feeling of killing stuff in a bomber is one of the greatest satisfactions in eve.\n\nAt the front end I've noticed a massive difference in just how fast stuff is going down, the disciplined primary alpha fire is staggering, most of us are trying to shoot stuff that's simply not there anymore."

Something painfully easy to exploit against the Xenons.\n\nI understand the reassons, too much CPU power investment... That's why I think it will be highly likely that, due to the complexity of some of the modules already shown on some SS, Station turrets can be triggering FF regularly. For example:\n\nThis one that looks like a Solar Power Module (akin to the SPPs on previous X's) has the kind of geometry EASILY exploitable as cover by a player fighter (Specially if it's capable of the powerfull strafing of previous X's games) against the owning station turrets placed somewhere else.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if they used the simple solution (but unrealistic) of simply making the sations immune to damage of shots of their turrets (Which is far less CPU intensive). Something similar may happen to Rocket turrets that, without any doubt will not even require complex geometry for a player to use missiles against the owning station.\n\nAdded to this they can also deactivate collision detection against the owning stations for those shots... Which would remove the chance to use the station geomethry as cover (Notice that turret arc could still prevent it to shoot at targets out of it... But that makes sense and still a tactial option attackers and defenders should pay attention to).\n\nLast edited by ragamer on Sun, 9. Oct 11, 14:38; edited 1 time in total\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if they used the simple solution (but unrealistic) of simply making the sations immune to damage of shots of their turrets (Which is far less CPU intensive)\n\nActually, the least CPU intensive would probably be to figure out and adjust the firing arcs BEFORE the station ever opens fire. It's not like stations are going to move! If the station suddenly finds itself with new, open firing arcs (because obstructing modules blew up/tractor beam shenanigans), then it's up to the station to shut their weapons down and reboot their systems.\n\nActually, the least CPU intensive would probably be to figure out and adjust the firing arcs BEFORE the station ever opens fire. It's not like stations are going to move!\n\nOh... the question is... When you do this? How you calculate it?... Performing a kind of \"ray tracing\" into a \"mesh\" of angular coordinates you divide the whole firing arc into? This is what's done usually, you calculate a \"firing allowed mask\" you check each time before opening fire (The \"angular size\" of each element of the mask is usually controlled by the deviation of the proyectile shot, in particular by half the angular area).But the above process can't help you at all with Rocket turrets...\n\n...I would love to see something like the above implemented but...\n\n...Don't you think that the \"no collision\" or the \"no damage\" dirty tricks will be much much much easier and will get rid of the potential \"urge\" of players attempting this kind of \"tactics\"? Which is the final goal, anyway (From Dev PoV, ofc... Not from the \"realism lovers\" like me).Am I really the only one with a good answer to \"simple AI for turrets\"? This works with standard projectiles and dumbfire missiles:\n\nTurret aims at enemy, fires a \"ghost shot\" that is invisible and does no damage and has immense speed. If the ghost hits friendly, the turret will NOT fire for about half a second, if it doesn't hit a friendly the turret will fire a real shot or burst. Repeat every half second. Covers ALL possible friendly fire scenarios in the entire imaginable gameworld with a fraction of the CPU usage of nearly any other idea.\n\nBORING FURTHER DETAILS YOU NEED NOT READ:\nTo avoid 100 stupid questions the \"ghost shot\" is easy as pie to make from the programmers point of view, the game already always knows who is shooting who. The ghost shot can also be an exact copy of the projectile fired or a \"buckshot\" to reduce the odds of friendly fire even more. Seeker missiles that are not covered by this type of ghosting should automatically disarm when they get too close to a friendly so as to not harm it, the projectile is simply disabled. All of the above took me about 10 seconds to come up with so I kinda think Egosoft has already done this or something even better.\n\nSimple, requires almost no CPU power, and keep thing from killing themselves.\n\nDoubling up every shot isn't CPU intensive?\nThere's also no simple way for a ghost bullet to predict if a ship CAN or WILL dodge a particular shot. If the ship dodges, the station can still shoot itself.\n\nQuote:By \"rebooting\" the turret systems, of course! Stations don't change shape very often (a few times per game hour, max?). So when they do change shape, THAT'S the time to figure out how their weapons work. Combat is the LAST time you want to stack up the friendly fire scripts! Tough targeting issues should be solved before the CPU finds itself short on time.\n\nIf the game can't figure it out, the weapon can be flagged for the player to solve. Sometimes planting a PPC behind a giant ore refinery is just dumb.\n\nIdeally, stations are connected in a way where few weapons find themselves with odd obstacles or restrictive firing arcs. Simple obstacles are pretty much unavoidable as stations become more complex. But really bad component spots can find other uses like shields or short ranged flak.\n\nI can't say much about missiles. The only remotely predictable missiles will be heavy torpedoes. Buyer beware. Replace your small missiles with flak style weapons, limit them to long range (away from the station), or pump those shields. Another option is for \"missile safety\" equipment that disables friendly fire missiles, minimizing damage.\n\nActually it doesn't even need to double every shot, it can fire one ghost and ten real shots like a supercharged phased repeater gun. As I said the \"buckshot\" would further reduce the likelihood of friendly fire but let's say the turret instead fires an expanding ghost shot that will pass any hostile but report if it touches a friendly, it would be nearly impossible to get friendly fire even in dogfights and it still does only need to be done once or twice a second, the rest can be full auto 30 shots a second baby! Even the engine in X3TC can handle a thousand shots a second and still get \"who-hits-who\" right, I really doubt an increase of 10% workload would matter."

After that I thinks it's a weighted percentage chance of what happens within. More than likely the largest percentage is the hull, but eventually the internal systems get hit also. I don't know if that answers your question(s)\n\n_________________ Finally, after years of hard work I am the Supreme Sith Warlord! Muwhahahaha!! What?? What do you mean \"there's only two of us\"?\n\nShields take damage before hull. Always. I don't know what the ratio is to hull/systems once the shields drop. But systems CAN be damaged before shields are breached. An easy way to prove this is to watch a capital ship in combat against a few fighter squads for awhile. Something like an ISD against x-wings. The fighters don't do enough damage to penetrate the shields; you can watch the ISD's shields blip down for a fraction of a second before they regenerate. But because the ISD is terrible at killing fighters, the fighters have a chance to live long enough that, somehow, the shield generator is damaged. You can also see this when a ship gets hit with a lot of power all at once- the shields might go from full to 50%, and the shield generators are suddenly at reduced effectiveness as well.\n\nMuch more rarely, I've seen a ship with shields up take damage to systems other than shields. Weapons, engines, anything. This is much more likely to happen when the ship is being pounded by lots of incoming fire than by small amounts of sustained damage, but I have seen weapons damaged in situations like the earlier one, with an ISD and x-wings.\n\nOn this note, the game has separate firing arcs for weapons, but shields and hull value are not assigned to portions of a ship. Easy way to test this is watch a large group of x-wings take out an ISD; they don't fire torpedoes until the shields are completely down, even if they are only ever hitting two sides of the ISD with lasers (which should only drop the shields on those two sides, if the shields were sectioned off like that).\n\nI think it may be possible to use tractor beams on ships with shields up (which takes out or slows down its sublight engines), but I'd have to do more testing to prove it.\n\nAlso, every ship (except fighters) have a damage control value assigned to it. You can see it in RebEd. This has something to do with how well a ship repairs, and thus a ship with a higher value here will have more robust systems than a ship with a lower value. I don't think it affects how difficult it is to damage the system, but I'm pretty sure higher values will greatly increase the chances of a system being repaired mid-battle. I don't know if this changes repairs made outside of combat.\n\nI *believe* ships never miss once they fire; if fire, the shot hits. Also, I *believe* it always does full damage from that arc (so if an ISD shoots a Mon Cal cruiser with its rear arc, the Mon Cal will be hit, and will be hit with the full value of the ISD's rear turbolasers). The only way I can think to test this would be to remove all but forward firing arc from a ship, remember its damage value, and remove the shields from another ship. Put the two in combat with each other, let the shield-less ship get hit (and count exactly how many times it is hit). Then retreat and see the hull damage of the shield-less ship. That might give you insight into whether its possible to miss (even though the laser graphics don't ever show misses), whether it is always the full damage, and/or what possible percentage goes to systems vs hull.\n\nSomehow, the game changes things based on turbolasers vs normal lasers vs ion cannons. Ion cannons seem to get a bonus against shields, but I'm not sure if they help disable systems after the shields are down or not. Lasers do much more damage against fighters than turbolasers do. I'm not sure if the game allows turbolasers to miss fighters, or if they just have reduced damage against them. Whether ion cannons are as effective as lasers against fighters, I don't know, nor do I know if they are as bad against fighters as turbolasers are.\n\nIndeed the shield generators can be damaged while the shields are still up. ASFAIK that is the only internal system that can be damaged while the shields are still up. The hits are always hits and with *full* damage, there are no misses. Ion cannons only do damage to shields, the manual claims it can disable internal systems (do not know about that). *Turbolasers hit capital ships much harder for full damage but hardly hit much against fighters, vice verse for lasers*. That would mean there is a percentage damage reduction for each type against what target. I thought to recall it was about 80% reduction. That was to simulate a turbo laser missing the small agile fighter target. Torpedoes only hit against bare hull (not shields), those fighter torpedoes are very good at destroying hulls to zero. Tractor beams slow down (and stop if strong enough or multiple beams) any vessel regardless of the state of the shields.\n\nThere seems to be a random hit to either a system box or the hull box on a weighted percentage. A heavy hull ship takes more damage to hull and less chance to a system health bar."

      "text": "It's a refit in name only, as a marketing ploy and an excuse for its price. It's Console set up is the same, its crew is the same, its hull is the same, its impulse turn rate, and inertia ratings are the same, its weapon set up is the same. It's not a refit. All that is different is the BOFF set up and an overpriced console. Outside that BOFF set up and Console, it remains identical to the other Advanced escort, that means it lacks what makes a Refit a Refit.\n\nOk, that does make your point more clear. However you're wording here 'you are not making one refit more powerful than any other refit' is confusing. Are you agreeing that giving it an extra slot is not making it more powerful, did you do a common typo and meant now and typed not? I'm confused.\n\nAnd lets go back a bit. You pointed out that the T5 retro has the same weapons as the T5 norms. Well the T5 norms has the same weapons as a T4. See that flaw? Cruisers and Escorts all gain an extra weapon slot at the transition of T4 to T5, Science does not. The standard power and maneuverability and other buffs that happen from T4 to T5 happen with it as they do all the other classes of ship, but unlike the others, T5 Science ships gain no extra offensive capabilities to deal with endgame level enemies where as Escorts and Cruisers do.\n\nThe choice to fly an escort with beams is not part of the equation. Yes if you take an Escort and an Intrepid with a forth fore slot and equipped them with the same weapons they would produce similar DPS. However running an Escort with beams is not going with its maximum DPS potential, so it doesn't invalidate the argument. If a Science could run dual and dual heavies then yes it could match an Escort in DPS potential but since it can't it never will. An escort will always be able to be fitted to do more DPS.\n\nShould read\n\nScience t4 ships have the same numbers as Science T5 vessels. So by giving a t5 refit an extra weapon you are making one refit more power then any other refit.\n\nAs for escort with out cannon. Well in that case if you put dual beam on your front slots on science ship you do more damage as well."

      "text": "Icrontic EVE Discussion\n\nI know @drasnor plays, and it seems like there are quite a few other EVE addicts around. Who else plays? What do you do? Where do you roam?\n\nAs for me, I have a single character currently. He's pretty much a carebear miner in/around Haatomo. Just got my Hulk. Been running missions too to break up the boredom. Doing Lv2s currently. 5.2 million skill points so far.\n\nIs this game free to play? Or is it another subscription based game? I've wanted to play this for awhile considering that it's really similar to the X series (Or at least looks like it is) course from what I'm hearing it's a lot more complicated.\n\nEDIT: ah nevermind, and what Plex is literally the equivalent of real money that's hilarious I can see a lot of problems shipping that around.\n\nPlex is not real money (you can get banned for real money trading). Plex can be purchased with real money, used to extend your account by a month and it can be bought/sold for in-game money (isk), thus allowing you to play the game \"for free\" by spending isk on Plex. If you, as a player, sell plex for real money though, you run the risk of CCP ruining your day.\n\nI play Eve. I have a high sec alt that does Planetary Interaction (yay easy slow trickle of money) some industry and a little bit of low level missioning when I'm terribly bored. I also have a null sec character in Dreddit. It does a bit of this and that.\n\nAlright what I mean is that it can be purchased with real money and can then be traded within EVE. Effectively if something happens to a shipment (Like say being blown up) you are losing real cash. (Analogy: You take dollars and convert them into another form of currency, now lets say you are robbed despite the conversion you are still losing the original equivalent.)\n\nNow back into EVE terms you pay lets say $50 for PLEX and the shipment is stolen or blown up even though it is an in game currency you are still losing $50\n\nIf you're going to sell your Plex, make sure your character is already at the station where you plan on selling it. Then log out of the game buy the Plex, redeem it for your character and it will be in your hanger, safe and sound, ready to be placed on the market. If you plan on using a Plex to extend your game time, you just use it as soon as you buy it, while you're still in a station.\n\nUnless you're doing something like buying a bunch of Plex in one solar system and transporting them to another solar system to sell at a markup, you shouldn't ever leave a station with a Plex in your cargohold.\n\nSaw a killmail with 36 PLEX losses before... Idiot was carrying them in a shuttle. 18bn isk loss in one go. I've been playing solidly for about 9-12 months, started 3 years ago but only did a month or two here and there. I run a C2 wormhole for/with my corp, do the odd lowsec/WH roam, run incursions, do PI, that sort of stuff. Started off as a miner then changed to combat for incursions so my skills are a bit wonky, levelling them out at the moment. Have got a few ships and isk but I'd be peen waving if I listed them :p That being said, on the scale of things its nothing really. You can lose PLEX while shipping them, but that's the beauty and the horror of the game. It's unashamedly dog eat dog. CCP's motto is basically Tough ****\n\nAre you saying that your in-game items that are worth real-world cash can be lost or stolen in-game? That's fucking hardcore. Awesome.\n\nI know right? That was what I thought. Told my father about it cause it sort of relates to his job. He said that it's an amazing marketing scheme, and that the idea of a person potentially losing 1000s of dollars to a video game amuses him greatly.\n\nAye, though fortunately you're only liable to lose thousands of dollars if you buy and immediately lose several years of subscription time :p\n\nI do try and think of it as real money, though, keeps me on my toes. The real killer is loss of time over money, though. I can make a billion in a day if I work hard over 24 hours, and lose it in a few seconds, which made that entire day a complete waste. As I said, its a killer game but worth it.\n\nFor EVE and non-EVE players, I would *seriously* recommend the Clarion Call series by Rooks and Kings alliance (download the .mkv where possible):\n\nWas on a nullsec roam with my alliance and we actually got hotdropped (somebody dropped a beacon and capital ships locked on and warped in) by Rooks and Kings. It was like getting forcibly penetrated by celebrities. Wonderful stuff. \n\nBuying a single PLEX with USD is 19.95. You get discounts for buying multiple packs of PLEX (28 PLEX is 489.86 USD). Of course, if you just pay for your account with an automatically billed credit card or PayPal account, it's 14.95 per month to play... less if you have a recurring subscription for more than 1 month at the same time. You can't turn your months into isk if you do this though.\n\nI usually mine to make money in game. Roughly 10 million ISK / hour is what I could do a few weeks ago while I was training for my Hulk, a mining ship that'll easily double my income rate. Problem is, the ship costs over 200 million ISK by the time you buy it and outfit it with the right equipment. That's a heck of a way to go when you only have 60 million in the bank and haven't had time to grind out the rest.\n\nI considered how long it'd take to make up that money in game and realized it'd be a pretty boring month. While considering all this, my favorite ship (1600mm plate Vexor) got blown up because I got a big dick and decided I could kill all the enemy ships in Recon Lv2 Part 1. PLEX to the rescue. I purchased 2 PLEX, sold them in Jita and came out with 1.3 billion ISK to my name.\n\nInstead of grinding for 2 months, I paid the equivalent of their subscriptions and was able to get my Hulk and my Dominix, and I still have ISK left over for when they get blown up!\n\nMy goal is to get to where I have enough in-game income that I can /q my recurring subscription and play for free.\n\n@buddyj yeah, I like flying with them. It's not for everyone though. Some of them can be pretty offensive at times, but on the whole they're mostly a good group to play with. Since it's a 2000+ player corp in a 5000+ player alliance, it can be hard to keep up with everything that's going on at times. There's something for pretty much everyone though, which is nice. Also, we just got our first titan kill without support from any other alliance recently. It was pretty awesome.\n\nHow active is more-active, BuddyJ? My corp's recruiting and we've got a fairly even EU-US split, CEO's a buddy of mine of a few years. There's 4-8 of us (people, not accounts :p) who are on daily, and most of us run multiple accounts. We're beginning to run nightly (or close enough) wormhole/lowsec raids, and do anything from WH ops to low/nullsec roams with the alliance on a regular basis. Is really friendly and tight-nit, though the CEO and one of the directors like dwarf porn jokes. Forewarned. We're small but getting there, though you might be a looking for something bigger still. What sort of SP are you sitting on? Never mind, learnificated to read. Same to you, drasnor, if you're interested. The more the merrier.\n\nI don't have much PvP experience but I'd love to fly with you sometime. I've been on a nullsec roam twice ever. I lived in lowsec for a month one time in a Russian-controlled area. I hardly ever saw anyone during my normal playtimes and only ever got into two 1v1 fights (1-1). I have a 63M SP toon and a 24M SP toon on one account.\n\nHoly crap thems is some nice SP. My CEO's sitting around 75m and we just recruited somebody in the mid 60s, so somebody with your experience would be most welcome. What sort of stuff do you do? I'm Harudath in-game if you want to get in contact. A couple of us are doing incursion blitzes at the moment, though as I said there are other things going on as well. What happens depends on who's on really.\n\nI don't have much PvP experience personally, but our glorious leader has been playing since '03 and a couple others for several years with PvP experience so they can generally tell a person about anything.\n\nI operated a high-sec research POS for a couple of years. Both toons are more or less tuned for mission running and industry. The high-SP toon is Caldari and can fly any Caldari ship T2-fitted except capitals, black ops, and interdictors. She can fly a T2-fitted Hulk/Mack, anchor a POS in 0.6 Amarr and 0.7 Caldari, solo L4s, fit T2 codebreaker/analyzer/salvager, probe down anything, and basically do whatever I want. Combat specialty is shield tanking with missiles and drones but is almost as good with hybrid guns.\n\nThe other one I've been playing more often because I can get a feeling of advancement playing her. The low-SP toon is Gallente and was originally going to be a mining/industrial alt but became a mission runner as well because it pays better. She can fly most Gallente sub-BS T2 and operate a POS in all regards. She'll be able to fly a T2-fitted Hulk next month. Combat specialty is shield buffered armor tanking with drones and hybrids.\n\nI'm not sure if I'll be able to play tonight but I'll see you in game if I can.\n\nYou're going to make a fellow director wet his panties with glee :p He's just started really getting into research/mining/indy in general. Was hoping to do it in high sec but we don't have the standings"

      "text": "Reavers use some very cool battle tactics. Reaver spaceships, captured from their victims, are instantly recognizable by the haphazard red stripes and bodies of victims adorning their hulls. They are also known for flying without proper safety measures such as nuclear engine radiation containment, a practice tantamount to suicide. This makes Reaver ships faster than their normal counterparts, but also makes it easier for their prey to detect their approach and to hide by powering down their ships rather than fleeing. Reavers' habit of ramming their victims with indifference to damaging their own hulls tends to leave their ships appearing battered or torn.\n\nTheir craft possesses a wide variety of exotic weaponry, many of which are designed to snare and capture other ships including EMP cannons, grappling lines, and energy nets. They use weapons that fire giant sharpened disks similar to buzzsaws or shuriken, in addition to more traditional anti-ship ordnance. They also fire long lance-like metal rods. Rather than firearms, Reavers will use any sharp object as a weapon in personal combat. They also fire toxic darts to cripple their opponents but not kill them. The goal of their weaponry is most likely to increase the number of survivors on victim ships (since Reavers have no interest in victims who are already dead). To cripple rescue ships, they have been known to leave a bait ship intact with a bomb planted on board set to detonate when another ship docks to help, destroying the already-derelict ship and crippling the ship that tried to provide aid.\n\nLOL. Firefly lives on at UW and on Evernote. Definitely one of the better shows in the science fiction genre, and its abandonment is a real shame. I don't understand how Terra Nova and V could get massive amounts of funding, but Firefly got dropped. Burning disappointment wrapped in quiet sadness indeed..."

A group of pvpers can really blitz elites and get each mission done in around 10 minutes. Khit on Ground Elite is especially fast if people know how to fight, the only elite that is faster at the moment is Infected Space. I would say Khit Space is tied in time.\n\nBut in all seriousness any restrictions to STF's will more likely cause more frustration and anger than see any benefits.

After you get a huge fleet, you can jump in, and go all 'lalala' on the planet.\n\nAlso, the starbase is not upgraded. I was expecting a fully upgraded starbase. If the dev's could find a way to give the starbase upgrades without the occupation people actually playing, that would be great. I know that this may take a while to put in the code, but it is too easy to kill the starbase. If the dev's can't find a way for the starbase to spawn upgraded, then could they possibly make another starbase entity that was as good as an upgraded starbase?\n\nBTW, I think the starbase should have ALL of the upgrades possible, not just 8. I mean, it's the occupation planet we're talking about. It's some ancient planet with relics of power that can assure supremacy. Surely they would want to defend it heavily, right? It's their super special artifact, right?Yes and no, its already hard to measure how much of a fleet you need to actually take the occupational planet. The main problem is that, it is implied that you macro up and army, on maps with very few aggressive paths towards your enemy. And you take the occupational planet and contest it with the enemy. Adding to the defense would make it a pain in the ass to actually take this planet and thats where the problem comes in.Or they could make it so that the natural orky counts as a ship of some sort so that you could make another starbase in the gravity well and have double the protection. That would be easier to program than letting you upgrade the starbase you capture since the game files do not naturally allow you to do thatQuoting Teun-A-Roonius, reply 14 QuVery good idea.

A purple quality gravimetric scientist who is efficient, or a purple quality photonic studies scientist who is both efficient and logical. Who do you pick?\n\nCurrently the photonic studies guy is the better choice for the assignment. Both officers will make the failure chance zero, but the photonic scientist's two critical success traits give a higher chance for a better outcome than the gravimetric scientist. Using the requested officer type leads to WORSE outcomes when you can reduce failure to zero such that the only factors which matter are the ones that increase the chance to critical.\n\nAs a fix, I propose that when a mission's Failure chance reaches zero, any further factors that would normally add Success (and whose contribution is wasted when there's no more Success possible) instead add Critical Success.\n\nThat way, when you actually have the correct officer called for by an assignment that has no failure rate, it will make sense to USE that correct officer."

Note \"too\", they probably wont be cheap if they are strong, if they are weak than still as you will need hundreds to win relative price wont be cheap, because if it was than there would be no need in destroyers, right?I'd rather put those trained pilots into a more heavily armored and armed ship, like a frigate or destroyerNot really and not easily.\n\nWith proper security measures, it becomes next to impossible (especially if you change encryption often..by the time the enemy manages to crak one, you're already using another)\n\nAnd if you are using a closed system then it literally IS impossible to hack itYou counter a tech, the enemy counters your counter, you counter his counter-counter etc... that's how military devices have been developed since before history and if you make all your fighters drones the enemy will find a way to counter them.\n\nWell, we saw in those screen shots that there are different tiers of fighter drones like in the other X games, so I can't imagine it's much of a stretch to envision cheaper versions of each drone that could be more disposable.\n\nAlso, I figure that capital ships like carriers will have special types of drones that are too large to be used with the PoA and are essentially fighters that you buy preassembled.\n\nWhat would be really cool is if they let us design specific types of carrier based fighter drones or change their loadouts for specific missions etc. I just can't imagine there only being one size of drone and launching them all from the PoA. The PoA is only an M6 size or thereabouts so it doesn't make sense to have it carrying \"big\" drones. Of course, that's just my own two cents"

      "text": "arna - stupid shit that is going to kill eve\n\nWe all know CCP will be ignoring 0.0 and other areas of EVE until they release incarna.\n\nWhat is the pont of Incarna?\n\nI play EVE because im huge science fiction fan. As a kid i watched Star Trek (TNG) so I'm playing EVE to fly imaginary space ships. I have no interest in seeing my character in stations sitting in bar or doing whatever. This whole venture is pointless imo because most of eve players don't care about walking around in space stations. We have players who like PVP, PVE or little bit of both but we don't have anyone who like to stay in stations. Why is CCP wasting so much time and ignoring the fundamental problem in EVE to bring this feature out.\n\nThis will not add more complexity to the game because people will check this out for few days then move on to their normal activities. Why waste resource on this venture when there is a good chance that CCP might loose some or most of its loyal customers. I have friends who had 3-4 accounts but now days they are scaling back to a single account.\n\nI for one, will not be checking Incarna when its comes out, I pay to fly internet spaceships not walk around in stations.\n\nTo attract more and different sort of players, people which seek for another type of experience but can be still plugged in the same thing.\nEve and its universe allows to stick / ducktape loads of generally different games together like live examples would be - Shatered Horizon, Starcraft and even recent discussed Perpeetum easily fits into picture - so why not to make a monster game (of course one can say that you probably can't shine in every aspect and you will most likely end up being average or bad in each individual section but thats just connected to skill (programming / planning) rather than concept).\n\nIf the overall playerbase is bigger everyone benefits (now you can still kill that industrial guy even he doesnt really plays the game for PVP). Can compare it somewhat to Steam which binds (tries to) totally opposite games but still the same players ..\n\nAnd in general what have you (most pvpers) been doing theese years? Watching red / blue / pink little squares moving arround on a black screen .. at some point it doesnt feel like that interesting anymore (except the pure social impact such actions create). Which explains why you would want to just drop the 3-4 accounts because there is nothing new to do rathern than anything else.. The moment you can and have flown every ship in the game a large part of the goal is reached and then there is a question what next?\nSo if they decide to fix the current problems (of which the most anoying is the \"lag\") using the \"just purchase more hardware\" approach (also can use Moore's law here) it is / could be fine even they dont dedicate any serious developer power to those issues.\n\nBut overall it's kinda useless to be frustrated about a game / piece of software (even there is a lots of time you have wasted) ..\nIf the product is doomed to die it will at some point - CCP is not that new company back in 1999 anymore so assuming that they don't have an established road / milestones they have to follow imho is wrong the same way thinking that an individual customer has any (major) influence.\n\nJust my ISK.\n.. also there have been threadnauts on Kugu with similar topic before Tyrannis\n\nMore players = win. However, don't you thing if they add more features without fixing lag then 0.0 lag becomes very real in high sec too? Shouldn't they address lag first and find a solution before attracting new customers. There will be rush of new players but they'll be hit by lag sooner or later and eventually they'll leave and attract bad press tooWell there is also an \"easy\" fix (at least temporar till the the population hits critical mass again) - if your code isnt really paralel computing friendly (its also the one creating a lot of troubles because of its nature and all kinds of interconnects) just replace the single node with more powerfull hardware - switch those tiny IBM blades with standalone quadruple quadcore / sixcore / N-core servers each having moar ram etc etc\n\nBut that involves either spending extra money or just waiting for the new generation of hardware (each quarter / half a year) when for the same costs you can switch 10 old pieces for 1 new which performs better.\nBalance is needed - if it's too late all the customers are long gone but if too early - you inject too much money (all the new and shiney stuff is overpriced) and can't get a reasonable return which leads either to bankrupt or shrinking staff / support etc - customers leaving.\n\nthe reason ccp isnt using multiple cpu blades to run one node is python doesnt support multi-threading cpu's its one stream using one cpu.\n\nobviously they can use multi-core blades and split the resources but it still doesnt eliminate the lag experienced in-game\n\nSOL Blades - These are the workhorses of Tranquility and are the primary focus of our ongoing work. The cluster is divided across 90 - 100 SOL blades which run 2 nodes each.\n\n* Node - a single EVE server process. This is the lowest level of granularity within the cluster.\n* Dedicated SOL blade - These are SOL blades that we dedicate to one system only. Systems such as Jita, Motsu and Saila reside on these. They run two nodes like any other SOL blade, however the second node is idle and does not load any solar systems.\n\nunless they can fix this its not going to matter how good the equipment is or isnt the code eve uses is limited on resources it can use.\n\nBut as you yourself quoted you still can solve some part of the problem with hardware - instead of the running more that one node (Eve system) on a single SOL blade and the manual \"reinforcement request on forums\" use the \"Jita approach\" for every solarsystem - as it looks a single dedicated blade can handle ~1k players (I imagine majority would be happy with such numbers / scale at least for some time). The multicore hardware and virtualisation just allows you to decrease the harware amount versus having a physical unit for each system. Of course its a big waste as large part of the universe prolly on average have 1-2 players online per system.\n\n.. and of course this all is simplified blabbing about some core problemsOf course they are a seperate team. It's just that there isn't any team for the other stuff. :P\n\nccp wont do it any time soon i think recoding all of the server code from python would take the best part of a year with all their coders working on it to recode and debug it + fix the myriad of bugs currently in the game & not to mention the server downtime to upgrade it, while i would love to see it happen & both ends (server & client) support multi-cpu/gpu/monitors i dont see ccp putting in that kind of resources.\n\nOf course it was just a fun note .. as Jython kinda allows you to compile and run the Python code in JVM that way kinda exploiting Javas advantages. Then again non-native things are usually forked up.. somewhat like anouncing a Linux/Mac client while actually it's just windows version running under Wine..\n\nIf CCP can get it right, I personally like the idea of Incarna. Increased interaction between players (especially within corporations and alliances) should add to the social aspect of the game. It adds to the all-encompassing feel of EVE, and will hopefully bring in new players. I just hope CCP stick with it to a point where it is polished and seamlessly becomes part of the game, instead of an obviously unfinished feature stuck precariously off the side of the main gameThrowing hardware at lag isn't an optimal approach. Their hardware is already humongously powerful, far more than needed to run a space sim. They should be able to handle some 2-10 times more entities than they can now. (where our definition of \"handle\" determines where in the \"2-10\" range we land - but who wouldn't accept, for instance, once-per-second updates on drone positions in exchange for a smoothly running battle?)\n\n\"higher blob numbers\" - what's acceptable? 1500? 3000? At some point we're good to go, right?\n\nOriginally Posted by Dregek\n\nthe reason ccp isnt using multiple cpu blades to run one node is python doesnt support multi-threading cpu's its one stream using one cpu.\n\nThe load shouldn't be in the python script. If it is, the offending code should be moved to C/C++ modules. (not a big deal.)\n\nThat said - guys, back to throwing hardware at the problem, it's not the way to go. Neither is revamping architecture to a multiprocessor friendly design. That'll only give us 2-4x performance improvement, more or less.\n\nHardware isn't the issue. EvE was perfectly able to handle 800-1000 People on Grid Pre-Dominion with the Hardware it had.\nTheres something with the Dominion-Code and/or -features that changed this, so it's pretty much a software-issue. Some people suspected the new features of the Fleetfinder to be related to this , but nobody outside CCP knows for sure.\n\nThe best project that might help is the Fleet-AI Zulu was talking about, probably helping quickly deploying power to stressed Nodes.\n\n...And probably they don't either. The recent lag article on EVE tribune said, \"The fact that CCP hasn't even figured out what they did to break the game's playability with Dominion speaks to the necessity for reworking things so that all the code is deliberately integrated and works properly.\" The implication here is that identifying the problem area is trivial compared to fixing it. That's typically not the case. In 9 cases out of 10, the \"fix\" once a problem is identified is trivial. What Finn* (tribune article author) might not appreciate is that the process of identifying the problem is 99% of the solution, and is friggin' hard. (okay, 9/10 isn't 99%, sue me.) It does help that we know whatever caused it was recently introduced, however.\n\nI'm gonna throw some words at this over on the uncensored forum, just for fun.\n\nwhile i agree that throwing hardware at the situation isnt an optimal solution, the game should encourage non-blobbing gameplay but it doesnt and if ccp wish to continue to tag eve as a \"sandbox\" they cant really do it either and i dont know of any way to discourage blobbing. Bringing it back to the coding & hardware issue, there is going to be a point where ccp have no choice but to upgrade to a more flexible code failing do so could stagnate eve's progress not to mention increase the running costs of the server farm.\n\nThe technology that computer & servers runs on has completely changed since eve came out and while ccp have taken steps to keep python working in the newer hardware era, its a plaster on a wound that isnt getting smaller and yet ccp's is pretty backwards beyond the graphics engine. For me the best step forward to alleviate the short term issues is dynamic loading on the blades to allow spontaneous response to an escalating fight.\n\nIncarna has good potenial for an increased social aspect espcially within a corp & alliance standpoint and if ccp add new hardware escially for it i see no reason for it to be a step in the wrong direction. Dust will be the first step into a untapped market if it works or not only time will tell\n\nI love the idea of doing something as efficiently as possible, and part of that is using the available hardware to capacity. It chaps my ass to think that most of the Tranquility blades are just sitting there. ick. First instinct is to start decomposing the app into schedulable entities and start throwing chunks of processing onto the available cores.\n\nI've learned over the past few years, though, that this can be a bad thing. Turning code concurrent, no matter how carefully, obfuscates funtionality. It also introduces control flow/synchronization overhead, but despite how much university classes hammer on Amdahl's Law, that's not a problem in most real life situations. (Unless you're using OpenMP or some such, in which case you might as well get a lobotomy anyway.) You just pick the appropriate granularity for the processing chunks. The real problem is that our brains work sequentially, and we more efficiently internalize sequential algorithms. Once we turn a set of operations concurrent, we're essentially giving up on any opportunity for further conventional algorithmic optimization. If we didn't see an optimization before we splat the code, there's virtually nil chance we'll recognize it after we mangle it into jobs or threads or whatever.\n\nThe sad fact for people who like threading is that algorithmic optimization is almost always more effective than concurrency optimization. Sucks, too, because that means you have to hunt down the system owner or wade through the code and build up a block diagram instead of just magically waving the concurrency wand over it all. It's never documented and the owner inevitably has better things to do than talk to you about it.\n\nStill. What are we talking here with Tranquility, something like 10% duty cycle? Roughly 90% is sitting idle, at least, right? gah.\n\nStill. What are we talking here with Tranquility, something like 10% duty cycle? Roughly 90% is sitting idle, at least, right? gah.\n\nthis is exactly my point, the hardware isnt being exploited because the code is unable to use it and this comes back to my early point of dynamically loading the nodes to meet demands of the server, this also have a knock on effect of ccp not needing to have as many \"live\" blades as it currently does but blades that are idle and using little power or resources to maintain but can be brought online if/when needed and added to a node on the fly.\n\nThe current situation of requesting a node reinforcement via petition and being enacted at DT is terrible and has no margin for error. IMO it should be a node reaches 95% capacity and a second blade is brought online to move other systems to the new blade allowing the current blade to focus on the main fight and the ability to add secondary (slave) nodes to help in processing the systems data\n\nWhatever dude, you should seriously apply for a job at CCP, if you don't already have RL commitments. I say this with complete seriousness...you seem like you know what's going on and what needs to happen. You'd have my vote at least.\n\nThe Colorblind Angel of Kugutsumen - Turning Bad Country into Mad Country one post a time\n\nI am seriously considering it. Did I not make that clear? I'm a bit in-between gigs right now, I was trying to figure out whether there was a real need, is all. Also whether it would make sense for CCP. We'll see what happens.\n\nWell, it wont kill EVE, especially if the subscriber number is still rising.\n\nSure there are plenty of bitter vets that just station spin or log on to swap skills/talk to mates, but its very possible that will always be the case.\n\nNot everyone will use Incarna, at this point I am undecided, but its there if i get bored or want to do something different.\n\nNow wether or not it is worth them throwing a massive amount of staff at it to get it completed and out the door, is open to debate. But thats just how software companies work. If Incarna is stunning, and then in 18 months CCP suddenly transform all the existing features into amazing finished and polished versions of themselves, then everyone here will likely be cheering.\n\nAlso reading that article, they have teams still trying to simulate and test fleet fights to identify the lag they unleashed with dominion/tyrranis, everyone screams that they should test their stuff more thoroughly but like they say time and again, you cannot pick up every bug or defect until a product is live, especially on a product like eve since its so large and complex. Thats why you have beta testing normally to try and pick up the bugs that the testing team missed.\n\nThe other problem is that they have no way of testing the software on a server the size of TQ until it hits TQ, because Singularity is just not the same size, its smaller and built for smaller user numbers. Yes in theory they should be able to fix the lag and pick it up before hand, but realistically they just cant.\n\nincarna started out as a great idea, and i liked it a lot, but that was over 2 years ago, we got our first glimpses of the engine and some dudes walking about in a station 1.5 years ago,\n\nsince then the only thing that we have seen come out the development of incarna is this (rather pretty) video:\n\nthrowing loads of extra devs at it is historically ccp's way of making things work (Trinity, Apocrypha) but this is just taking so long i dont see how the end product could possibly justify gimping the actual game's development for the next 18 months.\n\nThough lag is still a huge problem and not to distract from that, I think Incarna/D514 are both immensely cool ideas with a lot of promise. I have a certain fascination with eve as a \"complete sci-fi universe\" where you can interact and eventually do everything. PI/Incarna/D514 all help with that, but I do agree that fleet warfare is the most important part of EVE and they don't make up for that.\n\nThe Colorblind Angel of Kugutsumen - Turning Bad Country into Mad Country one post a time\n\nIncarna will be amazing for EVE, however I believe CCP have their priorities fucked.\n\nI just get this sense with CCP that they have no way of tracking bugs or putting a log on what's an escalated bug and what isn't. I get that strong feeling that they're still running with the small shop mentality in that when there's a problem, the ticket is answered with post-its and carried over to the person who can \"fix\" it. This information feels as though it's ONLY tracked through the petition system and that when a petition is closed, as is the problem... fixed or not. This here is speculation, but I'm sure I'm not the only person who feels this way when dealing with them.\n\nSo, CCP's prioroty 1... fix your QA/Support/Internal Tracking structure. I mean, I imagine when asked... What do your developers actually do, CCP doesn't have an answer... \"He's this cool dude who can kick my ass in fooseball, but I don't know what he's done this week in terms of workload\". A dynamic prioritized way to track workload and audit your workers.\n\nWhile this is something CCP may never have wanted as an internal work environment (the big corporation mentality), they shouldn't have made a game which they are competing with the likes of blizzavision, NCSoft and bioware etc... who all could produce a fully functional, WIS Spaceship game within a year or two with less bugs and a better support and tracking system.\n\nYou need an internal Wiki that the public doesnt have access to, a work ticket tracking system outside of the petition system and a team who internally just plays EVE to test out the bug. Their job is to see if they can recreate it, they are not programmers, they are people who are paid to hang out and test the game... Maybe the CSM can be hired on as an official job and it's a temp position that the players vote on. Then they'd actually be of use...\n\n1. Pull in the troops and work on the current game for 3 months of focused bug fixing.\n\n2. The people who aren't bug fixers work on things they can. Graphics people work on fixing graphics or improving current graphics. In 3 months of serious work, you should be able to re-model more than one single fucking battleship.\n\n3. Web people, put out some new forums... 3 months is not a stretch to put out some functional and decent forums.\n\n4. Data people start fixing rockets, the Demios and so many other imbalances. They can add 1 number to each ship which needs re-balancing. If it doesn't work... ok... these kinds of changes can be reverted. CCP is afraid to change the damage numbers because as soon as they do one thing the players ask, the playerbase will think that they have some kind of power and outcrys for fixes in the future will be louder and whinier. This shouldn't stop CCP from fixing known and documented imbalances... rockets... hybrid turrets...\n\nBut you're talking about incarna...\n\nSadly the game EVE is not ready for incarna and the current player base has no faith in CCP that they'll truly focus on bug fixing. IMO, CCP needs to pull in the troops who are working on WIS and do some serious damage control. Put the entire development team, including the WIS/Dust (not the asians, the ones in Iceland) people and spend 3 months of production focusing on bugs. Clean up the UI a little... doesn't need to be perfect, cause we all know what CCP's vision of perfect is.\n\nThe purpose of Incarna has been transparent and CCP hasn't kept it a secret. It's primary purpose is to gain subscribers quickly. However, their greatest mistake was not improving on the current aspects of the game.\n\nFor instance, how shitty does that video look with the archaic Neocom and boxy, outdated chat windows. In terms of the interface, EVE made a lot of improvements with PI. There's a lot of components there that work quite well where some aspects are well animated and are extremely smooth. This should have been priority one. Again, think priorities here... One of the biggest frustrations of EVE is not learning it, it's getting over the jacked up interface and lack of it's intuitiveness.\n\nThis should have been CCP's focus before pushing out Incarna.\n\nEVE was/is built off word of mouth. Right now the taste in the mouths of the current player base is sour. CCP needs to fix this first or else in 18 months, there will be a better game along. CCP has a successful base, but this base can easily be imitated and replicated to put out a game very similar.\n\nCCP wants more of the \"WoW\" RL iskies...\n\nHowever, imagine a Fantasy MMO RPG where you trained up your daggers, your cloaks, your boots of speed +4... etc. Then, put it on a single shard with conquerable lands and territory then add a few dungeons and PVE were combating nomadic roaming camps and herds.\n\nDear CCP,\n\nYou've created a product you can build on. A canvas so to speak, now build on this canvas and improve it. Have a \"new feature\" team hired on. Don't try to re-invent your game unless you have an entire separate team who doesn't take away from what the current EVE is.\n\nThen, delay Incarna for 3 months and do some serious, heads down bug fixing and current UI/Feature improvement... not addition.\n\nwho all could produce a fully functional, WIS Spaceship game within a year or two with less bugs and a better support and tracking system.\n\nYou just said NCsoft could do this help improve their griping and make it more realistic.\n\nWhen I brought up NCSoft, I was referring to their ability to pump out video games. Their support lacks, I was there for the Aion debacle. While the game lacked support, it was rather well developed and pretty polished. They failed on game mechanics and is not their first game to horribly fail on in terms of poor mechanics and support. Aion was a polished game on release. Everything (short of sieges) worked.\n\nAs for \"Over Complaining\"... I'm not. I just used a lot of words to express my pov on where I think CCP should go. Am I right? Who knows, but you can agree or disagreeChanging the color on powers wasn't really an issue or highly sought after thing. I never heard it brought up until City of Villains' release.\n\ni like the idea of Incarna i just dont like the fact they have 70 devs on it and literally 0 fixing bugs or generally cleaning house on current eve features, while yes im sure more than half of devs on Incarna are graphics related and other none coding related surely keeping your current product moving along in regards to bug fixing and other issues is something any & all mmo devs should be doing?\n\nThey pump out shitty games, just like Cryptic, Turbine, SoE, CCP, etc.\n\nEveryone who plays EVE is going to agree that CCP should be making fixing all the broken shit their priority. CCP evidently doesn't agree. We EVE players see spaceships as if it should be CCP's central focus, and CCP sees spaceships as but one part of a larger Science Fiction multi-game MMO universe, with DUST and I suspect other game ideas in the works to build on that.Everyone who plays EVE is going to agree that CCP should be making fixing all the broken shit their priority. CCP evidently doesn't agreeAs an advertiser i can attest the value of the so called \"Human Factor\" to create an empathy towards x or y issue.\ne.g.:  <---- The clown it's there and it's for that very same reason.\n\nMotivation is the main factor i see Incarna as a Plus.\n\nOriginally Posted by Hratli Smirksthe day eve start crackling, that day u will see EVE going F2P and micro transaction shit... which is basically what DUST is planned to be.\n\nWriting that last line i just got a Chilly feeling on my back thinking how easily some elements of the incarna stuff could be turned intro a micro-transaction business model...\n\nChanging the color on powers wasn't really an issue or highly sought after thing. I never heard it brought up until City of Villains' releaseno other mmo in existance is anything like eve tho and ccp have pushed out the pr as such, the line \"reap what you sow\" comes to mind they have made such a song and dance about it thats its now what the community expects of them. read my blog on here if you want, its probably been poorly wrote but my first ever blogPlease point to where I said I wished CCP were more like those other developers.\n\nAs I remember, without going back and reading through what I typed, I mentioned other developers being able to push out code and launch a game, I said nothing about them being superior.\n\nOriginally Posted by HandofSatanAion did 300 v 300 very well to the point where there would be upwards of over 2-3000 in the abyss fighting over siged castles. Was it fun? not really... Laggy as hell and due to a memory leak on launch had crashing issues. This was patched within a month of launch then they did a graphics patch within 4 months of launch that further enhanced large siege warfare in Aion. too bad the rest of the game sucked and nobody stuck around for the grind fest.\n\nNow, something you seem to forget is what CCP advertises and what players demand. Anyone who has been in a fleet lately (last couple months) will attest to constant gate lag and poor, overall system performance. Far worse than that was with the launch of Dominion. The current state of 0.0 is pretty rough as is empire where the last mission I did in a wasn't much better where waiting ~2 seconds for weapons to respond is kinda retarded. All my friends in null sec do nothing but complain about the lag, how fleets while running away from enemies who out number them, will get caught due to the traffic control and lose a ship. Yeah... I know... spam through...\n\nThese are in fleets of 20-40 people. Not large cap fleets... small roaming gangs. We're talking 50-100 in a system and the game is unplayableFleet lag affects those 1200 guys in XX-X and basically every fleet and gang fight on down. Also, if you spend a lot of time talking up the 0.0 as the crown jewel of your \"emergent gameplay\" advertising campaign, it shouldn't be a complete shitbox. Basically without 0.0 EVE has to rely on station games and mission running to grab headlines"

Despite the best efforts of our group leader, I just can't get my head around the battery rules.\nA) you use them to reinforce the shields, but the power to do so can come from other sources against multiple volleys?\nB) You can use them to preload your weapons before the game even if doing so requires more power than your batteries can generate?\nC) A ship with no warp power, 4 impulse points and 4 batteries could move at a baseline speed of 8?\nD) According to 1D4, unused power carries over to the next turn up to the number of un-disabled batteries --even if the batteries were not discharged?\nHow wrong am I? Or worse, how right am I? _________________ Being disintegrated makes me angry\nVERY angry indeed\n\nA) Yes, any source up to the number of undisabled batteries for each volley, as long as you have unspent energy tokens.\nB) Yes.\nC) Depending on the movement cost, yes. A ship with a move cost of one could move 8 for one turn only, and then would have to move only 4, or spend a turn recharging the batteries.\nD) Power carries over only if the batteries have been emptied during the turn, and only up to the number of empty, undisabled batteries you have. i.e. you can never carry over more power than the number of working batteries you have. _________________\n\nYou're almost right.\nA) Since energy allocation is pay as you go, if you have unspent power you can use it to reinforce shields against incoming damge, but only up to the number of undamaged battery boxes per volley and only if you have shield boxes remaining in that arc.\nAssume the vernerable Fed CA (36 power, 4 batteries and 30 boxes on the #1 shield).\nYou spend 24 energy for base speed 24 and you've preloaded your photons, leaving you with 12 power.\nA D7 fires disruptors at you at range 14 and throws in 3 phaser 1s for good measure. Perfect rolls menas that 21 points hit you. You spend 4 power [leaving 8] to reinforce against the volley so you now have 1 points of damage to deal with.\n1 burns through the shields and 16 boxes are disabled, leaving 14 boxes.\nNext impulse, his 2 drones strike the #1 shield (you should have turned!) for a combined total of 24 more points. You again reinforce for 4 (leaving 4) and reduce the volley to 20 points. 16 take out the shield and you score 4 internals...and the DAC roll is a four. [the third result is a battery, leaving 3].\nNow, along comes a D6 and his drone impacts on teh next impulse.\nIf it hits the #1 shield, you're SOL. You have no shield boxes, so you can't reinforce. If you could turn to take it on teh #2 shield (which still has 24 boxes) you could reinforce, but only for 3 points as you only have 3 batteries remaining.\n\nB) Yes. Again, assume the vernerable CA. By sacrificing your 4 points of battery power on Turn 1, you can start with 8 points of pre-load power in four Photons.\nBut this isn't always a good thing... see Commodore Patrick Doyle extensive tactics notes on the subject.\n\nC) Only if you have movement cost one ship, and only if the batteries were charged at the beginning of the turn. In Federaiton Commander, power is power. Generating source does not matter.\n\nD) Remember, power is power. You start the turn with fully charged batteries in your CA (That's 40 points of power - 36 generated and 4 battery). Throughout the turn, you use 32 points, leaving you 8 points during end of turn. It doesn't matter where it came from... you can put 4 of it into the batteries for the next turn.\nIf you spend 38 points during Turn 2, then you can transfer 2 points into the batteries for turn 3 and begin that turn with 38 total power (36 generated plus 2 batteries charged atthe end of turn 2)\n\nYour primary problem is that you are thinking of batteries in terms of how SFB uses them. In Federation Commander, they work totally different.\n\nAt the start of the turn, you figure out how much power you have available that turn. You count all of your non-battery power boxes together, and add in the batteries if they have carried power over from last turn. If this is the first turn, batteries are assumed to have carried power over from \"Turn 0\". (Subject to the (4C2c) first turn overloads.) Once the power available is determined, it is just \"power\", regardless of where it came from or how it was stored/generated.\n\nDuring the turn, your available power is just \"power\". It doesn't matter where the power \"came from\". When doing shield reinforcement, you are not using \"battery power\" (like you would in SFB). Rather, batteries simply serve as the determinant of how much power can be used to reinforce a shield for any given volley. The reinforcement does \"come from batteries\"; batteries are just the limit for how much reinforcement can be done.\n\nAt the end of the turn, batteries allow you to \"carry over\" power to the next turn. So, if you have four undisabled batteries, you may \"carry over\" up to four remaining points of power to the next turn. Since batteries cannot generate power, the power has to be present at the end of the turn to carry it over to the next turn. Again, this is a very different mindset from what was done in SFB.\n\nAs to the specific questions, ...\nKrellex does perfect on A-C. (On B, part of the point is that you are getting \"free\" energy in the deal.) For D, keep the above in mind on how batteries work. _________________\nFederation Commander Answer Guy\n\nThanks all. Yes, I figured there was a bit of SFB un-learning to do. It's just one of those things I thought I knew, so I just skimmed over it when I read the rules Live and learn.

      "text": "Yes, larger burst. The Siege does more DPS and has a higher refire rate, but the Bomber does more damage in one shot, which can be useful. The Bomber is also quicker and more heavily armed, and the shorter range can be an asset - it makes it more of a fleet ship for dealing with big things approaching whatever blob(s) I have out. If you really want to get bleeding-edge there's also the fact that Bombers, being closer to their target, have less of a shot travel time, but I think that's rather edge-case.\n\nI really don't see any reason to get Bomber Starships until your Siege is capped out or you have a massive surplus of metal but not crystal. Bombers may be \"more\" durable, but they're still rather frail. They do similar damage per volley, but the Siege fires far more rapidly. Siege Starships can take targets of opportunity easier. They can take out guard posts without eating retaliation easier. Bombers are also terrible with using transports. The only thing the Bomber does any better is get shot at, and if you want a damage sponge go for a Zenith or Spire.\n\nThey need their reload chopped down to make them comparable to Siege, or they need their alpha beefed up so that they can at least surpass Siege as a hit and run ship. Maybe a damage mod against either Starships or Structures to give them a focused role. As it is, trying to hit an Mk3+ world they're almost as glass as Siege, do less damage than Siege, take more damage than Siege due to range, same as Siege for alpha and hit and run, and worse with transports than Siege.\n\nI'm looking at the Siege as the \"Trebuchet\" (insane range, glass-cannon, slow) and the Bomber Starship as the \"Battering Ram\" (point-blank, tough-as-nails, relatively-fleet-of-foot). I think the Bomber could stand to have some buffs to have much higher survivability and to bring actual dps more in like with the siege, though not necessarily to equality. But I've been listening to these discussions to see if there was anything feasible that would be more interesting than just having them both be \"bash things\". But it's not the end of the world to have them just be very different forms of bash-things.\n\nI think a good way to differentiate them might be to give the Siege a railgun-type or beam-type weapon instead of its slow projectile - Sieges have a for-all-intents-and-purposes-infinite range weapon but it takes a long time to travel. It's part of the reason I find Bombers more feasible, IMO - they're far closer and, as such, their shots have less travel time. If the Seige's gun was quicker, it could even potentially use a slightly lower damage shot with a slightly lower-damage reload time. This gives the Seige a more constant stream of DPS compared to the Bomber, but gives the Bomber more burst damage, further cementing their roles as support/fleet ships.\n\nOf course, they're still both \"bash things\" (most ships are - this is a war-themed game after all), but this does differentiate them, or at least make them better at particular types of bashing.\n\nStop Comparing Bomber Starships to Sieges , They have Nothing in Common.\n\nTo those Complaining about Sieges Being Better : Watch out for the Resource Cost and Single Shot Damage , The bomber Starship Wins at those , And so Does Close Range , Major Ship Destruction , Chasing Things down , Lone Wolfing , Assault Force Leading , Battle Extension , Flanking , Etc etc etc\n\nIn Short : Bomber Starships Dominate at Close Range , While Sieges Do the Medium to Long range Slaughtering\n\nI think a good way to differentiate them might be to give the Siege a railgun-type or beam-type weapon instead of its slow projectile\n\nI actually rather like the lumbering shot effect. If anything, I think I'll have it use the Artillery-Golem's shot (not the Artillery Guardian, the Golem) or something like that. The idea is that it's some massive and slow plasma torpedo or something, and but if it hits you it hurts\n\nQuote\n\nOf course, they're still both \"bash things\" (most ships are - this is a war-themed game after all), but this does differentiate them, or at least make them better at particular types of bashing.\n\nRight, but specifically I mean that they're almost exactly the same thing in terms of damage: raw damage, no bonuses.\n\nFor heavier and higher mark guard posts my buddy has been using bombers as escorts for the siege starships.\n\nThen when they all enter the target system, siege and bombers go after one target. This way if the target isn't destroyed by the siege ships but only needs a couple more shots, the bombers will get the job done.\n\nIn my little newbie experience so far (so feel free to ignore my input ^^), the Siege S. is better than the Bomber S., but saying i have tried every strategy with both ships would be a lie .\n\nEven with 2x Health and 15x Armor Bomber S. dies 10x faster than Siege in destroying non mobile threats (playing against 2x AI-7 Zenith Descendants at the moment). In this case 38k range defeats increased Health+Armor+Speed in survivability at least, Bomber S. having to get real close to the target.\n\nIn a non micro way, group moving them with you fleet is a complete waste of their great speed, so it would seem to me they need a bit of micro to take advantage of them.\n\nIf i decide to raid an enemy system next to mine to get rid of some specific structure, i think Siege would still be better, at least (unless they are heavily Anti-Artillery, but I didn't try this enough to reach any kind of definitive conclusion). PS: AT least, again, in survivability, still don't know who would get the faster kill, taking in acount SS has a Cap. of 5 BB 4.\n\nSiege S. can also safely start pounding on enemy Force Fields while my main force gets rid of the immediate mobile threats.\n\nBomber S. has great speed that allows rapid intervention in case of \"oh crap an enemy biggy is chewing the health of my command center at an alarming rate 4 hops from where i am!\"\n\nAnd as a matter of resource cost, a ship that has a higher survivability is cheaper than a ship that costs the same and dies often (costs of both ships are mirrored I know SS being 4k/60k vs 60k/4k for BS ).\n\nBomber Starships don't need research unlock (interesting question would be, would you research them if they were initially locked?) so I'll continue to make them if I'm not short on resources, but I will still always build Siege Starships first.Logged\n\nIdeas? Suggestions? Concerns? Bugs to be squashed? Report them on the Mantis Bugtracker!You just pointed out the disadvantage of the Siege: they need significant protection. This means you either need to \"sterilize\" the target planet before bringing in your siege or do a lot of micro protecting it. The bomber starship has neither of those disadvantages.\n\nEh? I said they need to be well positioned. As in, the way someone might position artillery units in supcom. Because they outrange anything that can deal damage to them, they die less than bomber starships.\n\nYou're coming off as really defensive when you say \"deal with it\", and I have no idea what your crystal/metal statement is supposed to mean - and your survivability comeback is assuming perfect or near-perfect gameplay. Yes, the best way to assure ships don't take damage is to assure they don't take damage? It's kind of like saying \"just die less\" in an FPS - every once in a while you're going to eat a rocket and respawn, and every once in a while you're going to lose a starship or two.\n\nkeith: what if Siege got some kind of secondary, fleet-supporting effect? Tweak their damage down a bit/give Bombers a bit more and maybe cut down Bomber armor/health. Then give the Sieges something like, I dunno, a small force field. Makes a group of Sieges harder to take out (since you could arrange their FFs to overlap) and gives them a bit more survivability/versatility. They're too slow for the rapid-response/interdiction role the Bomber can fill, so the Siege can serve as a more defensive/long-term attack role."

      "text": "Author\nTopic: Cloaker starships ignore group move? (Read 343 times)\n\nI'm trying to use a Cloaker Starship to escort some Spire Rams for a side mission, but it seems to ignore the group move order and tears off, leaving my Rams behind, uncloaked. It does have the blue outline that signifies group move. Is it supposed to do this? Am I using this ship incorrectly?\n\nedit: I think this is the behavior when moving on your home systems, so the cloaker can 'predeploy' in a hostile system? And in hostile systems, it correctly group moves?\n\nI think that there is a bug with group move and speed boosts(Like those prevented by friendly command centers) working with units immune to speed boosts. But it may have been fixed in the upcoming version:\n\n* Fixed some longstanding (since introduction of group move trying to handle immune-to-speed-boosting units) bugs with group move: + ** Previously, for example, a speed-boostable 140-speed unit group-moving with a non-speed-boostable 152-speed unit would result in the boostable ship going 152, and the non-boostable ship going 140 (_below_ its normal speed!). This was because the non-boostable one was taking the minimum speed of it's boostable friends, and then setting its speed limit as if those friends were not actually boostable. + *** This bug has been captured, stuffed, and placed in the museum. It couldn't get away fast enough. + ** Thanks to HellishFiend and Spikey00 (among others) for reporting."

      "text": "Clan Wolverine would come out of hiding. They would strike and take back Terra. They would continue to push the clans out of IS. They would recruit IS freeborn mechwarriors to pilot their 2nd line mechs. They would then push the plans back to Strana Mechty. Everyone will ask how on earth did they manage that. Clan Wolverine is basically combining Feds and the Commonwealth together without the fighting between children. Besides they the Khan will be preparing to meet the other clans in battle. They will be producing mechs and tech as quickly as possible. They will get their revenge. LOL That is my theory like the Soviet/German WWII reference.\nPerhaps, before the war made it to Terra, the SI would have started a \"Scorched Earth\" policy.\nI also think that the IS forces would have eventually dropped their reluctance to use Nukes.\n\nMaybe, Victor Steiner-Davions consolidation of the IS forces into a reborn Star-League would have led to a behind the front lines counter-strike similiar to MacArthurs turning the tide in Korea during the 50's, instead of Operation Bulldog/Serpent still feel the Clans would have had the edge in such a battle, but how much is impossible to tell. No doubt they would have required reinforcements from the homeworld Clans to garrison outer rim planets so they could devote more troops to the action on Terra. As for the Comstar Jihad, that would never exist. Terra was Comstar's headquarters until Blakist separatists took it over. Given the battle that would have ensued, most of the resources for the Jihad would have been lost in the conflict. I find it far more likely that regardless of the victor, both the Clans and the Great Houses are decimated after such a conflict, and could give rise to a Fifth Succession War that reaches the levels of desperation seen in the Second Succession WarYou forget that the Word of Blake was not formed until AFTER Tukayyid. If such a battle for Terra were to occur, no doubt large portions of Comstar resources would be called to defend it. Comstar made it clear they wanted to defend Terra once it became known that it was the Clans primary objective. Blakist's only received help from the FWL AFTER their split from Comstar.\n\nIn fact if there is no Tukayyid, Anastasius Focht might not learn of Myndo Waterly's plan to bring the Inner Sphere under the rule of Comstar and therefore never assasinates him. Waterly would see Terra as the key to claiming dominion over the Houses and therefore most likely would have committed the bulk of his forces to defense.\n\nTerra would become a battle for the soul of the Inner Sphere between the Clans and Comstar.\n\n****Does anyone else feel like this would have been a much more awesome scenario than the Jihad?? Suppose after the FedCom Civil war ends, a new invasion force of Homeworld Clans makes it's own invasion corridors outside of the Falcon and Ghost Bear occupation zones. It resumes the race for Terra among all the Clans. Comstar and the Blakists, who HAD been planning a Jihad, see this as an opportunity to weaken the Houses for their rule. While Steel Vipers, Coyotes, Hell's Horses, Wolves, Falcons, and a few other Clans start tearing apart the Lyran Commonwealth and Draconis Combine, Comstar and Blakists reunite and reclaim Terra and its surrounding planets to brace for the coming assault. The Clans ferocity and desperation to get to Terra first leads to hoards of infighting and ultimately sparks hostilities that lead to the War of Reaving later on. After two of the Great Houses are devastated while the others suffer major losses, the Clans arrive at Terra. Comstar/Blake begin waging an epic defense against the Clan onslaught, both sides knowing the victor can claim rule over the Inner Sphere. The FWL, Cappellan Confederation, and Federated Suns send the remainder of their forces to Terra in order prevent either of the fanatical factions from winning the engagement. Boom, there's your new history****\n\nBut, really, we know this would never come to pass. Even if the Clans threw everything they had at a drive straight toward Terra, they would have the Fedcom and Combine units squeezing them on the sides, and Marik units would be pushing back from the other side. Considering Thomas Marik's connections to ComStar, I should like to think he would never stand to see Terra conquered by the Clans, at any cost.\n\nAnd then you have the vast reserves of Star League mechs, vehicles, battle armor, etc. that ComStar has stockpiled in their underground facilities on Terra (which, btw, is the most heavily industrialized planet in the Inner Sphere). I have never seen any exact figures on the numbers, but I have little doubt they are very impressive.\n\nLast but not least, even after their initial experience fighting against the IS forces, the Clans still did not understand how to fight protracted battles at this point. They were still learning the art of 'war to the knife', but the IS forces had been perfecting this art for the past few hundred years; it was second-nature to them.\n\nWell an invasion by the homeworld clans is pretty much going to happen. I just feel very sorry for whoever gets stuck with the Combine and Rasalhague Dominion as their invasion corridor. They're going to be like a piece of soft metal between a hammer and an anvil.\n\nAlright, enough of the: This side would do this or that. Let's focus on the Clan point of view. Ignoring warnings from Clan Wolf via Wolf's Dragoons reports that the Inner Sphere was NOT a bunch of cavemen, that they were redeveloping star league era tech, and though split, the houses had realatively steady borders. The Clan ASSUMED many things based on what they saw of the inner sphere when they left, and what happened when they arrived and settled in the systems around Strana Mechty. When they arrived at what became their homeworld - this righteous legion of warriors leaving the inner sphere to keep themselves from being used to destroy everything, they realized they had way too many warriors and not enough farmers, butchers, mechanics, teachers, whatever. The Kerenskys disarmed most of the warriors and gave them new jobs so the society could function. What happens? The kill each other, because bored warriors don't know what else to do, and they brought their inner sphere prejudices with them. So Lyrans fought Kuritans and so on. Nicholas Kerensky (Alexander's kid) has a vision, grabs a loyal cohort of warriors, and kicks everyone's butts and tells them to get back to work. He divides them into clans, where he mixes and matches people so all the ethnicities are mixed up and rendered irrelevant, this includes taking away all the warrior's last names. The only last names that exist are those names of the people who fought with Kerensky to reunite his people, and he says 25 people (he likes multiples of 5) can EARN each last name (bloodnames) if they can prove their heritage back to these warriors. This is typically proven easily as warriors are born via iron wombs of already mated bloodnamed genestock.\n\nAnyway, they build this new utopia, based on a caste system with warriors on top. They are the few, the elite, and the whole society is geared toward 1. supporting the warriors. 2. learning and building new technologies/sciences and 3. letting society prosper through trade. In a strange honor system that includes bidding, commanders bid the lowest number of troops against other commanders to accomplish their objective - essentially garaunteeing the least amount of total damage done. The idea is to preserve life by not having everyone go into all-out war to solve their differences. Trials replace warfare, where if one clan has a beef with, or wants something from another, they challenge the other and then they have what is sort of the equivelant of a jousting contest of their best mechwarriors against each other to prove right through might. There is an elected clan counsel. The Ilkhan (I L K han) is the elected leader in times when the clans must unite.\n\nBTW, old people, and old warriors are mostly thrown to the wind. 40 is old to pilot a battlemech. 45 is ancient. Even though they have great health, they consider 20-35, 15 years, a typical amount of time that a person is in their prime and useful to the war machine. (Other castes live to old age.) So, 300 years pass. That's 20 generations of forgetting the past and living in their utopian NOW. All they know of the inner sphere is pre-exodus stuff. (The clans, then the Star League Defense Force, left the inner sphere = the Exodus)\n\nThey assume that the inner sphere is on the edge of total self-destruction. The only contact they have is spying on periphery planets, which are basically the wild-west, lawless frontier of known space.\n\nThe Clans are politically divided by the 31st Century. Clan Wolf gets smart and sends spies in (Wolf's Dragoons) to check out what the inner sphere is up to by fighting for all the houses as a merc unit. But the Dragoons are kind of left hanging out to dry and their reports are mostly disregarded as they contradict what the home-bound clanners see in the periphery. The truth is, the Inner Sphere is raising to the hieghts of technology to match the once Utopian Star League (One-World/Unite Nations Order), and though no one can agree on which noble house has legitimate claim to the thrown of the Star League, the 5 great houses (plus the Swedes in the Galactic North) are mostly not killing each other. Two of the larger houses have even formed one big house. (Steiner and Davion married into each other's families and created the Federated Commonwealth out of their two states.)\n\nThe Crusader political faction in the Clans said, yeah, right. We are the rightful inheritors of Terra/Earth and the throne. Our society is great, and the inner sphere just doesn't realize it yet, but they will when we go bring on the pain, and forcefully convert them to our way of life. The Wardens saw it as their job to safegaurd humanity and knowledge in general, and if the Inner Sphere WASN'T going to implode, they should stay out of there. The Crusaders (dumb kids - remember, 35 is old/used up and 20 is when mechwarriors are at their peak, and they know better - yeah right....) think they know better and outnumber/outvote the rest of the clans, choose and IlKhan (war-chief) and go off to prove it.\n\nThe clan that reaches Earth and takes it over first, wins the race, and the ilKhan is forever on supposed to be from that clan. Then they would work to enlighten the inner sphere by bringing them all their cool technology, culture, and restore the star league in the clan's image.\n\nSO.... What happens if the Clans take Terra?\n\nThey put their plan into effect. However, the clans are full of dimwitted young people (20 year old neo-fascists) who think they know how 200 planets who have previously lived under a stereotypical Japanese culture (Kurita) should live. With or without infighting, the clans could not OCCUPY the whole inner sphere. They would be spread thin, even if they did knock out all the House capitols, and the majority of the people would rise up, actively or passively, to make life difficult for the clanners. Not only that, but once the clanners get out of their battlemechs and see that there are a variety of equally decent ways to live, they will question themselves.\n\nSo, yeah, it will be a civil war in the inner sphere and in the end, everyone would lose. The Houses and the Clans probably would set back human progress by a hundred years or more, and in the end, people would adopt their old or new culture and form bigger governments until each new empire hit it's max size and the inner sphere would be reborn.\n\nThe Wardens, btw, typically were kinder to the inner sphere people they conquered. The Wardens saw themselves as protectors, and the Crusaders were conquerers. True, they were more alike than different, but their attitudes toward some subjects differed. (Like the Republicrats and Demuplicans. When placed on the world stage of poltical platforms, they are far more similar than they ever would admit to, but they are all Americans who basically value the same things - just differ on how things should be set up and worked out. Too bad Americans are idiots. - and yes, I am proud to be an American! Wave the Stars and Bars, I mean stars and stripes forever! Blah, blah, blah...)\n\nBut, back to the OP. To summarize: This has all happened before, and it will all happen again until we all agree that the force is with us, and we should live long and prosper.\n\n(Things to support my arguments.)\n\n1. Smoke Jaguar, most aggressive and short sighted clan - who I love most - was ripped to shreds by a reborn Star League Defense Force because they were considered the scariest clan. (F*** YEAH! Take that, stravag inbreeds...)\n2. Clan Wolf made friends with the people they conquered. Rasalhague fell without a shot being fired. Why? Because both the Vikings and the Wolves valued each other's lives over politics.\n3. Jade Falcon. the tradition keepers, and Crusaders had a tough time. They are smart, but are bogged down by their ignorance of how to deal with people not of their uber-reich. They do kick butt when they need to, but have terrible people skills and so they trip up on domestic issues.\n4. Clan Ghost Bear, the other Wardens of the original four clans, realized they didn't know what they were doing and let the Rasalhague basically self-govern, with them holding the power over the military. The Vikings serve under a pretty free thinking self-government, and the Ghost Bear have become rather passive. They pushed to their REASONABLE limit and consolodated.\n5. Nova Cat, a latecomer in the invasion, actually MERGES with the Draconis Combine, as a minority group, and they join the Star League Defense Force when the Star League is reborn. They are Wardens, and they stick to their POV that they are there to protect the people, not to conquer.\n6. Living in the Inner Sphere was too much for Clan Wolf and they got into a heated family argument, with the Jade Falcons butted into, saying that Clan Wolf messed up the invasion by being too forward thinking, practical, and benevolent. So, they fought and Clan Wolf is now two Clans (3067ish).\n\nIn a hundred years, the clans would be looked at as a large group of violent immigrants who eventually realized everyone was really human, trueborn or not, and remain as a bunch of really proud ethnic minorities.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nI do agree that it would be interesting if MWO was bound by canon only up to the beginning of play, and we could play out the clan wars, and succession wars, as player-controlled factions, but with balances thrown in (mostly supply lines, planetary complicity/rebellion levels, etc.) and see how the Inner Sphere would look after 5 years of the clan invasion. If the further you went from your power base, the harder it was to field and mantain troops, the map would be constanty changing, but never totally dominated by one faction, even if they outnumbered others player-wise.\n\nBut that's a topic for another post. (RE: project Genesis which is an example of a partially complete system like the one I'm talking about.)\n\nOkay, steps down, puts soap box back in the pickup, and heads on to the next town.....\n\nThis is a fun \"what if\" scenario, but I don't see it ending well for the clans. Assuming we are starting from a point in time directly before Tukayyid, we have to consider the following factors working against the Clans.\n\n*The Clans are still led by ilKhan Ulric Kerensky. This was obviously a bad manuver for the crusader faction since Ulric was more than cunning enough to use the Clans factionalism against them while Clan Wolf made the greatest in roads into the Inner Sphere. When has it ever been a good idea to appoint a person who doesn't want war as a war leader?\n\n*Clan Smoke Jaguar in particular was already having problems maintaining their momentum. This is a result of their supply and manufacturing shortages that also prompted their protomech program. The inclusion of the Nova Cats to their corridor help to allieve the problem, but their steadfast refusal to use freeborn warriors even in a garrison setting, heavy hand in dealing with conquered I.S. people meant, along with their small garrison forces meant they had to reconquer their worlds quite often. This problem, along with their manufacturing issues, means they probably would not have been able to participate in a battle for Terra.\n\n*The Clan's supply lines were already stretched at this point, most of the invading Clans, notably Clans Wolf and Smoke Jaguar, had not taken advantage of the industrial capacity of their conquered worlds and instead were relying on supplies being shipped to them from the homeworlds. This problem would have only been exacerbated as the drove deeper into the Inner Sphere.\n\n*The Federated Commonwealth, and frankly all of the Successor States, dwarfed the Clans when it came to production, men, and material. At the beginning of WWII, Germany did not want the U.S. brought into the war because of our potential industrial capacity. When the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, their Admiral stated they had awakened the sleeping dragon. We went on to out produce every other country in that war and could have won through attrition alone. The Clans facing a united Inner Sphere front would have been ground down. This is made evident through how much the Inner Sphere was able to mobilize in the one year the Clans halted their invasion to elect a new ilKhan.\n\n*The best of the Clans faced Comstar and lost on the back water world of Tukayyid. Imagine a single Clan being the first to reach Terra with all of its defenses and having to face the Comguards there instead. Even the Clans naval assets wouldn't have been an advantage there considering the hidden fleets of ships used by Comstar and later the WoB.\n\n*Speaking of the Word of Blake, all of the assets they had had mustered to fight Comstar and the rest of the Inner Sphere was still largely part of Comstar at this point. The Manei Domini were a hidden asset within Comstar that even the primus was not aware of, but push come to shove, I believe they would have fought a Jihad style war against the Clans if it became evident the Clans were going to reestablish the Star League instead of them. Granted, they probably would have nuked and poisoned every Clan held world along with their former I.S. poulations if they had to, but the Clans would have been at a big disadvantage in the face of the onslaught the Inner Sphere faced in the 3070's.\n\nI think its more possible that Comstar starts to collapse if the Clans are able to destroy even the Inner circle, and Im sure they have the power to do so. And imagine... with comstar collapse the Inner sphere would be blind for a short while, and then the houses would try to use the moment to capture the HPGs, with many of them destroyed by the Blakist themselves (Im sure). after that they gained a crippled HPG network and fighting against themselves for the remaining hubs and best pieces of that network, because for the Inner Sphere information means their survival.\nAll clans have their own HPG's rendering them indipendent from any interfierence of comstar or their network.\n\nBut Im not sure about the Jihad, if comstar is broken and conquered by the houses, Im sure the secret Word of Blake wouldn't rise, they would fear to loose too much of their own tech or if they do soo, even more cripple the housesNow, hypothetically say the Clans some how managed to stay alive through the combined might of the Great Houses and ComStar. The Clans would be hard pressed to replenish their losses fast enough while the full industrial machine of the entire IS is dumping men, women, Mechs, and all manner of war materials on Terra. The Clans will not last. Its simply impossible for them to take Terra.\n\nThe clans didn't win Tukayyid because of two things. First they bid away their forces because they didn't respect the IS pilots/ComGuard pilots. Second is they were not prepared for a long term battle. They fight like it is a duel between gentlemen, so they were unprepared for the guerrilla tactics use by Focht and the ComGuards. Focht knew how the clans thought and used it to his full advantage. If the clans were being ran by a IS general, who commanded all the clans armies like Focht, the clans would have rolled right on through. Now on to the theory part of the argument. Now if the clans still run by one IS general as the ilkhan, would move straight towards Terra. Some armies should move to attack deeper on the Combine and the Commonwealth. This should give the Terran army a chance to stand against ComGuards, Feds, League and Confederation. IS should bunker down and start factories up and start using Freeborn pilots as garrison units. Basically Turtle on Terra until Commonwealth and the Combine fall to the clans. It could be done with the right military mindset.\n\nNot to contradict a fellow member of the Sea Wolves but that argument makes no sense. The clans lost on Tukayyid because of how they fought, not superior forces (also the Jade Falcons got a draw, they were not \"steamrolled\"). The ilKhan wanted the clans to loose so he did not advise them to adjust tactics, while he had his Wolves on the other hand decimate Anastasius Fochts Comstar forces and even tells him afterwards, that his is how it could have went (basicly). Not to mention that there were another 10 or so clans waiting in the wings. The Comguard are not that elite it was only because of Anastasius Fochts tactics that they were able to stand up against the clans. Also it was no where near the full might of the clans, They bid down to what they had, if the clans had ever released their \"Full might\" they would have absolutely torn then whole IS into shreds. Also what industrial machine? The IS can barely manufacture Gauss rifles until half way through the clan invasion. Where as the clans have their entire infrastructure in tact and completely unthreatened, All they would need to do is call in a couple more clans to secure the lines and they could easily take hold and assimilate. I mean seriously half of the populated planets are ruled by corrupt/dictorial regimes, the citezens aren't going to be throwing themselves at Omni-mechs as long as they can go about their livesFact? The Clans lost one fight against Comstar, and lost is a debatable term. Clan Wolf took both its objectives, Ghost Bear took one, and the Falcons managed a draw.\n\nYou ignore the fact that the Clans underbid and Comstar still sufferred 40% FATALITY RATE among its warriors.\n\nI don't get why everyone on here keeps referring to the Clans as mindless barbarians. They managed to avoid the same fate as the Inner Sphere and developed unparalleled technology. It shows a clear bias towards the Clans rather than thinking logically about the scenario.\n\nIn fact the only three planets I can remember directly of the Clans actually losing an engagement are Wolcott, Luthien, and Tukayyid. Three planets. That is number of planets successfully defended by the Inner Sphere during the invasion. Three. There might be a few more, but it still is a marginal number compared to the hundred or so worlds that fell to the Clans.\n\nTukayyid was fought because Comstar \" in no way wanted to see Terra, humanities birthplace, torn asunder by an enormous battle the likes of which the planet had not seen since 2777\" Comstar knew the Great Houses were helpless against the Clans, and was actually feeding them intel to further along the invasion. They KNEW that unless they intervened, the Clans would reach their objective. They also knew that unless they brokered the proxy fight, Terra would have been a bloodbath. Comstar gambled at Tukayyid and threw in all its chips.\n\nTukayyid was fought with 144 regiments for Comstar and 25 Galaxies for the Clans. A regiment carries between 108 to 180 mechs. A Galaxy contains approximately 3-5 Clusters, or 250 mechs.\n\nComstar fought with approximately 21600 mechs, while the Clans engaged with only 6250. Remember that 40% fatality rate? Given the losses Comstar suffered, it is clear the Clans were superior warriors. Comstar just won by taking advantage of their tactical weaknesses, noncooperation, and style of warfare. Clan Wolf won because they knew how to actually fight a war. Yes, the Clans hubris would have deterred the success of their campaign. But to ignore their clear combat superiority is rather ignorant.\n\nLaorDeLove is correct. If the Clans were run by an Inner Sphere general, they would have steamrolled Comstar into oblivion. Clan Wolf realized this, and hence saw success. It is not unlikely that had the invasion continued, Clan Wolf would have been the first to reach Terra, and therefore the best equipped to combat its defenders.\n\nI won't say that either Comstar or the Clans would have won such an engagement, because it is hard to determine how many Clans would have been involved, the tactics that would have been used, and the fanaticism that would have driven the Clans to capture their holy grail. If there is no Tukayyid, it is hard to not see the Clans reaching their main objective.\n\nI can't even imagine the success of the invasion had more than 4 of the 18 remaining Clans participated. 4 Clans took on the Inner Sphere and kicked it's rear. Imagine if you threw in another 12???"

      "text": "Progress Report: Strangely, with my hurry to get as much done as possible before summer sets in, Episode 5 is already more than halfway complete. Data and tactical maps are in, as is 95% of the post game content; really, the only things left are the final encounter and ending sequences. Looks like I'll be able to polish it up a bit before its late July release date after all. Speaking of which, here is a brief list of things I want to add but am making absolutely no guarantee that I will before the next episode, so stay your pitchforks:\n\nRight now, there is no difference in a Quality 1 X-Type property protection and a Quality 10 one. I would like to add an additional defense boost to the type (either Hull, Systems, or Pilot) for higher quality ones. This wouldn't be retroactive, and I can't guarantee that it will be plausible, but it's something I will consider.\n\nSpeaking of defenses, it seems like defense stats start meaning less and less after about Episode 2 as enemy skill levels get higher and higher. I might retool the damage formula - if not for enemies, then at least for player defenses. It's a dangerous move this late in the game's lifecycle, but it might be a necessary one.\n\nI promised an e-bro that I'd see into making a \"sticky\" cursor in battle that remembered and automatically selected your last weapon choice. I had this half-working, but a quirk in the processing events means I'd have to inject a fix into every battle map in the game (of which there are probably around 50). I'll also have to make a kiosk to let the player turn it on or off. Maybe I'll get to that eventually?\n\nI also wanted to add a menu option in the tactical screen to pop up the mission objective as a reminder. However, some missions have objectives that change halfway through, and any that have special objectives usually have a counter or some other interface-based reminder on-screen anyway, so this one is kind of low priority.\n\nLastly, a couple of folks asked about a \"low performance\" mode that removed flourishes like scrolling backdrops and whatnot. Kind of a slog to implement, but feasible. I'll see what I can do.\n\nSince the dawn of Unix time, weapons have been the most common \"interface\" to the game world by far. Almost every game ever made has been rooted in a primal desire to kill, or destroy, or stomp, or trap in a tiny bubble and pop. And because of this, the choice of or powering-up of weaponry is a staple gameplay element, if not the primary strategy itself. It's kind of strange to think about the conduit between the player's actions and the game world being distilled into one little white rectangle of pixels, but here we are. Sure, there might be secondary tools or abilities for situational use, but if you were to simplify all input to an Atari 2600's joystick, you better believe the lone action on that red button is gonna be \"attack.\"\n\nWhy, then, do so many RPGs play \"follow the leader\" with their weapon selections, as opposed to trying something new? It's actually kind of funny; the earliest RPGs expressed weapons in the simplest of terms: varying levels of \"attack power,\" whatever that means, and maybe accuracy too. Real-life weapons are situational, cultural, and completely pragmatic in their own ways, but few if any games really translate this into a strategically interesting manner.\n\nThe simplest handling of weapons is as I said before - \"attack power goes up.\" This is about as displaced from reality as you can get, but most of the time it's part of the adaptation of the escalation of power that many RPGs call \"progress.\" After all, shouldn't a solid gold sword worth 10,000 G's cut better than a steel one worth 1,000? It's all numbers. Numbers go up, player gets a mild euphoric rush that lasts until the next tier of enemies is encountered, and the cycle repeats. The weapon itself - a knight sword, a bo staff, a pair of kitchen knives - makes no discernible change on gameplay except for maybe a different combat animation or icon on the equipment screen. It's a name, a number, and a price, and that's it.\n\nThe next step up is forced diversity. Every character or character class specializes in exactly one type of weapon, but this is entirely for flavor, and all it means to the player is having to scroll down and buy one of each weapon instead of just buying 4 broadswords and moving on. This sort of goes hand-in-hand with the concept of weapon \"skills\" and \"specializations\" found in many western-style and strategy RPGs, but there is still no diversity to be had. Thieves use daggers, because the games in the previous generation deigned it so; the generic \"Attack\" command remains exactly as-is, regardless. Skill rating is just another number, and you're purposefully gimping yourself if you choose to wield a hammer instead.\n\nA slight step up from this is secondary effects on weapons. Maybe that hammer grants +1 to sneaking skill? Okay, it doesn't make much sense, but, magic! Unfortunately, the problem here is that these sorts of weapons tend to just amplify the effects of the classes they're meant for. You'll find daggers with +5% to Backstab skill, which are useless to everyone but thieves anyway, so any attempts at a creative loadout are stifled from the get-go, and you've got that \"illusion\" of diversity yet again which I've ranted upon numerous times. Skyrim is great fun, but it does this to a disturbing degree, even with armor. So, even though it's a supposedly classless system, you're already being railroaded into the plain vanilla prerequisite abilities of the fighter/mage/thief class system if you want to get the most out of your character.\n\nFinally, finally, we get to actual differences between different weapon classes, either in equipment restrictions or damage \"types.\" A two-handed sword means your forfeit a shield; everyone knows that. Unfortunately, this instance more often than not is reliant on whether the game's own balance means the difference in damage output is worth forfeiting blocking opportunities. Sometimes it is; sometimes it is not; the only way to know is trial and error, and by that point you've invested enough points into one branch or the other than you may regret your decision. Polearm weapons may have a lot more reach than daggers, but this is almost universally pointless; you'll get maybe one extra attack with that polearm before the enemy is up in your face (most AIs aren't ready to handle any actions more complex than \"rush in and attack\"), so the faster attack speed of the dagger basically trumps all. This is especially noticeable when damage caps are in play, especially by late-game - you will always, ALWAYS choose the weapon that gets more hits in per period, regardless of other factors. Ranged weapons meet a similar fate, almost always with damage reductions to compensate for the initial lack of danger (except for stealthy or \"snipe\" attacks).\n\nThen, there's the good old \"crush/edge/pierce\" weapon \"element\" triangle (guilty, of course). Weapons may innately be one of the three, and certain enemies will resist or be more vulnerable to certain types. However, in practice, this almost never makes an appreciable enough difference to be a consideration, and worse yet, sometimes designers may throw it in without really considering the weapons in play - knights almost always use swords, while healers almost always use crushing weapons, so if your only mace-wielding character is not suitable for melee combat, then that 25% boost in damage is going to be worthless anyway. It should be less of a balancing act and more of an integration into many factors of gameplay - the characters, the enemies, the weapon availability, and the sacrifice of a turn of attacking instead of doing some other action. Plus, when you get right down to it, it's still just a number. Granted, when I implemented such a triangle in TR, it was part of the philosophy of enemies being slightly randomized enough that there were many potential actions a player could take in a turn, but likely only one \"best\" action. Sometimes that may be clubbing a bug with a hard shell; sometimes that may be zapping it with lightning. The damage difference was significant enough to make it less of an afterthought. The Fire Emblem games mostly do this well, too.\n\nA subset of this is \"elemental\" weapons; they are generally useful for exactly one dungeon or boss fight, and never again, and there is usually maybe one weapon for each element in the entire game. Seems like an extreme waste of code to me, especially since I tend to just go non-elemental anyway for fear of getting caught with my pants down and inexplicably healing the enemy when attacking it. There is also the matter of \"enchanting\" weapons with elements, which is almost always a wasted action as well, except against particularly devious bosses.\n\nFinally, the top echelon of RPG weapons is almost exclusive to action RPGs - different weapons have different swing styles, speeds, reach, attack patterns, and (ugh) skills or finishing moves. The problem here - if you could call it that - is that it's less of a strategic choice and more of a playstyle preference. Some people like to exploit dodge mechanics and use huge, powerful strikes at a steady rate. Some people like to block and counter. Some people just \"kite\" enemies with arrows and never take a direct hit. Variety is always nice, but oddly enough, weapons within the genre itself have basically stagnated to the degree that any quirks or variances between titles are minor at best. And they still all achieve the same end - put out as much damage while taking as little as possible. Modern-setting games with projectile weapons are no different. The four or so weapons we got in Wolfenstein 3D have been repeated ad nauseum for 20+ years, and the subtle differences that designers incorporate for that \"realism\" sense aren't necessarily a good idea from a game design standpoint.\n\nIt's time for something new. If weapons aren't going to go all the way in making real-world sense, then, why keep repeating the same trick over and over? Is it gamer complacency? Ugh, gamers ruin everything. Anyway, why not have a light sword play different from a battle ax, either by way of \"Attack\" command or swinging animation? Why the oversimplification of \"damage versus defense\" as pure numbers? What if, when I miss with that ax swing, the blade gets embedded in the ground and I have to expend stamina pulling it out while being open to attack? Game balance seems to center around trade-offs, but right now those trade-offs seem to be \"attack speed versus attack power\" and that's it. The counterargument, I guess, is that gamers don't want to deal with micromanagement and just want to hammer on the R1 button. Demon's Souls and its followup get it half-right - weapons have distinct attack patterns that need to be learned and exploited, and doing something stupid like trying to use a huge two-hander inside of an enclosed tunnel just makes the blade bounce off the walls, which makes logical sense. Too bad the rest of the game amounted to NES-platformer style memorization, but it was a step in the right direction.\n\nSorry for such a long rant. I recently tried Gothic 3 off Gamefly, and immediately upon seeing the sword-swinging animation in that game and realizing that the developers thought \"yep, this is a high-quality production easily worth $60 USD\", I had to explore the issue in general and vent some. Maybe some day, I'll actually implement a design choice in one of my own games that runs counter to what I rant about on the internet!\n\nNext time: Stop saying you want to make an MMO, people! You have no idea what kind of pain you're about to bring upon yourselves!"

I 100% disagree.\n\nOf course you do.\n\nOriginally Posted by Vile rat\n\nI have more money than you, I should win god dammit!!\n\nYou guys have tons of isk and income you CHOOSE to spend it poorly. You also CHOOSE not to use the supercapitals you do have.\n\nOriginally Posted by Vile ratI think its pretty clear there is alot more going on. Spying , Misdirection , Skill + more expensive ships. You eagerly want to discount the time people spent to train for advanced ships or the effort it took to acquire said ships. Your agenda smells of \" Wanting to homogenize everything so that shear numbers and diplomacy always wins\".This would be fixed if CCP had changed the way aggression timers worked, so that if your ship was shootable (regardless of whether or not your character were logged in), if you got aggressed, that timer were reset.\n\nLog off without aggression, and that window is 30 seconds f.ex, but log off with aggression and that window is 15 minutes. If you're aggressed at any time during that timeperiod, the timer is reset to 15 minutes. In other words, get your ass safe before logging off, or go down like the bitch you are.\n\nSo the only PVP should be subcap vs subcap and the guy that brings the most will most likely win hey? You know there is other positions besides missionary?Actually, riddle me this: what was the role of a titan supposed to be? And what is it being used for today?\n\nI'll bite.\n\nThe original role of the titan was to allow a smaller group of players to use an ISK advantage to fight against massive blobs of Scrubs (i.e. Non supercaps).\nToday, titans are being used to allow a smaller group of players to use an ISK advantage to fight against massive blobs of Scrubs (i.e. Non supercaps).Biggest baddest motherfucking gunSadly supercaps aren't being neutered, just balanced. They should have a role to play just like every other ship, but their role shouldn't counter every other ship. Now supercaps will still be powerful, but they will require you to actually field a subcap fleet in supportSorry is it that hard to understand?\n\nThat's your reason? \"Every other PvP game has one\"?\n\ne: It is really hard to devise a comeback to what is basically \"Because, that's why!\"\n\n?\"eve's a bad mmo, really bad, it's only saving grace is the people playing it, which i guess doesn't say great things about the people playing other MMOs\"Why should a subcap fleet that's winning against supers ever bother jumping in supers? It is the log off mechanic, I agree, but it's a mechanic that only practically affects one class of ships, and it's a huge reason why there are so many running around (so no they're not fairly acquired, because they're still around when they should be dead). If not for the logoff mechanic, either the NC or the DRF would have lost all their supers in the first few fights, and AAA woulda killed off RA in Tenerifis.So how long does it take to train into a Gustav? How much does it cost to acquire in game? What game are we talking about? How much more effort must you put into acquiring a gustav than another gun?\n\n?\"eve's a bad mmo, really bad, it's only saving grace is the people playing it, which i guess doesn't say great things about the people playing other MMOs\"\n\nSo the only PVP should be subcap vs subcap and the guy that brings the most will most likely win hey? You know there is other positions besides missionary?\n\nLeaving aside the blatantstrawman, and your not very subtle attempt to insinuate the fallacy of the excluded middle (either Titans are awesome vs everything or else they're useless!!!)... how would that be worse than \"the only PvP should be supercap vs supercap and the guy that brings the most will win?\"\n\nSeriously manny, are you happy with the current state of 0.0? Do you think that things are as they should be? Has the massive supercap hegemony made 0.0 more fun or less fun, do you think? Feel free to use the freefalling PCU numbers to prove that supers should remain omnicapable and that it's a good and sensible idea to require any alliance that actually wants to play the sov game to be able to field dozens of titan and many dozens of supercarriers.\n\nAs I said earlier, there is currently an inexorable trend for a sov-holding alliance to require it's members to br able to field a supercapital. If you can't bring at least a Nyx, and you're not actively in the process of acquiring one, then you are essentially dead weight. I've asked this question over and over, but none of the anti-nerf brigade seem to be willing to give a straight answer, probably because they know that an honest answer would wreck their argument:\n\nDo you think that being able to field a supercapital is a reasonable minimum requirement for a player to be in a sov-holding alliance?\n\nManny, just in case you aren't keeping track of your own argument, let me sum up how it appears to others\n\n1.) You think that titans are the BFGs of EVE\n2.) You have decided that titans are the BFGs of EVE because they are very powerful, allow a small group to dominate, and take a lot of time, effort, and skill to use.\n3.) In doing so you defined BFGs as being powerful things which allow a person/small group of people to dominate and are balanced by their cost/effort to obtain\n4.) You then claimed, and I quote, \"LITERALLY EVERY PVP GAME HAS A BFG.\"\n\nSo I am asking you now, what the BFGs in these other games are. What are the BFGs in fighting games? They are undeniably PvP games, so according to you they should have BFGs. Can you name some? FPS are also PvP games and the originator of the term \"BFG\". Surely you can name the BFGs in some of the popular games - keeping in mind that you defined a BFG as being hard to get (through cost, effort or a mix of both) and requiring skill to use.\n\nIf you can't tell us what the BFGs are in these games, your argument that EVE should have titans because all PVP games have BFGs falls apart. You'll have to think up a new argument.\n\n?\"eve's a bad mmo, really bad, it's only saving grace is the people playing it, which i guess doesn't say great things about the people playing other MMOs\"\n\nOk, I'm seeing that you don't understand the concept of \"balance\" and \"designed roles\".\n\nOriginally Posted by Manny\n\nTheThat's not an answer to my question, which regards your argument. What are the BFGs in those PvP games? You claim every other PvP game has a BFG, so surely fighting games do to.\n\nYou are trying to box me into a question that will support your argument but what you don't take into account is those fighting games afaik are 1v1 and yes there is no BFG. Eve PVP isn't relegated to the confines of 1v1 its dynamic and the more dynamic the better. Should be fights of supers against subs Bombers against BS BS vs Frigs. For every possible setup there is a counter. ForYou are trying to box me into a question that will support your argument but what you don't take into account is those fighting games afaik are 1v1 and yes there is no BFG.\n\nSo according to Manny, Player Vs Player games only count as Player Vs Player games only count when there is more than one player on each side.\n\nOriginally Posted by Manny\n\nForI don't play in 0.0 and I do not have the ability to make any decisions at all (let alone at a tactical level) in Goonswarm. I might as well not even be considered in Goonswarm. Actually, I'm currently not.\n\ne: Still haven't addressed recent FPS games, with regards to overpowered guns that are hard to acquire and require skill to use properly.\n\n?\"eve's a bad mmo, really bad, it's only saving grace is the people playing it, which i guess doesn't say great things about the people playing other MMOs\"\n\nSell me on this idea. Why should a small alliance be able to effectively counter a huge alliance in sov warfare. Why should the efforts of 100 be able to thwart the efforts of 500? Serious question, why shouldn't the 100 just set their sights to a target more appropriate for their size instead of giving them super pimped out ships to somehow \"level the playing field\" just because they are rich?\n\nsimply, because having the biggest horde of scrubs should not be the priority of the game\n\nOk, I'm seeing that you don't understand the concept of \"balance\" and \"designed roles\".\n\nSupercaps do have a role. Have you flown a titan and see how hard they hit other caps versus what they hit a BS for? Do you realize how they have to be fit in order to hit a BS well? Even after this rebalance we will still be stroking BS for the same damage. The DD change just means we dont have to wait 10 minutes to jump out from blapping a logi the result will be the same. Supers role is they Kill capitals and grind sov/stations more efficiently than anything else. However if fit for the purpose they can do major damage to subcaps.\n\nOriginally Posted by tgrWas Manny in MC? I remember back when MC was so strong because of their heavy cap presence and then caps began getting slight nerfs and MC became hysterical for the reasons Manny is currently arguingNo, it's not simply about having the biggest horde of scrubs, just having numbers means nothing if they're not even remotely tempered by skill. Just ask IT Alliance how well that worked out for them. better skilled dudes (supers, 35m SP minimum), not win against 500 dudes in battleships (10-15m SP minimum)? dudes with more skill invested (supers, 35m SP minimum), not win against 500 dudes in battleships (10-15m SP minimum)?mh, I dont know what to respond, cant recognize any correlation between those 2 quotes. Why is more friends=better? We had this in the past with the NC and clusterfuck and soulcrashing lag as perfect reference and they died poorly despite of \"many friends\".\n\nNo it isn't Im saying there should be a multitude of ways to achieve victory and there is.\n\nZerg\n\nDiplomacy\n\nSubterfuge\n\nNukes\n\nThe more you can add to this the more dynamic things become. Trying to subtract from this detracts from a dynamic environment. I like bedlam and chaos it creates drama and makes things fun and exciting. Remember DHD's Aid Flotilla that shit owned it was different than a typical approach it made things exciting and different. Thats what supercaps represent just as BS fleets represent using different tools in different ways to achieve a desired endstate. Why not embrace the chaos and just try to do better to one up the other guy versus trying to eliminate something because you aren't able/willing/capable to rise to the challenge."

      "text": "feel massive enough? Do a 10v10 PvP and see the problem with that.\n\nIf it's enemies you want, do the No-win scenario or a Foundry mission with lots of NPC enemies to shoot at.\n\nAlso, on the 360 degree maneuverability: Even if the starships in Star Trek didn't appear to obey some principle of gravity, we still wouldn't have that sort of maneuvering in this game. . .and for two good reasons. One, the game engine isn't designed for that. Two, human beings aren't designed for that. Do people have any idea how disorienting 360 degree combat mechanics would be through a 2D screen of limited capabilities?\n\nI think you missed the point of what I said. I was not referring to the number of targets, or maybe I was but not by what you mean, for the most part I was talking about the ambiance of the encounters, there are too many weaker enemies and with the sound effects it makes the encounters feel tiny, little ships with tiny weapons shooting at other little ships, there should be fewer but more powerful enemy targets and sound effects should have a deeper resonance to give the impression of size.\nOn 360 degree maneuverability the game engine has nothing to do with it, you pitch up or down and you can fly in that direction, the only reason you can't go straight up or roll and invert is because of an arbitrary limit set on that degree of motion for the ships, not because the engine can't support it, Champions Online uses the same engine and has no such limitation on degrees of freedom, the only thing missing are roll controls, disorientation is not a factor, auto-righting is already built into the engine. How humans are designed is a non issue, humans have adapted well to operating aerobatic aircraft and spacecraft in the real world and the limitations of a 2D screen hasn't adversely affected players of fighter sims. That aside 360 flight doesn't bring anything of necessity to the game, 1 or 2000 foot long starships don't need to flit around like fighter jets, in fact it's less realistic if they do, but they could at least remove the limit on pitch angle so that ship can rise or dive without having to waste movement to get at targets above or below them.\n\nAll that aside, the real reason the game lacks a Star Trek feel is that Star trek isn't really about combat, it's about people, there is not enough interaction, not enough exploration, not enough puzzles and experiments, Scanning something should open a tricorder mini game that requires you to select parameters of the scan, repairing something should open a puzzle mini game that requires you to move and replace objects, but instead it's all go there, right click and wait, or shoot this, come here and collect reward, rinse and repeat.\n\nAll that aside, the real reason the game lacks a Star Trek feel is that Star trek isn't really about combat, it's about people, there is not enough interaction, not enough exploration, not enough puzzles and experiments, it's all go there, shoot this, come here and collect reward, rinse and repeat.\n\nAnd all the attempts to put it in, had been a failure so far.\nInteraction with NPCs get boring quite fast. You would need a single 20hrs Story to make it more interesting, but this is far too much work to implement it in a game like this.\nExploration, as it is designed, too. Go here, collect that, fly there collect that as well.\nPuzzles/Experiments: All there is are minigames at the moment, and most of it gets boring after the 2nd run.\n\nAfter all, it is combat (PvP) which offers the most alternation right now. To get more Star Trek Feeling, the game would have to be more like this one game from this other franchise, around 10 years ago. (This 20hrs+ Story Content Stuff, but it would take half an enternity to implement something like this, which is too long for a game like this, where people cry for new stuff every single week.)\n\nIn the actual Star Trek the ships rarely would do some of the 3D maneuvers you guys are talking about. There's this thing is space that Star Trek was actually very accurate with displaying called Torsional Stress.\n\nThe whole thing of Inertial Dampeners were meant to counter the internal effects of torsional stress, but there is not much that would prevent the torsion from ripping your ship in half, and most of the ships in the Star Trek universe are built with pylons and parts going off in every direction.\n\nI would say the turn rate and speeds of ships now already show their attention to inertial stresses. Though it does raise an interesting idea- can we fly a ship apart? It'd be neat bonus to mobility in emergencies.\n\nBut imagine how three dimensions could change fighting mechanics. Shields would have six sides minimum for the dorsal and ventral in addition to fore/aft starboard/port. And thats hard to depict in a two dimensional plane- like from looking at the side of ships or the circular shield indicator in the target viewer.\nNot adding dorsal and ventral shields would mean that turning your ship topside would effectively make shield mitigation automatic because you'd be dividing damage between all four simultaniously- and thats not realistically viable.\n\nAlso weapons would have to be targeted more conically because you'd have completely independently usable fore, aft, left, right, dorsal, and ventral weapons.\nNot doing so would make turning your ship upside down a meaningless cosmetic detail as opposed to a strategic maneuver.\nBut this could satisfy the broadside cannon wish of many players.\n\nAnd people so tired of the linearity of the game need to join a role play fleet (call me, I've got one).\nThere's no way that a game like this is going to be able to open up enough randomized experience and cover enough reaction possibilities to make it character driven.\nIf thats what's really important to you, role play with similarly minded individuals is the best bet.\n\nShields could stay just the way they are now without complicating things by adding two more sides, the game is not 2 dimensional, it's 3 dimensional and only feels like the former because of a number in a file limiting pitch angles. A ship above you shooting down at you hits on what appears to be a dorsal area but actually reads as damage to one of the existing quadrants depending on where the hit lands, the ship is enclosed in a ovoid sphere that is divided into 4 quadrants, nothing there needs to be changed. LIn the actual Star Trek the ships rarely would do some of the 3D maneuvers you guys are talking about. There's this thing is space that Star Trek was actually very accurate with displaying called Torsional Stress.\n\nSmall Crafts, the Defiant-Class and BoPs for example performed some of these maneuvers, so you are wrong.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by maxvitor\n\nLSmall Crafts, the Defiant-Class and BoPs for example performed some of these maneuvers, so you are wrong.\n\nThis just proves the point. Torsional stress gets greater the larger the object is. It's the same reason that fighter jets can do all kinds of fancy maneuvers but bombers basically fly in a straight line.

It can be either active or passive shield tanked. In fleets its main role is either going to be simple DD, or anti frigate, depending on how you fit it out.\n\nWith the changes to Heavy Assault Missiles (HAM) and Cruisers, the Caracal is a great solo/small gang kiting ship.\n\nSkills\n\nCaldari Cruiser should be trained to at least IV to take advantage of the DPS and range Buffs that come with every extra level in the skill.\n\nThis fit is able to perma-kite using a cap booster, MWD, and T2 disruptor. Even without perfect cap skills you can easily manage this for long term engagements.\n\nWeb helps against tackle. HAMs still do pretty decent damage to small targets, so TP is more of a niche mod for this slot. (Good against interceptors, assault frigs, etc).\n\nCaracal has the nice ability to switch ammo without losing its damage bonus, so you can use any type you want.\n\nIf your Navigation skills are a little low, consider dropping a BCS for a nanofiber, or depending on your skills, possibly the PDS.\n\nNot recommended, but you can drop DCU for nanofiber if you would like more speed/agility.\n\nDepending on your fitting skills and missile skills, you might even be able to fit a T2 LSE instead of the meta one with the PDS. This will be tankier, although you should avoid getting caught in the first place if possible.\n\nTactics\n\nPvE\n\nKite the rats !! Use your missile range to keep the frigates away from you while you pick them off with your missiles. It is possible to Alpha strike a rat frig with ordinary light missiles. If there are rat destroyers and cruisers with the frigates then take out the frigates first, then the destroyers, then isolate and take out the cruisers. Use your afterburner to stay out of their effective range but inside your missile optimal. Train your missile skills to increase optimal.\n\nPvP solo\n\nThe Caracal has nice bonuses for missiles and is decently fast, so it is a very good kiting ship. With the HAM tweaks it's good for taking out smaller ships (without using light missiles) that can catch it, while still being able to put a lot of DPS onto larger ships that can't catch it. Basically you just want to kite away from them, maybe heat your MWD initially if they warp in close/you are on a gate or station, then turn it off as it will burn out quite fast if you don't pay attention. Depending on your missile and cruiser skills you'll want to keep them from 20-30 KM away with HAMs. When you are running low on cap, simply pop a booster charge and keep burning along.\n\nYour goal is to avoid getting scrammed at all costs, so try to hit smaller ships that can catch you first and deal with bigger ships later. If there is a big ship that can hit you from afar giving you trouble (for example Abaddon), pull a lot of range (at least 100 KM) and try to split smaller ships off for easy kills.\n\nPvP fleet (Large)\n\nIf you are Rapid Light fit, focus on enemy destroyers, frigates, and possibly drones if necessary. If you are Heavy Missile (HML) or Heavy Assault Missile (HAM) fit, attack the target your FC calls primary. If you are using HAMs but it would be unsafe to get into range to use them on the designated primary, simply switch to attacking smaller ships such as frigates until such a time as you can damage the primary target.\n\nSmall Gang\n\nIf you are kiting, small gang tactics are going to be pretty similar to solo, except that you will likely want to burn in the same direction/ be aligned to the same thing as your fleetmates. There are all sorts of small gang compositions that one can try out. Just one example: 2-5 Caracals, 1 Bellicose. The Caracals apply DPS while the Bellicose supports them with Target Paints and helps tackle."

      "text": "Hey guys, me again. I've got a question concerning the creation of effects, specifically explosions with burst-fire weapons. I made a torpedo that has a burst fire of 3 (it is a slow traveling weapon), but the explosion only happens on the 1st and 3rd torpedoes, and nothing happens on the second, as if the damage was transferred, but no explosion. do you know why it does this? is it a hardcoded limit in the game? thanks! here's the pastebin:The backdrop is randomly generated each time... This means that it either draws upon one of the Random maps or has some sort of internal map generator.\n\nI got a question as well. Say I have a laser weapon that has a Damage value of 100 (same for all Banks) and the weapon has a burstCount of 2, this weapon would do 200 damage per volley (aka. 100 damage/shot), correct?\n\nAlso, on Entity modifiers, there's modifiers such as ShieldPointRestoreRate and MaxHullPoints, and I was wondering if there's any sort of Shield Point modifer, like MaxHullPoints, out there?\n\nLook at the Advent hangar shield bestowal ability. If its possible you'll find it thereHoly $%!#, that's awesome. I guess it just got so ingrained in people's heads that fighters can't have shields that no one bothered to try. If it works and I've got some new features to add to my modsI think I might have stumbled across something referring to this in the diplomacy.user file. But, I think that would be either to generate or not to generate a system instead of pick and choose what you want there. You could use that as an angle to look into it maybeIt is easier to make multiple models use the same texture sheet. than to use multiple textures, and one mesh to represent different units. The requiem mod, and SotGE ships share many textures. A Sins mesh cannot \"switch\" textures through scripting (afaik). How sins is set up now each unit is represented by a separate mesh with a separate texture for each mesh.\n\nTec, Pirates, and planetary defenders pretty much share the same meshes, and resources. However Pirate meshes share some textures with each other. This is something you may be interested in checking out.\n\nAs far as making a single hull mesh, and having mesh add ons called for to represent different units.. Aint gonna happen. If you look at the starbase, and structure upgrade meshes, each upgrade mesh is the whole structure with the add on that represents each upgrade added to the mesh. So tech, advent, and vasari starbases have 3 meshes of the whole starbase the only difference is the add ons. It is kind of stupid imo how they did it, but i didnt build the game. Homeworld 2 does the same thing with some units with its module upgrades. If it was possible to have small module upgrade meshes added to a single main hull it would save so much in system resources.\n\nWell that answers the question. Simple enough. I'm looking down the road at making a Minimal Sins with the same models for all sides just using the textures to differentiate them and dumbing down the models.\n\nMaybe I'll sit down this summer and really try to dig into it. Thanks for the replyHmm, interesting. Do you know if it uses a specific map to pick those groups? Because I really can't apply custom templates to random worlds without changing the template for every individual planet in those groups. I suppose I could just make copies of the original weighted random/random and change every map to use those, then make some new planets with the desired default template to put under WeightedRandom/Random, so thanks for the info."

Beyond\nthat distance the spacecraft is lost in the void of space. Space, however, is\ninfinitely huge and does not accommodate to human abilities. Therefore, a\nstarship's sensors augment and enhance the crew's own abilities, allowing\nthem to detect and see starships much farther than normal.\n\nA spacecraft's sensors use a combination of passive visual and EM sensors\nas well as active ladar and radar emitters to provide the pilot with an accurate\npicture of the space surrounding the craft. More sophisticated sensors even\nemploy advanced Gravimetric sensors to detect the mass of a remote starship and\nHyperspace Wave Distortion sensors to detect active Hyperdrive use or Hypercomm\ntransmissions. Civilian spacecraft rely on accurate sensor readings to navigate\nand maneuver while military spacecraft use even more accurate sensors to acquire\nand track threat spacecraft as well as coordinate the activity of allied or\nsubordinate craft. Under normal operations, all spacecraft navigate and maneuver\nusing active sensors. Active sensors provide detailed and accurate information\nbut are easily detected by other spacecraft. Under certain circumstances a\nspacecraft may operate under passive sensors only. Passive sensor operation\nprovides less accurate or detailed information than active sensor operation\nsince it can only detect emitted or reflected ambient EM radiation but has the\nadvantage of making the vessel itself harder to detect.\n\nEach spacecraft equipped with sensors lists the sensors Detection Range and\nIdentification Range. The Detection Range is the distance at which point the\nspacecraft will become aware of the existence of an object or energy source. At\nthis point, the information provided by the sensors is too limited to provide an\naccurate identification of the remote object. All that is known is the object's\nsize or mass, it's heading, and what kind of energy it might be generating or\ntransmitting. The Identification Range is the distance at which the sensors\nprovide enough information for an accurate identification of the object. At this\nrange, sensor operators, or computer databanks, can determine the identity and\nintention of the craft or object. Identification Range is considered the maximum\nrange at which a spacecraft's weapons can target and open fire on an opponent.\n\nA spacecraft operating with passive sensors only, or \"running\nsilent\", can detect other craft if the other craft is using active sensors\nat a range equal to the other craft's Active range.\n\nA spacecraft's sensors can detect other craft using more powerful active\nsensors at the other craft's active-range.\n\nSpacecraft equipped with advanced sensor suites may attempt a Scan against a\nsingle target.

      "text": "I thought I would try to collect popular ideas in one thread. Because I've noticed several important suggestions spread throughout the forums. I'll try to update this post as other suggestions people seem to agree on are brought up.\n\nFirst is fairly obvious. Variable lasgun settings for all lasguns.\n\nMy recommendation would be to implement this, and then give the Triplex version a bigger bonus, for example Overcharge on a Triplex adds an additional 1 pen, and Overload does 1d10+5 Pen 2. Or something similar.\n\nI would like to see the Bullpup get something special, the .5kg trade off for 1 less shot on burst fire and less range is not really equitable. My personal thought was and increase to the number of customizations it can have if it is part of the standard regimental kit. So normally a weapon can handle 4 customizations, the Bullpup could have 5. Also, the replacement of a lascarbine for an M35 Lasgun, should read \"… with M35 Lasgun or Bullpup Lasgun.\" as the Bullpup should be an option during Regiment creation.\n\nAlso, including sunlight recharging of Las packs.\n\nFailure with a grav-chute deals too much damage, I would change the test to Easy(+30) instead of Routine(+20), and decrease the damage to 1d10+ (1/per DoF), falling damage.\n\nThe Operate Skill is poorly formatted, its divided up like 3 separate skills when I believe it is meant to be a skill with 3 specialties.\n\nThere have been a lot of comments on Vehicles.\n\nGiven the current state of rules I would first recommend Changing the Pen of a Battle Cannon to 10. 8 obviously equates well with the TT, but since most Space Marines actually have 10 on their chest armor a 10 pen makes more sense. and Thus increase the Vanquishers to 20. and then simply have AP rounds provide a straight benefit, such as changing pen to 1.5X normal pen. I personally feel the changes should be far greater, but it would require redoing the profiles for both guns and the AP rounds section.\n\nMy 2 cents about the durability of vehicles. They are fine or at most require a small tweak. given that under the rules you can inflict multiple RF hits with one shot (a Lascannon could easily score a couple, and has a 50% chance of getting at least 1), which seriously damage vehicles. Also, destorying a MBT like the Leman Russ would normally be done with Lascannon teams, and idealy from an advantegeous position (side or rear). if a group of PCs is expecting to take down a Leman Russ with 1 Lascannon, then they are going to have a bad time. I am concerned with Melta weapons, they seem totally incapable of seriously damaging heavier tanks, perhaps a special rule giving them RF on a 9 or 10 when shot at a vehicle? or the Flame Quality? Typically they are powerful intense heat rays, and with the recent changes to Vehicles and fire combined with the Pen of a Mela weapon could make it viable for setting a vehicle on fire perhaps?\n\nFinally, the Well Provisioned doctrine grants bonuses logistics for fuel and repair parts, but these mechanics are not present. nor is a system or GM guidelines for acquiring/assigning vehicles as specialty mission gear. adding a operating time/range, plus including guidelines for acquiring/assigning vehicles as mission gear could be very helpful.\n\nThanks for reading, hopefully this will help devs find a comprehensive list of changes.\n\nVariable Settings is a good thing, but even that lacked power. It should be comparable to at least special SP ammo. Currently been running with High and Overload settings as such, and overcharge packs being 75% capacity instead of half. I feel its still a tiny bit conservative, but overall has let las weapons be considered [even if not always chosen still] rather than thrown out like yesterday's trash even in Black Crusade.\n\nHigh [x2 ammo] +1 Dmg / +2 Pen\n\nOver [x3 ammo] +2 Dmg / +4 Pen, Reliability -1 step\n\nHellguns only have low/high, with high as +2/+2. They're rarer and made for this kind of thing anyways.\n\nAs it currently is, the Triplex is nothing but a worse Long-Las, in every single way. Rarer, Lower penetration, lower range, non accurate, non-reliable, non-felling, Rare instead of Scarce, and its version of variable settings is just plain laughable. Bad enough a lasgun has a hard time two-shotting a minion already.\n\nI say we make a Shotlas out of it: though I'm thinking 'BC version' of scatter.\n\nSee, now I'd like to SEE a Bolter Drill. Or a Las Drill. Or a Plasma Drill.\n\nI have no idea how a bolter drill would be any different [you're probably just slamming bolter shells down the hole instead of placing regular explosives?] but screw it, mining lasers or plasma-cutter melees be awesome.\n\nOr at least hydraulic hammers/rock-breakers or the like. With power-fields? What Ork wouldn't want one for an arm?\n\nBolter Drill would be interesting, but Bolters aren't as common in guard. Lasgun Barrage is a nice touch, but my group feels its underpowered. Flesh Render could just use a new name and it would really help the sergeants.\n\nIf you want a Full-auto version of a lasgun you could use the assault lasgun from RT.\n\nIf lasguns get to powerful then it becomes ridiculous. a couple guardsman bursting an ork nob just seems wrong. and you need to consider the sarge's special that adds 4 to all your damage, it really helps the squad a lot. its obviously meant for lasguns.\n\nbut yea, i think its a a simple issue of introducing a low level variable setting, then being able to customize, mod, and give new ammo types, with the sarge command power, it all works outMinerva-Aegis? Assault lasgun? Stutter-las?\n\nAll three examples sacrifice either range, reliability or both to achieve their rate of fire. Building up an optimum charge takes a bit, it would appear."

If they're not useful to sort by what sort of things techs do, then how are players going to use categories, and how are players going to find techs that do a particular sort of thing?You are conflating two different issues. My complaint here is about the categories. There's no rule that a tech can only unlock new techs in the same category. But i would argue rather strongly that for instance, planetary stealth screens should not be in the \"ships\" category merely because the technobabble explains them with similar imaginary science , and some ship part tech is a prerequisite for the planetary stealth screens. Weather planetary stealth screens should have ship part tech as a prerequisite is more debatable.\n\nI also disagree with your assumption the only interesting research decision is between the new techs unlocked by the last thing he researched. Weather detectors are all in the same branch or scattered willy-nilly all over the tree, the player is still making the same essential choice-- weather he wants to prioritize better detectors now, or something else.\n\nOf course there is no category that that planetary stealth screens, or a good amount of other stuff could naturally fall in. That's what i'm compiling about. Because i'm worn out i don't have constructive alternatives at this timeI haven't read the whole thread, so i hope nobody else has already come up with this idea.

      "text": "noticing, recently, that a lot of people are flying Cruisers. A LOT. Specifically the Odyssey. For every Escort or Science Vessel I see, I could count 5 Cruisers. And, out of those 5 Cruisers, odds are at least ONE of them is an Odyssey. Usually, it'll be 2 or 3 (to the community's credit, that used to be a lot higher). People always complain that they tun slowly, so why are they BY FAR the most popular ship type in Starfleet? Well, let's examine each type, shall we?\n\nSECTION 1: AVAILABILITY.\nA big reason of this would be the SELECTION. Let's tale a look at the Playable Starship table over at STOWiki. I'm not going to get into the Fleet Ships, those are just buffed rehashes of what we had before. At lieutenant, we have 4 ships. The Oberth is the Science Vessel (C-Store only), the NX is the Escort (C-Store only), and there are TWO cruisers at this tier (one is C-Store only). The trend has already emerged. If we follow that chart down, the status quo doesn't change. One ship each, then the Retrofit off the C-Store. This is the same for Lt. Cmdr, Cmdr, and Captain.\nThen we hit Admiral, and the status quo packs it's bags and heads for the hills. Two Escorts (no C-Store versions), 4 Science Vessels (2 C-Store only)... and FIVE Cruisers (2 non-C-Store, one straight purchase, and 2 C-Store Gamble ships). At VA, ALL ships are C-Store (I, however, remember getting my Fed Sci his free Intrepid Retrofit when he hit VA - they need to re-add that). Five MORE cruisers to three Escorts and TWO Science Vessels.\nThe grand total is as follows:\nGetting the Bronze in this category is the Science Vessels, with only 11 variants. The silver goes to the Escorts, with 12. Getting the gold is, of course, the CRUISER, at a whopping EIGHTEEN variants of the lumbering giants. So, they get a point. There's more cruisers than other ships, but no cruiser is a Carrier. Odd.\n\nSECTION TWO: STATS.\nFor the purpose of standardized comparison, I'll be using the Assault Cruiser, the Advanced Escort, and the Reconnaissance Science Vessel. We'll start off with the most obvious stuff: Power Bonuses. Everyone should know these. Cruisers get +5 to all, Escorts get +15 weapons, and Science Vessels get +15 Aux. So, Escorts hurt more, Science uses more powers, and the Cruisers just balance. That should mean Escorts should win.\nThe next piece of obvious piece is Base Turn Rate. The Assault Cruiser does 7 degrees per second. The Recon Science Vessel gets 13 d/S, and the Advanced Escort peels off with 15 d/S. So, Escorts turn better.\nTechnobabble enthusiast will understand the next stat already: Shield modifiers. This is the number your base shield capacity gets multiplied by before bonuses get applied to give you your base shield on that ship. Cruisers, in this case, are the baseline, with a shield modifier of 1. This means, with NO boosts, if a shield says 5,000 capacity, you get 5,000 capacity. On the low end are the Escorts, at 0.9. With no boosts, a shield saying 5,000 on the tooltip will only get you 4,500. So, the Escorts have something of a deficit in the shields department. Science Vessels, however, gain a big ol' 1.3 modifier. This means that a tooltip that says 5,000 will net you 6,500 instead. They can pull their weight in shields. Science Vessels take the cake here.\nFinally, it's time for the real gap... Base Hull. The short stick got pulled by the Recon Science Vessel, she only has 27,000. The Advanced Escort, endeavoring to be the middle child, sits on a firm 31,000. A modest difference, an Escort can take an extra torpedo. However, the Assault Cruiser ate too many cakes in its youth, and sits on a fat 39,000. So, for eating too much cake, the Cruiser gets another one.\nSo, in this category, everyone meets up pretty evenly. No points here.\n\nSECTION 3: POTENTIAL POWERS.\nThis section is all about BOffs. What kind of powers can your lackeys slot in? I'll continue with the base ships from Section Two.\nThe Advanced Escort has 7 Tactical power slots, 2 Engineering power slots, and 3 Science power slots. This is clearly a damage spec. Those tactical slots could be firing every gun 9001 times a second. They bring pain.\nThe Recon Science vessel has 7 Science power slots, 3 Tactical power slots, and 2 Engineering power slots. This guy is gonna make things WEIRD. Black holes and subspace tears will appear all OVER the place! This ship flies in and turns the fight into an episode of the Twilight Zone.\nBut the Assault Cruiser... the number of frakks given by the Assault Cruiser is negative. This big bucket of bolts is bursting with 7 Engineering powers, 3 Tactical powers, and two Science powers. This guy can bring every healing and resistance power known to MAN. The damage from the Escort can just be healed back, and the Science Vessel is wasting its efforts.\n\nSUMMARY\nSo, we've looked at the ships. They've all got their niche. However, the winning of the Cruiser has become apparent. They're too much like real-life Tanks... take ALL the enemy fire and still have the ability to blow enemies sky high. Plus, there are more varieties of Cruiser. Overall, it's a lot stronger, especially considering that late-game enemies (the Borg) have a lot of durability AND damage, requiring them to be tanked. So, how can the other ships come up to par?\nFor one, there could stand to be a few more Escorts. They're small, Starfleet should have no trouble producing them. They could also stand to gain a passive, like the Science Vessels having Subsystem Targeting and Sensor Scan. Maybe, Escorts could get B:Faw, B:O, C:Rapid, and C:Scatter for free, with a special passive for Strafing runs (first consecutive volley deals 5% more damage, only reactivates on a weapon after that weapon has not fired for 7 seconds, plus a bigger Defense boost while moving).\nScience Vessels are a good mid-ground for ships; they can take a decent beating, they can have the highest shields in the game, and they cam make things wonky. They have a passive, and an ability gain. Their main issue is that they don't have the damage they need unless it's a long, drawn-out 1-on-1. But, they're decently well-balanced and good in a select few situations. There could be a few more of them, too. the way it is the game will become unplayable because no-one will have the lifespan (in case of escorts) or damage (In case of cruisers) or both (in case of science ships) to kill anything.\n\nI thought the OP was just observing that the most popular ships seem to be cruisers by federation players?\n\nEither way..\n\nMy observation has been kinda similar, when it comes to startfleet players I've noticed these\n\n-most are in cruisers\n-most dont know how to fly them\n-most lose a shield facing in pvp and use science/engineering team as opposed to tactical team\n-Most are flown by tactical captains\n\nMy guess for all these reasons?\nFanatics.\n\nThey go tactical because they like the idea of blowing things up, but dont realise they trade survivability. They choose cruisers because they are the ship of the captain/series they like e.g. Exploration cruiser (i mean why else is the like 4re-fits for one flipping vessel.) Soverign (the movies), or they think a cruiser can sufficently tank by spamming engineering and science teams.\n\nAs for the oddesy it might be the psychological thing of 'the most expensive thing is the best' and if i get this, i will be better at the game. Which makes me giggle when I'm in a stf (a Science captain in an escort) and I end up being the one supporting cruisers with AuxTSIF, and hazard emitters.\n\nAlso to say for cruiser's popularity some cruisers are 'iconic' ships that some people just feel compelled to buy, e.g. excelsior (i myself bought it and barely used it past a week) the way it is the game will become unplayable because no-one will have the lifespan (in case of escorts) or damage (In case of cruisers) or both (in case of science ships) to kill anything.\n\nRant over...\n\n33k... not bad... But my Odyssey build can take that. Like I said in the third part, Cruisers do a REALLY good job at sucking up damage. I pop Eng Team 3 and Miracle Worker... What damage? A seriously tank-specced cruiser is an unstoppable force. I once tanked a Tactical Cube in Infected Normal for 5 minutes... with its forward side facing me. Torpedoes, cannons, I took everything it had for WELL long enough for the rest of my team to take down the gate (which was my intention - you don't wanna take pod shots at the gate with a Tac Cube trying to snipe you)... and I did this BEFORE I perfected the build. An Elite Tactical Cube... that's another matter, but I still took his fire for a good 90 seconds. Between Reverse Shield Polarity 3, Eng Team 3, Miracle Worker, and my Borg set... I'm a GOOD tank.\n\nIf you'd like, I can give you the build. I simulated it on STOAcademy.\n\n\"They could also stand to gain a passive.. Maybe, Escorts could get B:Faw, B:O, C:Rapid, and C:Scatter for free, with a special passive for Strafing runs. \"\n\nWell... no, as you said they have 7 + or - tactical boff seats, weapon modifying abilities are what these are for...\n\n\"But, they're decently well-balanced and good in a select few situations.\"\n\nThat's arguable, science abilities keep getting nerfed or \"fixed\", science ships are tanks and crowd control (good for pve not pvp), most of abilities have been declawed at one point or another, but yeah in the right hands they can still be used well.\n\n\"There could be a few more of them, too.\"\n\nThat's really down to the players, if they want to fly them, they will, if they dont then they dont fly them :p, its not like there is a quota of how many types of ship there must be in game ^^\n\nThe reason for the numerical dominance of cruisers lies probably in the nature of star trek itself.\nStar Trek has always been a Cruiser dominated Universe. Before the introduction of the Defiant, \"escort\" class ships where next to unknown on Starfleet side. Cruisers on the other hand are the much more iconic type of ships in the Star Trek universe.\n\nYou know, before the Dominion War, Star Trek was about exploring the universe in ships which where able to do 5 or even 10 year missions. They had to be able to take care of themselves, without relying on other ships backing them up or providing firepower for them. Thats what i essentially expect from a Star trek game, i want to fly big ships that don't need \"escorts\" to destroy an enemy effectively.\n\nPersonally i would have prefered if they never introduced the Defiant in the first place. I think that such a type of ship doesn't belong to Starfleet or the Star Trek universe at all. I find the very idea of small agile glass cannons in Star Trek greatly inappropriate and improper IMO.\n\nIn my opinion:\nIn STO, Cruisers should dominate space battles with their firepower and survivability, while Science ships provide crowd control and other \"magic\" stuff.\nDoing fast dogfights and zipping around just isn't Star Trek for me, if i want to do that i play other games set in other sci fi universes. In STO Space combat should be more tactical oriented instead of those fast paced dogfights we have in STO.\n\nOne, cruisers are much more iconic so it makes sense that people playing for 'Trekness' would largely pick them. And the Odyssey is officially 'The Flagship,' whether its actually better or not.\n\nTwo, have you played much endgame? Cruisers are numerous, but escorts rule the roost already (and definately don't need buffing). I play cruisers and sci because escorts bore me, but numerically my escorts are a heck of a lot more effective than anything else."

Others require managing to find room to squeeze in a Boff power to counter specific attacks. Some ships don't exactly have a lot of room to spare, because they're only viable in a certain number of ways. Classic example would be the good ol' Hegh'ta. My current build more or less relies on a combination of two Tactical Team 1's and an RSP for the majority of tanking, with TSS and EptS for shield recovery and HE for hazard debuffing and a small hull heal.\n\nI don't realistically have ROOM to squeeze in a Sci Team to counter the sci-spam BS I come across, or the sci-based P2W attacks that get used like cheese. Putting that in requires opening a big gap in my TT coverage, which is what keeps me alive 50-60% of the time. It also requires me to sacrifice a boff skill that I KNOW I get a lot of use out of. . .there are no 'unused' skills on my Hegh'ta.\n\nSo, the 'just lacking adequate preparation' line doesn't cut it with me, especially since you'd be hard pressed to have a build set up to respond to every friggin bit of cheese that's out there (AMS, gravitic pulse, danubes, subnukes/subnuke doffs, general sci spam, etc).\n\nMy list of what I consider OP isn't TOO big. I don't consider subspace jump to be OP, for example. I don't consider Theta Radiation to be OP. Most P2W stuff is generally ok with me, they're items of reasonable utility (heck, I'm using two P2W items myself!). Mostly, I get pissed off at stuff like AMS spam the instant you shoot someone, gravitic pulses that render you helpless in regards to escaping/maneuvering, 2-3 subnukes getting stacked onto you, danube spam (especially combined with other cheap BS tricks).\n\nIf you open that up to variants of the ship and you have a deal. For example the temporal set is what gives the Wells it's power so allow it to work on any temporal ship. Or the Excelsior console (Now only sold on the CMDR version) leave that available to all Excelsior variants.\n\nDo this and I will support your idea all the way\n\nQuestion will be if other players are willing to give up their toys. If not, were back to the drawing board.\n\nCo-founder of The Spanish Inquisition TSI - Cause no one expects it!\n\nPaxOttomana: gawd mirror event is like fighting a tsi premade, they keep comin and comin!"

They are not going to invest in super amazing suits of armour that probably cost as much as a gunship.\n\nI think the Combine just stomp into whatever worlds they find and they begin using the technology of any species they take over, combining (Ha, Combine...) it with their own. That's why they've got such badass choppers and APCs. Imagine how much worse it could have gotten if they'd had more time to work with human tech. They'd have Combine tech tanks driving around and naval units.\n\nThe shit the Combine Soldiers are wearing are probably adapted from bullet proof vests and other personal protection equipment. Probably taken from whatever the human military forces were using. Fortunately for Earth, there was only one HEV suit left after the Black Mesa incident, which is the one Gman confiscated from Gordon. I believe Gman left the HEV suit somewhere Doctor Kleiner would stumble upon it. Naturally, he made many modifications to it as he stated when he gave it to you in HL2. If I'm correct, the Mark IV version of the HEV suit that Gordon wears is what the Transhuman Combine forces would be wearing had they gotten their hands on it.\n\nDidn't Valve say that the events of Portal and Portal 2 weren't cannon with the Half-life universe but Aperture Science is?\n\nThey are both canon, Valve hasn't said anything like that at all. If Portal 1 and 2 aren't canon, then what would we know about Aperture Science? Nothing at all. However:\n\nGR: From the design standpoint of Portal 2, were you are thinking in your mind, \"if we were going to make a Half-Life 3, how would Portal 2 tie into that main story line?\"\n\nEW: Yes, to a certain extent, you don't want to do something that is going to screw up Half-Life 3. So I can tell you that Chell is not going to blow up the Earth by the end of Portal 2. You want to leave something there. But having said that, we do the linkage and do some references but we kind of considered, at least Portal writers do, [that] if you think of it as the X-Files, Half-Life is the ongoing serious story with the characters of X-Files. Then X-Files would have these absurd one-off episodes. Portal is a self-contained thing and that's the Aperture Funhouse of Science, you know?\n\nThis does not suggest it is non-canon at all though. It just means the things that happen in Portal 2 will not have a direct impact on the next Half-life game, other than a few things about Aperture science itself and maybe a few references to Portal 2.\n\nValve are trying to distance the two series. They tied them together in Episode Two but realised with Portal 2 that the premises were so different they should have been completely separate in the first place.\n\nValve are trying to distance the two series. They tied them together in Episode Two but realised with Portal 2 that the premises were so different they should have been completely separate in the first place.\n\nIt does not suggest it is non-canon. If they didn't want it to be canon or thought they should have been completely separate universes than that is what they would of done - they could of changed the story. They distanced them slightly because they are two separate stories with different characters and settings. People wanted Chell and GLaDOS in the next Half-life. Valve didn't want the story of Portal 2 to affect Half-life so they set it far in the future - by doing that it means that changes to one of the games (e.g when the next Half-life comes out) doesn't mean they have to make changes to or plan it around the other game.\n\nBy Self-contained it just means that the story of the game does not have an affect on anything else, but what happens is canon although it will not impact Half-life in anyway other than a few bits of info about Aperture and its history. Portal 1 and 2 are canon.\n\nI find it that both Portal and Portal 2 are fully canon. Half life and Portal 2 just tell the story from a different stand point. Portal portrays the events in a comedic way, while HL keeps them dramatic and serious.\n\nIt's simple, really. You could write a story about Hitler's rise to power and keep it funny, while still being historically more/less accuratePortal 1 was most likely sometime after HL1, assuming GLaDOS' \"them\" was either Xen creatures or the Combine. Blaperture Mesa was just a joke; the Perpetual Testing Initiative never takes place in the original Portal universe. Cave did die long before the resonance cascade, thoughExactly. I know it's an off-topic, but this is the case with Black Mesa Bullsquid. With moving it's eyes, they wanted to make it feel like a thread, more sinister. I don't think it was rly needed to do this, since it lost that \" naturalwildlife feeling\" to me. But that may be just me. And sorry for offtopic :D\n\nPortal takes place between HL and HL2. Portal 2 takes place between HL2EP3 and HL3. Oh,and the rip between Portal and Portal 2 is very probably 20 years. Why? Look:\n1.Those test subjects in containers expire after 20 years,Wheatley probably took care of the expired subject,hence when he said \"smelly humans\" in that one level,he was referring to decomposing corpses.\n2.20 years is the perfect amount of time the building would decay alot and become overgrown,but if it was 200 years,it would probably turn into a forest with some remains here and there,and would cave in in the salt mine below.\n3.20 years is even extravagant for the level of the salt mine being preserved. I wonder how it didn't fall apart and cave in.cinematic mod is made by FF, and it's really shitty, ruins the whole thing.\n\n1) He received criticism on his various slutty Alyx models and model changes on, but has chosen to ignore it, as he states, \"It's for Alyx fans and downloading them is purely optional.\" True, but the basic principles is that he's changing the artistic style of every HL2 character into what they're not intended for.\n\n2) He bought props from poser sites, as TH89 stated.

As far as I've been able to determine, yes, the m and the c are distributed separately.\n\nSo on a normal planet, the range for a single resource type is 0 to 4 (both bounds inclusive). What is the distribution of that? (again, on a SINGLE TYPE of resource)\n\nWell those numbers are correct, I normally like to drop the .5 as you can't roll a .5 on a die, even if it not perfectly correct.\n\nAnd the fact that 2d6 has a slightly higher expected value is not only well know, but if you read any D&D optimization guide you notice that they always go for weapons that roll 2d6 or 2d4 over 1d12 or 1d8. Even more often is that they also look for brutal weapons as well, even not brutal, rolling 2d6 over 1d12 means a range of 2-12 versus 1-12, with the first averaging higher. Throw in brutal 1 and you get a range of 4-12, Brutal 2 becomes 6-12.\n\nOn the graph, it shows that 3,4 and 5 resources types make up the bulk of the galaxy, so balancing for 4 was not quite wrong. The greater issue likely is as it was pointed out, planets like the ones with ARS tend to have 5+ rather then finding an ARS on a planet with only 1 or 2. So maybe how those are being seeded should be adjusted rather then income from a harvester.\n\nAfter all, you should need to take planets for resources, planets for ARS and if you are lucky they are the same planet, but it sounds like that is not the case.\n\nGiven that I personally only play Fallen Spire, I don't often look at how much each planet makes, as I am going to have to take them all anywayOk I just finished collecting the data for just crystal nodes in 120 P# galaxies.

I'm not convinced that the sample size is hight enough that we couldn't just write it off due to random \"noise\", but it might be worth looking into.\n\nI collected 10 more galaxies worth of data on for crystal only. For these 10, the median was 2 throughout again and 2 of the 10 trials had an exact mean of 2. The mode was all over the place again, this time with an overall mode of 0 with the mode of the mode being 3Looking at it myself without running numbers and the sample sizes, I would say that it is not peaking at 4, but rather is within random limits. Granted you have to run formulas that I long forgot to prove it, but it looks like the lowest value is 450ish and the highest is 510. So it looks like the difference between the highest and the lowest is 2.5% of the total sample size, and I am sure that falls within random errorNot sure if I can help you there seeing as I've never actually beat this game yet.

It is also preferred for the simple user interface that any first time computer user can very quickly learn because the most commonly used features are immediately visible and can be activated with a single click of the mouse.\n\nTeamSpeak 3 continues the legacy of the original TeamSpeak communication system previously offered in TeamSpeak Classic (1.5) and TeamSpeak 2. TeamSpeak 3 is not merely an extension of its predecessors but rather a complete rewrite in C++ of its proprietary protocol and core technology.\n\nWith over nine years of experience and leadership in the VoIP sector, our engineers have created a flexible, powerful, and scalable solution granting you the ability to customize and tailor your voice communication needs any way you desire. New users and TeamSpeak veterans alike will now enjoy a completely new experience in voice communication using TeamSpeak 3's unmatched functionality and powerful new features.\n\nMumble is a voice chat application for groups. While it can be used for any kind of activity, it is primarily intended for gaming. It can be compared to programs like Ventrilo or TeamSpeak. People tend to simplify things, so when they talk about Mumble they either talk about \"Mumble\" the client application or about \"Mumble & Murmur\" the whole voice chat application suite.\n\nVent is the OG of the group and hasn't changed much since it was first introduced. Teamspeak 3 is the powerhouse that does everything, but takes up the most resources. Mumble is the new entry into the bunch with a very low resource use, but it also has more issues than the rest.\n\nAlso, FTL is weird. I'm not sure how much of it is based on luck or how much of it is my fault.\n\nI feel like it's a lot of the former though.\n\nA lot of both. But yeah, there's a lot of luck. General shit:\n\nWhen you first start the game, power up both your weapons, depower the med-bay, put that extra bit of power into your engines for an evasion boost, make sure you have shields, weapons, and the cockpit staffed, and turn autoattack on.\n\nIf there's a fire some place that you don't need to be right at that very moment, vent it. It'll go out when there's no oxygen. Just keep in mind that being in a room with no oxygen drains health fast - something you can use to your advantage against boarding parties if you upgrade your doors.\n\nUse nebulae to slow down the rebel fleet and buy more time to explore.\n\nYou can get through a lot of early fights taking little to no damage by just using your lasers. 95% of the time, taking out enemy weapons control is the highest priority. Sometimes drone control. Until the fights start getting harder, you only really want to use missiles against enemies with overwhelming laser counts or dangerous missiles. In such cases, a missile right to their weapons control should keep you from taking much damage in the fight.\n\nIf you can find another burst laser II, get it. Two burst IIs firing simultaneously is six shots, which will burn through any shield with ease. Pegasus missiles are another favourite of mine, as they're very resource efficient and defence drones have trouble stopping them.\n\nI'm not big on drone control, though it becomes pretty powerful if you get a drone recovery arm.\n\nStealth is amazing, and has surprisingly low scrap costs and power draw. Add stealth weapons, and you have a monster of a ship. Add the rare and expensive preigniter upgrade (charges weapons after every jump) and you are a ing god.\n\nA lot of stuff gets easier with a more diverse crew. Space station on fire and needs rescuing? Send a rockman, because he's immune to fire. Colony dealing with some weird space plague? Send an engi, because he can't get sick.\n\nHumans and slugs are average at combat and have 100 HP. Engis do half damage and zoltan only have 70 HP. Mantis move slightly faster than anyone else and do double damage. Rockmen are balls-out slow but have 150 HP and don't take fire damage. There's a hidden seventh race that's handy for raiding parties, too. Boarding parties mostly come from mantis ships, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you will be boarded by mantis.\n\nI mostly rely on \"free\" crew members. Rescuing them from slavers or protecting civilians from pirates or pulling them off of damaged space stations. Unfortunately, this means I have no control over what species the crewmember is, so you might want to pony up the 45 scrap at a store for a mantis if you've got nothing but humans and engis or something.\n\nAnd yeah, those are the two upgrades I meant. Aside from the +60% evasion (great to slap on just as the enemy launches a missile at you), enemies can't lock on to you while you're cloaked. Your weapons continue to charge up, but theirs stay frozen."

There was existing, ordinary-18-wheeler art for SR already, they could have used for the Zugmaschine ... which is definitely not statted as a \"moving office block\", like the Bergen was.\n\nAnyway, I have no idea. If I had to guess, someone had a huge folder full of images bereft of context, saw it, didn't 'get' the ladder was a ladder up to a massive vehicle's cab, and thought it was just as big rig with an unusual, cool look they could useIt's little more than sheet metal plus some framing... they're not exactly the most rugged structures on the road... compared to the cab with it's engine, transmission, etc. they're tinfoil.\n\nIf you wanted something more, at that point you're more or less building your own trailer from scratch. Your better route would be to do something like take a citymaster as a template, give it 'limited maneuverability' since it doesn't move on it's own but instead is drug behind the zugmachine. I'd still consider a seperate vehicle for damage purposes and NOT lump the two into one for balance reasons and problems within the RAW.\n\nYou could even end up with a flatbed carrying another vehicle.\n\nIt's probably best in all situations to not consider the combined tractor trailor a single unit except for maneuverability and speed restrictions. Damagewise... probably best to consider them two seperate targets and vehicles.\n\nHere's part of the reason why... you have a zug + trailor... you consider them a single target... target is attacked and takes damage... you now take off that trailer and put on another one... where is the damage? There's no rules to handle how each of them take damage or how it's split between the two.\n\nOn the other hand if they're two vehicles which only share a maneuverability/pilot response for the defense test to avoid getting hit but soak damage independently... it makes a lot more sense... as it's possible to trash the trailer and it's cargo without trashing the tractor unit... or vice versa (if you're trying to hijack the cargo). You know exactly how the damage is split between them at all times as well\n\n<Snip much awesomeness.>\n\nYou're talking smart, real smart, and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter. You're also pretty damn spot-on about splitting damage and counting the trailer as a limited maneuverability unitYou mean the Space Pirate's captain, right? Because he doesn't seem like an Astral Pirate, much less an Astral Pirate captain.\n\n... What do Astral Pirates steal, anyway?\n\nAstral LootI never said the trailer should have more actual body ... just, more room for modifications.\n\nQUOTE\n\nIt's probably best in all situations to not consider the combined tractor trailor a single unit except for maneuverability and speed restrictions.\n\nSR4 however, does exactly that. The Trailer doesn't have a separate body of 6. Instead, it ups the Tractor's body by 6.\n\nI agree with you that it's not a good approach. Unfortunately, it is the RAW's decision.\n\nNot so, a full sized trailer. A trailer that could hold two Body-10 cars (e.g., Mercury Comets), just by loading them nose-to-tail, with room to spare.\n\nstill not as big as a tree. Certainly not as long, and I doubt the plant is purely linear. Western Red Cedars, which are native to places like Seattle outreaches, grow to up to 200 ft long and 20ft spread. Body determines carry, if I recall. Also, the space needed for lift is dependent on the gas, assuming gas is the only variable for lift at that. As has been said, the rules for 4th ed are pretty nondescript. We back-referenced 3rd ed vehicle books for similar items in our group. As it appear you have? a roadmaster and tractor-trailer, have you considered a small plane? You can get a Tundra-9 if you truly break the bank at character creation, or you can get a yellow jacket without having to use Born Rich and In Debt.\n\nI just wanted a decent rig. If I wanted the best min/max possible, I wouldn't be playing a fucking mechanic.\n\nThe group already has a big rig. If you want something unique, perhaps the Mostran KVP-27T?

Yeah, a standard Raven is kitted out as a better scout, but it also costs 2 million more than a standard Cicada. That same two million could go a long way towards letting that standard Cicada kit out for wider variety of fighting. BasicallyFudge. Just talking about this dumb little Cicada makes me want this go to open beta more than anything else yetOur long term campaigns and story played nearly like the mech commander games. Take missions for pay, repair or abandon equipment when things were bad, hunt down and murder people who were behind on payments.The devs have stated that you wont be able to add JJs to mechs/variants that don't support them (I assume you'll be able to remove them from mechs that do have them, tho I can't imagine why anyone would). And the only Cicada variant that has JJs uses level 2 tech that isn't for sure in the game yetAssuming they'll be anything like CBT, without CASE systems being in game I'd imagine most ammo explosions will be instantly lethal, unless the ammo bin was low on munitions already. The one thing I'd like to see changed from CBT is machine gun ammo explosions, which should not do infinity damage like they tend to doWith regards to ammo explosions, one can only hope that machine gun ammo doesn't act as a perfectly contained nuclear bomb when it goes offWell, you could manipulate the number of heat sinks, the amount and positioning of the armor, and the engine power, which was cool.\n\nNot that any of that mattered, since most servers had heat disabled, everyone maximized armor, and no one touched their engine ratings.\n\nI guess sometimes people would strip all their electronic equipment off to load more weapons on their mechs, but that was really the only meaningful choice to be made somethingBeing able to add jump jets to a Daishi was one of the dumbest things in ME3's customization.\n\nThere is a canonical Daishi/Dire Wolf configuration with jump jets, the S configuration. Like all the S configs, it's designed for close-quarters (primarily urban) combat. It has an LB-20X autocannon, a large pulse laser, five medium pulse lasers, two Streak SRM-4's, two machine guns and two anti-personnel podsThat was my point. Pick-up games and scenarios were far more common, and that's how the vast majority of people played the tabletop game. Thus, games which replicated the scenario style or skirmish style play would be more true to tabletop play in general. You certainly wouldn't go to a con and play an ongoing campaign (except for a couple years, when they attempted a \"Living Battletech\" style of campaign that didn't progress very well). It was difficult to even find C-Bill costs for 'Mech parts until the Compendium rolled around. You had to make that shit up back in the day, certainly in the era of the early MechWarrior games compared to the tabletop rulesThe only tabletop BT game I ever played was a mercenary campaign. It was pretty decent, if a bit slow-moving at times.\n\nAs for the computer games, I've always loved the mercenary-focused installments best. There's just something about the resource management aspect of it that really clicks for me. It imbues the action with another layer of importance and urgency.\n\nOn the subject of resource management and economics, I wonder if they'll do anything with C-bill cost as a balancing mechanism for MWO. I'm sure an Atlas will cost more to buy and repair than a Jenner, but that's not relevant during the match, and anyway I doubt they'll make an Atlas cripplingly expensive to operate. (See World of Tanks for an example of this phenomenon in action; an IS-7 may cost 6 million credits but once you've bought it you can basically fight Tiger IIs with it all day.) I suppose they'll probably just stick with tonnage as the only limit on what you can bring, for better of for worse.\n\nSome day, though, I'd like to see a game of this type give players a reason to care about cost efficiency vs. combat potency. (After all, the Russians won WWII by producing a shitload of T-34s quickly and cheaply, even if they weren't individually as good as the Panther.) It'd be kind of cool if teams had a limited C-bill budget instead of, or even in addition to, a simple tonnage limit.\n\nI'm hoping the combat matchup system works something like WoT, except without being completely screwed up (or at least it was back when I played it). So for something like 4v4, a random team could have, say, a light, a couple medium/heavies, and an assault or 2 medium, 2 heavies against a similar spread, but you wouldn't have stuff like 4 Atlases getting matched up against some Jenners. WoT had some pretty messed up matches, though, because the matchups didn't seem to pay much attention to tanks besides size so you could have horrible matchups despite overall weight being about the sameYeah, I know they've had games with salvage/C-bill systems, but that's all pretty short-term stuff meant for singleplayer. Getting more money was an objective, but wasn't so tough as to make spending the money all that meaningful. If it takes, say, a week's play in the MMO to earn a million C-bills, then buying new mechs and equipment is going to mean a lot more than running a couple of missions to make some quick cash and buy a new mech. Even on the low end of things with an Urbanmech, that's over a week to buy one dinky little mech. You just get attached more to a mech if you have to stick with it for a while. If it sucks, you'll think back that crappy whatever you had; if it's great, you'll have second thoughts about giving it up and trading it in.\n\nMaking people have that sort of long-term attachment makes all the difference in the world between people just playing a mech versus making them feel like they own the mech. And when the idea is to get people to like their mech enough that they'll buy stuff for it in an otherwise-free MMO, attachment is definitely good.\n\nI'm hoping the combat matchup system works something like WoT, except without being completely screwed up (or at least it was back when I played it).\n\nAllow me to reassure you that it is still absolutely jacked.\n\nDoesn't stop the developers from posting a \"What do you think of the matchmaking system? We want honest, thoughtful, polite feedback\" thread on the official forums every single patch, then ignoring it when everybody says \"Kindly fix the fucking matchmaking.\"\n\nIt's armor is about what you'd expect from a 40 tonner, nothing special. It can run 129.6 kph, which is somewhat unusual for its size (most 40s go 97.2 kph).\n\nEDIT: Seems to be the fastest, most lightly-armed mediums in this timeframe that doesn't use high-tech gear. Just a big fuckin engine on legs.\n\nEDIT EDIT: Also note, the weapons are all in it's torso. Those arms are just shields.\n\nThat seems like my kind of scouting mech. But then again, the weapons don't really scream \"put some pressure on to make a getaway.\" Maybe there's tanks and turrets and shit that this mech can swoop in and take out, rather than being mech-to-mech combat based.\n\nThere's also the option of shutting your mech down to take you off the radar, giving you the potential for a surprise attack.\n\nExcept for the part where you're a big-ass mech and anybody with half a brain cell can respond to the radar blip from activating near them long before you could do anything meaningful. At least, every Mechwarrior game I've played has done things that way. Startup ends up taking so long that you end up chewing on lasers before you can fire, thus sort of negating the whole idea of a \"surprise attack\".\n\nNot to mention the problem of trying to hide a mech forty feet tall on maps designed to prevent mechs from being obscured by terrain or objects. Can't blame the engineers too much for that; they were told to build a walking tank, not the galactic champion of giant robot hide-and-seek."

Several months ago this was true but for the wrong reason: the opening double-wave required extreme effort (and generally cheese) to survive, but things were quite a bit easier after that. Now the early waves are way easier, and the challenge goes up from there. So it's possible to get into the game and discover later (but hopefully not too much later) that you're simply out of your league.

      "text": "OK, after seeing the Availability modifiers for getting Dark Eldar gear outside of their enclaves, I do note that the Splinter Cannon from The Souls Reaver becomes Unique (without the Auto-Stabilised Trait) - if available at all - in most situations. This means that the one from Hostile Acquisitions must be the \"cheap export model\" - although it having the Auto-Stabilised Trait as standard is a bit odd.\n\nNot odd at all, actually! Kabalite splinter cannons have a funny fluid core that basically uses some physics shenanigans to make them easy to port around.\n\nNo, the funny part is that the Auto-Stabilised Trait is a standard feature of the otherwise inferior weapon (the one from HA that I call the \"cheap export version\", but it's an optional upgrade for the superior model (the one from TSR). It's like having power steering a standard feature on the basic model of an automobile, but it's an extra you have to select when getting the luxury model.\n\nMy in-game explanation will be that the splinter cannon from Hostile Acquisitions is a lighter model made exclusively for hand-held use. OTOH, the splinter cannon from The Soul Reaver is a heavier model (50% heavier) firing larger splinters that fragment on impact (providing Tearing). It is primarily intended for use in vehicle mounts, but can optionally be equipped for hand-held use (giving it the Auto-Stabilised Trait and a higher Availability). Does that make sense of the existing differences?\n\nI kind of miss the Hail of Splinters weapon quality from PtU:Shades of Twilight. All of the splinter weapons in that adventure had Tearing when fired full auto. Then again, those weapons weren't Toxic.\n\nRemember that I've not seen the final version of Soul Reaver, so I can only comment based on my manuscript… I wrote both versions, but the version in Hostile Acquisitions was written before the current Dark Eldar codex was available. I made changes to those rules when adding the weapon to the armoury in Soul Reaver to reflect the way they worked in the wargame, but I don't know if those changes survived playtesting and editingWell, since my copy of the book is going to take a bit longer to reach me than I had earlier thought, time for a question I'd forgotten earlier.\n\nAmong the other vehicles, are there stats for fighter craft, like the Razorwing from the codex or their void fighter (assuming it's different)? My Saim-Hann descended Kabalite needs to upgrade to something even faster than a reaver jetbike at some pointAs much as this is an oversight on your part, you're hardly alone in it. Someone proofreading the whole thing should also have picked up upon it. :P\n\n\"It's never too late to panic.\" ~ Popular Valhallan folk saying\n\nSince so many seem to have trouble understanding Technology, Machine SpiritsMechanicus: LinkAdded after the fact - they're not in my manuscript.\n\nThe idea was drawn from Jes Goodwin's concept art of the Kabalite Warriors that was up on the GW website - notes on the images point out translator units (which appear on the models, mounted on the breastplate of their armour) and explain that Dark Eldar are loathe to degrade themselves by learning the languages of lesser creaturesWould it be possible for DE to obtain higher craftsmanship versions of the translator units that covered other languages? High Gothic, Ork, Kroot, Tau, Stryxis, Techna-Lingua, etc. could, in theory, all be learned from captives and historical records might even allow for the Necrontyr tongue.\n\nThey're Eldar. I doubt they think of it as 'software' the way we do. Hell, it's possible the translator uses the lobotomised psyche of a human to reinterpret the data a transform it into a medium the user understand. Getting it to translate other languages would be a matter of implanting it with similarly 'treated' souls of other races"

I don't ned to fly a looping with a cruiser, it's to slow in turning.\nPutting 250degree phasers in it, doesn't feel like flying a Definat known from DS9, and even there, they fly loopings.\n\nSo, this is a little...frustrating.\nAt least, from Champions Online I know, the engine allows to go 90degree up and down.\nFirst-person-vew should also be realizable from CO, but it seems to be disabled for STO. Why?\n\nI don't think many would disagree with you, however, we are at the mercy of the devs on this one. This has been discussed often, even in the short time I'm a member.\n\nFingers crossed it's something they are working on long term, though to be honest I don't find it game breaking I can count on one hand the number opf times I've found myself directly under something, generally enemies and other things stay close to the galactic plane. Some schools of thought say that it makes the game more accessible (having a fixed plane of movement), some people just don't get on with space sims for this reason, they get disoriented.\n\nIt has it's plusses and minuses. Perhaps they could make it an option?Thats what made games like Klingon Academy so great.\nYou had a First Person mode, but still had full situational awareness thanks to a number of sensor displays, showing both XYZ axis readings as well as a small image of the target ship as viewed from your locationwell.. that all depends on what the OP meant by \"real 3D\"\n\nif he's talking about full directionalWell, first-person-view would be optional. If you wanted, you can use it. If you want full awareness and can't get it in fpv, you just don't zoom in so far.\n\nI don't think the game physics of IW fits to ST. Have you ever seen a ship looking into another direction as it actually moves? Not in ST. Babylon 5, yes. But not ST.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Shingi\n\nwell.. that all depends on what the OP meant by \"real 3D\"\n\nif he's talking about full directionalhope that clears up what i was trying to say there.\n\nI talked about turning.\nSo increasing the pitch beyond 60 degrees or whatever it is.\nAnd even when going over 90degrees, it could be possible to automatically turn the ships top back upside, so don't have any \"inversion\".\nBut I do think, the game engine can't handle this, so in my opinion 89 degree would already better than as it is nowActually, I do not think that is the case for the following reasons:\n\n1) Many times it can be heard impulse being ordered into \"full reverse\". If impulse engines operate on simple thrust, then they must be able to channel almost as much power forwards as backwards which means impulse \"ports\" on the front.\n\n2) I believe it has been stated by those at the top that Impulse engines operate by warping space, similar to warp engines, although not to the degree that they could travel \"faster\" than light.\n\n3) The thrusters clearly operate on thrust and could probably turn a low mass ship like the Defiant very quickly. Indeed, we saw the Enterprise D do a half turn in a matter of about a second (presumably using thrusters). Even if the impulse engines do work like thrusters, that has absolutely no bearing on turn speed. The ship could still do a loop or a barrel roll just as quickly regardless of the forward speed (that is how vector addition works). The only bearing having more thrust in the rear would have is on turn radius at high speeds, but not turn time."

Any of you guys care to elaborate on yourselves?\n\nAre you all just hopeless fanboys?\n\nOr is there some other thing in common?\n\nPS. I am not trying to insult anyone.\n\nI really like both universes. The idea of arguing the point is that i allows for people to think of new ideas that are really cool. We will never actually get to see a stardestroyer battle a covenant ship, but it would be fairly epic. Since we wont know the winner by actually having that happen in a game or movie or something, we have the story ,and essentially the battle, in our heads. However we are all fairly biased towards one side or another, so to keep it balanced we have both sides state their cases. Its just fun. If you dont enjoy it, dont bother wasting your ime on these forums.\n\nhere here, i could be considered a fanboy but im not sure about which.\n\nOn topic: if one jedi was sloppy and a flood spore got hold of him that would be it as far as im concerned. and as previously stated if the spartans were able to get force powers which is possible in the star wars universe via the vally of the jedi they would be almost unstoppable as it would add to their already augmented being. Though there is the possibility of over streching the body and mind of the spartens making them kind of useless \n\nDon't know if things infected by the flood would be able to use the force. When the flood infect things they change the composition of the cells of that organism. This might kill off the midi-chlorians and make them no longer able to use the force. And i don't know how well jedi could be infeceted. midi-chlorians might provide some kind of resistance to flood super-cells. I dont know, they are both independt imiginary (hate to break it to you, but they are) cells. I dont know how they would interact.\n\nIt really comes down to ground battle or space. Even then I think GR would win, just like against Star Trek, the Star Wars universe is just properly setup from a military standpoint (So is halo). Fighters is a big key to this, star wars is setup essentially like a carrier fleet, though all ships in the universe have decent amoutns of lasers, missiles and ion cannon, they also support large complements of fighter craft (a Star Destroyer has 6 TIE squadrons makign for 72 Ships) and Republic fighters are hyperspace capable. Bombers and interceptors would rule space and the skies, as all fighters are atmosphere capable. Halo is lacking decent fighter support, and no shields on the ones that exist, A-wings would mop the floor with Pelicans and the human fighters (can't remember the name) and B-wings would rip into Halo's ships and Stations. The Mac cannon would probably prove very effective against the largest ships in the GR, but it wouldn't really turn the tied, and shields would hold at least against a few rounds.\n\nThen you come to ground fights, here is where Halo would really shine, but only if the GR didn't have air support. Rebuplic troops would be roughly on par with Halo's soldiers, so without airsupport it would boil down to numbers and how well the Spartan's fair. Jedi would only have so much impact, while good at covert missions, unless they are of the superior variety (End/Book Luke, Vader, or Yoda) they would only be picked out by Halo's soldiers and shot into the ground (or rocketted). Spartans would be effective, but once again, target on the front lines, so support and covert action would suit them better.\n\nI think ground would be the more interesting, if the Jedi equiped blasters, they would be much more effective, as their limited pre-cog would be an asset as squad support. Space would just be boring. Don't forget if you put flood in it they arn't on anyones side, and Jedi would be pretty hard to catch with popcorn, if I can beat them with the butt of my rifle, imagine a trained jedi with light saber and force push, not saying its impossible but definaly hard.\n\nAlso if your going to lump universes (So that Spartans, Covenant and flood are working together) then you have to lump Star Wars as well, which dwarfs Halo's universe, even if you ignore the stupid Yung-Von (or whatever) from the latest and worst incarnation of the Star Wars books.\n\nFanboy crap is epic. but in these situations where the universes are merged the possibilities are endless. as much as weve talked about the spartens being infused with the force equally the sith could fire the halo rings solving all their problems in one\n\nok, someone finally mentioned the sith. (FYI) they can destroy stars just by, er... using the force. also, jedi can use the 'force' to completely neutralize lasers, making them harmless (or, in the sense that they wont make you blind) beams of light. not to mention the not too famous orbalisks, which can obliterate spores and make the host completely invincible, as their shells are impenetrable. *over and out*\n\nThe Star Wars universe has alot more overpowered stuff, which is why i thought this conversation was limited to the Galactic Republic versus the UNSC. Now allies could feasibly be included. For example, if you mess with the UNSC, they have their Elite allies to back them up (and the Galactic Republic has jedi friends, so they can be included). This is why I suggested 'weaponizing' flood spores. Jedi powers such as these were not common in the republic, at least not common enough to save the jedi form the clones.\n\nAnyways, as much as I would love to say Halo, Jedis could take down the UNSC with the force. The spartans may be elite soldiers, but they can be easily countered with the force alone. Let alone the fact that each jedi is highly skilled with their light sabers.\n\nyou can see them coming. It is very difficult to sneak up on a jedi. And sniping would be difficult because of the rediculous reflexes. Clones were able to get very close and suprise them with LASER weapons at close range. That is difficult to block, but a bullet might be different\n\nin space it would be pretty onesided with star wars winning.ground battles would be a little differnt because of spartens and elites. brutes and humans would be wasted by storm troopers but everyone would be killed by jedi\n\nauren wrote:Courscant has a shield over the entire planet.

If it isn't just going to use radius, it should use cube of radius since ships are three dimensional objects?\n\nIt's not so much about realism as balance. If you add up all the radiuses of ships in a cap, you tend to get much lower totals for low-cap ships than for high-cap ships. So it's much harder to boost the attacks of a cap of high-cap ships. If you instead look at the squares of ships' radiuses, the total per cap is approximately independent of cap size. (There's great variation between ship types, but those are the trends.) This is the point I was ineloquently trying to make in this post a while ago. The graphs show that a cap of high-cap ships should be just as easy to boost as a cap of low-cap ships (on average), but this contradicts players' experience.\n\nAnyway, when I get some time I'll try and set up a little experiment with carefully chosen starting bonus ships against 1/1 Turtles, and try to confirm my hunch. (Or anyone's welcome to beat me to it!)\n\nI just corrected the Armor Boosters entry on the TZR page and updated a number of other entries; if someone with wiki access can think of a good description for the nanoswarm (or just copy the game's one) to replace the Mimic entry I'd appreciate it\n\nWhile we're on radiuses, I've a strong hunch the number of ships a booster can boost is actually being calculated based on the ships' radiuses, rather than the squares of their radiuses.

Feel free to add to it, or suggest here and I can add. I think it makes life easier for the devs to consolidate them like this, plus it helps avoid duplicate reports.\n\nDoes anyone know if there's a way to close old Mantis reports? Mantis 9307 is already done, and Mantis 6523 was long ago made redundant by intervening changes.\n\nI'm not sure which I find more befuddling, the fact you gave an answer already given by Chris, or the fact you just answered a question posed in 2010\n\nI don't want to rob you of your critical reading skills by explaining.\n\nSorry if I sounded rude. Last time I saw such a break in a thread it was because someone had responded to a post by a sophisticated spambot, which was subsequently deleted. I'd just thought something similar might have happened here.\n\nSo previously, Sniper Turrets got a higher attack bonus against Raid Starships (UltraLight hulls) than most other ships. I think that meant they would tend to auto-target Raid Starships ahead of most other targets based on the usual logic about maximising damage (not certain because I used to target them manually). And that's what you want, as Raid Starships are incredibly dangerous, and their radar dampening, immunities, and high armor mean Sniper Turrets are one of the few defenses that are effective against them. But now, Sniper Turrets get the same bonus against Raid Starships as against a variety of other common targets. So do they still preferentially target Raid Starships, or have we inadvertently made them \"dumber\"? Would it be worth slightly increasing their bonus vs. UltraLight hulls to improve their \"intelligence\"?\n\nIf you press tab to bring up the galaxy map, you can select a filter near the bottom of the screen that will show you which planets contain champion wormholes.

But linking their names doesnt give them rights to anything. Is that possible, or is that what the holding corp is for?\n\nlike to keep an alt in there or something?\n\nPretty much. You can do it with an out-of-the-box character really and maybe 1 hour of training, and have individuals do the same. It'll also let you pay alliance bills with said people and etc.\n\nAlso, CAOD is probably the worst place for asking for advice. Well, a room full of starving jackles after having just finished working a 14-hour shift in a meat-packing plant might come close, but yeah, other forums besides CAOD might get better responses.\n\nThe only way to do it is to have your designated diplo put an alt into the holding corp and then make that character a director so it can set standings. Unfortunatly it can do all sorts of other stuff BoB style, but there's no medium.\n\nDespite repeated requests from CEO's, CCP has never added a non-director standing-setting role for corps or alliances."

Then people who like the challenge of busting up campers could still have that option, but more casual gamers could choose an easier server. For me, this game has been ruined by all the people who think it's fun to camp on the other teams spawn pointAnd the battle to get all bases could go on for a pretty long time too. Still, if WH bases were the barren wastelands they are in SH, many would just skip the bases and go for the raping straight away.\n\nRe: Why Base Rapes in Starhawk are going to be more frequent and worse than in Warhawk, In a single picture\n\nThat is indeed the reality. In addition, there's only three options in this game: Your team is base-raped or enemy team is base-raped, or there's a stand-still between the two where two bases are incredibly turreted-up and both teams have multiple tanks/hawk on the move.\n\nThere's nothing in between these. There's no middle point on the battle field that needs to be crossed before a base-rape can begin on the other side of the battle-field. It simply happens. Today, twice, my team had no structures and were being pwn'd to death. Hacker skill-Steal their launch pad hawk, and the battle-field turned all around. In a matter of minutes, the opponents base was being raped by my teams clusters and torpedo's.\n\nIn Warhawk, however, there were bases that needed to be captured before moving forward. I miss that.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nMain account is Gorbad. Don't expect posts from this account anymore.\n\nRe: Why Base Rapes in Starhawk are going to be more frequent and worse than in Warhawk, In a single picture\n\nYes well if SH had real bases with non destructable buildings placed in stategic locations it would help alot. I dont know, maybe alot of people would play WH differently now that they have played SH\n\nMaybe, but i don't think they'd have that much success and in great measure because you had lots of cover in most main bases in WH. I know because i've seen lots of people that would try to play WH with that mindset, as if there were no bases in between main bases and their impact on the game's outcome was only superficial.\n\nI've seen several people who would spawn, get the TOW and throw it at the enemy's main base, but that was probably a wasted TOW because the other team was in a base capturing it for territory. I've seen people spawning and flying in a straight line to the flag in WH and that was so stupid and ineffective against a team with more than 2 brain cells because probably that player would have to go through the bases that the enemy had captured in the meantime.\n\nIt's one of the biggest things that bugs me in SH, that rush tactics were made valid and effective. Spawn, get the bigger weapons like Torpedo or clusters and you can destroy the enemy's base. Spawn, rush to the flag and if you're out of their base, your chances are good of getting it back.\n\nI always laughed at rushers in WH but SH came and took the strategic fight for territory away. Now it's fight for each other's main base and that makes it so that a baseraping can take place really quickly.\n\nRe: Why Base Rapes in Starhawk are going to be more frequent and worse than in Warhawk, In a single picture\n\nDude that is the point, you're supposed to put buildings down to make cover\n\nWalls are actually useful, believe it or not. They cost very little rift energy, too. Sadly they're taken down easily. Seeing as the bruiser skill is going to get nerfed a bit, it should be interesting to see how long walls will last with the upcoming update. Hopefully slightly longer."

The galaxy is an incredibly dangerous place, unless youíre trying to instantaneously warp across unfathomable distances, in which case itís perfectly safe. 35.

      "text": "threads that go like this: \"As a Fed escort, I cannot solo or tank against 5 klinks who are playing as a team. This proves Klingon cloaking is broken.\"\n\nI am one of those BoP pilots that loves to Battlecloak just to hear the screams of rage from the Fed players, and I have a few comments.\n\nFirst: If you're a target of a Klink alpha strike, you won't survive without teammates healing you or unless you have a defensive ability like RSP or popping an evasive burst. I can flip that argument, and also point out if you're a single Klink in the middle of a Fedball that is focusing fire, you are equally dead just as quickly.\n\nSecond: This is a team game. You can't think of this as a solo game where your given ship class can beat every other ship class every time. Heals, buffs, debuffs...they're all important. In T2, the Feds have such a huge potential advantage in this that they could dominate the tier (like they did in beta) if they really wanted to. But doing this properly is my third point....\n\nThird: This game is about skill. Very much about skill. Now it's true that as a BoP I usually consider Fed escorts to be a tasty snack...however I've flown against plenty of GOOD escort pilots who know how to fly their ships and who can tear me into pieces if I'm not careful. It's the same with cruisers and sci ships. It's very apparent to me which fed pilots know what they're doing, and which ones are spamming spacebar and not using effective BO abilities.\n\nFourth: Having Klinks run and cloak is what you want as a Fed. You want them forced out of combat...even temporarily...in order to focus down the remaining Klinks. If I get pushed off and battlecloak to escape, I'm now doing ZERO DPS for my team. The pursuing Feds won't get the kill against me, but they will immediately be able to push spacebar again and continue DPS against the remaining Klinks. If I turn around and engage again, the cooldown on battlecloak will leave me exposed (and very killable) for the next 20 seconds. And 20 seconds in a BoP is a lifetime. Forcing that Klink to run is a temporary mission kill...sure you don't get the epeen rush of an explosion...and sure it doesn't directly show up on the scoreboard...but you've neutralized that Klink. He's gone. He's not kllling anyone on your team. And he's left you to be able to more effectively focus fire on his teammates. He's just made it easier for you to do your job and get focus fire on the other ships. Remember...PvP is ultimately about effective dps and dps mitigation, and cloaked ships do zero dps.\n\nThat. That right there is your mistake. You do not try and turn round. While you're waiting for the Klingons to decloak you have your engines at full power. As soon as that first enemy spot shows up on your sensors or that first sound of a cloaking device touches your ears you pound evasive like your life depends on it (it kind of does). You have a modicum of leeway if there's other escorts but if you're the only one you run.\n\nAt that point the initial alpha likely misses or if not does only medium damage. The Klingons suddenly find their target not only lived but is currently utterly out of weapon range entirely. Hopefully your friends and ally's now focus fire one or two down.\n\nIf you find yourself as the only escort. You mission is no longer damage. It is survival. You are bait.\n\n+1. For those reading the above and disagreeing, there is what the 'problem' is. Escort drivers believe that they and they alone should be the one that wins the glory. Not the class, but the human player playing the game. I am not trying to make this a Fed vs Klingon thing because it is not, or at best only on the periphery of the reason what is the root of this issue. It has to do with wanting to capture that storybook James Kirk feeling of never loosing playing the Federation side. Lip service is paid to the 'team' concept of course, but it is never really truly believed, because that 'the Federation never looses' concept is ingrained from canon. Those that play the Klingon side, because of the mechanics of the game take a more realistic approach because those mechanics teach us to be that way. They literally force us to team and teach us that the fist is always mightier (and safer) than the finger.\n\nAllow me to present a scenario to illustrate. Please note that I will be using you and your within the scenario which will be generic you and yours and do not mean you personally. Look at it honestly and try to imagine what you yourself would honestly do rather than what you wish you would do. You in an escort spawn in to Cracked Planet with another escort, and two cruisers with a science vessel. You are playing T2. Your team is not a pre-made, but not inexperienced as all are lvl 12-13. Your first reaction and practice from experience is to ball. This is sound defensive doctrine. Your second reaction is to form a team. Again sound doctrine as it allows you to trade information about what capabilities you and your teammates have. As you are pre-made and probably do not have access to some voice chat, you use the team text chat. Some time passes and you start getting nervous as you know the Klinks are out there but that damn cloak of theirs is more than annoying. You want to get it over with. Up to this point YOU are probably nodding your head saying 'yup that is me'. This is where it goes wrong and makes the point mentioned above. The Klinks de-cloak and alpha strike and it is YOU.\n\nNow to illustrate my point; your first reaction upon hearing 'Warning. Shields Failing' as posted many times is NOT to run by hitting full power to engines and evasive maneuvers or bunker up with all power to shields, but to see what is shooting at you so you can turn and fight. How is this benefiting your TEAM? Have you made a pre-made text saying you are under attack to warn them? You know from painful experience that escorts are targeted first because not only they the 'easy' kills but they are also the class which can hurt the BoPs the quickest. Yet, knowing this your first reaction is not about your team or applying the knowledge you have learned from encounter after encounter but to do a Kirk/Rambo in turning to shoot down and win against all realistic odds.\n\nThe Klingon side on the other hand have been taught right from the beginning that the way to win is through the team. Cloak gives us a first strike advantage, and while our weapons are powerful yes, they are not ALL powerful. A lone BoP that jumps an escort can just about get that escort to a kill, but not quite. After that, it becomes a bank and weave melee which more times than not will result in the BoP loosing (not due to less maneuverability, but because of a weaker hull and bleedthrough damage). This teaches us to ALWAYS attack with pairs and groups. This further teaches us that our BoPs are indeed eggshells with a big gun.\n\nNow let us reverse that scenario. In this case you are playing the Klingon. You have learned it is the team that wins not you personally. Your 5 man team is all cloaked and you have the same scenario as above with regards pre-made and text chat. In this scenario you do not face ANY escorts but 3 cruisers and 2 science ships. No easy kills here. This is where the script changes somewhat from the usual occurrence when playing as a Fed. That is not to say it ALWAYS happens because we too have our Rambos but is common enough to be relied upon (and where the TEAM can actually USE the Rambos to best effect as well). After waiting and observing for what seems forever, analyzing the Fed ball movement patterns and looking for ANY ***** or mistake, one Klingon, usually the best tank, will volunteer to de-cloak and be focus fired to allow the rest of the team to bag one hopefully two kills. He volunteers knowing that he has maybe a 10% chance of surviving as he needs to be focus fired by the complete fed ball in order to draw their attention to him and allow the team to attack opposite from him. De-cloaking alone will not cause the ball to react, but attacking one of those same ships will. This is why it illustrates that difference. I am not saying that that player is more noble blah blah, but that he has been taught that he alone does not win, but that the TEAM wins.\n\nSame game, different equipment and a totally different mental mindset is what is illustrated above. Until that understanding of the mindset is acknowledged and applied to the game dynamics, calls for nerfs will never be taken seriouslyFunny for me as fed science vessel it is more like 90% win in space pvp. U sure u play it right ? If a klingon decloak behind u and tractor beam to nuke u down just use sensor jam or brace impact or even both. And dont forget u also cn break tractor beam or make it less effective by using more power in engines.\n\nBut u kinda right that the firt guy focused by the klinogn group dies fast. But this is due to the fact no1 heals in the game. I have heavily focused on healing and when I apply my buffs I heal for 6000 + 50% less dmg buff for 20 sec. That can counter 2 Klingons nuking 1 fed. Normally enough to win the fightBeam target shields will still heal the shields under RSP until it 'procs' and they evaporate.\n\nThe problem comes from people using solo skills and then trying to PVP. People are equipped to maximise solo potential whilst grinding quests to be honest. I personally did the same whilst getting my fed to 45, ALL my skills were to aid my soloability not to help anyone else.\n\nEven people I know do the same (science ships with NO teambuffs) just skills that aid themselves.\n\nAnd due to klingons doing PVP primarily they're obviously going to have PVP orientated skills.\n\nIt still depends on player skill and their ability to adapt, a game in OB, it was all fed cruisers. Playing klingon and a random team, group together, decide to attack one, 3 klingons die because the others healed the cruiser we were targetting and we didn't react to take them down, regroup. call a target list of the healers we now know, repeat till win.\n\nI am seriously howling at people who say that Klingons that Battle Cloak during a fight are without honor. Without honor, no, smart, yes. Let me explain.\n\nYou use your fedball because 1v1 you get smoked (because most of you PVE most of the time and have not been forced to learn to PVP as we have. Not that you are all bad at it, but we are FORCED to PVP and get good at it). You get free blues from quests, and outgun the majority of Klingons, but you have not been forced to learn how to play defensively. When you fedball, your gear shines through and you tear us a new corn hole.\n\nIs the fedball without honor? No, because it is what you have to do to survive. Now ...\n\nIn order for us to survive and pick off stragglers of your fedball, we need to rush in, get your aggro, gtfo (combat cloak), spin around and pick off one or two that don't rush off to find us.\n\nYour fedball is annoying (because you rip us new ones), and our cloak is annoying (because sometimes you don't use the abilities at your disposal to find us, and you rage over it)\n\nI hear so many people talking about OP. But truth is, you could have all the best gear and all the skill points for all your Boff's but if you charge into a ball at full impulse you will have no REAL weapon power or shield power for aprox 12 sec. ( keep your power meter on setting 3 to see the fluctuation) in that time you ill be getting pummeled by all 5 enemies at once.\n\nso its not that the enemy is overpowered, you are under powering your self when you fight like that.\n\nTactical solution, if your fed stay in a tight ball and let them come to you. 10 to one says they will come at full impulse. focus fire on the bird first!.\n\nTactical solution, if your Klingon slow to normal speed 20km out and group in a tight formation. this keeps you all hitting the same shield for max penetration. focus fire on the science ships first. then escorts."

      "text": "Sounds like we will probably want a generalized heuristic search function over the starlane graph. We could used a simple shortest-ETA heuristic in order to suggest travel routes to players and the player could then modify the route any way they want. For the AI, we could plug in a more advanced heuristic so that it can figure out what route it wants to travel.\n\nI think, if the Player selects Fleet A, and moves around with the mouse over other Planets, there should be a red line indicating the shortest way. If for some reasons (e.g. the 10-doomstar-fleet nearby) doesnt want this way, but another, he would have to shift-click the first waypoint of the other way he wants, and moving the mouse over planets would then give him the shortest way from the waypoint to the planets.\n\nA nice addon would be, if moving around the mouse, the player gets a red line showing the shortest way, and a dotted red line showing the second-shortest way, and by pressing 2 while alt-clicking the target he selects the second-shortest way.\n\nI like how MOO3 handles this. You choose the average number and length of starlanes on galaxy generation. The only thing I'd add to this would be a mini-map example of each kind, just so the player sees exactly what 'many starlanes, moderate length' really means.\n\n_________________ Surprise and Terror! I am greeted by the smooth and hostile face of our old enemy, the Hootmans! No... the Huge-glands, no, I remember, the Hunams!\n\nForgot to mention, the reason why I want to be able to change offroad costs also is so that in a game of no starlanes a player can send their fleets to a location in space somewhere, between planets, ready for an ambush or an unexpected assault.\n\nEg, in Stars! planets can only detect cloaked ships a certain distance - so you maneuver those ships between planets so that it remains unobserved.\n\nWell, I'd like to have deep space movement as an option as well. Using starlanes should be the usual thing, but for advanced players the startegic possibilities of deep space should be open. To be choosen at the start of the game of course. And no support for single play (to cut AI difficulties).\n\nThus in a MP advanced players could use deep space movement, while inexperienced players and the AI don't have to worry about it.\n\nThere is a prob;em with a No Starlane game. Namely the range of ships. With starlanes its not a problem because we limit the number of hops for various engine classes. However for no starlanes we don't want a player to be able to bomb your homeworld on turn 25. So we have a few things we can do.\n\n1. Draw a circle around each planet and you can move with starlanes to any planet in a circle which increases with engine speed.\n2. Have a seperate tech (fuel cells) a la MoO 1-2. Which increases the circle size.\n3.Limit the number of starlane hops depending on engine tech. That way if there is a starlane that is VERY long you can use it on the first turn of the game. and if you expand to a planet on the other side then you can simultaneously have expansion on both sides of the universe.\n4. some kind of combination?\n\nIf we want to make a no-starlane game possible then we should go with 1 or 2.\n\nI think range should apply to both starlane and offroad travelling. Starlanes aren't wormholes as far as I am concerned. I prefer to view things in more of a Star Wars manner where star lanes would equal a well mapped and free-of-trouble route through space. Also I don't see a compelling gameplay reason why starlanes should make you travel further. Starlanes are already X times faster than offroading so going off road is already sufficiently unattractive, no need to through another negative into the mix.\n\nThe star-wars idea is quite nice, but how will the range-thing be done? I didn't like the system of moo2, where you can fly from A to B, because C is close enough to B.\n\nSo, if you have a linear universe having planets at positions\n1 4 9 50 55 57\nAnd you have bases on\n1 4 57\nit would be easy to fly from 4 to 51 with a range of 5, since 55 is only 2 away from your closest base.\nI think the refuelling system of space-ward ho is much better, but maybe the moo2-system is easier for gameplay, and less fleet-micromanaging-intense.\n\nAlso, i don't think offroad travel should be a racepick but a technology, and total invisbility would be an extremly powerfull pick"

      "text": "\"Flags are 256 x 160 pixels and are PNG files and they'll work on EVA flags and the ones that are in the space center. Additionally they should keep in mind that the textures are going to be square in memory. So that flag is 256 x 256 from a memory perspective.\"\n\nIn the style of \"are you sure it is plugged in\" computer repair ..... did you take the Coffee Beans out of the deck? For a 5 player game you remove all of them before you start play. That alone (factoring out the number of cards used for players starting hands) would reduce the size of the draw pile by nearly 20%\n\nYou did nothing wrong. Thats exactly what happens in a Duna encounter.\n\nThough it may be simpler to think of it not as you going 2Km/s too fast. Think of it as you staying still and Duna rushing past your spot at 2Km/s. You have to burn to catch up.\n\nIf you have ever seen folks on the forums talk about 'aerobreaking', thats one way to save fuel. When Duna comes zipping past you, enter its atmosphere a bit. Its like jumping into a slipstream of a 2Km/s wind. The atmosphere will push on your ship a lot and cause it to change velocity to better match that of Duna. Its a tricky procedure but saves you lots of fuel.\n\nBy creeping up on it a bit at a time. Dont try and cover the whole distance all at one go. Imagine it like golf. To hit a hole in one is next to impossible. So what you want to do is a series of approaches. Closer and closer with each shot.\n\nStep one: Hold your position. Set the station as your target, then switch to targeting mode on the navball. (Click on the text above the ball to switch between target/orbit/surface modes.) Turn around until you are lined up on the retrograde marker (The triangle shaped yellow marker.) Slowly throttle up your engines and watch your velocity readout right above the navball. When you get it as close to zero as you can, cut your engines.\n\nStep two: Nudge closer Turn around until you are facing the target marker on the navball. (The pink circle shaped marker.) Now switch to map mode. You will see two red arrows, one on your own orbit and one on the orbit of the station. Slowly fire up your engines. Those two red arrows will start sliding around. When you get them as close to each other as you can, cut your engines.\n\nStep three: wait No, seriously. Wait. Dont rush this part. Time warp a bit if your impatient but do not go on to the next step until your ship is right at the point where those two red arrows are lining up in map mode.\n\nStep four: Repeat steps one through three. Think of it like the golf metaphor again. When you take a shot and wind up near the green, you may be to the left of the green, to the right, in front of it, behind it. Each time you come to rest, you have to re evaluate your situation and figure out what direction you need to go to next. Then when you are on the green you have to wait till the ball stops rolling and once again figure out if you are to the left or the right of the hole. Each time through this process, your stroke power will become less and less, but the direction you have to turn for the next shot is likely going to be vastly diffident.\n\nOnce your close enough then you can switch to RCS thrusters and dock, but thats a whole other set of skills. Practice rendezvous a dozen or so times first.\n\nRemember his idea was that the other player would start on a second planet. And you would not know what one so you would have to search. A good estimate if my friend and I started playing today, we would first encounter each other sometime in 2019.\n\nThis is an old Old OLD question that gets asked on a fairly regular basis. It can not be done and there are multiple reasons it cant be done.\n\nFirst of all, the physics models are only loaded for objects that are within 2.5 kilometers of your current vessel. If the centre of mass of the object you are trying to dock with is more than 2.5Km away from the docking port, no docking will be done as the object you are trying to dock with will still be \"on rails\".\n\nNow if your willing to cheat, you can open the save file in a text editor and hack together all the parts by hand. But even at that you run into a bigger issue. A ring around Kerbin would be something on the order of 1.2 milion parts. Its doubtful that any home computer would have the memory requirements to so much as load the save game file.\n\nThink about it, if there were no social ramifications for driving up to a gas station, filling up your car, and then just driving away without paying, would you not at least do it every once in awhile?\n\nScott Manley himself hangs out in these forums. He is /user/illectro so you may want to just ask him directly.\n\nAs a guess, Im thinking it is a second game. On the menu screen where you load a saved game, its just a second game he is running and in this one he can cheat to no end. Use hyperedit and so forth. A testing grounds if you will where he can try out new designs.\n\nI know thats what I do at least. When building a rocket I will construct and test it in my \"training grounds\" save and once it is finalized I will copy the craft over into me \"explore\" folder.\n\nLearning how to make an orbit is one of the first 'waypoints' in the game. Understand that no matter what, its going to be quite a changeling for you to do but once you do you will be overcome with the most amazing feeling of accomplishment.\n\nThat being said, orbiting is not just getting up. Its moving fast enough sideways that when you come back down you will \"bypas\" the ground. Im assuming you pressed \"M\" at some point to look at your map. Did you see how the arch you were travelling in mad your touchdown spot off to the east of the space centre? Well what you need to do is burn east so that touchdown spot will get further away from the space centre. Burn hard enough, and that touchdown spot will keep getting further and further away until it gets so far away that it wraps totaly around the globe and puts you back right where you were. Thats orbit.\n\nWhat the exact combination of \"burn up\" and \"burn east\" is to get you there? Well thats a complex topic. At some points in your orbit you want to be burning more up than east. And at other points you want to be burning more east that up. This video and this video will explain it better than I ever could.\n\nSecond, yes it is possible to dock one ship to another in orbit. But if you thought making it to orbit was complicated, thats nothing compared to the chalange of learning how to do an orbital rendezvous. But it can be done, so yes.\n\nYou do want an intercept, but you dont want the intercept to match your apoapsis. Your apoasis should be further out past jools orbit.\n\nFor a regular jool intercept, your launch window is when jool is about 95 degrees ahead of Kerbin. For a gravity assist make it something higher than that. Like 120 degrees. Then when you burn, burn longer than it would take to get out to jools orbit. Keep raising your apoasis. The outbound spot where you cross jools orbit will keep getting closer and closer to jool until you intercept.\n\nYour intercept will not have you on a path where you are coming in parallel to jools orbit, rather you will be zipping past it on your way out.\n\nHalfway there do an adjustment burn so that you will come in on the trailing side."

      "text": "That was my logic with regards to agility vs turning. Also I'd envisage scenarios where Ties provide escort to these as they lumber forward to destroy a ground target that only their weapons can defeat. Rebel fighters obviously aiming to stop this. AT-ATs can lose a turn of moving closer to the target if they wish to gain an additional attack die.\n\nAs for Gen Veers points, there was no thought to this as I have no idea how to grade the various pilots.\n\nEither way if FFG never release the walker I'll probably pic a few up from other suppliers and go with this scenario and a few more of these cards.\n\nIf we get Turbo Laser turrets for the Death Star, why not other ground units? They'd be scenario-based but it would still be pretty cool. I have some MicroMachine AT-ATs that could be used for such scenarios.\n\nRemember Hoth? He needs way more shields than that, that chassis is almost impenatrable…\n\nalmost impenatrable to speeders, however\n\nWith Ties aiming to shoot down rebel fighters I would expect the rebel player is in the position of\n\nA. do I clear the Ties and conentrate on the potentially close range AT-ATs with my squadron.\n\nor\n\nB. Concentrate on the AT-ATs and hope the Ties roll poorly in attack in order to have any ships remaining.\n\nSo playtesting will focus on finding balance depending on the number of fighters, AT-ATs, distance to close to target (which would require a target lock) etc.\n\nIf I do the maths and assume the AT-AT fits on the Falcons base size and on a 4' table the AT-AT should be in firing range in 5 moves (assuming it is never staionary). It has an escort of 3 Ties against 2 X-wing and 1Y-Wing. (I'd assume due to the inclusion of the walker that the Ties will be low pilot skills and the Rebels a higher quality with a few upgrades). With a hull 9, its survivability will depend on point A and B above. Also I would expect the Target will have some sheilds, these my be reduced by the Ties (no target lock) however the final blow must come from the walkerDude that is Awesome! I've been thinking up AT-AT vs snow speeder scenarios for awhile. The creation of this card greatly helps. I think you have the specs dead on. But personally I think it should have a point value of around 40-50. May I ask what software or how you came by designing this card? Because its pretty rad!\n\nIn game terms, I think the speed is too fast. :)\nYes I concider the 1 forward being too fast if compared to ships. I'd give it ½ a movement forward concidering it's top speed was 60km/h.\nAlso concidering the fact that if you'd like to circle that thing 3times when trying to use the towcable, it would move too fast.\n\nIf I remember correctly, an AT-AT has to stop in order to turn an then it rotates on spot to a new heading before moving forward again. So it should have a move dial of ½ forward, S left, S, S right (\"S\" being stationary).\n\n\"When making a Stationary turn, rotate the model up to 90degrees\" Would this make sense?- Attack 0\n\n- Agility 0\n\n- Hull 2\n\n- Shields 6\n\nMuch appreciated.\n\nStationary ability- Reasoning was Millenium Falcon has agility 1, and I thought there was now way a walker was as agile as the falcon.\n\nEscorts- I like this a lot and will explore it more, mainly when I have access to the new upgrade cards.\n\nHeavy Armour- I see what you mean and while impervious to speeders I have no idea how they deal with X-Wings, protons etc as I expect that perhaps they will over time cause damage to the hull. Looking through the damage deck I noticed only 3 cards are useless as a result for the AT-AT, Structural Damage, Minor Hull Breach and Damaged Engine. Mainly because they deal with turns the AT-AT can'r preform anyway. I did toy with the idea of only crits being effective but I had to appreciate that it will take much longer to bring the walker down and therefore tip the balance that the game needs.\n\nAs yet I have not devised a way an AT-AT can recieve a stress marker. (still working on it) Since they have no red maneuver.\n\nShield Generators- As I said Ties can take down its shields without a Target Lock (since they don't have that luxury) however only the walker can affect its hull value (with Target Lock) so I'm happy with the target hull only being affected by the heavy lasers.\n\nAttack 0- Not sure why you wouldn't want the walker to fire its lasers\n\nAgility 0- I agree\n\nSheilds 6- I can't find any reference of the AT-AT being fitted with sheilds. If I'm wrong glad to be set straight\n\nHull 2 - In order to replicate its armour without sheilds 9 seemed appropriate. Even if it had sheilds with your stats its still 8 hits till it comes down so we're not that much different."

Sure, why not.\n\nThe argument could be made that you should maximize your abilities, though. Attack Pattern Alpha gives you a damage buff, so the more damage you have TO buff, the more helpful it will be. With that in mind, you'd want to be in the highest DPS ship there is: an Escort.\n\nSimilarly, Engineers get Rotate Shield Frequencies, so you'd think it would make sense for them to be in the ship that gets the biggest shield bonus, which is Cruisers.\n\nBut if you tend to like hybrids, then a Tactical in a Cruiser would be giving up some DPS for some survivability.

Ie occiosionally a ship might be hostile to a race who notoriety is neutral to this ship and perhpas visa versa if I cant find a way to make the oppsoite case work to improve relations.\n\nBasically just to spice the race relations up an little and create some race relations movement. Conversely Im also looking for way for races to improve their notoriety to each other (trashing it while fuin is easy) - in either case, I need an oppotune point at which to apply changes to a ship.\n\nThe environment signal might actually be a good intercept rather than having to modify a huge amount of the game unnessessarily - in reality this doesnt desprately need to happen at create time, just that seemed a convenient time, but I dont want to be trawling every ship in the universe occasionally either for perf reasons - we allready have enough scripts that need to trawl through way too much to do what they need to do\n\nAnyway - just an experiment at the moment on top of some more interesting race and faction relations stuff Im playing around"

So you made 20 billion. How many hours of game play did that require? Would you consider the ganking to have been difficult? Or pretty easy? Do you think the level of difficulty and time you put into it is proportional with that reward? Or do you think it is imbalancedYou understand that he had 11 billion before he ganked a single ship or bought a single unit of oxygen isotopes?Regardless, none of this has any relevance at all to my initial points here:\n\nAtrum Veneficus wrote:\n\nMirima Thurander wrote: removed.\n\nAny post that can be summed up as \"\" because ganking wont be free any more\"\" is not valid.\n\nI haven't read the rest of this thread but essentially all you are doing is cutting poor pilots out of ganking.\n\nLet me put it to you this way: beforeI have enough isk to suicide gank for years. Concord insurance makes no impact on my choice to kill your stuff. Most \"professional\" suicide gankers have similar stories. Their wealth comes from other means and they are going to wreck you for laughs, not for profit. So changing the insurance policy makes no difference to them and they are probably the largest portion of suicide gankers.\n\nSo who does removing insurance hurt?\n\nScenario 1: The clueless newbie. At one point in our eve careers we were all this guy. I'm sure we all have stories about how we were blown up in empire by concord with no idea what we did wrong. Sometime back in 2007 when I first started, I was repping some corpmate doing missions in my Exqueror, a salvager/loot stealer came in, my corpmate did something to him, and concord blew up my corpmate and my exequeror. I have no idea what I did, thinking back it was probably because I'd assigned my drones to the corpmate.\n\nRegardless, my clueless corpmate and I doing L4 missions died to Concord for no other reason than being bothered by a buzzard in a mission. No insurance payout in the world you are proposing for the reason of being helplessly new at the game. Let's not ignore all the Concord executions that occur during Empire Incursions. Some of those are pure accidents. No insurance payouts there?\n\nScenario 2: The guy wanting to try something new. In your adolescent phase of Eve Online, you are still trying to figure out who you want to be. A miner? A mission runner? A 0.0 bitter political arm-chair general? A low-sec pirate? An NPC 0.0 pirate? A mercenary corp? An empire war-dec corp? An inventory, production, market, or logistics services? A scammer? A ganker? Most of us have tried several roles and the biggest barriers to entry are the initial capital cost. You don't leap into moon mining or capital ship production because they cost billions of isk in start-up capital. Instead you stick to areas that are cheap to get into with minimal losses if you find you don't like it.\n\nYour proposed changes would essential create a barrier of entry for trying out empire ganking. Empire ganking would become the province of the individually wealthy, the elite, those for whom price is no object. The poor huddled masses will be excluded from trying out this hilariously fun past-time because you've introduced a barrier of entry to keep them from even trying out the sport. How very Republican of you. Let's watch Fox News together while clubbing baby seals.\n\nSo for the tldr crowd: your proposed changes make no difference to the truly dedicated crowd while hurting a lot more people than your intent.That's half true. If ganking were harder or more costly or easier to protect against the threat would have carried less credibility and have had less of an effect. Just because the change in price came before the actual ganking doesn't mean it wasn't tied to the actual ganking. If market speculators were accurately predicting the impact it would have then it doesn't matter whether they took action early or late.\n\nAtrum Veneficus wrote:\n\nRegardless, none of this has any relevance at all to my initial points here:\n\nI don't totally disagree with you. I'm suspicious that removing insurance isn't the right solution. My gut instinct is that the best solution would be to make ganking more challenging. In fact, I just lean that way in general with everything in eve. More challenge = good. You guys are experienced players fighting noobs. Stacking the deck in favor of the noobs would make the game more fun and challenging for both sides. They'd stand more of a chance so when they did their jobs well (given their limited experience and resources) they'd be rewarded for that by surviving. That is a more meaningful kind of challenge. Think of it like this. Are first graders more challenged by giving them a test on their ability to read or by giving them a calculus problem? I'd say the former because the later is so far outside of their abilities that they can't even really take on the challenge. At the same time,you'd have to play at the height of your game to take them down, so you'd be getting more challenge too. That's good for everybody, right? Wouldn't you deep down rather do stuff in the game that tests your abilities pretty rigorously?\n\nWhat form more making it more challenging would take I don't know. IMO it shouldn't be something that just like dictates a specific fitting of a particular ship to get your alpha high enough, or that means you need to bring more ships, it should be something more nuanced like a better way for players to come to each others' defense or ways to make the gankers be on the move the whole time they're in system like when they have -5 standing or whatever. Something that requires really being on the ball.\n\nBut, I haven't ever ganked and I was only ganked once while transporting stuff like 2 years ago, so I don't really know if it is in fact too easy to pull off for the ganker. It certainly seems like it would be from the outside, but if it honestly is already quite challenging, that would certainly change my view. I'd be interested in your thoughts on that.\n\nI do think using the insurance system to collect for ships you committed suicide in is fishy. IMO CCP should fix stuff like that just on principle I guess. If you self destruct your insurance is voided, so I don't see why \"suicide by cop\" would be treated differently. But yeah, I don't really think that's a big deal either way.\n\nI've counted up the many hours I've spent suicide ganking between my main and alts. My targets are generally miners - Mackinaws and Hulks. I've counted up the hours spent on sec-status repair.\n\nAdded up the gains from the salvage and loot drops and insurance, and subtracted premiums and mods lost from ganking.\n\nTurns out I'm actually earning NEGATIVE income per hour. Only the odd Intact Armor Plate drop / faction booster allows you to turn a profit.\n\nI could have earned FAR more ISK just running LVL 4 missions - or just mining myself.\n\nTell me again, why does this activity need a nerf? I would figure that LVL4 bounties need to be reduced long before insurance payments need to be skewed against people who make a living suicide ganking.\n\nIs this just a strategic whine thread from miners who want to force professional gankers to go after haulers instead?Posted - 2011.11.01 21:18:00 -\n[131] - QuoteYour just so far off base with the miners needing the subsidy I can only assume your being obtuse. Or maybe, just maybe you haven't bothered to measure the cost difference of building/buying a hulk and the appropriate insurance payout and compared that to the cost's for say a brutix. That or your completely clueless and are simply trolling. Neither scenario would shock me in the least.\n\nI'd get into you continued proclamation of suicide ganking having some type of risk, but when your so clearly able to ignore simple mathematics I fear the conversation would be at best tiresome.\nMy opinion is actually very much in line with this. Get rid of insurance altogether. It's kind of ridiculous when you think about it. Who the hell would insure battleships in the jacked up universe that is Eve? How do you make that business model profitable? Here, pay me a fraction of the hull price, and when your ship inevitably dies, I'll pay you way more than you paid in!\n\nScrap insurance, reduce build minerals required by some percentage.\n\nThen when ganking continues unabated, I can reference this thread, this post, these words, and say \"I told you so.\"\n\nPosted - 2011.11.02 00:19:00 -\n[136] - Quote\nOP, the hate you preceive is the same complaint any player makes when something that has not consequence/counter is nerfed. I think it is completely illogical that any ship in Eve would be insured, particularly combat ships. If I were in charge, I'd get rid of insurance totally, or at a minimum after the first 30 days of a paid account with no insurance for trial accounts.\n\nActually, you'd need to increase it. Right now ship insurance serves as a stopgap to prevent mineral prices from being bottomed out. If minerals get TOO cheap, it becomes profitable to buy minerals, build ships, and then destroy those ships for the insurance payment. Without it there's no safety net and mineral prices would get ridiculously low. You'd need to require a lot more minerals per ship to absorb the excess, but mining would still be hurt as an occupation.Do you know how many chances at new intelligent life are just lost because of those goddamn miners? Space genocide is what it is.\n\nPosted - 2011.11.02 01:59:00 -\n[140] - Quote\nOk so I just read through this thread... It tells me this.2, The gankers whined more than the miners in this thread.\n\nlol thats funny because its trueI love the the smell of victory in the morning. It smells like... Blood, vomit and burning flesh..\n\nAny post that can be summed up as \"\" because ganking wont be free any more\"\" is not valid.\n\nRemoving the insurance payout reduces the possible return on investment. No good business person likes to see that happen.\n\nthat's a good argument for increasing the payout for t2 hulks... and or removing suicide ganking altogether.... but I don't see that suicide ganking is much of a business.. though mining removal could be a business strategy.[IMG]ok so let's see if u can come up with a tanked fit that doesn't get solo'd by a lone goon standard gank fitted alpha pest the following ships\n\n1. Retreiver 2. Covetor 3. Mackinaw 4. Hulk\n\nSo see if u can make a gank proof mining barge/exumer fit for all 4 ships\n\nmy alt - 32k ehp, with one of the little fixed reactor units, a dcu, extender, resists, and rigs. ie t1/t2 fit. Requires that concord does in fact drop the donuts and disable the pest in expected times (no guarentee!) >50k is possible, but that will attract many battleships at once for the officer drop chance, ie pointless.\n\nActually avoiding a single alpha pest by motion mining away from public belts (missions/gravs) and watching d-scan allows you to run less ehp and better yield though. Even if you are not fully aligned speed, you can seriously reduce the to-warp time for a hulk without killing your yield. (probably cannot be done with ice).\n\nie: the problem is currently not the hulks tank, its that a subset of playerbase is not currently letting a subset of the playerbase \"play\" afk in terribly fitted ships without training full shield skills. I'm struggling to see that as a big problem, and I'm struggling to see why that could/should be fixed by changing payouts driveNew forum, still no automatic double post merge. CCP Exxcellence.-a . Playing the game of life means to pvp. Get used to it or become extinctI was more or less referencing the fact that those who are intelligent enough have already figured how to keep mining Gallente ICE and have been doing so quite successfully driveTL;DR Adapt or GTFO\n\n+1 to you my friend, you get it.Free Lyris Nairn, goodposter extraordinaire and Spacebook Superstar.\n\nInsurance is paid out of CCP's infinite bucket. Insurance payment put more ISK into the player bucket then was taken out when insurance was purchased. However small that amount, it is still an inflationary risk.\n\nIf a gank + insurance = profit but gank without insurance = loss then insurance has to go. It is a subsidy to the player's bucket from a source of ISK that simply contributes (however minor) to inflation. Has nothing to do with the individual players ganking. It's a high-level Sink\\Faucet decision. I don't think this has anything to do with ganking directly at all. I think we are thinking way too low-level on the origin of this decision.\n\nIf there is 2 billion ISK insurance pay outs in CONCORD actioned activities, that is two billion that was moved from the CCP bucket to the Player bucket. Period. Doesn't even matter if they were profitable. We know that we took less then 2 billion ISK from the player bucket in taking out insurance. Any other loss is still contained in the player bucket. It is the movement of CCP ISK into the player economy that is the issue.\n\nEven if the margin between insurance and payout is small it is still movement from CCP's bucket into the player economy. My assumption is that, at this time, the bulk of insurance payouts are in hi-sec as the result of suicide ganks. The carebears don't lose ships as often so there never is an insurance payout, hi-sec insurance is a sink then. The suicide gankers effectively are consistent payouts and like any insurance company, their policy is being dropped or a rider added that says, \"No CONCORD payouts\" since we pay out too often for your risk catagory. Since we don't have premiums (yet) in Eve insurance, dropping it is the only option.\n\nI honestly don't think the mechanic of ganking ever entered the equation, it was just a simple decision that just about any insurance company would have made. They are adding a rider that says \"We do not insure your car if you use it in a crime and the cops **** it up"

The OP was not talking about renting space from another alliance. He was talking about a regional NRDS where anyone who wanted to enter the area and be a carebear could. Renting space from someone else would be counter productive in trying to establish a market hub that was meant for the general public. If concord shot everyone that didnt pay them rent would jita be like it is? It seems like your just trying to flame carebears try to keep this topic on trackIf both sides benefit from it, you can't call PVE'rs Parasites ;) They are only parasites if they don't give the PvPers something back (like manufactured war equipment).

If pos warfare stopped, and the mad pos buildup you can create in your home region would allow the alliance to focus on ships and ships alone.\n\nLots of pew pew from roaming gangs, and jumpbridges solve a lot of the 0.0 transportation issues (gang arrives a lot sooner, more pew pew).\n\nThe basic idea is doing what most of the north has done. they seem to be enjoying it, as you dont need to defend the ratters, just go roaming and kill their ratters, find their fleets.\n\nSomething similar to a ROE, or our (real world)Geneva Conventions.\n\nIt is possible if everyone agrees.\n\nOriginally by:Halkinbob is dead, goons are great, cheese is cheesy, there we go no need for any more threadsDefine your bordersDefine your bordersAt which point you become a paper tiger.

I guess I have expand the targets for my own anger.\n\nOriginally by:Laura BarettaEditedPosted - 2007.12.12 04:27:00 -\n[55]\nCVA are the only (so far) successful example of this kind of ideology, having established Providence as NRDS and open to anyone who can follow the rules (which basically consists of \"don't pewpew what isn't hostile\"). However, we are a unique example, and there are a number of reasons why our case isn't applicable to 0.0 at large.\n\nFirst, we live in quite possibly the worst 0.0 region in Eve. Low-sec roids, 500k BS rats, not many good moons and no dyspro moons, etc. This means that none of the major powers who could steamroll the region and claim it themselves or install pets actually would, because there's nothing to gain from it. So, while everybody and their brother loves to come here in roaming gank gangs, there's not been much contention of sov since we drove U'K out and secured all of Providence under our/allied banners 7 months ago. While we remain ever vigilant and prepared with the expectation that one day someone will come for us, it does allow the region some degree of stability compared to more valuable areas.\n\nSecond, we're RPers, which means we have loyalties both to the alliance and region beyond that of most alliances. We're more willing to defend the space with everything we've got, we have a more stable membership with better retention of high-SP players, and we're less likely to suffer from morale \"failure cascades\" when things turn ugly. Our regional allies who aren't RP entities themselves have years-old ties to the area, and so are likewise committed.\n\nThird, we're next to Empire, with four direct Empire access points as well as the nearby Catch entrance via HED. This makes it easy for neutrals to get in and out of our space, and it also enables us to fund ourselves via Empire-based production, missioning, etc rather than having to directly compete with neutrals for the poor resources in Providence. Those in deeper 0.0 regions have to pretty much rely on ratting and mining locally to sustain themselves at a membership level, and so allowing neutrals to come in and compete for those resources hurts the alliance.\n\nFourth, we don't tout ourselves as carebears or creators of a \"safe haven for all\", as others have done. 0.0 is not a safe place no matter what you do, and we try to make it clear to any neutrals who come that we are not CONCORD and their safety is their own responsibility, our only promise is that we won't shoot any peaceful people for just being here. The aforementioned easy access to Providence makes it a breeding ground for hostiles. Nobody who joins CVA has any illusions about how peaceful it's going to be, Providence is the favorite hunting ground for a lot of the south, all manner of empire-based gankers, and various roaming entities (CI for example, who merged into Tri and have brought their new friends down here now). The constant combat makes us stronger and also discourages those neutral leeches who are incapable and unwilling to provide for their own security, allowing the rest to thrive. Compare that to other historical organizations who have actively encouraged out-and-out carebears to come and live in their space with a \"we'll keep you safe\" motto, while having little military strength of their own, and not getting enough day-to-day combat to convince PvPers to stay in the alliance, leading to a massive crushing defeat when properly tested in the slightest.\n\nA strong PvP alliance in good 0.0 space has little real incentive to open their space to outsiders, and if they choose to do so, would likely find themselves losing membership due to boredom from lack of fighting, frustration over resource competition, the headaches caused by operating NRDS (it is definitely inconvenient compared to NBSI, and game mechanics actively work against it), and general stagnation from having to babysit whiny neutral carebears with entitlement complexes. Providence is a unique exception to the rule, not a proof that the idea is universally feasible.\n\nPosted - 2007.12.12 08:33:00 -\n[57]\nWhy? Successful alliances mix fighting and building without overdoing either. You're essentially arguing for a welfare check, in the form of 0.0 rewards, for those unwilling or unable to take their own space. Your dream is cute, but you really need to try visiting more regions. Some areas already have thriving markets, considering the number of people around, without this type of suggestion.\n\nPosted - 2007.12.12 14:47:00 -\n[60]\nWhy do some people seem to think that the best rewards in the game should be readily available to those who have neither the desire nor ability to ensure that availability"

I'd love to see the current scripting system used. Load some sort of 'burst dispersal' script that weakens the effect, but causes it to be an AoE burst centered on the locked target.\n\nAll the code to do all of that stuff is already in the engine, so I can't imagine it would be horribly difficult to implement. Balancing would be a whole different issue. Interestingly enough, only TDs and Damps are scripted E-war, so it really does match quite nicely.\n\n-O\n\nTyrus Tenebros\n\nJanuary 15 2012, 05:26:00 PM\n\nJust boost the recon bonus so that one damp and/or one TD will effectively shut down one ship anyways.\n\nWebs, ECM, and to some extent TPs are already \"working as intended\", though TPs in general could use a bit of a buff, or webs a bit of a nerf to the tracking formula (due to the current relative massive advantage of using a web over a TP)\n\nedit: also make optimal range on damps, TDs, and TPs longer.\n\nMike deVoid\n\nJanuary 15 2012, 06:26:25 PMRania Serlia\n\nJanuary 20 2012, 07:58:12RoemySchneider\n\nJanuary 20 2012, 10:53:53ah no, sry for not conveying that;\nindeed only 1 activation per target - for each module though.\nVarcaus\n\nJanuary 24 2012, 12:56:17 AMHonestly a recon should shut down a lone ship maybe not kill but jam/web/damp/neut into uselessness otherwise recons themselves are pretty useless.\n\nVortex\n\nJanuary 24 2012, 02:21:07 AMThe game engine doesn't really like module cycle times < ~2 seconds. Probe launchers and NOmen pulse lasers already push the game to the edge. 1s cycle time would see very inconsistent pulses between when the cycle has ended and when your client actually figures that out.\n\nI'd agree that if one wanted to do this, the best method would be adjusting the ship bonuses upwards until 1 module = 1 ship gone (more or less what the Falcon gets) from the fight. A recon spoiling a \"solo\" player is no different than an unexpected scimitar or falcon showing up anyways, so it doesn't matter what your particular level of screwed is coming from. Keep in mind though, that in large fights its difficult to coordinate your EW across all the targets. If you want EW to be useful in fleets, then there needs to be UI additions so that you can see the effects of your fleets EW. I'd propose something along the lines of a toggled box on the overview that shows the status of your squadmates (not other squads/wings/etc) EW. Would make it a lot easier to know who is pointed/webbed and who has jammers pointed at them, etc.\n\nedit: just remembered that the game engine doesn't communicate that kind of information between clients...soooo.... (this is why you can't see shots missing your allies ships, your client doesn't know the result of those attacks).\n\nMfume\n\nJanuary 24 2012, 07:33:29 AM\n\nHonestly a recon should shut down a lone ship maybe not kill but jam/web/damp/neut into uselessness otherwise recons themselves are pretty useless.\n\nI agree totally. I just don't want to read the threads that emerge when a single bonused and scripted TD takes a blaster boat's falloff to under 2km or makes tracking a similar ship impossible at 5km.\n\nRania Serlia\n\nJanuary 31 2012, 07:11:00 AM\n\nA double TD arbitrator can already effectively shut down a single turret ship rather easily. Granted, this isn't enough to get line pilots into arbitrators, but it's a good use of amarr newbies in a smallgang. Explaining to them exactly how their EW works is a must though of course.\nRun the dps graph on a double TD(tracking speed disruption) arbi vs a cookiecutter(double TE, double gyro) shieldycane at and under 5km with full (mwd off) transversal and the results are pretty telling.\nAlternately, run the graphs with optimal disruption and see what happens to your projection/falloff. (0.3+3.3 with RFEMP, 0.7+5 w/barrage)\n\nUsing those numbers as a guideline, an armor Curse with the current TDs could take two (battlecruiser class)turret ships effectively out of a fight. I'll grant that nobody flies armor curses anymore because they are just not very surviveable at all.\n\nI mean granted, a double TD arbi is probably not going to be cap boosting, so the fight could go pretty apoorly for little old arbitrator(cane neuts can be counternossed), but that was just an example.\n\nThis is already a ship that can dictate the range at which it must be effectively fought, and the arbi deals reasonable dps for a cruiser too(well 5 bonused mediums isn't a joke at least, and plenty of spares). Making one TD=one disabled ship would have to be balanced carefully against people just jamming two of them on their myrmidons and hyperions to shut down completely any other soloer, and the arbitrator just being able to plain kill any turret ship 1v1, which right now it cannot do(midslots are extremely valueable on an armor tanked EW cruiser that's trying to solo!).\n\nI know I'm restating a previous statement, however, IMO, any attempt to rebalance TDs for gang work would have to be carefully weighed against turning the humble TD bonused ships into auto win vs any turret ship solopwnmobiles."

If you're attacking an AI's home planet this is fairly obvious. Ships will fly through the center then go in a random radial direction. If they happen to pick a direction where there is a long line of ships already, they will go back to the center and pick again. I'm not sure if this is because it is a range issue or what. Regardless, i don't think it impacts the effectiveness of the ships.\n\nOh yeah I understand. I just thought that it was maybe a part of left over code or something that didn't get transferred over.

These weapons, albeit with the Raijin's limited weapons generator, mean the Yaki fighter is deadly against all other M4 vessels, and indeed seems to be one of the few ships conceived with the purpose of killing its counterparts in mind.

It is not complete, but you can tell that from the data coverage column.\n\nI have to say I like this idea, but it's simply not practical from a development standpoint.\n\nThe fact that CCP provides no API for applications to find out: 1) Which moons have which minerals in them. 2) Average market prices on things (eve-central kind of does this, but CCP really needs to release their own API for it; eve-central kind of sucks tbqfh). 3) Who has a tower anchored on each moon (and whether or not they actually have a moon miner anchored & onlined).\n\nNot to mention the fact that the amount of profit from moons can vary quite a bit depending on what the person mining it does with it -- sell it straight, simple react it and then sell it, do a full-on complex reaction and then sell it, or go all the way to T2 components or even T2 modules/ships...\n\nHonestly the only way this would be even partly \"possible\" is if all the major alliances reported what moons they owned and their locations, along with how much profit they made off the moons -- and that isn't going to happen, because high end moons are totally-super-sekrit.\n\nI'd be happy for a map that shows the sov of systems, and links them, but does NOT give extra range due to Outposts and such. Some alliance's in 0.0 you can't even SEE their space on the maps, due to them having only one outpost where an adjoining alliance may have 10, and the \"influence\" from the 10 overides the one.\n\nBasically a sov map that shows the actual borders between sov holding entities.\n\nOriginally by:Holy LowlanderI doubt this map is complete tbh ( that is only highend wise)\n\nCache , Cobalt Edge , Curse , Great Wildlands , Outer Passage , Periggen Falls, The spire not having any highend moons at all can't be correct , can it ?\n\nAnd are branch , tenal and tribute really *that* low on highendmoons ?\n\nThe dotlan is hardly reliable when it comes to high-end counts, it's all information compiled from outside sources. I think a good amount of that info comes from leaked info here and there. Places that change hands more often tend to have the more reliable info, as more people know where the high-ends are. Branch, Tenal and Tribute haven't really changed hands that often. I think the closest any of them have come to being in any real danger was the MAX campaign, and I believe that only just barely scratched into Tribute before it fizzled.

The meat of the code is drawing, it's very easy to rewrite the \"who has sov here\" bits to count moons instead. It's a weekend project, at the longest.\n\nAs others have pointed out, the problems are related to getting the information, not displaying it. I have no way to query who actually owns any given moon - the best I can do is look at sovereignty. I have a similar problem with stations, so I just default to basing it off of who has sov there since it's rare that the sov holder isn't the station holder. For moons, this probably isn't reliable enough.\n\nI also don't have a list of moons. Without a good list (and Dotlan probably isn't good enough) the map probably wouldn't be accurate enough to matter.\n\nThis thread is older than 90 days and has been locked due to inactivity."

I imagine upgrading and leveling up would be a combination of upgrading ship parts and spending on schooling in whatever your selected crew member's specialty is, kind of like the original Front Mission.\n\nDelixe: Try Spaceforce: Captains it's kind of what you are talking about. You explore normally but when you encounter an enemy your switch to a sort of JRPG/FInal Fantasy style turn based combat.\n\nYeah, but that's still heavy on resource collection and tech tree advancement. I don't know how I can simplify the idea any further than \"Final Fantasy swaps sprites with Tyrian\". No maneuvering of ships like pieces on a chess board, just choosing whether to attack, defend, use an item, or wait.\n\nAssuming the story is something decent and the entire cast doesn't consist of whiny 14 year old magical twits and that it avoids all those horrid sci-fi clichés, then I'd play the shit out of that game.\n\n@Hesusio Unless one of those 14-y/o's is a clone with accelerated growth, then there probably won't be any. The only \"cliches\" I'm after are the \"hard-bitten mercenary/salvage/ancient-alien-artifact-hunting crew\" cliches. Kinda like the crew from Alien Resurrection. They get \"conscripted\" (read: press-ganged) into the linear-plot's \"main mission\" by the game-world's Imperial-type gov't. \"We have whole hard drives worth of charges against you. We'll toss you all in the cacky if you don't cooperate and go on this ultimately suicidal mission.\" That stuff.\n\n@Foxhack Forget about the shooter elements. Play a game called Starflight. Most of the game consists of exploring systems and landing on planets and exploring those planets in a rover. Combat in space is real-time, arcade-style shooting of lasers and torpedoes to wear down regenerative shields and ultimately the hull.\n\nNow think about FF's ATB system replacing the arcade shooter combat, where fights are initiated either by random encounter or when the player's sprite and an enemy sprite collide. The fights never take place on foot, only in space or on the ground in the rover. THE REST OF THE GAME WORLD FREEZES IN PLACE WHILE A FIGHT IS IN MOTION, WHICH MOVES FORWARD STEP-BY-STEP. No arcade action, no resource management or tower defense, just an RPGMaker-type JRPG with sci-fi sprites.\n\nIf the idea is really this hard to express, then I'm not going to bother trying to explain it anymore."

      "text": "While Krootox, much like the Shaper, have never been an excellent choice for the Carnivore squad, this function provides a significant boost to the unit in 5th. Now, before you think \"ZOMG Krootox are the roxxor!\", they are still cost prohibitive as they are the equivalent of 5x Kroot or even 6x Hounds. As always, it's important to weigh the pros and cons to their inclusion in any list.\n\nOne of the benefits behind including krootox in your list, is that you now have some light armor anti-tank in your troop selection. The other benefit is that you are able to include up to 3x Krootox in your carnivore squads. This means that with 5th edition being prone to \"spamming\" units, you could have anywhere from 3x to 18x S7 shots showing up on your opponents flank. I would hope that to achieve the higher end number (18) you realize that it limits you to larger games and cuts into your \"suit\" point allotments.\n\nThat being said there is a solid middle ground when it comes to taking these units.\n\nIn my experience, I have found that Kroot Carnivore squads are best kept between 130-140pts. I've had great success with 20x Kroot or 10x Kroot + 10x Hounds. So where does the Krootox fit into my current list?\n\nThe current build that I will be using is: 10x Kroot 4x Hounds 1x Krootox (I am running two units like this)\n\nThis is a fairly well rounded and balanced unit. They have decent amounts of HTH attacks, a good number of shots against infantry, and now have the added benefit of being able to pop light tanks.\n\nOne configuration I have considered is: 10x Kroot 2x KrootoxIn general you will see that the Krootox still are not that great. They do however offer some tactical advantages. - Reduced foot print and perceived threat - Improved odds against Light Armor - Increased Combat Effectiveness threshold\n\nThe biggest boon will be to bringing S7 and S6 to bear on the side & rear armor of the Chimera Chassis as well as against Raider chassis. That is the really the biggest \"plus\" in the competitive/tournament scene. You'll still find that for the points the krootox are half as effective in HTH when compared to Kroot/Hounds You will also find them less than half effective (33% roughly) for the points versus basic infantry. Even in my example regarding combat effectiveness threshold the morale check is the same, check out the following: (15xKroot) or (10xKroot + 6xHounds) VS (10xKroot + 1xKrootox) 4x unsaved wounds will yield a morale check on all 3. (20xKroot) or (10xKroot + 10xHounds) VS (10xKroot + 2xKrootox) 5x unsaved wounds will yield a moral check on all 3.\n\nVery nice, and it provides some insight into using a model I personally have never tried before.\n\nI see the krootox being very useful in apocalypse games where the pooint limit can let you take all three krootox and use them as a threat to your opponents flanks and forces them into a killzone. Or, making him divert precious firepower to eliminate them while allowing different anti-tank forces to advance. After all, you can't hit everything at once can you?\n\nThanks for posting it, and maybe it'll open up some new tactical options to the new players. And maybe our new codex will make them better than the current version.\n\nThe small unit with three Krootox (not sure on numbers yet as it's not all sunk in yet) sound interesting as they do have that 48\" range. That covers quite a distance when coming on from the sides, possibly forcing the enemy to travel a fair distance to stop them taking pot-shots at the rear of tanks. The threat of 3-6 S7 shots heading towards the back of a tank might let you place facing games given that at the other end of the field you'll be looking at Railguns.\n\nAlso means that a Kroot unit looking to outflank in order to take an enemy objective (or even just contest/threaten from a nearby wood) has the ability to knock out a transport bringing troops to deal with them. I'm definitely warming to the idea of the backfield (or should that be backwoods) Krootox.\n\nIt'd be interesting to compare them to a Deathrain, obviously they aren't as good at killing things - 2/3rds the price but with half the fire power (beyond 12\") and not twinlinked. But they are troops and not elite slots and outflanking is definitely safer than a deep-strike or jumping up the board.\n\nTastyfish wrote:.\n\nI'd second that the argument allowing the krootox to outflank is weak at best.\n\npaidinfull wrote:You'd still be better off buying extra kroot or kroot hounds for the purposes of leadership tests. For what you paid for two krootox, you could get 10 kroot, or almost 12 kroot hounds. With the additional 10 kroot it will take 5 unsaved wounds for a test which is the same as if you disposed of two wounds on the krootox. If you use kroot hounds you will need 6 unsaved wounds for a leadership test. If you are looking for using krootox to avoid leadership tests, a shaper will serve the same purposes better. He has just as many wounds as a krootox, gives the whole unit higher leadership AND costs less than a krootox. On top of all this, the extra wounds only help against shooting. In assault, any wounds allocated to the krootox will still count for combat resolution.\n\npaidinfull wrote:\n\nyou could have anywhere from 3x to 18x S7 shots showing up on your opponents flank. Being rapid fire makes it next to useless.\n\nOnly if they are sitting within 18\" of the board edge that you happen to show up on. Otherwise you are getting 0 Str7 shots at side armor.\n\npaidinfull wrote:\n\nThe biggest boon will be to bringing S7 and S6 to bear on the side & rear armor of the Chimera Chassis as well as against Raider chassis.\n\nYou will get Str7 OR Str6 against side and rear armor. Being rapid fire, you can either shoot with the gun or assault, not both. If you are looking at rhinos (Which are more common than IG, or DE combined) There is no difference between shooting missile pods into the front vs the side and Deathrains are much more efficient than the krootox. IF the Kroot Gun was assault, it might be worth it since you could crack the transport, then assault the contents, however you are more likely to crack the transport then have all the kroot wiped out in the following turn by the disembarking unit. Plus Str6 in assault isn't that amazing anymore when it doesn't ignore armor, and doesn't ignore FNP on T4 models. You may wound most things on 2's but when they get an armor/invulnerable save and/or FNP you won't actually be killing much. IF they get the charge off on blood angels, THREE krootox will kill on average 1 marine. At over 100 points for those 3 models it just isn't worth it..[/quote] I was imagining them deploying quite a way from the front lines, either close to the enemies board edge, but away from enemies that aren't an easy assault away or in a suitable terrain feature - running if need be. They would then be relying on their low threat, long range, distance and any suitable terrain to harrass and take potshots at rear armour in the second turnI've been playing around with the idea of Krootox in my head for a while now. The only merits I can see about including Krootox in your list is to have a more survivable form of S7 firepower in your list. Given that you have to take at least 10 Kroot minimum in order to field a Krootox means that you have 10 ablative wounds until your Krootox start coming under fireThe objective thing is a point, but two death rains and a krootox with a kroot unit do very different things - for the specific task of taking out light vehicles, obviously a death rain would be better, even more so when you include the cost of the Kroot required to get the krootox.\n\nHowever I don't think it's worth excluding the Kroot from this comparison though, the question is more is the upgrade of 2/3 or 1 1/2 death rains worth it to a unit of kroot or two to add the harrasing of light vehicles and the rear armour of tanks to their roles?What an incredibly trite and argumentative stance you've adopted. What's with the 2mo thread necromancy? Simply looking for a drunken argument? What do you plan to do if you played someone like me who simply _Outflanked_ the Krootox? Would you pick up your little toy soldiers and go? Would you grab my hand and attempt to force me? Bizarre.\n\nThis is the RAW so it doesn't really matter if you think it's \"weak\", it's how the logic in the game works.\n\nIn this instance, taking the stance that the codex is \"obsolete\" or \"outdated\" is irrelevant. It's a valid rule set in 5th edition. From a logic standpoint, I *proved* my point. Saying \"nuh-uhhh\" doesn't change that. Look at the Outflank rule, there you will note that the only requirement to Outflank any unit in 5th Edition, is that they have \"special rule Infiltrate\".\n\nLook at the Kroot Carnivore section and you will note another special rule. It is written in bold and then a definition of the rule is provided immediately following it. That is *a* special rule Infiltrate. Do you mean to suggest that this isn't a special rule? That this special rule is not called Infiltrate? To suggest that the Outflank rule is only referring to the USR, or anything else is an assumption, not RAW. Does the Kroot Carnivore Squad have a special rule called Infiltrate? Yes it does.\n\nASIDE: By RAW Kroot can not be placed after deployment using the Infiltrate USR because they don't have the rule. So why do you and everyone else allow it? Kinda arbitrary to actually break the rules in one place, but not follow them explicitly elsewhere don't you think?\n\nTo meet Outflank's criteria all the rule does is validate that the unit has \"special rule Infiltrate\". Do you have it Yes or No? The Kroot Carnivore Squad has it, and therefore can Outflank with Krootox.\n\nFolks consistently forget that game theory is based on math and is comprised of mathematical proofs. You're looking to argue that the Kroot Carnivore Squad doesn't have the Infiltrate Special rule? That's fine. Anyone is more than welcome to take that stance, but all one simply has to do is open the codex and the BGB, point to the Outflank rule and then to the Kroot Carnivore entry.\n\nAs far as how useful of a tactic this is... debate to your heart's content, but it is a legal tactic.Quote:\n\nWhat do you plan to do if you played someone like me who simply _Outflanked_ the Krootox? Would you pick up your little toy soldiers and go?\n\nExactly. In a \"friendly\" game, I'd tell you to stop rules lawyering and find something better to do with my time if you refused. In a tournament, I'd call a judge over to explain things to you.\n\nBut maybe I should ask you the same thing? What would you do if I simply ignored everything your Kroot unit did and refused to remove models they \"killed\", moved as if they are not there, shot with units that they \"locked in combat\", and reported the game results to the tournament judge based on an objective score that does not include any objectives they \"claimed\"? Or what would you do if I decided that my Broadsides are allowed to outflank and started shooting railguns into your rear armor?\n\nQuote:\n\nThis is the RAW so it doesn't really matter if you think it's \"weak\", it's how the logic in the game works.\n\nExcept by strict RAW, the entire game is broken. Fine, by RAW have your Krootox outflank, but I guarantee I'm going to find a dozen RAW issues that go against you. For example, I hope you didn't take any special-issue weapons in your army, because there is no legal way to do so. Etc.\n\nQuote:\n\nDoes the Kroot Carnivore Squad have a special rule called Infiltrate? Yes it does.\n\nNot if it has a Krootox.\n\nQuote:\n\nASIDE: By RAW Kroot can not be placed after deployment using the Infiltrate USR because they don't have the rule. So why do you and everyone else allow it? Kinda arbitrary to actually break the rules in one place, but not follow them explicitly elsewhere don't you think?\n\nErr, what? RAW is perfectly clear there, as long as the unit does not contain a Krootox, it may infiltrate normally. Don't forget that you don't have to have the Infiltrate USR to infiltrate.\n\nQuote:\n\nFolks consistently forget that game theory is based on math and is comprised of mathematical proofs.\n\nIt would be nice if it was. Unfortunately, GW is either incapable of or unwilling to write a consistent set of rules, and the rules fall well short of \"mathematical proofs\". This isn't too bad if you're willing to go with the intent of the rules (which is usually pretty obvious), but you simply can not have a functioning game of 40k by using the standards of mathematical proofs.\n\nQuote:\n\nAs far as how useful of a tactic this is... debate to your heart's content, but it is a legal tactic.\n\nIt is not legal. At best, it is possibly legal based on a very weak RAW argument. And given that you don't even have an undisputed argument that RAW agrees with you (just look at the arguments in both this thread and your first one on the subject), why should anyone allow you to go against pretty obvious RAI?That's the rub though, it's not clear for RAI because of how other identical use cases are presented. Please read the other topic and you will see exactly that point. There are explicit assumptions that are being made that aren't written anywhere. (I will explain at the end where they are made.)\n\nWere that the case units with USR Infiltrate would not be able to Outflank if they took a transport. You are welcome to dispute that, but in doing so you are arbitrarily accepting one use case over another on the differences between \"can not Infiltrate\" and \"may not Infiltrate\" solely on the fact that it is an \"accepted\" usage, not that it is RAW. That is simply my point.\n\nIn terms of NOVA and Adepticon both of those FAQs have RAW errors and are intended to be used as guidelines only when playing and preparing for those specific tournaments. How long was the multiple Rune Priest 4+ against psychic abilities used incorrectly? Almost a year? That was in both their FAQs incorrectly prior to GW FAQing it. At the time I pointed a similar RAW discrepancy that the majority disagreed with. It's not about the majority perspective, it's about the explicit RAW logic as presented.\n\nI find it incredibly silly that you refer to a disagreement in this as a \"stunt\" because you simply don't understand. The circumstances are identical in game theory to that of a unit with the USR Infiltrate and a dedicated transport. They are identical, but you are ignoring how they are identical and why both mechanics work. Take a look at why both work and you will understand my point. A TO arbitrarily concluding something has no relevance on whether or not it's actual RAW. An interpretation or misinterpretation has no bearing on whether or not it's RAW. When one plays a game with their friends, or any game, they're merely playing a _game_.\n\nIt's a game and the point isn't to win or lose or exploit some rule, but to have fun@Perergine I've made my point. I've supported it with quotes and you've ignored them. This discussion is 2 months old and you've provided nothing that substantiates your stance. You even miss the fact that by RAW Kroot do not have the Infiltrate USR and yet you grant it to them every game.\n\n4th Ed Codex pg 37: Kroot Carnivore Squad: Special Rules wrote:\n\n\"If the squad does not contain a Krootox Rider it may Infiltrate if the mission permits it. See the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook for the infiltrators scenario special rules.\"\n\nYou will note, that there is no such thing as the verb \"infiltrate\" or the \"infiltrators scenario\" in the 5th edition rulebook or it's FAQs. So no, you are 100% wrong in that your *assumption* is crystal clear. All mentions of \"infiltrate\" and it's derivatives are _assumed_ to be in reference to the Infiltrate USR. As players we make an unknowing assumption in logic that the Kroot Carnivore Squad have the USR Infiltrate. Find somewhere, anywhere in the rulebook that defines how to \"infiltrate\" outside of the USR Infiltrate. You won't because it doesn't exist, so how is that the Kroot Carnivore Squad are legally able to \"infiltrate\" if we don't first make the assumption that they have the Infiltrate USR? They can't. They have to have the Infiltrate USR to be able to use it's rule.\n\nYou, as a player, have already unknowingly granted the Kroot Carnivore Squad entry the Infiltrate USR. That is how the logic works, else you can not place the Kroot on the table after deployment. Using that exact logic, ties into why the instance of a unit with the Infiltrate USR and a dedicated transport may Outflank is identical. That is why this exchange is silly, you're not even aware you're doing something but stringently denying it's usage. You're ignorant to the foundation of your own actions.\n\nRAI is that a unit with the Infiltrate Special rule may Outflank. By RAW there is no stipulation made that unit has to be able to use this ability or be permitted to use it, merely to have the Special Rule RAW is that a unit with the Infiltrate Special rule can not Infiltrate if they take a dedicated transport RAI is that the above unit may still Outflank\n\nKroot Carnivore squads have a Special Rule, Infiltrate. Its definition is provided right there in print. This special rule is never lost, as it is triggered when a Krootox is added to the squad. The addition of the Krootox initiates the same logic criteria that is _IDENTICAL_ to that of the above scenario.\n\nHere are ALL of the rules in question:\n\nOutflank wrote:\n\nDuring deployment, players may declare that units with the 'Scout' or 'Infiltrate' special rules are attempting to outflank the enemy.\n\nInfiltrate wrote:\n\nPg. 75, MRB \"If a unit with this ability is deployed in a dedicated transport, it can not infiltrate.\n\nOutflank wrote:\n\nNote that if such units are picked from their army list together with a dedicated transport, they may outflank with their transport, but if they do so they must move onto the table embarked in it.\n\n4th Ed Codex pg 37: Kroot Carnivore Squad: Special Rules wrote:\n\n\"If the squad does not contain a Krootox Rider it may infiltrate if the mission permits it. See the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook for the infiltrators scenario special rules.\"\n\nThere is no exception made in the Outflank rule for units with dedicated transports. It specifically refers to units that meet the above criteria, which is, units with the Scout or Infiltrate special rule.\n\nSo the units in question either always have the special rules or they lose it and gain it.\n\nThe widely accepted RAI is that the units always have the special rule only may not use it.\n\nThe thing is, if a unit takes a dedicated transport it may not infiltrate. You will note that this is exactly the same function and mathematical proof in the Krootox rule. Both units in question have a special rule Infiltrate. It just so happens that the Kroot one is defined there in the codex and folks can not wrap their heads around that. Assuming that all references are to the USR, when the criteria is as simple as \"do you have a special rule Infiltrate\". Check? You may Outflank.\n\nIf you are honestly not able to see that the two are identical, and simply refuse to accept the possibility that you are wrong and making assumptions that aren't RAW, then I think we are done here and this thread should be closed. It's not necessary for you to like me or to want to play a game with me, as from a RAW stance, I've proven my point.\n\nI've actually played with an outflanking Krootox in my squad of Kroot several times locally, since getting the idea from here. It's far from imbalanced, and the people I've spoken with at the LGS seem to agree that while it's a stretch of an interpretation, the stretch doesn't unbalance it. But then again, I get a considerable amount of leeway at the LGS to try out new things or re-interpretations with the Tau (such as ignoring the 1500pt limit for Shadowsun).paidinfull, I do understand your point. Your whole house of cards is based on dedicated transports of infiltrator outflanking, which I don't agree. Here is why:\n\nInfiltrate: If a unit with this ability is deployed inside a transport vehicle, it cannot infiltrate. Infiltrate also confers a special outflank move to units of infiltrators that are kept in reserve.\n\nScout: If a unit with this ability is deployed inside a dedicated transport vehicle, it confers the scout ability to the transport too. This rule also confers a special outflank move to units of scouts that are kept in reserve.\n\nSo scout vehicles are scouts but infiltrator vehicles are not infiltrators. And only units with infiltrate and scout rules can outflank. So care to guess which dedicated transport is actually permitted at p94? There is nothing to argue here, you chose to understand it your way, I do mine. Go bug GW if you need to.\n\nNow important stuff. Let's say I agreed with you. Bought bunch of oxen, prepared an army based on this tactic. Paid money to join Throne of Skulls. And denied this tactic at the first match. Will you compensate my expenses? Or should I be content with knowing that my army is correct by your interpretation?\n\nMost likely I am going to be denied of this in every major tournament and get despised for this in every friendly game. Why am I doing this again? Because you said so? Thanks but no thanks.\n\nPaidinfull I have read your other thread and I am sorry to say you have not \"proven or explained\" that a unit with a krootox can outflank. Personally I think they should be able to, hell if a raven wing army on bikes the size of cars can outflank then so should a krootox that is a vastly silent in comparison.\n\nHowever the rules say \"if the squad does not contain a krootox rider it may infiltrate\". If they do take the krootox then they quite simply don't have the infiltrate ability to use.\n\nIf you pulled this on me in an event I would probably laugh at you lots then fall on the floor laughing some more till I my ribs split. As a house rule I don't have a problem with it as such but pull this off at an event and you would find you just wasted a lots of points on something you can not do.\n\nI wish it did work like this though cos I got 3 maxed out units or kroot with 3 ktootox each and it would rock to assault someone with them while outflanking =D but then that is why they denied us doing it in the first place I should think the Tau are not known for there hard hitting assault units so forcing us to keep our hardest hitting assault monster in our gun lines for deployment makes sense.\n\nOf corse the other problem with your funny little idea is dice. There is no guarantee even with gear that they will turn up when or where you want them.... I know this the hard way, dice will wreck your plans if you rely on them to much. You also have the added problem of your opponent knowing that you are doing it so they will just move there units back a bit out of assault range. your could still shoot at them but lets be honest you will be able to shoot 18\" on once you have moved at best and unless there is a lot of nice cover within 6\" of the edge of the table your kroot will just get ripped to bits when the return fire kicks in. Indeed in spearhead or dawn of war you are better off not bothering with outflank. In spearhead you can just hold them back and then bring them on from anywhere along the long table edge you chose this is so much more reliable placement wise but of corse you don't know when they will turn up. in dawn of war so long as you get to deploy first you are best putting them up front as they can hold units up and be within rapid fire range from the get go else bring them on at the start and get ready to blow holes in things turn 2.\n\nI used a unit of krootox a while back and just deployed them the good old fashioned way on the table glad I did cos a bunch of biker scouts outflanked and sped along the back of my lines. If I did not have the krootox there to deal with them in combat they could have done a lot of damage to my Tau. The big guns where kind of handy but as a counter assault unit they are very usefulAnd your attitude of \"what are you going to do if I just ignore your objections and outflank them anyway, grab them out of my hands?\" isn't confrontational? Or your accusation that I was drunk and looking for a fight?\n\nQuote:\n\n@Perergine I've made my point. I've supported it with quotes and you've ignored them. This discussion is 2 months old and you've provided nothing that substantiates your stance.\n\nDisagreeing with you is not the same thing as ignoring you. I've read all of your arguments, and I think they're weak at best.\n\nQuote:\n\nAll mentions of \"infiltrate\" and it's derivatives are _assumed_ to be in reference to the Infiltrate USR.\n\nWhy? Please remember that you don't need the Infiltrate USR to infiltrate.\n\nQuote:\n\nFind somewhere, anywhere in the rulebook that defines how to \"infiltrate\" outside of the USR Infiltrate.\n\nPage 92, under \"infiltrators and scouts\". The rule says \"deploy their infiltrators\", NOT \"deploy their models with the Infiltrate USR\", and tells you to do it using the process described in the USR on page 75. Whether you have the USR or some other rule telling you to temporarily act as if you do, you deploy using the same process.\n\nQuote:\n\nUsing that exact logic, ties into why the instance of a unit with the Infiltrate USR and a dedicated transport may Outflank is identical.\n\nThis is not true at all. A unit embarked on a dedicated transport may not infiltrate, but it does not lose the Infiltrate USR. Kroot, on the other hand, do not have the USR in the first place. Even if you assume that Kroot have the Infiltrate USR when they don't have a Krootox in the squad, there is a very strong argument that, by RAI at minimum, if not RAW, they lose that ability entirely when they take a Krootox.\n\n=====================================================================\n\nHlali wrote:Sure, I agree that it would make sense to change the rules to allow Kroot squads with Krootox to outflank, and (in my opinion at least) it certainly wouldn't be overpowered. In the next codex, assuming nothing else changes that would make it overpowered, I'd like to see this restriction removed and Kroot get the standard Infiltrate USR. If nothing else, it would simplify things a lot, and not force you to leave the Krootox at home if you want to outflank the squad at any point in a tournament with fixed lists.\n\nThe problem is that, as this thread proves, the subject is a controversial one, with most people agreeing that the rules don't actually allow you to do this. This puts it in the same category as all other custom units/house rules/etc, they can be fun to play with if you and your opponent agree to change the standard rules in that way, but they aren't really something you can base your army around for tournaments or pickup games against unknown opponents.\n\nThe Kroot squad may infiltrate if and ONLY if there is no Krootox rider. Not to mention the Krootox aren't even worth this much arguing for what little they do and how fragile they actually are. Just take a unit of 20 Kroot and 10 hounds and use it as an outflanking hammer and you'll pretty much smash apart anything you touch (I've had a squad of 20 with 5 hounds kill a ten man unit of Space Wolf marines in a round of combat. The basic ones.). Is this guy for serious or is he just trolling at this point? I'm starting to think he's just trolling the community honestly.\n\nTo hit on an old cord(ie the thread this one is leaning on) you must also consider GW's general lack of effort to prevent things like this in the event of a new codex/edition etc etc. As a GK player, I'll use the old codex as an example. GK's weren't exactly \"competitive\" before the latest codex, mostly because its about as old as the current Tau codex. Grey Knights got the shaft on some things as new Space Marine codices came out, but they also got some nifty toys. Infinite range psychic hood? Hurricane bolters on Land Raiders that could ALWAYS fire? Those are two the cool things, but some things like the Assault cannon never got upgraded and sucked back then. People started to complain, and what did GW do? They released a FAQ that essentially said it's fair to play with the old stuff, and if your opponents agree, even change the rules to make them up to par with newer versions of the same gear(for the same points).\n\nThe general point is that when it comes down to it, especially on an issue like this, it comes down to \"popular\" opinion and what your opponent will agree to. Trying to do something like this at a tourney will not likely go over"

If you play with no fog of war you can see that quite easy by looking at the world. As soon as you get a ship on the planet they start to spawn and not a minute before that. I normally like to send a MK4 scout starship over to sit on the world until I can get a MK1 scout Starship to just live on the world safely."

I am still looking into why they turn red although at the moment i rather preffer it, some of the planets are hard to see in the blackness of space and the red seems to act as a sort of highlight.\n\nAre you going to implement realistic warfare with real physics?\n-unlimited weaponrange\n-relativly slow projectiles with low power for short range combat (fighters -> cruiser?)\n-really fast projectiles (2-3% of the speed of light? with huge impact, you know newton, don't you? )\nCombat is based more around movement to avoid \"sniperattacks\" from battleships and the like and for sure about finding the enemy out there)\nEverything smaller than a cruiser should be a real danger to a battleship, because it can't target those fast and maneuverable ships, so they need an escort fleet.\n\nWell, after all, it's just about physics, mass and speed and of course the limiting speed of light. Don't forget, that a creditcard accelerated to maybe 3% of light's speed has an impactpower of some nuclear bombs. The only problem is targeting, try to hit a 300m ship with a 20kg projectile on a distance of 300.000km, even passive sensors would have a delay of 1s at this range, so you do not really know were the target is at the moment you fire the massdriver.\n\nTo bad you can't simulate \"detectionspeed\", can you? This would make movement on the map really interesting, you would need to move your ships unpredictable to avoid enemy fire, because highend sensors would detect the ship at any range, just limited by the speed of light. Let's pretend you have the possibility to move faster than light (for example by reducing the mass of the object relativly to the normal space-time), you can't be detected directly, just indirectly.\nBut I believe this would go way to far for this game\n\nHowever, important is newtonian weapon and shipbehavior and of course recon to setup attackplans with several fleets etc and of course to fire heavy massdrivers at targets far away and if you do not hit something directly, well, the projectile could hit the planet behind and somehow destroy some infrastructure? or it hits some other ship 200km behind the targeted ship?\nAfter all it's how real space warfare would work at the current level of knowledge.\n\nEdit: If you need some shipideas, i still have all my 3d models open to use for everyone, but they are not textured. I'll see if I can create some more in the near future, but I can't promise anything due to limited time.\n\n@The KC:\nAs intriguing (and near-realistic) as your idea is, I don't believe that the game engine supports it. I want to say this was recently discussed in another mod thread but, the way a bullet (or any weapon) is given to hit or miss is determined as it is fired within the game itself. If it 'misses', it'll fly past. If it 'hits', the game slightly alters the projectile's path to make the visual intercept.\n++++++++++++++++++++\nHowever, to legitimate this post as not an attack (which was not my intent), I am would posit an idea of my own, for any large-scale environment mod. In concept, the move order would be altered. everything that follows depends on this.\n\nInstead of a point-to-point movement system, you would instead issue move orders that would give the selected ship(s) a new velocity to to a set maximum (be it 2Km/sec, whatever). The ship would then rotate itself to align to the new velocity (or correctional vector, should it be moving already) before accelerating.\n\nAdditionally, this direct implementation holds only for orders outside of the sensors manager. From the manager, point-to-point would still hold, but with the ship accelerating roughly halfway, rotating (to present maximum thrust to decelerate), and then coming to 'full stop' at the destination.\n\nI cannot emphasize enough that I simply do not know if the movement methods are hard-coded in the engine or not. However, I have given decent thought to implementation should it be possible (on a high level, mind you). PM me if you* wish, and/or think it worth exploring further.\n\n@KwirkyJ\nIt's true how the engine handles simple projectiles, but if you use unguidedmissile-projectiles instead of tracers your fire is directional, the weapon firing those longrange kinetics also could have a missrate of 0.01% (because of some small errors during calculating the firesolution), but there is one problem, if the target moves enough after firing you won't hit it. To avoid this you could scatter salvos at the target with some calculated miss.\nBelieve me, this is possible, because I've done it once for fun with one weapon of the pds mod. It was real fun, you could attack everything from everywhere, but the longer the range the higher the missrate. This way there will be an optimal range for weapons were the accuracy is high enough and the tracking of the turret ( or maneuverability of the ship if the weapon is hardmounted) fits the speed of moving targets (do not forget at what velocity those projectiles would fly through space). This way it gets harder to hit fast ships at long range ( dependent on projectile-velocity) and it gets harder to hit fast ships at short range (because of the tracking). This should be the concept for all projectile oriented weapons, then you just need to tweak the numbers for each type. Shortrange weapons use relativly slow projectiles with low energy so it's fearly easy to hit targets in a range of about 10-50km, those weapons should be mounted on everything smaller than a cruiser. This way those ships could stil attack everything on the map, but they are not likely to hit something 20.000km away because of the low projectile-velocity, but these ships are highly maneuverability, so they can react better on fast targets.\n\nOne example: a fleet combat begins at 100.000km range, some scouts have found the position of the enemyfleet.\nYour heavy massdrivers align and fire,shortly after the first hits the enemy reacts and moves his ships, he splits up and sends his carriers, frigs and some cruisers out to you, but you lose the contact to this part of the fleet because there aren't enough scouts out there. So he sneaks up and avoids your heavy fire through movement (as long as he moves, his battlecruisers can't fire back). Suddenly a huge wave of fighters and bombers attacks one of your BC's and destroys it with some torpedoes, now you are under heavy pressure. You need to setup a defensive against those small ships, you start your own fighters, but at this moment some fast frigs are incoming, some of them are reconnaissancefrigates. Now you have a problem, the enemy knows were you are, he attacks you with small ships and if he gets a small window to align his heavy massdrivers you will be obliterated.\nSo, what was the fail in there? Not enough reconnaissance and of course some really bad tactics.\n\nEdit: Another idea, somewhere on the forums was a way to create a \"gravity\"weapon, which attracts everything in it's eventsphere. Something like this for each planetoid whould be great. The sphere needs to be larger than the atmosphere (and don't forget, some planets do hot have a real atmosphere) and attract everything around slowly towards the surface.\nJust imagine if you then use ships there and after the combat the wrecks slowly tend to collide with the surface.\nThis would also limit the range were you can use ships near planetoids, you can move them through the gravityfield, but you can't position them there. If projectiles are affected, too, well, then you need to alter your tactics, because you need to get closer, otherwise you will only hit the planet somewhere or the projectile is distracted enough, that you can't hit anything from longrange.\n\n@The KC\nThat approach might work. However, I see a couple possible snags. Firstly, is there a limiting factor on the speed of the missile/projectile, as there is with ships (and can this be overcome?) To get an appropriate engagement envelope that is 1) as realistic as you are proposing and 2) feasible given the expected distances involved, they would have to move absurdly fast (up to .1C). Secondly, there is an issue of how targeting works within the game engine. As far as I know, the game does not interpolate the intercept points (that is, determine how the target is moving, how the weapon is moving, and how quickly the projectile will cross the distance), and instead fires at the current location of the target. While your weapon in PDS may have worked satisfactorily, I express concern that with the change in scale it may not play out as expected (as nearly any cross-motion will result in clean misses). If the target-interpolation and speed problems can be overcome, I would be most interested to see the results, however.\n\nI am working on the 15th fleet, I will try to stick as much as possible to the HW universe. I will start working on ships in order of importance. The first will be the MS.\n\nMS-Redesign.\n\nWhen you look at the pride of Higara, it is a very flawed design, and not battle oriented. I wanted to created a MS that had the feel and look of the HW1 MS, the armor of the HW2 MS, and higher power then the BC.\n\nAfter drawing dozens of concepts, I couldn't make anything that I was satisfied with. So, I went back to basics. I litteraly, took the Pride and flipped it on its side. I liked the curved surface. So I ran with it. And here it is after 7hours of meshing. Remember it is not polished, and it doesn't have goblins as of yet.as far as I was aware making the guns fire \"ahead\" of the moving target was as simple as increasing the bullet speed and accuracy, making a stream of bullets move in an arc as the turret keeps firing ahead of the target, and the bullets hit the moving ship.\n\ngreat model whisper, the only negative thing I can think about it is that the turrets look a little meh (like scaled up destroyer turrets). In my opinion turrets with some similarity to the rear seige cannon turret would look awesome (say, either a single heavy ion laser, a bit like the hgn_BC turrets, or a dual barreled kinteic turret with the barrels in a vertical arrangement).I tested this. First off, test parameters:\n\nTwo Higgy destroyers broadsiding each other.\n\n- I gave the ship fairly high acceleration, rotation and move speeds to simulate the targets moving 'away' from where they were last seen.\n\n- The guns were given a long range (12km) and a slow bullet (3500m/s). Accuracy was set to 0.6% and damage high to show impacts. <iUseVelocityPred> flag (see karos graveyard funciton reference) was set too.\n\nI came to following results:\n\n1) The rounds do indeed not track their target. Quickly chaning direction led to fired rounds missing their target consistently (obviously 0.6% is not never hit but enough to be represantive).\n\n2) Even with the damage = 1 tag set in the accuracy settings, the ships rarely hit each other, leading to a pretty long and boring fight.\n\n3) I added sphereburst damage with a 100m radus to the guns and repeated the test. The results were quite nice: When a ship moved after the other had fired, the shots would miss and do virtually no damage. When it stayed course or stood still, it took damage very quickly (desired effect).\n\nConclusion: An 'artillery barrage' style space battle is definitly possible but really only makes sense when using burst damage.\n\nAt any event, it makes space battles pretty interesting but you'd have to play around with it a little and form your own oppinion if this is right for this mod.\n\nI forgot to mention this before but I like the new mothership design . Going with something actually capable of defending itself is a big plus!\n\nWhisper, have you considered the possibility of using very large subsystems to hold the frigate and capital yards, as per HW:C? It would make sense for the 15th fleet's MS to draw inspiration from the Somtaaw's Explorer class MS in more ways than just the big gun. Speaking of which, could the big gun be made into a constructable/destroyable subsystem?\n\nOn another note, have you considered incorporating mololu's raiders or one of the 'remastered' versions of the original races into this mod? Will the regular Pride of Higaara fleet still be playable in this mod?\n\nHate to tell you this, guys, but this mod is dead as a can of spam from all appearances. The last post in this thread before the recent rez was in feb 2010, Whisper2me's last post on the forum was in june of the same year, and Moleman has been inactive for a similar length of time.\n\n@.@ oi I'm not inactive persay, just kinda behind the scenes, RL takes priority over modding. On a side not, yes Siber is correct, it is dead and has been dead for some time, although i could have sworn I or Whisper2me put a post up about that a while back.\n\nAn avid follower of the mod still had a copy so I was able to start working with the material again.\n\najlsunrise I would like to talk to you about a couple of things if I could with Leviathanswrath, via google talk or Teamspeak 3\n\nEDIT:\nIn the mean time I am going to request this thread be locked, the work for the large system maps and such are going to be incorporated into the Beast Evolution Mod, Progress has already been started and that thread will be updated soon.'"

This means that anyone can start a corporation by running a dozen level one missions and without really knowing how to cooperate with other people. Increasing this cost means that: 1. Fewer CAOD alt posting corps will exist 2. Players wanting to start a corporation either have to work for a significant amount of time to do it on their own 3. Or they need to work together - the 100 mil starting cost is really the corporation's first goal\n\nIt will make it harder but I think the end result will help them instead of hurting them.

Besides, they'd always just choose \"Closing of corporation\" so they don't have to worry about a premature end.\n\nYou misunderstand - they would still be responsible for paying war fees every week, the objectives are a way of having a public record of their victories. This would be extremely important for the reputation of a mercenary corporation, for example, and a good way to determine of those you want to hire are worth what you're paying.\n\nQuote:no, that's unnecessary hassle. Instead of flagging the corp, just flag everyone who is currently in the corp and joins in the future.

The objectives should be a way for: 1. Attacking corps to have a tangible record of their accomplishments during wars 2. Defending corps to deny the attacking corporations these objectives, which puts a blemish on their recordAs it is now, its artificial. You have corps deccing corps simply for noob kills... or, just to grief. That's as artificial as it can get. There needs to be reason behind it all... its up for the deccing corps to decide what that is. And its up for the devs to figure out a way to implement it.... so after its all said and done, each corp involved in the war has a clear road to victory. What are reasons to dec a corp? 1. remove from space 2. extract isk 3. kills\n\nCan you think of anymore reasons? Wars will be so much better if they had meaning and ways for both sides to achieve victory. Why should a corp be able to dec war and then simply end it with not recourse? With no fullfillment of winning, or pain of losing? Talk about zero risk... all you do is pay, and poof you got a war. CCP needs to stop making isk a factor in power.\n\nI like 3, but it shouldn't be reqiured. 4 is alright. 5 has been discussed quite a bit, and I have no issue with it. 6 is nice, but as people have said it would be simpler to make the wars transfer to the player for the remainder of the week even if they leave.\n\n1.

      "text": "MOD: Stargate Races - 2011/12/13 - Diplomacy v1.34 Update\n\ndolynick\n\nThis mod adds custom races to the game based on races from the various Stargate television series. At present it includes the Ancients, Wraith, Asgard, Goa'uld and the Ori.\n\nAncients:\n\nA race that uses larger, more powerful ships to compose the basis of their fleet. You will have a fraction of the number of ships in your fleet but many of them are more comparable in power to a capital ship for other races than to a frigate. Ancient capital ships are immensely powerful and include the fabled Atlantis city ship. They are also able to build Space Gates that allow near instant travel between planets, allowing them to easily shift their fleet resources as needed.\n\nWraith:\n\nA race whose ships do not have shields but who compensate with increased hull points, armor and regeneration rates. They have a wide selection of cruisers of varying power but only one type of capital ship, Hives, which are the heart of their fleet.\n\nAsgard:\n\nA race whose ships focus on shields and mobility. Asgard vessels and structures have low hull point scores but all have shield points. While they may not have dramatically more shield points than other races, their shields are superior in mitigation factors and mitigation build-up, with multiple research entries for improvements. The Asgard fleet employs no strikecraft but makes up for the lack thereof with superior anti-fighter weaponry on various ships and structures and a notable advantage in mobility. Sublight and hyperspace engines are highly advanced and provide superior mobility in both local gravity wells as well as interplanetary & interstellar travel and the Asgard empire tree provides numerours upgrades which provide further mobility advantages.\n\nGoa'uld\n\nA parasitic race who pose as gods to their subjects. A powerful economy and formiddable diplomatic and cultural tools combine to make them a force to be reckoned with. They may only have a handful of frigates and cruisers but most serve several functions. Powerful capital ships anchor their fleet and complete their tools for conquest.\n\nOri\n\nAn offshoot of the Ancient race founded on fanatical belief in ascended beings who call themselves the Ori. Governed by the Priors, living beings empowered by the Ori to impose their will, the followers of Origin are empowered by the the vast knowledge of the universe that their ascended overlords possess. The Ori fleet is composed of a full compliment of ships varying in size but all very powerful. Even the smallest frigates are protected by powerful shields and the massive capital ships are capable of engaging entire enemy fleets by themselves as they spread Origin across the universe or destroy all those who refuse to submit to the will of the Ori.\n\nAll are Manifest friendly. Verified to work with Volumetric Explosions and Bailknights for Entrenchment. Priority order, top to bottom: 1) SG-Races, 2) PlanetSize, 3) FleetSize, 4) Volumetric, 5) Bailknight's.\n\nIf you are using SGGalaxy then you may stack it with the FleetSize mod as follows: 1) SGGalaxy, 2) FleetSize, 3) Volumetric, 4) Bailknight's.\n\n**Note: It may be necessary to reduce game effect settings to \"high\" from \"highest\", especially when using Volumetric Explosions and Bailknight's graphic effects in conjunction with SGRaces or SGGalaxy. It may also be necessary to edit your user.setting file and increase the MaxParticleCount setting (default value is 6000).No. If the mod is installed properly and working, it will look like regular Sins but you will simply have several Stargate races to choose from when you cycle through your race selection at the start of a game. If you are just using GalaxyMod (not SGGalaxy) and fleetsize, then you won't really see any difference at all except til you are already in game... GalaxyMod just adds a bunch of new planet types you may find as you explore your system (assuming you aren't playing a pre-built map, of course) and fleetsize simply tweaks the fleet/capitol ship numbers as you aquire it.\n\nAny model you might want to donate should, preferably, be done in XSI or exported in .xsi format so that it can be converted to a mesh for Sins. I'm not actively working on the mod right now but I do appreciate the offer. I am not sure how much model work is going to have to be redone for Rebellion either. I suspect there are a few changes in the way it all works.\n\nSoon? Probably not. There will be a fair amount of work involved. When/If I get around to converting it, it will likely happen in phases. There will be a \"beta\" of sorts that is basically the mod, as it stands currently in diplomacy, that will run in Rebellion. There will be no \"Rebellion\" features (titans, etc) but it will work in Rebellion. Phase 2 would be converting certain ships, etc to use the new Rebellion features. For example, the Atlantis would become a titan, as would the Galactic Colossus and Sovereign, etc. This will require a some thought and planning as I will basically have to redo abilities and add some for them to be titan-esque, which is why it won't happen in phase 1.\n\nThat being said, I have not been doing any modding at all for some time and I have barely touched Rebellion as a game yet. I will have to find the motivation to get to this. I will likely be taking holidays over the course of July, so if I find myself with the inclination I may have the spare time to get phase one completed then.\n\nHow's this mod compare with the SGI one? I downloaded SGI not long ago and began adding things to it. However I haven't been able to connect with them, don't know if they are still active and would like to take a look at the few things I've doneAh. Was just wondering how much of an overlap there was, having two separate Stargate Mods seems odd to me.\n\nStill loving your mod dolynick... In case anyone is wondering: Yes, 1.06 still works with Dip 1.37 so they didn't break it for once. Looking forward to new versions (if any), a Rebellion one would be awesome (Atlantis as Titan is win)."

      "text": "EVE Evolved: Trading: The basics\n\nOf all the moneymaking endeavours you can take in EVE Online, trading is perhaps the one with the highest potential for profit. While missin running profit tops out at a few tens of millions per hour and the profit margin from production isn't that big, trading is limited only by the amount of effort you're willing to put in and is much improved by inherent business talent. At the low end of the trading spectrum, beginners can make a healthy income ferrying items from A to B. At the other extreme, a market-savvy individual can pull billions per week out of the players in EVE great conglomerated marketplaces.\n\nIn this first guide in a short series on trading, I look at the different types of trading options available to newer EVE players.\n\nCourier freight\n\nOne of the first trading jobs a new EVE player is likely to try out is running freight. The most basic option is to buy NPC-sold trade goods where they're cheap. This can be good but typically doesn't make a huge amount of ISK for new players who don't have access to a massive freighter. Player-made courier contracts are another viable option. Players often set up public courier contracts requesting that their package be taken from one place to another and if you have enough ISK to front the collateral they've set, you can take the job. I've been known to run courier missions now and then just to feel useful but it can be good ISK for newer players. Before accepting a courier contract, be sure to go over the following checklist:\n\nExamine the route. Avoid taking contracts that force you to go through low security space or you might end up on the business end of a pirate's warp scrambler.\n\nCheck that you have enough cargo space to hold the contract. Remember that courier contracts can't be split up into smaller packages so you'll need a ship big enough to hold the whole thing in one go. Industrial ships are perfect for large packages.\n\nCheck the collateral amount Avoid contracts with high collateral and low rewards. If the item's really worth that much, they should be willing to pay a little more to offset the risk of carrying it. Check the destination station. If the contract is in 0.0, it could be a player-run outpost to which you have no docking rights. If this is the case, you'll be unable to complete the contract and you'll lose your collateral deposit.\n\nLook for additional contracts going to the same system or any system along your route. Grabbing two or three contracts before making the journey could add up to a lot of extra profit. Junkyard pile.\n\nIt's surprising what people will throw away. A few missiles here, an old railgun there. Most people just sell their old bits and bobs to the first sell order that pops up, regardless of its price. The loot from PvP kills also tends to be treated the same way and is just sold to buy orders for some quick profit. Not everyone has the time to watch market orders for a few things to sell and it's these people you can make a lot of ISK out of. By setting up the highest buy order for some items, anyone trying to sell them quickly will be selling on a few items, you'll soon find a few with buy orders far below their true value.\n\nFor maximum effectiveness, you should set the range of your buy order to cover as wide an area as possible. You can then periodically fly around collecting up all your items. The ideal buy order range covers the entire region but be aware that this also includes low security systems so you may need to sneak into them periodically. Instead of collecting the items yourself, another option is to set up courier contracts to have other people move the items for you. If they fail the contract, you'll collect the collateral payment so you won't be out of pocket."

      "text": "Yeah, I think something like that seems reasonable. Only instead of Rebel and Empire, I'd call it light and dark to clarify that it could be 2x Jedi, 2x Rebel, 2x Empire, 2x Sith, and then 1x of something and 1x of something else (just as an example). Having 6 factions is going to make it trickier to keep things balanced.\n\nEach pack of 60 cards wouldn't need to have a perfectly even spread. Remember, each pack of 60 is actually part of a larger cycle of 6 packs that are all connected thematically and mechanically, so think of it more as 360 cards. It's not like having the first pack weigh more heavily for the Imperial Navy will cause some kind of meta game upset, if the next pack is just around the corner.\n\nUnless of course the first pack is a Death Star type Objective card, and the Attack Run event won't release until the end of the cycle…The problem is even if the first cycle is perfectly balanced card wise the meta will screw that up and it will require the next cycle to skew off the \"strongest\" faction. Thankfully it's a \"Living\" game and doesn't have to stagnate on the meta of the day.\n\nWe know that some pods can only be included once per deck, so sometimes there'll need to be a least a few of those singleton pods. Hard to say at this point how common One Per Objective Deck pods will be though, so who knows.\n\nIf they are common, then four pairs of pods and two singleton pods might be standard. If they're less common, five pairs of pods might be the norm with packs including singletons infrequently.Yeah, this could go either way. Even Lord of the Rings LCG is infrequent with this. There was just recently a 'only 1 per deck' card for LotR but they included 3 copies of it in the adventure pack. And yet the Hero cards are also only 1 per deck but we only ever get 1 of each of those.\n\nNever made sense to me.\n\nThey probably did it incase you wanted to run Path of Need in multiple decks, but what are the odds of wanting/needing to do that? Probably about the same odds as me wanting to run the same hero in multiple decks. Or any other card x3 in multiple decks.\n\nLotr heroes aren't one per deck, they're one per game. The other unique cards come in triplicate so you can get to them faster in your deck, but heroes start in play, so you dont need ti fish for them. Plus it gives them an extra two cards for the encounter set. My money is on them doing 2 copies each of all pods, even if they are limited, because it means there's less pods to design and balance.\n\nBut that's my point. Normal cards are 3x per deck and thus 3x per game for ME. Of course, if I like having multiple decks together at the same time with the same cards or if I want Path of Need in MY deck and also in my friend's deck, that's my prerogative. But these optional choices shouldn't be FFG's concern. FFG should supply a person with the max number of each card for one deck and use the extra space for whatever else, something cool. Giving me 3x Path of Need or 2x of a Star Wars pod that are one per deck doesn't help me any more than giving me 3x of a hero. It wastes space for something else worthwhile/cool."

      "text": ".2] Hero rush\n\nBy this I mean the teleport-capable heroes being able to attack your 1st power capping squad when they've barely even started, and often drive them off the point.\n\nJust want to garner peoples' opinions about this. It's annoying, and while I'm all for harass, this literally isn't counterable without delaying you unless you're ready for it. Is that a problem? I'm unsure, so I thought I'd get a few opinions\n\nIt's a very powerful tactic that rapes your capping capabilities in the first minutes of the game.\n\nAgainst Warpspider, you need to have your hero or a Tac squad to chase it off - letting it shoot at your scouts will result in casualties in about 4 seconds of firing. Against Mekboy, you can start meleeing it with scouts to nullify it's damage. Ravener? No idea, haven't played against a single RA yet for some reason.\n\nOr just melee rush him. After teleporting all the way across the map, he'll have to wait to regen energy to escapeNot for long. Tried using an FC to hunt down mekboyz that would attack first-cappers and the mekboy easily teleports away -- well before losing even half of his health. Same for Warp Spider Exarch.\n\nIn the end, this teleportation harassment comes down to the enemy being able to use a single starting unit to tie up 1+ enemy starting units (eg. using scouts+FC to force back). Best case scenario, where you force the enemy hero back with a single squad, then capping capabilities are still even.\n\nMost likely, you've taken losses courtesy of capping damage modifier and the instafire of teleporation and have to use two squads. It's really a shame how unavoidable and easy this is; I've only played a few games as mekboy, and I can assure you that this harassment is as effective as the early ravener ranged unit/tunnel spam [whack a mole].\n\nis some righteous advice. It's a mean opening for a game, but I don't think it's unfair. If his WSE (or Mekboy, or presumably any Eldar hero on a smallish map with Fleet of Foot now being charged at the outset) is tearing ass across the map to get to you, he's disadvantaging himself in capturing power. If you stay the course with few or no losses, you'll probably end up ahead of your enemy.\n\nNo. The whole point of harassing with teleporting hero is to put you at a capping disadvantage. Otherwise it would be an entirely pointless endeavor and waste of your teleporting hero's capping potential. There is probably a reason every TS 35+ opponent I fought comes in knocking with a teleporting hero if they have one.\n\nYou need at least 2 units (unless you are Orks, thanks to pedosluggas) to chase of a teleporting hero from sniping your capping units (the smart harasser goes for gaunts, guardians, and scouts). Heroes that teleport in will have enough energy for 2 combat jumps easily."

The Orion cruiser is just like a star cruiser, except it has fighter support and more crew.\n\nCrew has unfortunately basically no meaning. The Orion's special ability fighters is not that great, unfortunately, though I wouldn't necessarily call a single science console great either.\nThe Vor'Cha has less hull than the Assault Cruiser. The Neg'Var is closest to the Exploration Cruiser Retrofit, but the Retrofit has a special ability that can bring its turn rate way beyond that of the Neg'Var.\n\nI am not necessarily saying you're wrong they seem better, but I know from context, the often simply are not. I think one the primary reasons is because KDF strategies look different from Federation strategies, and that makes certain aspects of a ship's stats more or less important. KDF strategies are build around their cloak -that means any ship that doesn't have cloak is a potential liability. It also is based on hit & run - that makes it every difficult to run effective healer builds, as your allies are constantly zooming in and out. So you want your Cruiser to be build more for a high DPS role (though DHCs are still not that great, despite the higher turn rate of Neg'Var and Vor'Cha) and to work as a \"bait\" for your enemies. That also means that you at least could use a better turn rate. On the Federation Side, you can build and play effective healers as people usually stay togther\n\nThat all mostly applies to PvP. In PvE, a thing like cloak is not that relevant (unless you don't have to kill anyone), but the turn rate and different weapon options might make a difference. (Though maybe not as much... NPCs don't tend to maneuver much, and the BO layout of the AC and SC at least beat the Neg'Vars.)"

      "text": "There's an element to the whole Medieval veneer that does seem a bit silly to me. However, I do find this premise as stated in The Inner Sphere at a Glance to be very intruiging\n\nIn original Battletech (I started playing in the late '80's when I found some of the students I was student teacher for - playing this game at lunch), none of the inner sphere factions really had the capability to make Battkemechs. They were handed down from father to son over generations and were very scarce. Very few new ones were made and they were often put into circulation when a cache of Lostech was discovered someplace.\n\nIf you were lucky enough to be the offspring of someone who had a Wasp, you got the wasp and unless you captured another in battle (very rare) or were granted one by a benefactor state (very, very, very rare) you would never have any other Mech.\n\nThis is where the whole fuedal aspect came into play. A lance of Wasps was a HUGE power on a planet, it was a big deal when a lance fought another lance. Fiefdoms were associated with the individual Battelmech. So you got Dad's Wasp and became Barron of Munchkin IV.\n\nMechwarriors payed fealty up the chain to one of the four factions. It was a Feudal society. Mechwarriors are the knights of that society.\n\nDarq I hear what you're saying. At first that aspect of the Medieval flavoring was missed by me, but the family heritage part of it became a bit more apparent as I read some of the sourcebooks. I'm much more comfortable with the Medieval elemant of the setting now and have in fact grown to really enjoy it.\n\nFor the setting, the ComStar sourcebook was what sealed the deal for me. There's so many elements of SciFi noir intertwined with that organization that I doubt I could ever put together enough adventures/mission to even get close to the bottom of it.\n\nSo Peregry - really likin what I see so far, but have you considered making 'Mechs just big people and going all in with SW rules set? One of the things mechs share in common with people is they are very complicated systems.\n\nUse the same rules for combat. They have armor, by location (covered in the rules), you have weapons stats you can extrapalate from with regards to figuring out armor and weapons - Cannons can be used to extrapalate auto cannons, as your base damage the M2HB is in the main rules.\n\nThe main rules cover the effects of damage to the overall system, targetting individual locations, etc. Take the healing rules, use Tech skills and make them repair rules.\n\nThe first is we like the way BattleTech handles damage and such, and much of the tough, walking tank feel of Mechs come from that damage system. We love Savage Worlds, but its damage system leads to more fragile, characters and very swingy, rather than steady, damage that often results in sudden dramatic kills rather than a grind down that often occurs with BattleTech.\n\nThe second is the amount of balance work that goes into all the various weapon systems. As it stands, BattleTech is pretty balanced, not perfectly mind you, but enough so that we would not be able to convert all the weapons in a balanced manner, especially when you consider figuring armor into it. Using the SW weapons as a base also leads to some ridiculous numbers. Modern tank guns in BattleTech are statted as being Light or Medium Rifles. Being generous we'll say a 120mm Cannon (5d10 damage, AP 68) is a medium rifles, which does 6 damage in BattleTech. This gives 1 BattleTech scale damage coming out to about 1d8 damage per point. So this means an AC20 has to roll 20d8. This means that resolving damage using a SW style system actually ends up taking longer due to the amount of dice being rolled. Its obviously impractical, and so we couldn't use SW numbers as a baseline, and instead we'd have to come up with our own damage scale. Where we then face even more complex balancing issues. _________________ - Peregry\nIt is always giant stompy robot time!\n\nI guess the question is did you want to do an RPG universe for Battletech or a combined RPG / Miniature game. If its the former, balance doesn't matter and combat can remain nebulous. If the latter then yes I see where you are goingGlad you're liking what you see, and feel free to ask design questions or give feedback.\n\nIf you mean a pure SW conversion, I don't mind. If you want it included in the SBT documents in the optional rules section, I'll even integrate it, with you credited of course.\n\nI think there may already exist SW mecha rules in one of the supplements, so I would suggest finding out and if they do use them as a starting point. No need to recreate the wheel, after all. _________________ - Peregry\nIt is always giant stompy robot time!\n\nDarq - I briefly attempted Mecha as characters in my Inteface Zero setting, but reverted back to the SW vehicles style mechs in the setting rules' due to my players not caring for the character approach. I think vehicles as characters works well for spaceships (I've experimented using Chaosmeister's Savage Space rules), but not that well for Mechs. If you want to create Mecha that use the Savage World rules for vehicles, I'd recommend using the examples in Clint Blacks Basic SW Mecha Rules doc at savageheroes.com or the technique in the Sci Fi Gear Toolkit.\n\nAs to not using some BattleTech rules in a SW conversion; I'm not sure there's that big of an audience for it. Since getting into the BT tabletop and exploring SBT, I've participated in a number of threads with fans discussing the different MechWarrior RPGs. Those threads were on the official BT forums as well as on RPG.NET site, so not just current fans. A recurring theme in all of those threads was that fans liked 2 different scales and they all liked some BT crunch. At the same time, there were a lot of comments that using standard BT rules (and the adapted rules in most of the MW RPGs) for mech combat scale bogged things down. It was almost a unanimous consensus that pure BT (or something very close) rules within a RPG was far too slow and crunchy to support the fluidity of an RPG adventure. I think you have to take an approach like peregry and his team have, where you balance some of the crunch of BT with the better elements of Savage Worlds like movement and the combat to-hit game mechanics.\n\nAs to having PCs and mechs on the same scale (not sure if you're inteding that) its far trickier than it at 1st seems. Even in Interface Zero where mechs are much smaller and far, far less powerful than BT 'Mechs, they seem truly omnipotent when placed amongst PC's. As a GM you either have to put every PC in a mech (very tricky in that setting due to costs, backgrounds and potential NPC retaliation) or be very careful how you structure the action sequences in adventures. From what little exploration I've done in putting together some SBT adventures, I can say its far easier to handle the transition to a different scale for adventures in which MechWarrior PCs mount up.\n\nAnyhow, just my own 2 cents.\n\n[Edit] BTW, I'm with you on the earlier periods in the BT canon - or at least the earlier part of the 31st century. My campaign is going to begin in the late 3rd Succession War (starting 3020) and run to the War of 3039. I'm still not sure what house PC's will be in, but Im leaning towards Davion or Kurita - favoving Kurita so I can involve the Ronin War and the Free Rasalhague Republic. In particular within that timeframe, I find the years around Tiepolo's reign as ComStar Primus to be very dark and interesting. I'm defnititely going to have some ComStar draconinan antics figure into some of my adventures.\n\nCan you ellucidate on why it didn't work well? I would be interested in what pain points you ran into.\n\nWith regards to the setting, I think one of the big roleplaying factors missing from \"Neo-Battletech\" is the irreplaceability of mechs, ammunition and components. I don't see anyone these days ceding the battlefield to avoid trashing their irreplacable mech or scavanging battlefields for ammo. Those were the good old days!\n\nHate to break it to you, but the days of BattleMechs being completely irreplaceable was gone back when the game first became known as BattleTech, rather than BattleDroids. Canon wise, the Great Houses could build repair parts and ammo with impunity (I'd never heard of ammo being in short supply before, merely Mechs) throughout the entire history.\n\nAnything else that you've heard was, quite simply, wrong.* ;p\n\nFrom a design standing point, we've been trying to ensure that everything within the system we can convert, is converted. To our playing, we're actually playing through the game's history, though our campaign started in the mid-3040s and we're in the original Clan Invasion right now. The Clans are a great antagonist from a GMing perspective, so long as they perceive the PCs as honorable opponents they will only attack with a force just good enough to threaten, but not enough to overwhelm the PCs. This is the opposite of the Great Houses, who once a group becomes a sufficient threat will simply unload overkill and be done with it.\n\n---------------------------\n* In regards to BattleTech canon, newer ALWAYS trumps older unless you're dealing with a 3rd person omniscient viewpoint (ie novels). Most source books, especially those with a lot of setting fluff, are actually considered to be written \"in universe\" and subject to the in universe publisher's limited knowledge, or just flat out misinformation. In fact, one of the reason the earlier source books paint the Inner Sphere as worse off than it actually was was because ComStar wanted it to look like that in an effort to undermine the Great Houses. _________________ - Peregry\nIt is always giant stompy robot time!\n\nOnly the most technologically advanced planets can manufacture them, and few planets have any major technological base left. The Succession Wars have devestated the industry of the Inner Sphere, and 'Mech fatalities have almost exceeded the total output of new 'Mechs and spare parts. Battlefield salvage and Star League supply depots have become major objectives in the Succession Wars.\n\nNow granted I may have run with this a bit, but I seem to remember the early novels: pre-Clans agreeing with this interpretation. I seem to remember some Comstar shanannigans where they were hiding the tech and controlling the political clime with judicious release of parts.\n\nThat was definitely the status quo in 3025, but things had picked baxk up in time for the 4th War.\n\nBasically the 1st and 2nd Succession Wars were total war with Star League era weapons (and WMDs in the 1st War). The 3rd, which lasted the longest, was at the lower level intensity, and by the end of it Mechs had been teched down and were becoming more rare. The Helm Memory Core and NAIS began reversing the, seeing the return of full scale troop movement in the 4th War and then the reemergence of some tech in the War of 3039. It was not until after the Clan Invasion the Inner Sphere had gotten, militarily tech wise, to the same level as the Star League.\n\nComStar never sold tech, as far as I remember, except when they sold the Dracs Star League era mechs in the lead up to the War of 3039, and that was purely a move to spite Hanse Davion and the fledgling Federated Commonwealth. Other than that, if they had it, they kept it. Of course, perhaps they did sell things occasionally and we never heard about it, they kept the records after all... _________________ - Peregry\nIt is always giant stompy robot time!\n\nCan you ellucidate on why it didn't work well? I would be interested in what pain points you ran into.\n\nSure... its a fairly complex discussion so I'll try to keep it simple, but I'll probably fail. Bottom line, with mecha (Golemmechs in Interface Zero) as chacacters we found it sucked the mecha out of the setting. With the mecha having their own traits, playing them became more akin to a super powers or Fantasy setting where you're battling with your omnipotent summoned companion.\n\nI used 2 differents systems. Initially I just treated them as WC's and used the construct rules as per SWD. I handled everything as per standard characters but kept vehicular ACC/TS, gave them d12+1 base strength and of course they had Heavy Armor that began at a base of 20(5) and upgradable. I tried using character pace briefly, but it really didn't fit the IZ setting at all. The result was truly a powerful entitiy, but playing them was more like playing Mechaton; your summoned, bad-ass construct.\n\nthe 2nd was a mecha variation of Chaosmeisters' Spaceships as Characters (Savage Space) system. In that system the 5 base attributes define much of a spaceship, so I adapted it to mecha. In IZ there's a matrix of 11 different variable systems that define a mech, with most of those conferring a bonus to a piloting PC's skill and some a penalty to a NPC's skill. So using the Savage Space model I linked those systems to a base attribute and made them upgradable by increasing the attribute type. While others -still linked to an attribute- could only be enhanced through parts upgrades. All attributes start at a die level of d4 just as in standard SWD character creation. Something to note about IZ golemmechs, is that they would sit somewhere between BattleTech Body Armor and Light 'Mechs.\nSo...basically what it broke down to was:\n\nThe ACC/TS (engine), VCI-Ring, GPS, Commlink, Life Support, Structural toughness and number of wounds were all treated as integral parts of the mech and consequently they could be improved with an attribute increase. All the others could only be enhanced via parts upgrades, with the linked attribute providing a bonus via a lower cost (the higher the cheaper.) A good thing because stuff is damn expensive in IZ. Strength was critical as it not only increased hand/melee damage but also the number of slots that allowed other parts to be upgraded or added - all weapons take up 1 slot. I was told by the setting creators that the golemmech's wouldn't be capable of kicking motions, so that why its not factored in. The Heavy Amor penetration prevention could also only be increased via armor upgrades.\n\nMeanwhile the mech's/golemmech's Shooting, Piloting, Fighting, Notice, Stealth and Climbing skills were all standard character skills, with the exception that stealth required a stealth unit installation to be available and climbing was linked to Strength. Golemmechs can't jump in IZ so that wasn't a worry. I didn't go as far as mecha/golemmech hindrances and edges, but it would have been very easy to add them. There's quite a bit more to it than that (such as intial build points) but hey I can't type forever.\n\nThe result of the 2nd approach were mecha that still seemed like a sophisticated combat mech, but the flavor of them made them feel a bit too advanced for the setting; IZ is Earth 2087. The plus of this was it did allow some fun fighting in golemmech Vs golemmech situations, but its hard to provide that often in IZ scenarios. And you can't easily shift scale in IZ like in SBT. The 2nd technique did help a bit with preventing the mecha from feeling like they'd been completely sucked out of the setting, but ultimately players wanted their PC's skills to drive the actions of a mecha and this still didn't provide that. In the end I just tweaked the base IZ golemmech system (which does have quite a few holes) and my players were much happier with that.\n\nSomething I don't think I explained too well in my last post, is exactly how I felt mehca as characters sucked the mecha out of the setting. There's actually 3 points; 1) as already mentioned, it makes mecha feel too much like you're battling with a 20 ton, summoned behemoth; 2) For a Hard SciFi setting (which I consider both BT and IZ to be) it diminishses a lot of that cool flavoring and interesting tech; 3) It detracts to some extent from roleplaying, as the consequences/challenges of being in mech battles gets relegated to the design and skill of the mechs as opposed to the PC's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIt was the 3rd point that was the biggest complaint amongst my players, hence their desire to really have their PCs driving golemmechs. In terms of the impact on hard-sci tech; despite best intentions and attention to detail, you lose some of it when you have mecha as characters. Trying to maintain it all results in mecha characters being too complex. Contrast that to SBT where you keep all the grind, crunch, nuts & bolts and myomer bundles of BT's 'Mech construction technology. IZ is less hard-sci than BT, but even with it there were detractions; i.e. the VCI-Ring really became a purposeless piece of equipment with golemmechs as characters, whereas it's a major boon for PC pilots.\n\nWhere I think mecha as characters can fly well is in Pulp SciFi or Weird Science settings. So for those cool, wheeled Hailfire Droids in Star Wars II or those retro, radio controlled mecha in Sky Captain the World of Tomorrow, the rules I adapted from Savage Space could work nicely.\n\nLast edited by kronovan on Wed Jun 27, 2012 11:10 am; edited 1 time in total\n\nI don't think I explained correctly where I want to go with this (of course I'm not sure exactly where that is so...). I don't want to treat the mecha as characters, per se. I want to handle combat and movement like character combat and movement, not vehicle combat and movement.\n\nPlayer A in his Warhammer shoots a dual PPC shot at a Marauder. Player A makes a ranged attack using his Mech Shooting skill instead of his shooting skill. Everything else works as normal.\n\nThe Marauder has armor and a Toughness (though they will be much bigger than normal characters (like 50)) and the PPC does damage of 10d20 (MG does 1 point (2d10 for M2HB) and PPC does 10 points damage (Which scaled up to match the M2HB would be 20d10, which I took the liberty of changing to 10d20 - same upper limit, more damage likely). Then go on as normal.\n\nMechs can be shaken and incapacitated, managing damage without getting into all the fiddly minutia, they can recover as the Pilot overrides burnout systems etc - you can do a lot with the narrative! Injury table represents systems knocked out by location.\n\nI picture applying healing / medical rules, using Astech skill, etc. So you don't need to track the specifics, just generalizations - The left arm is out.\n\nI'm not sure how abstracting damage will enhance RP, I also think that your idea might actually be slower than what we use in SBT. The only thing that it sort of allows is a more seamless transition between normal SW and Mechs.\n\nAs to speed, let us consider the attack scenario you presented, that of a single PPC attack.\n\nStep 1 is to roll the attack roll, this is the same Gunnery vs TN. This is quick and painless, so long as everyone knows their TNs.\n\nStep 2 in SBT is to determine hit location. 2d6 and consult a table doesn't take long (moreso if you have a hit location roller app like we use). This is probably the biggest slowdown in SBT, but not where a single big hit weapon is concerned.\n\nStep 2 for you is Roll Damage. For small weapons this won't be bad, but for the PPC with 10d20 this will take quite a bit of time.\n\nStep 3 for SBT is apply Damage to location.\n\nStep 3 for you is apply Damage vs Toughness.\n\nStep 4 for both is determine results of Damage, deal with \"Wounds\" or Criticals. I have no idea how these would compare. In SBT this can be as quick as \"nothing/not happening\" to quite a while due to resolving crits, using bennies to \"Soak\" etc. I imagine this could also be as quick as the similar nothing of SBT or a long drawn out process.\n\nPlease don't think I'm trying to discourage you or criticize the idea, rather I'm just trying to point out complications and am curious your opinions of things"

I tried making FS + shees, but the seer can't take down the CL and the shees die to the CL and Raptors. I also tried teching to tier 2 and getting CoW, but that takes too long and costs too much (by the time CoW is done, I've used up too much requisition to have enough shees). Is there anything else I can defeat him with? I tried Reapers once too, but Raptors move very quickly and even FoFd Reapers have trouble escaping them.\n\nRaptors are uber expensive. You should have some time to prepare if he is using lots of them. I suggest getting using Psychic storm liberally, and have multiple reaper squads (Guide the one that's not being chased) so he can't tie them up all at once.\n\nAlso, upgrade your LPs, and lead the raptors in a circle around the LP. They'll die eventually or back off.\n\nRaptors are not as strong as ASM, and die to any focused fire, that's why they are usually used for harrassing\n\nSay hello to 650 hp aspiring champions that come a second later, as all good csm raptor harassers wil learn to do versus an eldar player.

      "text": "Sunday, February 17, 2013\n\nUnsheathed Claws\n\nWhen I started writing this, it was pondering over the issue of war decs and how they affect high sec. It is one of the eternal \"broken features\" in Eve.\n\nAfter reading some of the comments on both sides and by third parties with the Purple (Red vs Blue) x Eve Uni war it presents itself at a different angle. Some say that no one should dec Eve Uni due to their position as a New Player helper organization However, there are more than new players in Eve Uni. If no one ever did anything to Eve Uni 'for the newbies' it would become a haven for people to hide from the rest of the game forever.\n\n\"Did this damage Eve Uni?\" Someone suggested to me that it did. I don't know. I'm not in Eve Uni. I just hang out in their help channel. Damage is part of Eve. As is loss. If the war dec system was removed this day could not have happened. If war were mutual this may not have happened. Yet, the very defines of war does not speak of mutual decisions.\n\n: a state of usually open and declared armed hostile conflict between states or nations\n\n: a period of such armed conflict\n\n: state of war\n\n: a state of hostility, conflict, or antagonism\n\n: a struggle or competition between opposing forces or for a particular end\n\nYet, why do people expect it to be mutual because it is in a video game? It is a video game that we entered with the foreknowledge that we can not dictate the environment and all of the events. I learned this well myself this weekend and I will cover that on Monday (I think).\n\nYet, listening to discussions and having discussions I'm picking up the strands of thought that speak of why the war dec system is broken and needs to be mutual. It is not that the dec system itself is hopeless and conceptually wrong it is that war within a video game may create a presumption formed from a participants idea of what would be fun for them.\n\nThis war was \"fun\" while other wars are \"not fun\". Should war in a game have to be easily defined as fun?\n\nA few weeks ago, in a conversation a newer player asked:\n\n\"Why don't warring parties just make a gentleman's agreement not to pod kill? A gentleman's agreement not to pod kill seems like a way to move to a more mutually beneficial nash equilibrium.\"\n\nIn game theory, the Nash equilibrium is a solution concept of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players, in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no player has anything to gain by changing only his own strategy unilaterally. If each player has chosen a strategy and no player can benefit by changing his or her strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices and the corresponding payoffs constitute a Nash equilibrium.\n\nSomeone told him that his idea was not a Nash Equilibrium. I asked him why someone would go to war and then hand over benefits and gains to him? He said, \"add game.\"\n\nAhh yes, Eve is a game. I don't actually forget that. I believe instead of \"add game\" it is more create an environment I want to participate in on an equal situation. It decreases risk and minimizes loss. If that is what both parties want then go for it. However, when one thinks 'War' I doubt that many also think, \"Let me allow my target into a situation where he too will receive benefits from this\".\n\n\"Adding game\" may mean \"let us make sure that everyone is having fun\". But sometimes people's fun is removing others fun. This is where we step into the types of games and people get to lift their sandbox flag to defend Eve. It all fits in there, sure. But, the sandbox has edges and those edges are controlled by CCP. It wanders back into the land of \"what are the worlds restrictions?\" It always will because CCP ultimately controls the world and creates the restrictions that we then work with to the best of our abilities.\n\nOur sandbox flag only has the strength in the materials that CCP gave us to create it. Yet, inside of it we are allowed to run free. Only, not quite. We have zones and areas and rules and we work inside of them. CCP has created hard boundaries and unfettered our hands to go and play inside of those boundaries. But they are still there.\n\nBut the freedom is confusing. It is as confusing as a wild animal raised and tamed and then kicked out into the wild to figure out life. Some do and some don't. The above solution, so simple is domestication meeting the wilderness. Domestication often gets stomped but the wilderness too can be crushed by the relentlessness of domestication. We have war between the wilderness and domestication with each side stomping over the other depending on who comes to visit. War is not a static concept. The very use of the word is wrong for the majority of uses the 'war' system has. But, because it is not static all the uses also fall into what war can be defined as.\n\nIt is such a hard balance. The war thing. It is so simple and to me sensible to say 'deal' it's war. The problem is all of those hard boundaries and domestication. I am not going to have a gentlemen's agreement not to pod someone during a war. Yet, I have personally created those agreements to create prearranged fights to help introduce the wilderness to the domesticated parties. At some point the war can turn into a prearranged situation. It is still defined as war but it loses the feel of war and becomes more of an event.\n\nI don't come to an answer. I kind of get lost in my own musings as I try to figure out how to end this. My thoughts have a lot of elasticity here. I will leave it open and see what else bubbles to the surface.\n\n9 comments:\n\nI have a friend in EveUni who has been playing a lot longer than I. They're also into heavier things like multiple wormholes with full capital support, and sound more than willing to be looking for fights anywhere in Eve. So unless someone wanted to split them into an explicitly newbie organization and then make that dec-free it wouldn't work. Just something to pass on if someone suggests that to you again.\n\nBut as people have noted plenty before, there is a lot not-warlike in Eve \"wars\". Sides are not extinguished (since capsuleers are immortal, even when they don't just dock up) and there really is little or no resources acquired in highsec war decs. Maybe a moon changes hands at most.\n\nI've been flying in the war with RvB. I think we're testing E Uni in a way that doesn't normally happen and they've made quite a few mistakes of piloting and FC. Which is a great way to learn.\n\nSo not only are we giving the newbie unistas a very exciting and pvp-oriented start to Eve Online but we are also improving the teachers. At the moment it's looking a bit like \"those who can't do, teach\" as FCs have warped link ships and logis rather naively at times. We've also seen hilarous chat confusion - I joined in the conversation this morning as a couple of unistas were working out in local how to proof the organisation against spies.\n\nAt top level though there's a lot of good will towards Eve Uni from RvB and while we like going round to their house and smashing up some toys we're only playing and they are our friends.\n\nI don't think it's at all absurd to add rules and conditions to war. It happens in real life, and sometimes the belligerent parties even abided by them. There's certainly less moral imperative to create a Space Geneva convention or similar things (e.g. WMD bans), but there's no particular reason that two parties in EVE couldn't come to some reciprocal agreement that, war or not, it will be better for everyone if they all follow certain conventions (don't use links, don't podkill, don't convospam, don't attack 'civilian infrastructure', etc...). I think it happens less because: a) it's a game and no one sees it as a moral outrage to podkill b) victory by inflicting material loss on your enemy is impractical, people fall back on 'crush their spirit' as a tactic, which is not conducive reciprocal agreements to not be dicks.\n\nSometimes we tend to take a too serious look at EVE and use words as War to describe it.\n\nIt's more like playing rugby against your mates in school. It's an aggressive high contact sport, we use the same rules as the real \"pros\", it will have a winner and a loser but in the end of the day we pat the loser in the back and say \"good game and see you next year for a rematch\". Winners are happy, and losers go plan and train hard for the rematch. At least is what we did in RvB.\n\nWe could have added rules of no podding like we have in RvB, but they are really hard to enforce and discussion about reimbursement for accidents would probably spoil the fun for people and create an hostile environment that would lead to real war which would be the same in space, but with angry people behind the keyboards. Soon mockery, arguments in local chat would emerge and instead of friends we would become real adversaries. Not fun anymore"

I hope I'm wrong. At the very least, if you're going to charge dilithium to recruit crew members, then those recruitment missions should not take up an assignment slot.

      "text": "Operations\n\nRaptor\n\nRaptors are a type of Klingon playable starship. They are powerful, medium-sized warships of the Klingon Defense Force. Raptors are available at tiers 2 to 5, to Klingon characters from the rank of Lieutenant Commander upward. They typically carry around twice the crew of a Bird-of-Prey, and are built purely for firepower. They have good maneuverability and are comparable to the Federation Escort.\n\nRaptors utilize a triangular configuration typical of the Klingon fleet, with bridge forward at the narrow point of the hull, and warp nacelles at the aft corners. The main body of the Raptor follows the center line of the ship from the bridge to the stern, increasing in volume toward the stern. Wings taper back from the neck forward, to the nacelles aft-starboard and aft-port.\n\nContents\n\nTo see which rank and profession of Bridge Officers you can have hover your mouse over the icons in the Bridge Officer column of the table. The values in the shield column show the capacity of the shield that ship has equipped as standard. See the shields guide for more details.\n\nThe Somraw Raptor is the first Raptor class starship that players of the Klingon Empire will gain access to. It has very good maneuverability, although not as good as a Bird-of-Prey. In comparison to the Bird-of-Prey which is the only ship at the Lieutenant Commander level for players, it has a better hull and one extra tactical station which is highly beneficial even at lower levels. It does however have a lower shield modifier, lower maneuverability and cannot cloak in combat.\n\nThe Qorgh class is a third tier (Commander rank) Klingon Raptor. It provides players with an excellent choice to upgrade to if they used the original Raptor. Even if they didn't, it's a very good choice of ship. It is larger than its predecessor but still follows the same design principles. Unfortunately, it doesn't carry extra fore weapons much like the Bird-of-Prey of its tier. For more fore weapons, players should consider a Cruiser.\n\nThe Pach Raptor is the Captain Tier Raptor vessel available to Klingon Empire players. It is very similar in design to the Qorgh other than minor differences. The main difference is the neck stem connecting the main hull to the bridge, which instead of being a solid hull is comprised of several stems. It is the first Raptor to carry four frontal weapon slots and a Commander rank Tactical station.\n\nThe Qin Raptor is the most powerful Raptor available to players of the Klingon Empire and is only available when players reach the rank of Brigadier General. The design is not as progressive compared to the other types. It loses its red nacelles, has smaller wings (in ratio to the size of the vessels) and the neck stem is much smaller due to an enlarged hull at the fore section. The overall structure is vaguely reminiscent of early Andorian Kumari Class vessels due to the wings structural design, as well as the forward hulls size being dwarfed by the forward command module. Regardless, it has a very strong Klingon flavor to its overall design.\n\nThe Raptor is a formidable ship for any opponent, and for a player it brings a large amount of firepower to a fight. The ship is quite maneuverable and can out-match most Federation vessels (except for the Escort type starship). Raptors, like most Klingon vessels, have the ability to equip cannons into their arsenal. The brunt of a Raptors firepower comes from the front of the ship which holds more weapon slots than the aft section. Raptors unfortunately have weak shields due to sub-par Science and Engineering stations.\n\nDue to their small crew size the Raptor has a poor repair rate. Raptors, much like a Bird-of-Prey, is superior in numbers compared to solo play although solo play for the ship is still very viable as a play style. They are very quick ships at impulse speeds and are only slightly slower than a Bird-of-Prey. In comparison to Federation vessels are equal to Escort class ships and faster than Cruisers and Science vessels. This provides the player with a good ability to maintain their firepower on specific sections of the opponents shields and hull"

      "text": "TOE is \"Table of Organization and Equipment\" and is one of the documents stating how a military force is to be organized. How many planes, how many pilots, how many people in the ground crew, and on and on and on. In a bit I'll try and dig up some examples and post a link. Questions like \"What does CAG stand for\" and \"What's the CIC\" are what this is for.\n\nSince two such question have come up in rapid succession, I'll answer them here, and then leave off:\n\nThe CIC is the combat information center, it is the room in which information about the battle is collected, and it is a principle place from which any battle will be directed; on BG it seems to also include the functions of a ships bridge, which is the location from which a ship is driven. This strikes me as very reasonable for a ship in space.\n\nCAG stands for Commander Air Group. While the Colonial the Colonial Fleet TOE (Table of Orginization and Equipment) remains a deep, dark mystery which we might hope to solve here, in Western navies (which BG more than a little resembles) the CAG commands the embarked air wing, and is a peer of (rather than subordinate too) the skipper of the carrier.\n\n[Edited to add: Strega, is there anyway you, or someone else, can fix that \"your\"? Sorry. Homonyms are my natural predator]\n\nDone. I made it \"BG TOE\" so it wouldn't be quite so long. Plus, it's rhyme-y.\n\nOn the show, the XO seems to be sort of a mediator in military decisions affecting both the air wing and the carrier -- which it seems like you'd need, but what do I know? Does that correspond to the modern navy? Or am I imagining the whole thing?\n\nThere's a great resourse availble on understanding how a USN carrier battle-group is organized at  . It's a little dated but it gets the high points, written for Reserve Officers reporting on-board for their duty-tours. It even has ship-board etiquette and what-to-pack.\n\nCurrent USN military doctrine has the Carrier's Captain and the CAG as co-equals reporting to the strike-force's commanding Admiral. The Carrier XO (usually of the rank of Captain) runs the ship-side of the day-to-day operations.\n\nWe've also met the Landing Signal Officer (LSO). In the miniseries his name was Captain Kelly. He's the guy who was questioning Adama about Tigh's fitness for command.\n\nLike the CAG, this also is a real wet-navy position.\n\nAlso, as far as CIC goes, (reasonably minor spoiler follows)in a later episode there's a scene where Adama and company, in the midst of a battle, clearly change rooms between one with tactical displays and another where they give the ship movement commands. This seems to argue that there's either a CIC, or at least a battle briefing room of some type which is somewhat seperate from the bridge.\n\nI thought I caught railroad tracks on the back of Starbuck's helmet during \"Bastile Day\", just as a data point. Maybe they're some kind of integrated service, kind of like the Candian Forces?\n\nCould be. The odd mix of army-style and navy-style ranks could be a result of Joint doctrine gone horribly wrong, resulting in a unified rank structure designed to confuse everyone (grin).\n\nWhat we desparately need from the show's PTB is a table of rank insignia. Well, I deparately need one. I have a thing for rank tables. Ahem.\n\nI had typed a lot more, but I found myself going in circles trying to figure out how a Commander can outrank a Colonel, and gave up. At least one other Marine had those two white bars on his helmet, by the way.\n\nHelo who's stuck on Caprica referred to himself to Boomer as her ECO which I think means Electronic Combat Officer since he ran some controls in the back of the Raptor. Either that or it could be Equipment Control Officer.\n\nWhat we desparately need from the show's PTB is a table of rank insignia. Well, I deparately need one. I have a thing for rank tables. Ahem.\n\nThe odd mix of army-style and navy-style ranks could be a result of Joint doctrine gone horribly wrong, resulting in a unified rank structure designed to confuse everyone (grin).\n\nI'll buy that. I have a tough enough time trying to keep the Army and Air Force acronyms straight at the Pentagon...\n\nMaybe Galactica is a combination of an aircraft carrier and amphibious assault ship - more analogous to what the USN and USMC are doing with the Expeditionary Strike Group concept: \n\nThe ship certainly looks large enough to carry both her fighter wing and troops, and the hints at unrest on Sagittarion (President 'Stands with Dri-Erase Marker' mentioned President Adar sending in the Marines at the end of \"33\") certainly indicate a need for some sort of assault capability for the Colonial Navy.\n\nA word or acronym I've heard a few times on BG is pronounced something like \"draedus\". It appears to be referencing thair radar-like system. Anyone know what the word actually is, and what it refers to?\n\nThanks for this! I'd sort of had CIC figured out, but the whole might-also-just-be-the-bridge thing had me confused. But since it's all still sort of a combat situation anyway, it makes more sense to me now that I look at it. Man, as if I ever needed reason #865 not to join the military, it would be my complete inability to be down with rank, protocol, and acronymns/abbreviations.\n\nI think the thing with the CIC is that it would (as far as I can make out) be used primarily when leading a Battlestar Group into battle. Since the Galactica doesn't have a carrier group anymore (unless, you know, Adama wants to start issuing orders like \"Astral Queen, you fly up to the Cylons, go boogedy boogedy boo, and run away real fast\") and really just needs to direct itself, the bridge is pretty much all they need.\n\nIt's their sensor/radar type system, right? At first I thought it was the name of a ship, but every ship seems to have a dradis (DRADIS?). It seems like it must be an acronym, but I have no idea what for.\n\nGlobalSecurity.Org has the same problems we do with how things are \"organized\".\n\n\"... Land lubbers accustomed to the admirable clarity of the organization of the United States Air Force, or the slight quirkiness of the organization of the United States Army, will be quickly alarmed and bewildered by what claims to pass for the \"organization\" of the United States Navy. Indeed, those not of a naval persuasion may be surprised to learn that the Navy is \"organized\" at all, in that units intermediate between numbered fleets and individual ships so rarely figure in public accounts of naval activities. And the more that one learns of US Navy \"organization\" the less it is understood, given the bizarre diversity and inconsistency of unit designations. One source of this confusion is the distinction between tactical and administrative chains of command, while additional obscurity derives from individual commanders wearing multiple hats in various chains of command. \"\n\nThis topic should be fun.....\n\nDRAEDUS might be a deep-space version of the USN's AEGIS radar-aircombat system. (Hint: AEGIS is not an DoD acronym. Aegis was the armored-cloak worn by Zues and Athena, spun of Gold in the form of a goatskin, with the Gorgon's head as it's clasp.)\n\nAnyway, with all BG's pseudo-Greek mythology allusions, it wouldn't surprise me had they used \"AEGIS\" for such a thing, particularly when there's already a real world counterpart. So I'd assumed that \"dradis\" was something else.\n\nAccording to the official website, the officer ranks in the Colonial fleet are: Ensign, Lieutenant j.g., Lieutenant, Captain, Colonel, Commander, Admiral. There are also Colonial Marines, but their rank structure is unknown (they have not as yet appeared onscreen).\n\nAccording to the official website, the officer ranks in the Colonial fleet are: Ensign, Lieutenant j.g., Lieutenant, Captain, Colonel, Commander, Admiral. There are also Colonial Marines, but their rank structure is unknown\n\nThere aren't any colonels or majors in the USN. It goes ensign, j.g., lieutenant, lt. commander, commander, captain, then admirals.\n\nWe can't really put this on Ron Moore and company either. The ranks were very central to the original show, and while they dumped a lot of the baggage of the original, I think they felt it somewhat essential to keep Adama as a \"Commander\", because it had become somewhat emblematic to call him that. From that I suppose it made sense to keep Tigh as a Colonel and so on, because that use of \"Commander\" was already nonsense. Glen A. Larson is to blame! Yup!\n\nAnd actually \"Major\" does seem to have gotten lost. I mean Glen Larson was already pilfering multiple military services, so I wonder why \"Major\" got the boot.\n\nIf the quote about the rank structure pans out, then the two bars on Starbuck's helmet were indeed the correct rank, if the Colonials use US Navy tactical insignia (a variant of the \"brass\" insignia they wear on the khaki uniform collar. Which is the same as the other services' regular insignia, but completely different from the stripe-based insignia on the dress blue uniform sleeves, thus requiring each sailor to memorize two different insignia for each officer rank. It's not just a job, it's a giant headache). Or it could have been a coincidence.\n\nAnd actually \"Major\" does seem to have gotten lost. ...so I wonder why \"Major\" got the boot.\n\nThere's a military joke there somewhere, but I can't quite think of it. Anyway, could the doctor be a Marine doctor? Maybe the Marines have Majors. The Navy probably got rid of it (assuming for the moment that the list above is complete) to avoid things like \"Major Payne\" or \"Major Major.\"\n\nMy gut feeling is that DRADIS is just RADAR spelled sideways. There are a number of little things about the show that send the message, \"They're just like us, only different.\" Instead of RADAR they have DRADIS. Instead of radio, they have wireless. Instead of \"november\" and \"charlie,\" they have \"nebula\" and \"constellation.\" Instead of \"mayday\" they have \"crypter.\"\n\n(I'm not saying that DRADIS works just like RADAR only with a different name. The inner workings could depend on modulated neutrino emissions or Einstein-Rosen particle pairs or the moral power of virginity for all I know. I'm just saying that our word for \"machine that sees far for us\" is \"RADAR\" while their word for the same thing is \"DRADIS.\")\n\nA small nitpick but we use the term wireless for radio as well. Though admittedly it's not incredibly common. Also, given how they've been treating the communication equipment on the ships (one way telegram-like communications over long distances, voice coms over short, and no communication after jumping away from the fleet) it looks very much like they're trying to be consistent with using a lightspeed limited electro-magnetic wave for communication.\n\nIn \"Act of Contrition\" Apollo says he's got 40 surviving Vipers (and 21 pilots). Does that fit into the context of this thread (which seems to be about military organization)?\n\nAlso in the episode, Starbuck makes references to LSOs (during her story about Cmdr. Adama's 1,000 landing) and meatballs (when trying to help the nugget land). The former presumably stands for Landing Signal Officer (as the one who would guide the Vipers to a safe landing) and meatballs as the signal that Vipers follow to the landing area. Seems pretty conforming to U.S. Navy stuff to me."

      "text": "Musings about the virtual and the real world\n\nHulks and Roleplay\n\nThe war between the naive high-security miners and the goons who suicide them continues – apparently in perpetuum. I don't specifically care for either group much. The miners bore me with their whining about \"security\" and the gankers bore me since they represent the anonymous and self righteous mass that makes up 90% of online (and RL) populace. And as a Wormhole Dweller and non-industrialist, I don't care much for mining anyway. So, this little drama should not bother me.\n\nBut it does and I wondered why and I only now figured out, why. It has nothing to do with the unfairness of the fight. After all, I like shooting at unarmed ships. That's part of EVE Online as much as its spreadsheet appeal. You don't like it, find another game. In fact, I like that miners need to deploy organization, wits and some coordination to their game. Creativity is never bad. What really bothers me is something different. It is the \"suicide\" mechanic of the gankers that creates the appearance of an exploit rather than a game mechanic. Let me explain:\n\nScience fiction stories – and EVE is noting but a big, interactive science fiction story – rely on altered parameters of the world. We have railguns, laser weapons and mining lasers as part of this environment and work with the tools that we are given to create our corner in the universe. Good science fiction is internally consistent. I.e. you can make up rules, new laws of physics etc but they have to mesh into a consistent and – somewhat – believable whole. Otherwise the immersion is broken and bad science fiction is riddled with that problem. For example, in EVE Online, Concord represents the police force that prevents and punishes crimes. Attacking others in \"High security\" space is a crime. So, someone attacks a miner, police ships come and destroy it – before the miner is destroyed hopefully but certainly afterwards. It is supposed to work as a preventative and a punitive mechanism at the same time. It just doesn't. The punishment that is dished out is – in ISK terms - negligible for an alliance or even a motivated player. The \"Police\" is powerless as the perpetrator doesn't have a high enough risk to contemplate.\n\nThis is not internally consistent with the environment we play in. In other words, the suicide tactics of the Brainless Ones is anathema to the laws of the world we created. I mean, how many thousands of non-capsuleers have died for the whims of The Mittani? Wouldn't there me mass industrial actions among the crews? Wouldn't Concord not understand the very basic mechanics and adapt to the strategies? We demand better AI from our NPC rats, where is the AI of Concord? I am really not a RP player – I have a ton of respect for those who make it work for them – but I rebel against game elements that are internally not consistent and break the immersion. And suicide ganking is one of them.\n\nNow what? CCP wanted to make it difficult and expensive to commit crimes in high security space. Now it is dirt-easy and virtually free of consequence. The fact that it is called \"High Security\" and that a powerless police arrives eventually creates the illusion of safety that the miners desire. So, I put it to CCP, if they actually wanted a real \"High Security\" environment, they have to create one. This means, make the police much faster (park them on all belts), improve tanks on miners and so on. Is that desirable? I personally don't thing so. But it would delineate the high-security from low. And, at the same time, make mining in low sec much more profitable than mining in high sec, same way as CCP basically killed PI in high sec.\n\nThe bottom line is, we do participate inside a RP environment whether we want to or not. We all adhere to the given rules of the universe but unlike the physical laws CCP is at the power to change the physical laws. The conflict we have currently between the miners and the gankers is caused by an invalid and outdated expectation of what the laws of the our universe are.\n\nPost navigation\n\n6 Responses to Hulks and Roleplay\n\nWhile CCP may continue to make criminal activity more difficult, the only answer to organized ganking would have to be systemic changes and there is no desire within CCP to change game mechanics to preclude suicidal behavior.\n\nIf you undock anywhere, you can be killed, for absolutely no reason whatsoever. That is fundamental to the gameplay experience in Eve. CCP may just be better off renaming \"HiSec\" to \"BetterSec\" or something similar to reduce new-player misunderstanding of that risk. A reactive \"police\" force is never going to provide any kind of defense, whether it is player-driven or NPC-driven.\n\nReading the latest ship balancing devblog, it sounds like CCP has finally realized miners should get some kind of better defense against solo suicide-ganking and can-flipping. The changes seem to point to increased hardening and larger ore bays, but we'll have to wait and see what changes actually make it through.\n\nMy take on the RP back-story concerning crews is they are being paid an astronomical amount to man capsuleer ships. So much so that the possibility of death is mitigated by the almighty ISK. It obviously won't motivate every dirt-dweller, but really how many people are aboard these ships anyway. Mining hulls have minimal crews as do most vessels used in suicide operations.\n\nGood points. I do agree that anything that undocks should be fair game to some extent – I never advocated a truly zero-risk zone. What is the problem here is not that ships are being shot at but that the expectations of miners and gankers about \"security\" diverge. But those expectations are not immutable. They are completely under CCP control. In the current system, it _looks like_ that CCP promises invulnerability and fails to deliver since gankers exploit the risk / benefit relationship. Why does nobody cry \"foul\" when a Hulk gets blown up in low or nullsec? Because the Hulk pilot was under no illusion of security.\n\nYour point on renaming \"High security\" is valid, although \"high\" is not the same as \"complete\". There is more to that than just the name. Mining is a long-winded, repetitive task that can only be done while watching a movie, curing cancer or other during other worthwhile RL activities. This turns miners into sitting ducks. If mining was as exciting as – for example – running missions, the mining profession would be very different. Why not bring about some extremely expensive cloaky, ninja mining ship that locks an asteroid, blows it up with one blast and hoovers up (compressed!) fragments before disappearing again? All of a sudden, miners would sneak into low sec and learn the stealthy craft.\n\nFiddling with mining frigs and some tank does nothing. The gankers just bring more firepower since ISK is free to them. Instead of 1 Catalyst, it will take 5 Tornados. Ok, so Mittani raises the bounty on those ships to 100 million each. Whatever. As long as ISK is free and security standing is a joke, the situation will not materially change.\n\nWith respect to the RP side of things. I have a hard time thinking that crews sign up for a ganker who blew up his fifth ship that day. Eventually, no amount of ISk can attract the crew – unless we get some kind of RP explanation that they (mostly) all get rescued. Mme. Thalys below lists a raft of RP issues I never thought about… All of them break the immersion and eventually could and should be looked at by CCP.\n\nThe crew argument is intuitively valid, but can be explained away. A capsuleer can control a ship's movement and it's defensive and offensive systems. On a normal trip you would still need a crew to operate support systems and do all kinds of other maintenance that make the ship run better. A suicide ganker, however, would just have to warp to a target, fly straight at it and let lose with a few volleys that usually do not even spend all of the loaded ammo.\n\nSuch a simple task should be possible for a solo capsuleer even when flying a battleship.\n\nI agree with the general reasoning though. I can see how crews would sign on even with a reckless capsuleer because of the possibly high rewards (makes you wonder what part of your income actually goes to them … maybe they are included in the ship's price or so) If someone were a known suicide ganker, who would sign up for a mission that involves certain death?\n\nIf you'd go full on realism of crime and punishment, then the consequence should probably be that you can not leave the system where you committed such a crime. The same actually would apply to faction standing. i.e. why would the Amarr Navy shoot me, but the Imperial gate operators wave me through?\n\nStations would probably also react in a way. Sure many are run by corporations who have their own jurisdictions (at least the Caldari ones do) but stations that are run by government authorities like the Federal Navy … would they just allow a criminal capsuleer to dock without impounding the ship?\n\nImagine the RL analogy of shooting someone across the street from a government building and then just hop in there to have a coffee in their cafeteria. I'm sure nobody would bother you at all\n\nThe question is how playable it would make the game. I did suggest before that gates and stations should lock out suicide gankers until their timer expires. Whether they should also lock out everyone with negative sec status or faction standing is another thing though.\n\nIn FW they now do have such a system, and that is weird in itself. If the Caldari militia take over a system from the Gallente, then you can't dock there anymore or clone jump into the station if you're on the Gallente side. You can however fly to any Caldari highsec system and dock there freely. How does that make sense?\n\nI'm honestly not sure about the consequences if such a thing were implemented. Mobility would be very restricted for many players, and the only feasible way to kill someone in highsec would be to declare war on them. It would be more realistic though.\n\nMme. Thalys, you should work for CCP. In 6 paragraphs you listed more messy game mechanics than I would have come up with in weeks of pondering. Together they strengthen my conviction that EVE is and was a brilliantly conceived and very shoddily implemented hackjob that grew too fast to allow for real thought on mechanics. Software projects can be like that and the slapped together POS mechanics, Wardec, security and sovereignty mechanics are a testimony to CCP's great vision and inability of project / product management. And I love them for it. I played WoW for years. Polished, pretty, easy, clean, no bugs. No challenge. No fun."

      "text": "Is this that system with over 1000 people in local atm? Do you realise what you're saying? :|\n\nbecause thats how parts of the game are played with allot of people thats how the game is advertised huge fleet fights ect. is this really that hard of a concept yeah it might not effect some people but it does effect allot of others.\n\nOriginally by:Dirk Altmanyes that any large engagement in this game is filled with insane amounts of lag. why should huge amounts of lag be acceptable?\n\nThere is no such thing as unlimited resources. There is ALWAYS limits to what can be done.\n\nI'm new so sorry if my #'s are off but this is more for proving a case:\n\nFights lag with 100vs 100 - People complain CCP Announces they've improved the servers and now can handle up to 300vs300 before lagging. Players bring 300vs300 wars and get lag and complain. CCP announces they've improved servers and now can handle up to 500vs500 before lagging. Players bring 500vs500 wars and get lag and complain.\n\nIf you keep pushing the limits of their updates, then you're going to lag.\n\nOriginally by:Dirk Altmanbecause thats how parts of the game are played with allot of people thats how the game is advertised huge fleet fights ect. is this really that hard of a concept yeah it might not effect some people but it does effect allot of others.\n\nHuge in todays standards is 128+, 256+ now maybe with mag... thats 256 players all interacting with each other in the same place on the same server... I'm pretty sure fleet fights up to 500 are quite acceptable given it's a reinforced node.\n\nMore dynamic load balancing would be welcome though, I agree... More awesome servers for the systems that need the power too please :)Eh, in Wow during raiding we had sometimes so much lag it would be unplayable. And it wasn't a full load server. Plus everybody was on a different instance (though probably most instances were on the same pysical machine).\n\nAnd about lag. Lol I laugh at this. I fought at jv1v some 2? years ago. At peak there were more than 1k people in the system, with no \"reinforced nodes\" and before all the new stackless things, better hardware, 64 bits and all the need for speed. At that time you didn't get lag. You did get multiple node crashes with characters perma blocked offline for hours. I commend CCP on doing always better than what was before. BelieveThis would actually be pretty interesting to test, CI. In EVE, a node is the hardware equivalent to a server in other MMOs. Interestingly enough, the maximum number of players that a single node can support in EVE is similar to the maximum number of players that a server, or realm can support in another MMO.\n\nIIRC, each WoW server can hold somewhere from 2000-3000 players at a time. EVE can hold somewhere from 1400-1600. This difference might be accounted by the fact that EVE possesses virtually no client side processing, whereas WoW relies heavily upon it (hence all the 3rd party cheating applications, or \"hacks\" for WoW).\n\nWithExcuse me if I am wrong but I was under the impression lag is handled in 2 parts. CCP make the pipes / connections to the server as good as possible but if you have 100vs100 (200 people) all tyring to interact and the 200 people all have DIFFERENT ISP speeds / connections and different factors; IE distance geographically, **** downloads, 56k modem, bad conections, line noise etc, would this not add to the lag as the server is trying to recieve and then send on this data to you, thus the lag is not the server, but the other persons sh!t house connection.\n\nThus the people complaining, maybe should complain to the other 50 nubs with crap connections slowing everyone else down? (Is this correct?)Originally by:Taedrin With while leaving the rest of the realm intact.)Which is EXACTLY why we have so many interesting missions that involve more than 1) Goto first room 2) kill everything 3) if something important dropped, loot it 4) if mission isn't finished yet, go to next room 5) else if mission is finished, go back to agent with any important item and complete the mission 6) Goto step 2.\n\nSeriously, if CCP focused on PvE so much, they would have made missions more interesting than simply \"kill EVERYTHING\" or \"get this item!\". It would be nice to have some missions which required tactics and thinking.\n\nThe easiest way to do this would be to give NPCs sleeper AI. It would also be nice if there were some missions which involved things like escorting an NPC convoy, or aiding a navy fleet which is being overwhelmed by pirates.\n\nEDIT:\n\nQuote: while leaving the rest of the realm intact.)\n\nWhichOriginally by:Dirk Altman I just thought this was funny as I saw this relogging for my third time in an hour trying to get into game and fight in a large fleet fight taking place out in 0.0\n\nYou can choose EVE as the winner, with its lag issues in large fleet fights (main attraction). Or you can choose that other MMO as the winner, with its lag issues in Raids (main attraction) - regardless of the size of the server.\n\nYour call.\n\nOther MMOs haven't really piqued my personal interest - and have far too many other issues to deal with.Oh I dunno. The other 97% of eve that is running just fine would disagree with your statement. Why would they ***** about something that doesn't effect them? Besides fleet fights were fine pre dominion so give ccp some time to fix whatever it is they borked in the code. Or vent your frustration in whinge threads I guess if it makes you feel better.\n\nOriginally by:IntigoRegardless of how incredibly stupid the OP is, it did catch my eye how insanely arrogant and foolish that statement was.\n\nA simple \"hey we won, grats to us\" would have sufficed - but that way of writing it was pretty bad.\n\nWhy? Just because you personally have issues with eve atm doesn't mean the rest of us are. From my vantage point and I'm sure many others the wording was spot on. But hey I understand because you really are getting the short end of the lag stick but overall its not even a factor in the greater game so sorry if your isolated patch of eve is not up to snuff.\n\nI think the guys there with bring back the AOE DD might have a point there... hmm.... fleets where usually toasted to more managable sizes and left with the lucky / well tanked ships to slug it out in the finals.\n\nDawinism used to solve the lag problem. Is it just coencidence that these problems came about the same time as the titan change?It was awful when there was no limit on Wintergrasp, pretty much 2 frames a second on a lot of the more populated servers with more than 400 people going at it. I know Onyxia would routinely have 500 or more (usually 3-1 odds though).\n\nI think CCP is doing ok in comparison. Hell getting into Jita used to be awful and a crap shoot on whether or not you'd get stuck. One of the last corps I was in had a mining op going in a site that was in a dead end on the other side of Jita. I pretty much had to wait till downtime to jump through or have to file a petition to get moved 1 jump past. Now a days I have no problems jumping into Jita and leaving. Undocking from 4-4 can sometimes be a little bit of a lag from loading in, but once you load in it's pretty good.\n\nOriginally by:Gecko O'BacBelieveyet there is so much where I'm tempted to say CCP didn't even try. they were saying stuff like they couldn't effectively implement infiniband because each system ran on a single thread, and that there is no dynamic load balancing other than to restart the server and manually do it."

(NOTE: this has NOTHING in common with the star trek holodeck where you can materialize crap out of thin air and stuff like that, so keep that in mind!) the function of that room is similar to a CIC (combat information center) on a battleship, only much more sophisticated. instead of using small maps and radar and such, people can see the actual space around them and any points of interest such as enemies, allies, anomalies in space, etc will be displayed directly at their \"actual\" position. it is also possible to show holograms of other people and talk to them, but only if they are on their own ships CIC. so this whole thing is the extreme version of the augmented reality technology which we all know already from many other media. although fighters won't be able to use the holograms to materialize things, they can however use the holographic functions to distract their enemy (for examply by placing a dozen map markers around his head or something like that). although you can choose basically any space-themed background, you cannot change the background it shows (because the CIC is only able to generate the background of it's current position). and now a final word of advise: although hel's ship is very durable, it is entirely possible to rip holes into the walls of the ship with enough force, which would lead to sudden and total loss of pressure and therefore an unwanted and possibly everlasting and definitely deadly trip to space (at least for any character that needs air to survive), so watch your actions!\n\nOh great, you expect me to get Virtus aboard on that as it's circling Earth?

Will they just be fighting over the remote control?\n\nno, the arena can only represent the surroundings of the current position of hels ship in space. so if people find my design of the background is too hard for them to draw, they can choose an easier space themed background and simply explain it by \"her ship has moved into another spot in space before the fight started\" the functions of the holo system are limited to creating and shifting various symbols and map markers. they are also able to \"paint\" simple lines with their fingers.

When leaving the eng room, make sure that the tac (and the tac only) accesses the console... I believe when noone else touches it the accolade can be done, even with a team."

Mostly noobs and people who better do some first person shooter flame here! Excuse me. But this game is not only for CRF freaks. Its for tacticians. Some TBR or Grav well, APO or evasive maneuvers do the trick. Its not too difficult. Render the trics useless does not seem to be apropriate.\nRather nerf the CRF spammers to encourage them to think of something creative.\n\nWhoever read this thread already can be fully capable of rendering any tricobalt build totally useless.\"Live Long and Prosper but always carry a fully charged phaser, just in case!\". Arrr'owCould you explain why you're in the PvP boards if you don't care about it?\n\nThe Dev tracker is the devil! Point of fact, most of these folk wouldn't even notice a change if not for it or word of mouth.\n\nSeriously though, I think it's important to get as many voices in on a conversation as possible. It could really be better for the game as a whole. Unfortunately, for that to work all of the voices chiming in would need to actually care enough to educate themselves about how what works and why.\n\nTric spammers are not tacticians. They are PvE heroes who can't play worth a damn, so they use the currently insane damage and crit bonuses of Trics with DPB to get kills they otherwise wouldn't get.\n\nBtw, any of the people complaining about Trics in this thread, especially the fleets, could use those setups and troll the hell out of the queues, basically shutting them down.\n\nThey don't do that because it's lame and because they don't want to ruin what little community still plays the game.\n\nTrics are not the issue, it's the chained crits from DPB. To say that there is no tact involved is an overstatement when most PvP'rs now keep an eye out for them and know when to hit CSV, TBR, FAW, APO, Aceton Assimilators, AMS, EM, EWP, VTR.\n\nPersonally, I find the Jem Attack Ship a bigger issue because it makes lousy PvP'rs seem respectable, marginally decent PvP'rs competative and once exceptional PvP'rs look godly. It's training wheels that scale upward with player skill. It's not available to everyone and those who have it will defend it to the death because they'd never fly anything else.\n\nI don't always use torpedoes but when I do, I prefer Tricobalts. Friendship is magic, my friends."

      "text": "Modules\nModules are enhancements that may be added to ships that are at least size 1. These increase the cost of the craft they are applied to and provide a wide array of bonuses and effects, thgouh colony and space station construction are linked to modules. You may replace and/or add modules like any other system while the craft is at a friendly world or station. A ship may have a total size of modules equal to its own size (so a size 4 ship can carry up to size 4 worth of modules).\n\nThis lab provides the ship with advanced sensors dedicated to navigation, this provides a few bonuses. When the ship spends 0.2 turn scanning a jump gate or wormhole, the chances of a jump miscalculation occurring are greatly reduced. When warping, the ship can retain up to 1/2 (rounded down) of its sensor value to observe its surroundings during warp (allowing the craft to possibly drop out of warp to investigate strange readings). The ship reduces any damage sustained by warping through rifts by 1.\n\nThis module provides storage for resources, wreckage, etc. Cargo modules can carry a total amount of resources/wreckage of a value equal to twice their size. These may also be required to carry artifacts, especially if they are large.\n\nThis allows the construction of a new colony on an open world. To construct the colony you must deploy the module there at the start of a turn. It takes 1 full turn to construct the colony. When a colony finishes, you now control that world. It begins with 1 construction value and 2 energy, and begins receiving infrastructure on the following turn. If you used the size 1 module, the craft carrying the module is consumed in the process. If you used the size 2 module, only the module is consumed to create the colony.\n\nThis module contains additional troops and equipment for defense and boarding operations. The equipped craft increases its boarding strength by an amount equal to the size of this module. Note that this boarding strength is added to the size of the craft to determine the base boarding strength (making the craft more difficult to capture, and better at capturing other craft despite taking loses).\n\nDrones are remote controlled fighters, or mindless swarms. They are smaller than normal size 0 craft, attacking as a group to inflict damage, though such craft are difficult to evade. Treat the drone module as a weapon with strength equal to twice the total module size. This weapon attacks independently of the craft's primary weapons (if any), they cannot attack in pass 1, but may attack in any other pass. The drones have an attack range of 6 units (note that this range is due to the fact the craft can move and strike swiftly), and ignore all DR bonus from the target's engines and also do not suffer the normal loss of damage when splitting it between multiple targets. If you have attacked with them at least once in a wave, they may be targeted as though they were a ship. Damage assigned to them damages their attack strength by an equal amount (note this must be repaired before it is returned to full strength). Your foes must declare the drones as their intended target before the wave begins.\n\nDrones take 1 less damage from all attacks due to their small size and quick movements.\n\nWhen you assign a drone control module, you select a ship weapon type you have ranks in to be the damage type the module uses. You may assign a single weapon trait to the module/size (based on the weapon type you applied), adjusting the cost as normal. Drones equipped with the long-range trait have a range of 8 units.\n\nThis module allows the craft to carry other smaller craft onboard. Note that craft loaded in a hangar cannot have their own hangars loaded. A hangar module can carry a total size of craft equal to its own size -1. Note that each size step down doubles the number of craft can fit in that space (for example; if you have a size 2 hangar bay, you can load a size 1 craft or 2 size 0 craft. Whereas a size 4 hangar bay can carry a size 3, two size 2's, 4 size 1's or up to 8 size 0's, or any similar combination of those sizes). A size 1 hangar module can only carry a single size 0 craft.\n\nThese modules allow the gathering of ore from asteroid fields. They collect ore at a rate equal to the module's size each turn. If applied to a ship, the resources must be stored in a supply module to be returned for resources (either from the mining craft or a cargo ship in its fleet). If applied to a station in an asteroid field, the resources are gathered automatically, as though the station were simply a planet.\n\nThis module provides small weapons that are used to deter and destroy small ships. When the equipped ship is attacked by a size 0 craft or drones, the attacker takes damage from the module equal to the module's size. The module has a range of 6 units, if the attacker is firing from beyond that range, it will not take damage. This counter-attack occurs each time the equipped craft is attacked.\n\nPoint Defense attacks ignore the damage reduction from engines and the damage reduction drones have passively for their size.\n\nWhen you equip this module, choose a ship weapon type you have at level 2, this module's attacks use that same type for its damage. Note that you can only apply one weapon trait to this module, regardless of size.\n\nThese modules allow craft to make in-flight repairs to themselves or other ships/stations/orbital defenses. The production value for the repair rate is equal to twice the size of the module. Note that you must have stored resources or wreckage within the fleet to make the repairs.\n\nThis module provides a lab capable of advanced research and analysis. The ship may spend an extra 0.2 turn scanning worlds or ships to treat its sensors as though they were 2 ranks higher. In addition, the crew reduces the time it takes to translate alien languages by 0.5 turn and may reverse engineer alien technology. Reversed technology is of course only available to the crew until it returns to a friendly world or station, at which point it can unload the information to local scientists.\n\nWhen being built, this module has ship systems assigned to it, other than warp and engines. All costs are treated as if assigning them to a size 1 ship. You must assign at least 1 rank of hull to the module. Traits may also be assigned to the module. When this module is unloaded, it is used to create a space station in that hex that possesses all of the tech/traits used in the module. This takes 1 full turn.\n\nStations are a cross between planets and ships. They begin with 4 base energy, 1 construction value, 6 infrastructure and a starting infrastructure cap of 10 (and a max cap of 15). At the start of the turn, you treat it like a world, building certain structures on it and/or building defenses. Stations are limited to building industry structures. Stations are considered planets for the use of economics and logistics. Once a station has a shipyard it may build more modules for itself. It is treated as a size 4 ship in terms of what it can equip.\n\nStations receive the bonus hull value for being a size 4 craft.\n\nYou may add another station module to an existing station, though expanding a station in this way treats the station as two stations against your control limit (3 for 3, etc). Adding another station module increases the station's maximum infrastructure cap by another 15 and its overall size by another 4 (increasing hull, boarding strength and available space for additional modules).\n\nStations are repaired like ships, but may repair themselves so long as they have either a repair module (with sufficient resources) or a shipyard.\n\nWeapon Battery\n\nSize 1+ Module\nCost Modifier: +1/size based on weapon type\nRequirement: Ship or Defense Weapons (Any type), can only be assigned to craft of size 4+\n\nThis module provides additional fire support, increasing the weapon damage of one of your weapon systems by 1/size.\n\nNote that the following modules may be equipped to defenses of proper size; Reinforced Hull, Reinforced Shields and Weapon Battery.\n\nColonizing New worlds\nYou may begin new colonies using the colony modules (see the 'colony module' listed above for details on colonization). Note that your first colony module is at a reduced cost due to the preparations your race has been making towards settling on new worlds. The number of worlds your race can control is limited by your development aspects (note that your homeworld is never counted against this limit);\n\nWorld Control Limit: 1 + Level of Economics + Level of Industry + Level of Logistics"

      "text": "Even at the greatest penalty, a system-system jump can only take, at most, 40 days. Unless they are close by. In that case, they can only take at most 4 days. With the Miloslav engine, we cut that in half. So, presuming we aren't moving across an entire sector, the most time we can spend in flight is 20 days.\n\nOf course, if we're moving across the entire Calixis, we might end up in transit for 120 days. That would be bad. I think the ship has 6 months' supplies at the moment, so moving across an entire Segmentum in a single bound might be a little too ambitious.\n\nOn the matter of the GMNavigator, I'm okay with it. Warp encounters can be tedious, and with the GM in charge, any encounter we face will be either part of the current plot or a hook for the next. Unless he has a thing for warp encounters. In which case we'll become hardened daemonhunters before we get to Dionysus.\n\n__________________\nThe greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\n\nLuc, dear, did you ever noticed how you call Damaris by a different name every time? Are you sure you don't have something for Tzeentch or, let's say, the Eldar clowns?\n\nOh, yeah, but our engine also gives us the beautiful disadvantage of rolling encounters every 3 days, not 5. So at a 20 day trip we have 6 chances of being even MORE delayed. Check out page 187 of the Rogue Trader core book. The chart is mostly inoffensive, but 4 out of 11 events would makes us take even more time. Of course, if we can just skip these occurrences and add it as a footnote when we translate back there is no reason why not to, unless it's something very interesting that everyone would like to chip in.\n\nI am of the opinion warp travel is cripplingly dangerous. Most ships rarely make long warp jumps, only entire fleets of the Navy have the strength and support necessary to shake off prolonged warp weather. I also don't believe this will creep our gameplay, so eh. It's just fluff, really.\n\nPS: I am good. I am not a material person so I only have few worldly possessions can't remember Damaris. I get the vowels mixed up sometimes, so instead of trying and being off by an A or an I, I just go with Daenerys or whatever.\n\nYeah, Warp Encounters can be juttering. That said, I'm not sure how many would take over 24 hours to deal with. The storm and the shoals are really the biggest ones, by my judgment. Even then, only the storm would seem to take a gratuitous amount of time to rectify.\n\nYeah, fluff-wise people don't just leap into the Warp on a lark.\n\n__________________\nThe greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\n\nMe and another player were talking about it, and we noticed you're online a lot, but don't seem to post much. We'd appreciate it if you could post at least once every few hours while you're online.\n\nThank you.\n\nShort answer? No.\n\nLong answer is - I visit this forum for more than just my PbP games. Of which there are several, both in which I play and one which I run. And since I've still been managing to get in a post for this at least once a day or more on average, I'm not going to try hurrying that any more.__________________\n\"Not trusting me might be the smartest decision you made since getting off of your horse.\"I would argue against that for two reasons:\n\nOne, back in Dark Heresy (admittedly, not Rogue Trader, but same universe) Feral Worlds are a legitimate starting point for characters. In Rogue Trader, there is the Death World which sounds similar but is arguably different enough to not be synonymous. In DH, Ferals aren't limited to hide armour and heavy stone clubs, so saying that feral troops are strikes me as peculiar. It seems to me that the penalty for their being unfamiliar with the technology is the -2 they take to Power.\n\nTwo, the description of heavy infantry isn't dependent on the world choice. If it was dependent, I don't see why Battlefleet Koronus would even have options other than Modern. Fielding an army which isn't comprised of people who have at the very least a lasgun would be suicide in this setting.\n\nI was making my unit based on the archetype of the Catachans, or at least of Death Worlders in general. Hopefully this shows that it isn't an entirely poorly thought out selection.\n\n__________________\nThe greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\n\nI'd really rather not, especially a cybernetic. With 12 hours before we leave Footfall (well, ~12 hours that is) he'd have to be on the medicae deck, presuming it's usable. That would mean for, what is it, 2d10-TB days he'd be out of commission. While you might roll super well and be up after a single day, it's unlikely -- and if you didn't, that would mean that the crewmember who fires the guns will be unable to participate in ship combat.\n\n__________________\nThe greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\n\nOkay, I am here, hopefully not too late. Am I still under the obligation to attend the bridge My Lady? Scrap that, of course I am. It's just so sad that Astropaths have very little to do besides screamingSorry, Baveboi, Luff is kind of a racist when it comes to mutants. The Imperial Creed and the horrific decade-long guerilla war against mutants that saw many of his friends killed horribly kinda do that to man.\n\nDo not apologize, my friend. I like that. Of conflict we spawn the stuff of which good prose is made of. I could be a Navigator with a warp eye and any numbers of horrid mutations, so Luff might feel a little lucky that he got the most normal looking psyker of this sectorTaunting the heavily-armed man in power armor with a deep and lasting hatred of mutants probably isn't the wisest idea.\n\nTechnically speaking, I should have to pass a willpower roll right now or try to tear your head off. But I'm going to assume he has a slightly higher degree of tolerance for navigators and astropaths both because of their IC special status and OOC convenience.\n\nPsykers are not really mutants per the book. They have a mutation for psychic capabilities, but it's considered a curse of warpcraft or the Emperor's Gift. The Astropath's case being the later, you should be at least slightly tolerable to Carlyle's unnerving presence.\n\nBesides, who would shoot their own cellphone just because it has an ugly design? And at least Carlyle is the prettiest of the ugly phones am tolerating it. My background says quite literally that I must pass a willpower test when confronting my hated enemy (in this case, mutants) or attack them all-out. I'm assuming a greater degree of tolerance than normal by not rolling for it in the first place.\n\nSomeone who's seen his friends and family die brutally at the hands of other cellphones.\n\nBut seriously, I'm not going to shoot you unless you attack me. Liff will continue to be racist, however.\n\nAre you kidding Withrow? It would be awesome. Imagine how fast and how easy it would be to communicate with others! But it is beside the point of the metaphor I guess...\n\nDo not worry, Henry, I don't presume you will, in either case. My background also tells me to answer threat with threat, violence with violence, but there is nothing threatening about a friendly banter between crewmates. Carlyle also knows for a certainty that Astropaths don't come easily, or cheaply, so Luff will surely refrain from destroying Lady Xanatov's possessions.\n\nI might be an ugly, trauma inducing and overly paranoid cellphone, but I am HER cellphone after allHaha! Yes, that could be useful, but Astropaths are able to \"see\" just fine. Astropaths can read, paint, write and play \"who blinks first\" normally. They can't, however, be blinded by normal conditions such as a blind grenade or camouflage or darkness. Warp-induced conditions are obviously a yes, as well as physical manifestations, such as rain, fog and smoke.\n\nExtract from rogue trader core book, pg72:\n\nSpoiler\n\nSee Without Eyes:\nAn Astropath Transcendent is blind yet at the same time has a strange ability to perceive without using his physical senses. An Astropath Transcendent is functionally treated as if he can see normally (including seeing colors and being limited by walls, etc.). However, Astropaths Transcendent are not affected by effects that target their vision, such as blind grenades and cameleoline. They are, however, completely incapable of seeing Untouchables.\n\nSo begets the question: Eyes? What for?\n\nAnd Carlyle already looks fairly normal. If he puts a pair of shades on (nothing too hard to find, I bet) and change his attire for something more inconspicuous he would be nearly unidentifiable. But then again a psyker of his caliber has ways to get people not to burn him alive"

      "text": "Then I went off to get drunk and have a bar-brawl, in order to give other people time to deal with their conflicts before I ordered them off planet. Sure, you wouldn't just do that to everyone if you saw them having fun...but you having exclusive choice over that still feels deprotagonising. Prolly abused player syndrome, but really, who really wants to be under the whim of someone else (unless you can control it with resources)?\n\nThat's what would push me to deprotagonise you (by arguing with your choice), because I feel I'm going to be deprotagonised. But as I said, that's just me. Now, if you gave the rest of the group control of when your character ordered everyone off planet........Because nobody in SG-1 ever disobeys orders? And therefore they can't treat my ordering them off planet as just another IC complication to force them to hard choices?\n\nReading this, and considering the example I gave above, it makes me ponder a question: Are you sure the people in your group are interested in making the hard choices? Or at least, are interested in making that particular kind of hard choice? Because if their behavior was at all like what I described above, I think a large part of it is specifically about avoiding the hard choicesTo me, the core problem of your game seemed to be \"Tony wants to make an irreversible decision to conclude a conflict, and other people are trying to make that decision reversible.\"\n\nThis stuff about \"ownership\" and \"earned rights\" is your justification for why you should have your way. To me it seems blatantly unnessecary.\n\nI think you're all working towards a good Narrativist outcome: You're driving towards those irreversible decisions, they're inserting their character's into the conflict and trying to represent their character's place in them well.\n\nThe problem is that words alone in the majority of situations are indeed very reversible, and thus do not make a good way to make irreversible choices. Thus, if they were accompanied by actions(Such as, I don't know, your character calls for them to be placed on a list of unfriendly societies that will take a long time to get off of.), you wouldn't run into the problem of other people reversing your decisions. Their characters could bicker about it, and expres thier extreme displeasure, but the choice has been made in story terms: Ritual sacrifice + Americn Values = Blackballed planetThe others I don't knowDoh! Replace that E with an I at the game level. At the character level, mm, also pretty IDude, I said what I'd feel...I didn't say it'd make rational sense. If it's abused player syndrome then adversity can be missread as deprotagonisation. If abused player syndrome isn't something that ever crops up with them, then this idea isn't applicableWhat, the rest of the people around the table can't get up in your face telling you you have to fold? Yeah, they don't have any game-mechanical way to keep you from pushing a conflict to conclusion, but they sure can agitate against your stakes or against any individual raise or escalation. This has happened to me - fellow players assume I'm not going to go to Shooting, and I do. Oh my, there's room for a lot of social pressure to take it back or back down.\n\nWhich is pretty much what you're describing happening in your game, right? Social pressure from players to back down from a conflict, not attempts to undo your decision within the fiction? seeing that connection being made, so there's not much I can contribute back.\n\nOkay, you started with three questions, right?\n\nSo that's my big question: Do players earn the right to more authority over conflicts than their fellows? Is that a feasible way to play? Not \"Am I right, were they wrong?\", because I figure we were all just on different pages. But \"Could you communicate the view I had, such that people would accept it?\"\n\nThat's a \"Depends,\" \"Sure\" and \"Sometimes\" respectively.\n\nIt's when you get into the particulars that it gets complicated. Players who reject the \"No Myth\" principle (implicitly or explicitly) may not find their character's attitude that malleable toward what's going on in the SIS - the story would break for them if they arbitrarily (on their view) kept their characters out of the climax. Players who have meatspace \"hot buttons\" may feel the social contract gives them the right to resist introducing some kinds of unpleasantness in play. (Quick hypothetical: Player A puts a lot of effort into a conflict that he decides to solve by decreeing that an offending NPC should be gang-raped.) Such players might even be formally convinceable in advance and then renege on the deal when the trigger circumstance came up. There are probably other reasons why a given play group might reject the idea. Those are just the ones I can think of.\n\nCommunicating your view and getting buy-in would be easier in advance than in the event, and easier explicitly than tacitly. It might help to explain it in terms of niche protection - this is how my character shines; please help me understand how your character shines so I can support that. If someone says, \"My character can't let you get away with that,\" a constructive response might be, \"Cool. Can we together come up with some circumstance that keeps your character from interfering? If not, can we formalize this as a conflict that I have the chance of winning so we can move on? And if it's too late to save this particular conflict, I really want us to figure out how we can formalize ownership of conflicts in the future. When I commit as much to a conflict as I have to this one, I feel a sense of ownership for it and I need to have that respected.\"\n\nNo guarantees that any of that works, because there's no fact of the matter about whether your character should own that conflict. It's a valid preference, though.\n\nI don't think I would, initially, be as unhappy with people contesting the explicit rules as I was with them contesting the implicit rules. If somebody says \"Dude, you have to Give now,\" in Dogs I just give them a funny look and say \"Uh ... No.\" Sometimes I say it with a grin, but I'm not going to feel threatened because I know that the rules have got my back.\n\nNow if the same person kept harping on the same subject? Then I'd get twice as ticked off as I ever did in this game, because now I'm (a) having to hash the same issue out OOC and (b) feeling that our explicit agreement (in the form of the rules) has been violated. In the first game I was ticked about having to hash out the issue, but I certainly didn't think that anyone was violating any explicit rules.\n\nBut Dogs rules are not the same gradual buy-in, with options at several points, that I'm hoping to get working. You might be able to jury-rig it, if you let people Give without losing Stakes, in order to expand the Stakes in a follow-up conflict (which would allow other people to get in on the action). Like:\n\nPC#1: Stakes are \"Does he take back what he said?\" PC#2: I got no interest in that. Feel free. PC#1: Okay, I shoot him in the kneecap. \"Take it back, you yellow-bellied coward!\" PC#2: Whoa! No way! That's expanding the stakes! PC#1: Oh? I thought it was just fallout. PC#2: No, no. Now I need in. PC#1: So the new Stakes are ... what ... \"Does my character dominate the whole situation?\" PC#2: How about \"Does your character make people respect him?\" PC#1: Sounds good to me. So I get the fallout I inflicted, plus all my dice fresh? PC#2: Yep, and I roll in with my Calming tone, 2d10. \"This ain't the way to earn nobody's respect, Brother.\"\n\nIn case I haven't made it clear: This thead probably would] have been in RPG Theory when that forum was still active. I think it's a lot more useful to discuss the theoretical with the strong grounding that we've got in the actual play, but I am hoping to make some general tools as wellAh, I see, I thought you were trying to figure out what had happened and why, and missed the springboard to \"How do I get the thing that I want out of game through system support.\" Now that its clear hopefully I can be more helpful.\n\nDoing it by system, but not mechanics, the easiest way is probably going to be to make sure to keep clear OOC communications about not only what is happening, but where you are moving. If people around the table don't OOCly see that you're going to drop a bomb until its gone off, then they may have some right to be irked once the explosion has happened and now there is nothing they can do about it.\n\nReally, it's not that different than the old saw with GMs of a certain type who get frustrated with their players not picking up on important clues that are \"so very obvious.\" Certainly what you are going for may be obvious to you, but to the others at the table it might not be any more obvious than the clues a GM leaves on the railroad. Letting them know OOCly that you are taking this plot over and if they want to intercede they'd best do so quickly can yield better results. If they had known before you dropped the judgment bomb, and still hadn't bought in then clearly they have no right to -- they've forfeited it. If they did want to buy in at that point then all the scenes that folks like Josh and Mike were talking about could have been set up. They could have had their characters meet you in the hall on the way to tell the aliens to screw themselves and had a big fight then. You probably would have been less annoyed, because they would be heightening your stakes rather than trying to take them away after you'd already \"won\" them; and they certainly would have had more opportunity to play without feeling the hammer of doom taking away their protagonist role.\n\nSo, that's the \"perfect world of lovely communications\" answer. How to hardcode that into something in the games rules? Well, we've got to look at a couple things here: do you want it to be a system where once it is said it is done, or where once it is said it is still negotiable? (The difference that Ron talked about between Dogs and Polaris.) Because, in my little tiny non-designer brain, it makes sense that if you want to have a \"said and done\" system then you need to have some kind of mechanic for letting people know what is coming, very freaking clearly, before it comes. If, OTOH, you want a \"you can fight over it even once its said\" system then you can say whatever you want without warning, because people still have the ability to negotiate it out.\n\nIn your Dog's example, an experienced Dogs player should know that if they're opting out of a conflict it could get escalated to violence. If they want to stop that, they should be in it. In a Capes game, however, it would work without warning because you can always fight for control and to push things up and down. Now, I'd actually say in this context that for a new Dogs player the issue could be problematic – because if they don't know the shooty is a common result of conflicts then we're back at the \"GM's really obvious clue that isn't so obvious\" level. Whereas in Capes newbs don't get caught pants-down so often because they have a chance to keep kicking at it so long as they want to badly enough. (And if they don't want to badly enough, then it's their call.)\n\nSo, to try to be concise, when looking at systems for this I think the first thing we need to determine is who knows what when, and how statements of effect can be made in response to that knowledge. Once people know what is going on and have a chance to buy in on even, clear footing the choice is made. However if they do not know what is going on, clearly and not just \"well you should have known\" clearly, then the choice hasn't been made. At that point you can either go the hard road (too bad, it's said and done) or the cooperative road (oh, lets renegotiate).\n\n(Which, to bring back an earlier point, may depend on what the gamers at your table want. Some people will be fine with effect being generated before they were ready for it because it gives them a chane to do something big back. Others will not because it disrupts the flow of the game in a way that reduces their enjoyment.)\n\nI wonder whether it would help if, in addition to a system for resolving a conflict, you had a system for letting players defer a conflict.\n\nLike, I'm about to have not-Jack tell the aliens to shove off. I say \"Okay folks, I'm about to tell these guys to shove off. Anyone want to defer that?\" and then people could say \"What? You're gonna do that? Oh heck, no, my character comes into the room on some pretext and that interrupts you. That gets deferred.\"\n\nThat would, in some sense, have allowed me to maintain my \"investment\" (i.e. the deferrment doesn't change my mind, or change what the decision is going to be) but give people time to jump in and add their own investment in the importance of the issue (possibly even rivalling or exceeding mine).\n\nI know that in theory that's all really one conflict resolution system, but I suspect that breaking out the pacing from the resolution would have helped me in this situation, and might help generally.\n\nThat's be awesome, Tony. How many times in various other forms of drama do we see a big thematic statement delayed by unforseen cirumstances -- and it only increases the tension surrounding that thematic statement."

Our guests will\nintroduce themselves and start taking your questions!\n\nFrank|Mindark: Hi everyone, Frank here from Marketing. Delighted to be hear\nat the Xfire chat.\n\nMagnus|Mindark: Hi Im Magnus I'm head of development.\n\nMagnus|Mindark: Question: Sp1k3: Does the CryEngine bring us the promised\nvehicles that was said to be implented within a year from then? :)\n\nAnswer: Yes it will!\n\nAlf|mindark: Question: Sp1k3: Does the CryEngine bring us the promised\nvehicles that was said to be implented within a year from then? :)\n\nAnswer: The artists are looking forward to modeling vehicles\n\nMarco|Mindark: Question: thomasandersson: Which features of the CryENGIENE\nwill EU use, except from graphics, im talking about physics, AI and sound which\nalso is included in CryENGIENE2\n\nAnswer: We will use as many features as possible from the CE2.\n\nFrank|Mindark: Question: helmars: Is it possible that planet Calypso\nbecomes obsolete, when other planets with the same functionality arrives?\n\nAnswer: No, the planet Calypso will allways be around and will continue to be\nfilled with new and exciting content.\n\nFrank|Mindark: Question: Gaga: Will there be really several another planets\nin EU?\n\nAnswer: Absolutely. This is part of a very concrete plan we have now and we\nwill be seeing space exploration and combat in connection with the big cross\nover to the CryENGINE.\n\nMarco|Mindark: Question: Sacred: When space fighting comes possible, will\nthere be new \"cheaper\" spaceships so that every \"normal\"\nplayer is able to get one?\n\nAnswer: When space opens up there will be a complete system accompaning it,\nwith real depth and integration into the real cash economy.\n\nMagnus|Mindark: Question: DeadeX: Q: Can you tell us more about the space\nopening and the \"Space Pirating\" ?\n\nAnswer: As more planets will be added to the universe there will be need for\ntravel between them. The space will be untamed and filled with unexpected\nhappenings. The space flight will mean much more than todays blackout. And\nwhere you find valuable things you are never alone.\n\nFrank|Mindark: Question: Da RCAnka Ho: Will there be any IRL-events in Sweden where we (the players) get to meet\nyou guys?\n\nAnswer: We don't have any planned at the moment, but the community organizes\nthese type of events regularly in Europe and the US. You can probably find more\ninformation about this at \n. Loads and loads of community info there\n\nMarco|Mindark: Question: galadea: Will it be possible to build self\ndesigned buildings in the future?\n\nAnswer: That is one long term goal. We will continue to add systems that caters\nto participant creativity, while maintaining the real cash economy, the\nintegrity of Entropia, and the stability of the market.\n\nAlf|mindark: Question: Zorglub: do you think to create customizable armor\nset ? when ?\n\nAnswer: We are hoping to leave as much as possible to the participants in the\nfuture when it comes to designing things. However, there are a vast number of\ntechnical specifications that have to be met. Few people actally have the\nskills to put together an armor of their own design, that will work flawlessly\nwithing EU, together with other clothingitems.\n\nMarco|Mindark: Question: Vlooe: Are any improvements planned for the\nsociety system?\n\nAnswer: For Example a \"common Chat\" for more than on Soc?\n\nSome time after CE2 there will be a complete update to the\nentire social system in Entropia, including messaging, societies, chats,\noffline emailing, SMS services, associations and company building. The\ncommunication system as such hasn't received much attention for a while so it\nis in need for these updates.\n\nFrank|Mindark: Question: rookieeu: Since 'Robot' attacks were central to\nCalipso's history ...... will you implement them again on a regular basis and\nnot as a 'rare' event\n\nAnswer: You're right. The robots have played a central role in Calypso's\nhistory and I would be very surprised if we didn't see them again. Remember\nthey have a base in the Akbal Cimi system. Thats where the usually gather\nthemselves before a major attack. They've been quiet recently, so I wouldn't be\nsurprised if they were cooking something up.\n\nMarco|Mindark: Question: Demonikos: 1) There is a very important Question\nabout the economy of of EU as it is atm and hope in some further Information if\npossible : In VU 9.2 ,today, already more L armor parts of Higher Level (like\nJaguar ) have been discovered . Does this mean that MA in the future VU might\nstop the Unlimited Versions of those high-end Armors and let only Limited Parts\ndrop or will both keep dropping?\n\nAnswer: No, MA sees benefits having both Limited and Unlimited versions av\nitems in Entropia. Both kinds will be avilable in the future as well. MA does\nnot desire to have 100% Limited items.\n\nAlf|mindark: Question: ~Pork.: Will we see any new wall paper and floors\nfor apartments anytime soon? or other home fernishings?\n\nAnswer: Yes, wallpapers and textures for walls, ceilings, perhaps even\nexteriors shouldn´t be any problem to leave to the participants to upload in\nthe near future. Everyone should have the opportunity to furnish their home\naccording to their own wishes. After all, apartments and alike, are personal\nareas. Hopefully wallpapers and textures will also be sold on the marquet.\n\nFrank|Mindark: Question: Pirx Danford: How soon can we expect a better\nintroduction for newcomers? I am eager to invite more people.\n\nAnswer: Great questions. We're aware of the initial complexity and difficulty\nwith landing on Calypso. We've recently benefited from an academic study on\nentering Entropia and are planning to make changes in connection with the\nCryENGINE release. That will be the perfect opportunity to make these type of\nmajor changes.\n\nMagnus|Mindark: Question: terracognita: Will the graphic demand be simular\nto crysis, when the new engine is fully in use?\n\nAnswer: Yes they will, but you will as in Crysis and Entropia today be able to\nset up your own custom settings that are more suiteble to your computer. We\nhave a set of diffrent requirements than Crysis since we have another focus on\nthe character system and its degree of customization this toghether with the\nextreme gatherings is a greate challange but we feel confident that we already\nhave come far with the implementation of the client.\n\nMarco|Mindark: Question: Pant: Factories have been mentioned in the past.\nDoes the CE2 have any impact on them?\n\nAnswer: Factories and mass production is part of the future of Entropia. It\nwill create a new kind of business opportunity for both the \"employer\"\nas well as the factory \"employees\". One may speculate that ammo\nproduction would be very suitable for factories.\n\nFrank|Mindark: Question: Dion Red Strike: Other Than keeping the economy\nstable, what is the biggest focus of the dev group as of today?\n\nAnswer: The biggest focus right now, is the adaptation of the CryENGINE. As we\nmentioned in the VU List, 90% of our programming resources are involved in this\nnow.\n\nAlf|mindark: Question: njaaack: Will MA add new tamable pets on the new\nplanets?\n\nAnswer: Yes - our goal is to make ALL creatures tameable. Unfortunately the\ngraphic team are up to their necks in other cool stuff for you guys. Besides-\nwe are, ehrm, not the biggest team in the world and have to concentrate on the\nbigger tasks at hand. Personally I wouldnt complain about riding into Port\nAtlantis on my tame Hogglo...\n\nAlf|mindark: But sure - ther will be more animals soon to tame\n\nMarco|Mindark: Question: Jod: When can we expect an announcement and some\nsort of teaser from the new planet partner?\n\nAnswer: As soon as the lawyers are ready with the contract. There is much legal\nstuff to walk though when you are going to build a planet.\n\nMarco|Mindark: Question: Uolevikuolevi: Are the decent mentor gifts\ncompletely removed from the \"pool\", as it seems no one is getting\nthem anymore?\n\nAnswer: I heard a rumor that a new batch of Mentor items was added in today's release...\n\nFrank|Mindark: Question: Psychnosiz: does the possible us recession have\nany impact on ma since it's $ based ?\n\nAnswer: Obviously it has a certain impact as we mentioned in one of our recent\nquarterly reports. However this is quite understandable and normal when using a\nreal cash economy as Entropia does. There are ups and downs. In the long run,\nthings even out.\n\nMarco|Mindark: Question: Pant: A Player advisery board has been mentioned\non EntropiaForum. Does MA have any plans to implement such a thing?\n\nAnswer: No, not really. We may open up politics within Entropia in the future,\nwhere avatars could be elected and stuff, and maybe MindArk would function as a\nrepresentitive in this. But it way in the future at this point.\n\nMarco|Mindark: Question: Gaga: What will be the recommended system req for\nCE2? (on full graphics :) )\n\nAnswer: Probably the same as the game Crysis.\n\nAlf|mindark: Question: Skyfox20k: Of course..weather systems...will\nweather systems be implemented when CE is released\n\nAnswer: Yes this will be one of the new possibilities for the graphic team - to\ncreate moods through changing weatherpatterns. One can for example imagine\nareas where it´s always dark and gloomy, with eternal drizzle and dismal\novercast. Kind of like Sweden\n\nMarco|Mindark: Question: l3irdmann: When you guys first made the game I\nknow you must have had thoughts/visions and many expectations of what it would\ngrow into in the coming years. That being said, Is the Entropia we all know and\nlove grown into what you planed for/envisioned it would be?\n\nAnswer: A very good question. There is a long term vision for Entropia. It\nstretches several decades into the future. One goal is to become better than\nreal life, an option to real life as we know it today - in essence making the\nEntropia participant immortal. As of today, I'd say we maybe have reached 5% on\nthe journey that is Entropia. There are many, many years a head of us.\n\nFrank|Mindark: Question: thomasandersson: Will there be any quests in EU in\nthe future?\n\nAnswer: At the moment, we're not planning to introduce the types of quests you\nwould be used to from other games. We will see more interactions like the Robot\nBeacons we have in Entropia today though. A big part of Entropia is about being\nable to live your own virtual life by combining your own unique mix of skills,\nabilites etc. We definitely will want to preserve this feeling and not just\nhand participants a finished script.\n\nMagnus|Mindark: Question: Konve: Do Mindark see changes to current systems\nas intended nerfs to gain more money, or nessecary changed due to risk of\nupsetting the market even more if nothing is done?\n\nAnswer: All changes and improvments are done to make the universe more self\nsustained and open to both beginners and veterans. We are constantly monitoring\nthe economy and the users to see how the system is used and how the system\nwould work better for all. We earn money on a stable universe with many users\nwith different backgrounds feeling they have a chance of participating and\nfinding fields of experties. All parameters will never be predictible and that\nis a great engine of a real economy.\n\nMarco|Mindark: Question: phaythe: Q: Is thre any possibility that the new\nengine is being coded in a modular structure so that the older client may still\nbe able to connect to maximize the number of people with hardware capable of\nplaying the game? As someone looking forward to utilizing the game as a\nbusiness venture, losing a mass number of potential \"clients\" due to\nthe engine being upgraded is a major concern...\n\nAnswer: Probably not, the CE2 is a new system and we don't see the need to put\nvaluable resources into mainting the obsolete client. For us it would be better\nto make sure the CE2-Entropia client is customizable enough to allow people\nwith less powerful computer to take part anyway.\n\nFrank|Mindark: Question: treedoctor: Were can we purchaze Official Mindark\nItems like Statues, Tchirts and more ?\n\nAnswer: Yes, we've seen a renewed interest in Entropia merchadise recently and\nhave plans to introduce some basic items to begin with this year. We've been\nusing small figurines of Calypso wildlife at exhibitions around the world and\nthey've proven very popular.\n\nAlf|mindark: Question: Dion Red Strike: What is/was the hardest part of\nupgrading to the new graphics engine?\n\nAnswer: So far Im not sure we´ve gotten to the really hard part. The tools are\nexcellent and we are learning what we can do with them. I think the\ndifficulties will be on the programmers side, to get our avatars to work in the\nnew engine. One has to remember that there is a huge difference between\ncreating a character for a game like Crysis and creating an avatar for\nEntropia. We have to deal with all kind of customization for the participants´\nchoices. The most interesting aspect I think will be creating Alien\nenvironments with the engine. So far Ive mostly seen earth-like green forests\nand sunny beaches. It will be really cool to walk through more sci-fi-like\nenvironments.\n\nAnswer: Mindark expects to go public later this year. Any additional\ninformation about this will be presented when available.\n\nAlf|mindark: Question: Demonikos: The last months i've read about the MA\nplans and moves for the promotion of EU, in Brasil and China ... Is there any\nplan in the close future, that is aiming in other Countries with big MMORPG\nmarket like Japan , Russia etc?\n\nAlf|mindark: weARE IMPLEMENTING CHOPSTICKS AND FUR-HATS AS WE SPEAK\n\nMarco|Mindark: Question: Black Hawk Hawk: Trying to figure out the loot\nsystem in public (forums or open discution boards) is against EULA?\n\nAnswer: Not at all. =) Mindark staff actually often check such topics and are\nintrigued by all the theories that floats around. =)\n\nMarco|Mindark: Question: Soldat Somme: Has Mindark got any other future\nplans other then Entropia Universe?\n\nAnswer: Mindark will work on developing the Entropia Universe platform. That is\nour vision and business. There are no plans for us to pursue anything else.\n\nMagnus|Mindark: Question: daikiba: Will there be small transport items like\nhoverboards and jetpacks available?\n\nAnswer: This is a intressting question, I think we got something about\ndecreasing the weight earlier. We want to build a universe with constraints and\nneeds as real life, not all but some. We think that needs creates oportunities\nand that is an important part of an economy. We will not supply the sollution\nfor overweight, You wil!. We will just supply the \"economical\nblueprints\" for hoverboards, antigravity equipment, veiachles or mounts.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we are interested in cooperation with large companies around the\nworld. Not only from the advertising aspect but also for the expertise they can\nbring to the table. This expertise can help us in the introduction of new\nsystems, like vehicles for example. This would allow us to deliver a quality\nentertainment experience to our users, which at the end of the day is what\nentropia is about.\n\nAlf|mindark: Question: Psychnosiz: will there ever be a tp chip that will\nenable flying\n\nAnswer: I hope so... would be cool. Makes for interesting fights in the\npvp-zones :)\n\nMagnus|Mindark: Question: Zarki: Does Mindark make there salary by taking\nsmall amouts from every users accounts ?\n\nAnswer: No we earn money on your activity. We aim to to earn an average of one\ndollar per hour and user based on all users.\n\nFrank|Mindark: Question: Konve: Is it possible that pets would work as a\n\"storage on legs\" - allowing for longer hunting/mining runs?\n\nAnswer: It would certainly be a logical development, but I can't promise anything\nright now. They are already useful now though. I once read about somebody using\nthem as shields in PvP:)\n\nAlf|mindark: Question: Black Hawk Hawk: Can we look older in future?\n\nAnswer: There is actually morphtargets in the chardef-system that allows for an\nolder look, and some textures have more wrinkles than others. So if you try\nhard you can have a senior look. if we are going to introduce even more range\nfor the aging... im not sure. Very few people actually choose to have fat or\nold avatars, so its hardly worth the effort.\n\nMagnus|Mindark: Question: galadea: Do you have plans to implement branded\nitems like nike shoes that make you run faster?\n\nAnswer: There will always be new opportunites that arrive as the universe\ndevelops.\n\nMarco|Mindark: Question: melocybe: How does MA see itself in the MMO world?\n\nAnswer: As pioneers in a new and exciting field. We see ourselves as the\ncreators of a virtual universe platform that handles a real cash economy with\nsafety, balancing and monitoring capabilities. The platform will be state of\nthe art and use cutting edge technology (like CE2) in its representation of the\nnext generation of Internet - the 3d-Internet. There are a lot of spectics and\npeople who would doom us and our unique business model, but we have proven it\nand will continue to improve the system. Right now we feel we get a lot of\nrespect from our peers and from other businesses around the world, which is a\ngreat feeling after so many years of hard work.\n\nMarco|Mindark: Question: renwotanhoek: Do Mindark visit this year again the\nGames Convention in Leipzig ?\n\nAnswer: With a very high certanty, yes, we will be there.\n\nFrank|Mindark: Question: loserkid83: Will gambeling ever be a part of\nEntropia, or are there to many legal issues associated with it\n\nAlf|mindark: Question: product2378: s there any chance of any info as to\nany of the new planets or any sneaky peak pictures of developments you can post\non the website :)\n\nAnswer: yes we will post some nice pictures for you as sson as we have something\nthat is representative. Actually the first environments for the new engine will\nbe created very soon.\n\nFrank|Mindark: Question: melocybe: Can we expect more interaction between\nsocieties? More interaction within societies, like having a soc inventory, soc\nreal-estate, maybe even item manufacturing plants that require members of a soc\nto work together?\n\nAnswer: Yes, we have the land grab going on right now\n\nFrank|Mindark: one of the most exciting society events in entropia.\n\nFrank|Mindark: Question: POLE 'The NBK': Did you expect so many questions\nin the Xfire chatroom ?\n\nAnswer: We weren't quite sure what to expect to begin with, but when we saw the\n\"Chatter Room\" filling up in the beginning we knew something was\nabout to happen:)\n\nFrank|Mindark: Question: twitchie9: Will there be anymore VU's before the\nmajor CryEngine VU?\n\nAnswer: Yes. Several.\n\nMarco|Mindark: Question: galadea: Eu started as a very idealistic project.\nDo you still feel the enthusiasm of teh first years or is it slowing down\nbecause of the bigger responsibility\n\nAnswer: Yes, very much so. Much of it originates from the fact that Entropia is\nin constant and quick evolution, if you compare Entropia today with Entropia one\nyear ago, two years ago, etc, you will see enorumous changes to it. Entropia\nwill always be in motion and will never be \"finished\".\n\nMagnus|Mindark: Question: Lamhir: - BANKING QUESTION: With recent banning of\nbanks in Second Life (all institution which provide constant rate of interests\n= garantueed profit) which arent regulated by real world regulations, do you\nsee any problems upcomping with Entropia banks?!\n\nAnswer: That is the thing with Entropia. If we create a system it is based on\nbasic economic facts and rules. You cannot create things from nothing and do\nnot doubt there is no such thing as garantueed profit, you have to put in\neffort, time, money, knowledge or value of some kind. If you think about it\nthat is what the real life regulations are there for. You just have to be\ncareful and look close and you will find the oportunities in the safe and\nsecure environment. Nobody profits in the long run from anarchy. We see no\nproblem with banks infact why would they not work, there is a need for them.\n\nMarco|Mindark: Question: Black Hawk Hawk: Will cash cards be available any\ntime soon?\n\nAnswer: We are pursuing the best and safest partner possible, in order to have a\nlong term safe system in place. Several potential partners were screened during\n2007 but we decided not to use them. The delays are unfortunate, but we must\nhave a secure and safe system that will last for a very long time in the\nfuture. I believe there will be some interesting development as to this in a\ncouple of weeks time.\n\nAlf|mindark: Question: knabo: Will we be seeing more\n\"interesting\" landmarks like caves and such\n\nAnswer: yes certainly, but dont expect everything at once... we will start with\na small world and expand it like the old continents. Once our partners start\ncreating their own planets we can exppect everything from caves and dungeons,\nto underwater-environments and airless moons. We will eventually have a virtual\nuniverse with hundreds of different worlds to visit, a vast galaxy...\n\nAlf|mindark: Alf says goodnight and see you on Calypso tomorrow! Good\nhunting!\n\nMagnus|Mindark: Question: ardorj: Some of the bugs must have given you a\ngood laugh. Can you name one of which you say \"that was funny\"\n\nAnswer: Its an old one but it is still the funniest one, this was back in 2003\nor 2004. Suddenly one day the server just went down and they would not get up\nagain. Everytime we tried to restart them they just crashed. After a while one\nof the programmers came up to me and said. We have found the problem! Yes what\nis? I asked eagrly. User X has picked up the entire terrain in his inventory\nand he has just logged out. We have to fix the problem or wait until he loggs\nin again... =) Now that is something we warn our new programmers about even\ntoday....\n\nMarco|Mindark: Lol - the world in the backpack issue. I remember that. =)\n\nFrank|Mindark: Thanks very much everybody. As alf said - see you on\nCalypso!\n\n[Xfire] Chatteox: Alright everyone thank you for participating in the Entropia\nUniverse Live Chat. We apologize again for the unforeseen technical\ndifficulties. But now I'll give out the prizes!\n\nMarco|Mindark: Thanks a lot everyone, there were like a million more\nquestions, but this was what we had time for. Good night everyone!\n\n[Xfire] Chatteox: There are 15 prizes total don't go anywhere while I announce\nthem!"

      "text": "P.S. Ventessel, I hope you don't mind me asking, but you seem to know a whole lot about military stuffs (), how come?\n\nToo much time with the Navy, the Marines started rubbing off on meConsidering how depth charges capitalize on the added pressure in water to be more destructive to submarines even if it is not an actual hit, I don't think explosive force is an issue.\n\nThis is slightly off-topic, but the effectiveness of depth charges is partially derived from the displacement of water next to the hull of a submarine. The hull of the sub is designed to withstand the slow, steady pressure of the sea. When a depth charge detonates close enough to the hull, the force of the explosion displaces a large volume of water, and if the resulting (temporary) vacuum comes into contact with the hull, the sudden decrease in pressure can cause the hull to rupture. Needless to say, that's bad news for the submarine crew.\n\nEDIT: So I guess I'm not following your argument here. How is explosive force not going to be an issue here?\n\nQuote:\nOriginally Posted by GarfieldJL\n\nNow concerning shrapenal, that could be an issue, on the other hand they aren't exactly organics either, so it's not like they will experience explosive decompression (which is why I specified the attackers be droids).\n\nI'm not seeing how being a droid stops the shrapnel from damaging them? They'll need to be out of the potential line of effect drawn from the blast center regardless, or they might get perforated since the fragments won't slow down or be affected by gravity as they would in a planetary environmentWell this conversation gives added reason for G0-T0 to use stealth ships to take out or capture Traya's fleet.\n\nRight now we have Traya throwing a tantrum and sending her fleet around to conduct orbital bombardments on planets, and sending assassins around to kill people.\n\nWouldn't the orbital bombardments start to really tick people off?\n\nReally since the Hutts are not in play I don't see anyone putting a bounty on \"Goto,\" and he'd obviously put one on Traya's head.\n\nAside from all the smuggler's he's running out of business with his own ultra-efficient ring?\n\nAnd Traya won't be bombarding random people in a temper tantrum, if she bombards anything at all. Traya was opposed to wanton destruction, so while G0-T0's vaunted HK droids might not care about blasting third parties to pieces, Traya will be very mindful of the consequences of all her actions. She's not only calculating and ruthless, but capable of remarkable forethought when it comes to seeing how her actions will take shape down the line.\n\nQuote:\nOriginally Posted by GarfieldJL\n\nI just thought of something G0-T0 can do.\n\nSend small ships in and release a naturally occurring plague into Malachor V's atmosphere or send some droids in and have them spray the disease every which way when they start encountering people.\n\nPretty soon Traya will have a nice plague on her hands.Let me get this straight you're saying that: if G0-T0 manages to send a bunch of probe droids to Malachor V, carrying canisters containing an airborne pathogen, and they manage to get it into Traya's academy (especially if the virus has about a 24 hour time frame before people start manifesting the symptoms; is a hare-brained and desperate idea?\n\nAlso concerning the droids, yes shrapnel is an issue, but it isn't as big of an issue for a droid as it would be for someone in a space suit"

      "text": "By the cut-and-dry-est, most raw RAW, you can remove the Obsolescent/Obsolete modification because of a technicality.\n\nActually no, you can't, as there is no rule that allows it.\n\nQUOTE\n\nIf that technicality had not been written (something as easy as making a new \"Vehicle Trait\" list, similar to what they intended but far away from what occurred) then there would be no issue.\n\nI don't really see the difference. The traits are labeled differently. The term \"Trait\" alone should be enough to make clear that they are not typical modifications, that can be added and removed to/from anything. wish I could claim credit for this one. Like I said, my best friend who I roped into being a shadowrun fan came up with 'the airfoil'.No part of that makes sense. (IMG:style_emoticons/default/smile.gif) Assuming that it were possible to remove LTA, you'd end up with a little cabin. It could sit there.\n\nNo you wouldn't. Remeber, zepplins are big, huge, rigid frames. So you'd wind up with a tiny cabin underneath a massive metal hull topped with propellers. And it is an air ship, the LTA mod being something you can put on any frame, so it doesn't seem remotely impossible to say that the \"base frame\" would be a watergoing vessel.\n\nThen you crunch the numbers - this new vessel has 1/10th the operation time of the zepplin, Speed and Acceleration double, Handling improves by 2, but it loses Improved Takeoff and Landing 2. Then you add the hydrofoil capability, doubling Speed and Acceleration again, while cutting operation time in half; so, if you're using the hydrofoil full-time, the operation time on one tank of gas went from 60 hours to three hours, but speed and acceleration quadrupled.\n\nThen you just whack the Improved Economy mod on there to improve the operation time back to six hours per tank of fuel, and slam on something like 12 spare fuel tanks and SunCell to make something that can go for like five days straight without stopping to refuel.\n\nShazam, you have a hybrid ekranoplan/hydrofoil that can cruise up and down the seas at 144 Kph with a fucking enormous hold of cargo has air-propellers as its primary mode of propulsion.\n\nThat makes it resemble an ekranoplane. And since this thing will be up on a hydrofoil when it's in motion, it's not remotely a stretch to say that that huge body of its is benefiting from the ground effect, partially as a way to explain how something so damn huge can stand on hydrofoils and moveOr it could mean you can remove the Obsolete/Obsolescent upgrade and have non-working old droneIt frankly doesn't matter what you think of its practical function as an ekranoplane, the fact is that you have a fuckhuge once-zeppelin zooming the ocean around at 144 KPH on hydrofoil stilts, powered by propellers.\n\nIf that's not crazy-awesome enough to justify its own existence to you, then you have no room in your soul for coolnessI just said don't call it an ekranoplane. (IMG:style_emoticons/default/smile.gif) It's a totally different crazy thing, which is what I just said: *own* the crazy results, don't handwave them into a more 'normal' form. So, de-LTA your zeppelin, add a hydrofoil, (add water sealing! It's a mod.), and enjoy. I'm sure it won't stand out. (IMG:style_emoticons/default/wink.gif)\n\nActually, yes, because I've already provided the rules. Here they are again, from my OP:\n\nQUOTE\n\nStandard Upgrades: In this entry you will find a list of vehicle modifications (p. 131) that the vehicle automatically comes equipped with at no extra cost. These standard upgrades use the same rules as given for vehicle modifications, but they don't count toward the vehicle's slot limit and the vehicle itself still counts as unmodified. Other restrictions, like the maximum amount of weapon mounts, still apply. Removing a standard upgrade does not provide additional modification slots. The changes to a vehicle's stats due to its standard upgrades are already calculated into its stats list.\n\nQUOTE\n\nThis takes the usual modification test and requires the tools mentioned in the modification description. However, the threshold is halved and there are no further materials required.\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\nQUOTE ( @ Apr 8 2012, 04:37 AM)\n\nI don't really see the difference. The traits are labeled differently. The term \"Trait\" alone should be enough to make clear that they are not typical modifications, that can be added and removed to/from anything.\n\nExcept that they aren't. You can give it a descriptive title all you want, but when it follows all the rules for something and is listed in the same category as that other thing, it is actually that other thing. In this case it is a Standard Upgrade. Since no rules were provided for what a Vehicle Trait is, it is a meaningless sequence of letters and does not register at all in the rules. All it would have taken to correct this is for it to read \"Vehicle Trait - Vehicle traits are like Standard Upgrades, but cannot be removed.\" Lacking this, they follow all rules for Standard Upgrades because they are, in fact, Standard Upgrades.\n\nQUOTE (pdboddy @ Apr 8 2012, 09:41 PM)\n\nOr it could mean you can remove the Obsolete/Obsolescent upgrade and have non-working old drone.\n\nExcept that Obsolete/Obsolescent do not determine the Device Rating of the drone, they only modify it. Removing that modification restores the original Device Rating.\n\n--------------------\n\n\"There is a fine line between arrogance and confidence - and I walk that line proudly.\" - Myself.\n\nQUOTE This takes the usual modification test and requires the tools mentioned in the modification description. However, the threshold is halved and there are no further materials required.\n\n(emphasis mine)--------------------\n\n\"There is a fine line between arrogance and confidence - and I walk that line proudly.\" - MyselfMy problem wasn't that you're proven is that it's theoretically possible to remove Obsolete/Obsolescent and it would be free to do so. It's that the tools needed and threshold are not listed so it's all GM discretion in practice anyways. That's the same net effect if you did make the mods hard traits and asked the GM \"hey can I remove this trait?\"\n\nI guess the RAW way the GM is more inclined to let you \"upgrade\" the vehicle which frankly I don't see the issue. So with GM determined hard work and tools, you can now turn a Predator drone into a more viable combat platform. Since you can just buy a wide variety of military drones (often for cheaper), this isn't even that unbalancing. Also is that really that silly to improve the electronics? Since there's generic \"tuning\" modifications like Improved Economy and Improved Suspension, the special effect of removing Obsolete isn't that special either since there's no need for a black box doing the effects.\n\nIt's odd that it's be free to do this besides the tools and man hour. As rules oversights go though, that's nothing and is vastly different from the submersible aircraft carriers which gave them a crunch ability to sink and drown everyone and then resurface. If Obsolete meant that Predator drones could fly into space or carry 15 people or something, then you'll have a caseYes, you did mention it, but you glossed over the importance of it.\n\nRAW has to address two things: what you CAN do, and HOW you do it.\n\nBy RAW, it states that yes, you CAN remove those traits/mods.\n\nIt does not, however, describe HOW you go about actually removing those mods. There is no guidance for removing these as mods. It leaves it up for the GM to adjudicate.\n\nWhich, IMO, is fine with me, as it likely should be resolved on a case-by-case basis.\n\nI'm not getting the whole \"this is fluff\" counter-argument. I'm not arguing that you can or cannot remove obsolete/obsolescent. I think you should be able to...if you want to upgrade the controls, electronics, software, and firmware of the drone.\n\nI also agree that the mods should have been worded better, to address the ramifications of removing the mod (i.e. the device rating goes to 0, not +1/+2).\n\nI didn't say there wasn't a fluff/crunch distinction. I (pretty obviously, I thought) meant that everyone always uses that distinction for their own advantage. (IMG:style_emoticons/default/smile.gif) Hence, 'that's just fluff'… when it disagrees with someone. Given that they're not labeled in SR4, deciding what is and isn't crunch represents a significant rules issue.\n\nActually, yes, because I've already provided the rules. Here they are again, from my OP: ...\n\nNone of those quotes provide any rule that says, that you can remove them.\n\nThe rules for vehicle modification say, that you can remove them to gain back slots (which does not work with Standard Upgrades) and to slim down its appearance.\n\nQUOTE\n\nA modification can be removed to get back the slots it took up and slim down the item's appearance.\n\nThere is nothing else.\n\nAnd...\n\nQUOTE\n\nStandard Upgrades: In this entry you will find a list of vehicle modifications (p. 131) ...\n\nSince Obsolete is no vehicle modification, the rules about standard upgrades cannot apply to them, because the list only contains vehicle modifications (because at the time of writing there was nothing else). And, as I already said, Obsolete is no vehicle modification (which is quite obvious, also, because you cannot modify a vehicle with it... there are no costs, no times, no tools, or whatnot listed for it, because it is not a modification but a trait; and clearly labeled so as well).\n\nAnd as others have pointed out, there is no modification description, so there is no way to find out what would be needed if you could remove it.\n\nQUOTE\n\nThis takes the usual modification test and requires the tools mentioned in the modification description. However, the threshold is halved and there are no further materials required.\n\nIt does not, however, describe HOW you go about actually removing those mods. There is no guidance for removing these as mods. It leaves it up for the GM to adjudicate.\n\nThe more fair way to deal with this is to treat it like arsenal, like when they forgot the line entry for some mods, like rocket booster(i think it was)\n\nIn short, the lack of more details on these mods is a dev oversight.\n\nThe framework for neraph to do what he suggests is all there, but its the writer's fault they didn't include all the necessary details.

      "text": "Why do you assume that you'd get 3 extra chapters of fluff, and not just lose the 3 chapters all together? 3 Chapters isn't that much space, but you seem to be treating it as if it were half the book. It isn't. Its 3 chapters.\n\nBeyond that, the system seems like it'd be pretty hard to make incompatible. The Career systems are all going to work the same way most likely, you'll still have talent trees, and you've already got the Force-Sensitive spec that allows you to make a Jedi equal to Luke.\n\nI can't see how you'd be able to make that all incompatible, when everything is at the same power-level.\n\nI said it was ideal, I even gave the example of getting it different.\n\nAnd why do I presume the space? Because the 'repeated' stuff is some of the meatiest stuff in the book: Core Mechanics, Equipment, and general setting info. Just like in the 40k books.\n\nAnd the real reason is that book prices and size are based on number of 'packets' inside them. 3 chapters - especially the rules and generic setting stuff and equipment that would be repeated in each is going to be 48 pages easily (2 packets), and likely in the 72-96 range with all the art, that's enough to drop down 5-10 bucks on a hardcover. In 40k RPG terms it's the difference between the Core Books and a Rites of Battle style once yearly 'big book'. That's quite all right too. I'll take a cheaper version. Thoguh as I said, ideally we get a similar size with more NEW stuff.\n\nAnd incompatible? 40k games ostensibly all work on the same mechanic. And the first three even use the talent trees and career rank thing, and based on the same XP… though at different costs depending on the game, yet there were enough changes that things were anything but seamless. Just compare Ascension level Dark Heresy characters with starting Deathwatch Marines. Same XP level, DRASTICALLY different power levels. Rough equivalents, but not seamless by any definition of the word. It takes work to make them work together.\n\nI think that you're looking at it the wrong way. It's actually not hard at all to play a Deathwatch character in Dark Herasy. Nor is it challenging to have a Dark Herasy character in Deathwatch. What gets wonky is combining both systems together. Was that clear?\n\nPlaying a character, and playing a campaign are not synonymous, and it's past the one-offs and the short series of adventures where the break down occurs.\n\nAll of the 40K games have different acquisition models for gearI'd like to think there has been a lesson learned, especially with such an important franchise. They blow Star Wars, and that's a pretty huge whoops. So, I actually trust them to manage it, especially after listening to the podcast with Jay[/quote]\n\nYou're GM should be able to make all those calls baised on the specific exception that you are making. But personally I'd convert the oddball character to the rules used in the prime setting. It's not hard for example to say that a Space Marine who is acting as a member of a Rogue Trader crew uses profit factor to aquire a new gun, since he is far from the support network.\n\nVagrantWhisper said:Differing xp progressions is a thing, but I honestly don't worry about it. I maintain that they are essentially comparable especially since the bestiaries make a point of not repeating material and can be used in any of the lines with truely minimal work. I worry not."

      "text": "WH40,000] Tales of the Neckbeard and Adventures in Crazyland, 1000 FLGS stories.\n\nPosts\n\nI have given some DE players problems with my guard, if only because there are just too many av12 hull on the board to deal with. My last 2k IG list had 12 av12 hulls and 1 av14. Three ravagers will at best kill three turn one, less if I went first and smoked (assuming they can still shoot after I shoot them), usually they miss a few times and a 50% chance to do anything to av12 on armor pen means usually you can count on only 1 roll on the damage chart per tank. Then you have what, 3-4 lances on raiders (so enough to take out one more tank from next turn one way or another), then some blasters scattered around that may have range to say at least stun another tank. Even best case you killed about have of say the chimera full of vets that are now halfway across the board and stunned a couple of others. Still have the hydras/manticores to deal with. If you shot them to keep them from shooting, then my vets loaded with plasma/melta are going to be near your side of the board, and you then still have three vendettas with the heavy bolters so thats 9 shots per that can hurt DE skimmers.\n\nOf course this is never going to happen short of the DE player seizing on me. If I go first and he deployes, unless he has enough cover block LOS to all his stuff (including from 3 scouting vendettas) , even with cover saves I have enough long range shooting to kill several av10 hulls (or at least stun the ravagers so they arnt a threat and move on to transports) and my chimears full of vets have moved up 12 to get into range next turn. If he goes first I can always jsut reserve everything and have my stuff come in on a 3+ turn two due to astropath. Then I can overpower a flank and smoke alot of my stuff befor he shoots anything. S8 vs AV12 still needs a good mass of fire to kill stuff reliably, no russes means the lance rule is wasted, and DE just cant take that many S8 shots in most lists. heat lances are ok but like blasters you need to be close, which is not great vs a list loaded with plasma/melta/heavy flamers. As IG, I dont care about you assaulting me (I die anyway and I am going to make you need 6s to hit my tanks with haywires if I see you getting close) dont care about poison shots (cant hurt my tanks and kill guardsmen worse than bolters). I play eldar and DE alot and they tend to need to get lucky or have me roll horribly to have a good shots of winning, eldar because their arnt enough of them to weather my shooting, DE beause I out shoot them by a good bit but am still more durable than them and have numbers on my side.\n\nMaybe it's just because my experience with DE are lists that have 20+ Dark Lances everytimeLike I said, I have never seen DE not just completely vaporize a mech list, IG or otherwise. My experience with DE though is with a national tournament level player, so there is that accurate. You contradicted. I reiterated and gave an explanation for that experience. You contradicted and pulled your own dick out anecdotal\n\nThe thing is, it being a national tournament player or the scrub down the street has absolutely no effect on the numerical probability of stuff happening. Mass of AV 12 is a well recognized weakness of DE, 20 lances or no. Unless the IG player is an idiot, or the game takes place on planet bowling ball, it is literally impossible to reliably 'vaporize' a mech list, national tournament guy or no.\n\nIs my experience anecdotal? Yes. Is it 100% accurate as my experience? Yes, because I was not exaggerating or stretching any truth about it. 20+ Dark Lances in an army can and will utterly shut down a mech list. Be it destroying all the tanks, forcing them into LOS blocking terrain and making them therefore useless, or a combination of the two. Tournament players have a better understanding of target priority and importance, so the same list can give varying results to different people that play it... Which is why fail netlists are so funny.\n\nNumerical averages and statistics in 40k are utterly useless once the game starts. They help us make informed decisions, but once dice hit the table, they mean nothing, and we all have first hand knowledge of that, I am sure. I've had a unit of marines survive 174 lasgun shots without a single failed wound. I've had 5 Lasguns kill 5 terminators. It happens. I have seen a DE list bring down 9+ chimera chassis in one turn of shooting in multiple games. I've had it happen to me.\n\nNax on April 2012Yeah, Nax, your argument isn't working all that well. It only holds up like you're saying it does if the DE player has all the advantages and his opponent is letting him dictate all the terms of engagement once the game starts, and also assuming that the DE player is going to continually roll exceptionally well, and never have a flubbed turn to balance it out.\n\nI'm not really even trying to make an argument, Gabe. It's happened to me, it's happened to people worse than me, and it's happened to people better than me. At RTTs, and big con tournaments, in league games, etc etc.\n\nI'm going to actually go play 40k now. 1k necrons vs 1k IG. HuzzahMy Kroot are going to be DE, using imperial tech. Landspeeder Storms for Venoms, modified Melta's for blasters, Missile launchers and such for other weapons. Trying to figure out what to do for a raider, thinking a Stormraven except the armor just looks to thick.\n\nI've got reams of notes and sketches for what stuffs going to look like...it's taken some time but I'm starting to make actual headway.\n\nI don't see why you can't just krootify the raider hull. Just make it like some primitive-tech hover skiff. Knock off some of the side railings, add some looted imperial bits, replace the weapons, some wood and bone pieces (look to wfb orks). imagine something along the lines of the Star Wars desert skiffs.\n\nAssuming 21 Lances you're looking at 14 hits, 7 glances or pens, and maybe 2 dead vehicles. Less with smoke. It's certainly possible for the fatality count to be much higher and it'll definitely happen in some games, but the raw numbers aren't actually that good for taking out 10-12+ AV12 hulls that fast.\n\nWhere was I dick measuring? I gave my experience, which is 100% accurate. You contradicted. I reiterated and gave an explanation for that experience. You contradicted and pulled your own dick out\n\nYou said you know from a national champion.\n\nSo do I, and instead of naming him and playing \"who knows the better DE player\" I'm stating it's a fact that DE falters against mass AV. Aside from getting seized on by a strong shooting army, it's essentially their primary weaknessNo, now it's an argument between two positions with competent backers on each side.\n\nSaying, \"X player says this-\" is an argument with supporting evidence.\n\nSaying, \"I know X player who says-\" is akin to saying, \"Check out my dick, it's so big, that's how you know it's awesome\".\n\nAside, I didn't mean it in any sort of offensive way, Nax took it pretty personally. I didn't want to devolve this into, \"I know so and so who says this\", nevermind the fact that just because someone is a national champion doesn't mean their opinion is even all that great, especially when it's contradictory to the average (Not pointed at Nax, saying in general.) There are lots of people who have won events with 'shitty' lists because of matchups/players/etc. There's a lot more to this game than just lists, the best players can do well with damn near any list if they really want to.\n\nTL-DR - Sorry if I offended you Nax. I wasn't trying to imply you were trying to act like an internet tough guy, I was trying to steer the conversation away from something that might turn into what it did.\n\nI used the fact that both you and Nax have dealt with national champ DE players to come to a useful conclusion about the question at hand. Because of normal internet anonymity issues, I gave both of you the benefit of the doubt on issues of fact, i.e. that you really knew these guys, and did not hold it against you that you didn't name names.\n\nEven if you don't feel that it's a good form of argumentation, I'd ask you to not discourage people, because it is quite useful to some of us.\n\nArguments from authority (which is what this is kind of an attempt at) are pretty awful no matter how you try to cut it. I'd be willing to bet you guys are talking about pretty different lists when you get right down to it. The metas in which these games took place are also significant because 40k is such a list building centered game at higher levelsThat's not the point I made. And actually, the people who tend to win big tournaments are the people who have put a lot of math and testing into the kinds of lists that they put together. Not as rigorous a process as a legit science field, of course, but they certainly aren't coming to their conclusions without a process that they go through. Regardless - \"people who win national championships say,\" isn't even an argument to begin with. \"People who win championships have shown me that their playtesting, and their actual practice games, indicate XYZ,\" is a very different statement."

And it is definitely a standalone kit because it is designed to be transportable, as they could have it deployed to many different testing areas.\n\nBesides the high end models of Caterpillar's rental power generator line could generate power output up to 1.5 megawatt.SAMs, other missiles that the railgun can't effectively replace, a second railgun, more ammo/power systems for railguns/lasers, more crew space? All seem like reasonable ideas.Still, pretty cool if it works.\n\nThe current mounting keeps the ship from using helocopters so they will have to find somewhere else to put it.\n\nYou think they'll have a larger crew? I personally thought 84 was a bit low for a ship that's quite a bit larger than a modern destroyer that requires a crew of 100-350.

      "text": "During the discussion of the game play mode, there was a question about how the players would reside in the galaxy, how they would colonize planets, and how many planets he could colonize. Many browser-based games allow you to colonize an entire planet and you are given a limited number of building 'fields' to work withA bigger unexplored universe What if we gave players a bigger universe - explored and unexplored - to live in, while making inhabited planets adequately 'crowded' as if you lived in the universe of Star Trek or Star Wars. Players would reside or visit a number of inhabited installations in the game. The general idea is for a multitude of players to be able to coexist in a location such as a planet, orbital facility, base, outpost even exceptionally large ships at the same time. If say, 1,000 players could reside on a large planet, you could produce truly unique systems with planets that are not the same from system to system, and would allow players to travel more, and visit other places besides their own home planets.\n\nLocal Economies With a planet that has a heavier population, it could provide a working infrastructure and economy, since not all players want to do all occupations. A planet would employ miners, merchants, shipyards, space ports, factories, research facilities, outfitting yards, bars, planetary defenses, and possibly a local government. This way everyone works together and the player can do what each enjoys the most.\n\nEach player could be given a piece of land on the planet to build what he pleases. This land could be limited, but he might also be able to purchase multiple lots on the planet. The player would also have the ability to own lots on multiple planets or facilities.\n\nSolar systems would be unique in nature, some solar systems may be nearly empty, with only a couple of orbiting planets, others might not have any habitable planets, and other solar systems may have a bountiful resource planet, or several M-class planets. The possibilities are endless.\n\nConquering Settlements Bases and planets could be conquered by a warring alliance if all of the planets defenses are subdued, and the attacking force has the required manpower to effectively take over the base or planet. An attacking force may also lay siege to the base, intruding a whole new series of strategies.\n\nColonization Colonization would require a group of individuals to collaborate on a colonization effort to make it successful. A planet could construct colonization ships that could be used in the effort to colonize new worlds. Which could then be built up.\n\nBuilding Space Stations and Outposts Building space stations would require a significant amount of resources from all of the players involved in the building project. Deep Space Outposts or listening posts could also be built, and would require mobile building platforms - and a significant amount of resources, depending on the size - to build the base. The bases would then be owned by the builders, and could space could be rented out or sold to other playersWRONG You're missing the part when HOW and WHERE depends only on our own ideas and immagination. We can create a system that puts so many random elements, and so many different types of planets/asteroid belts/etc., that eaven with 250000 solar systems in the wole game we really CAN make every single one of those unique and still have a lot of empty space to explore. Let me give You an example of a possible solution to that issue:\n\nWe have a 2 dimentional universe map with stars appearing there just as \"dots\" or different sizes of \"circles\". Every solar system would be generated randomly when first visited and saved in the database (so our database grows bigger every time some system is explored for the first time). That doesnt sound really revolutionary, right? Now let's add some additional elements to that idea:\n\nEvery solar system has 10 slots (or 15 or 8 or whatever we want it to be, that's not important at the moment)\n\nEvery generating of a system is an algorythm with several steps:\n\nA random number from 1 to \"max slots\" ie generated. That is our number of objects on the system.\n\nA random position is selected for every generated object in between position 1 and \"max slots\". As an effect we get a solar system with unknown number of planets on unknown positions.\n\nFor each object there is \"class\" selection, which is just a logical variable selected randomly (0 or 1), where 0 is an \"uninhabitable object\" and 1 is \"inhabitable\".\n\nFINAL PHASE: Every uninhabitable and inhabitable object is now selected randomly from the table containing exact objects of each type. In that table we have planets of various types, asteroid belt, giant planetoids and other special objects.\n\nAdditional objects: this step is not necesairy, but i think it's a nice idea to. A random number is generated from 0 to 3, which indicates the number of \"specials\" in the system like comets, alien ship wrecks or gas clouds.\n\nSo tell me, does that sound interesting? Now let's estimate how many possible combinations there are (i will use 10 as a default number of slots, object types and so on, because it's easyer): - We have 10 types of solar systems (with 1, 2, 3 ... 10 objects). - There are 10 types of habitable and 10 of uninhabitable objects. - Many objects can also have their own moons (the number depends on the object), but max could be liek 10 moons for a Brown Dwarf class superplanet - Remember that all of them can be located on different positions in the same system type (5 planet systems can look in ~300 ways)\n\nSimple multiplying 10*10*2(2 i think is the average number of moons including gas giants and superplanets)*500(possible layouts, propably there's more but i was to lazy to calculate that)*3^3(specials) ... 900 000 possible combinations. Of course many of them can look really similar, some may be generated exactly the same just because it;s random, but hey! ... we have a unique galaxy with high possibility to generate systems wit 0 inhabitable planets!\n\nSo now ... is it possible or not to kae every of those 250 000 (or more) solat systems unique ?\n\n Plus, you end up with a crowded universe rather than just crowded planets.\n\ni know im fairly new around here but i have extensive programming knowledge outside php unfortunately and this is an extremely interesting subject for me. i have actually started one of these before as i played a couple online way too much and wanted more. i left the group who began it as time got away from me with school and work that innevitably led to it not passing initial development but it would be fun to see one starting from scratch again.\n\nthis topic is a similar discussion we had and one of the things we thought we could use to differientiate the game from others. it is all along similar ideas as you present here and the basic thoughts were as follows:, very simplistic in nature unlike the previous guy though so give me some slack\n\nanyways, (lots of sharp edges but smoothing it out is the fun part) here is the rough idea you start with standard planetary systems with multiple planets to be colonized based on size but these planet sizes would result in multiple regions on the planet that could be colonized by multiple, different players\n\nie planet size 500 gives it 5 regions, 300 only 3...then each would have space to build totaling the size but a random size to each region. so region one might have 75, region two 150, etc...\n\nthen the planets could be colonized by more than one player as long as a) there are no planetary defenses or b) half of the planet is built on and make these feats that cant be done quickly. you could also invite allies to free regions or something.\n\nthis sort of layout could give the game another level of play too which would be land battles. everyone is used to going strait to spaceship fighting in the space game but what if you had to earn the ability to fly in space first? in the mean time you explore and colonize other land regions on your planet until you research/discover/build something to give you space flight tech.\n\nyour economy and career oritented design would simply take this idea one step further and while i understand your wanting to make it more than just a fighting game, this innevitably plays a role and would fit right in. lots of things to do on the planet besides fight would be a great addition.\n\nwith a format like this would force you to start people on the same planet to get early interaction but this could actually be beneficial as you can define a small system in the game and db until more people start playing and until they can actually explore space. i know you mentioned inhabiteted unexplored regions with what i would assume to be AI areas but starting galaxy 1-4 for example like others do could provide this type of set up and these unexplored galaxies could come into play late in game.\n\nmake sense? i dont know...just an idea we had and it seemed like this would fit in with what you were thinking here but if im way off base then...ok, just throwing it out there...good luck with this, i look forward to playing it!\n\nHighway of Life wrote:Highway of Life wrote: ...

Of course that system would require additional algorythms that would keep the area not really that overcrowded. On the other hand if You want to put so many players on one planet, than we don't really need any spaceships we need takns! we need a lot of tanks and infantry !\n\nMy point is, that we seem to have different definition of something being \"crowded\" or not ... for me crowd means a LOT of players in only one spot/one planet. Making people scattered in the whole universe makes it really NOT crowded at all, and many solar systems coesn't limit expansion at all ... because one race colonised every single planet it could in a solar system that doesn't mean the system is already full ... it only means that other planets in that system couldnt be colonised by them, but still can be by others. Spi21s idea with 5 or 3 regions on one planet is pretty much closer to the idea of multiple players in one system, but on seperate planets, than to the idea where 100 or 50 players are stuck on only one planet like sardines in a can\n\nAs a player i would be really confused just by the numbers ... how is it supposed to be simple and easy to use? That would be much more harder than browsing galaxy in Ogame or SFC. You have some solar systems that are inhabited, in every system there are several planets, and on a planet there are several players ... isn't tha one of the things we want to avoid? A really copmplicated element?\n\nKfarcyk wrote:I suspect you would need at least 8 inhabitable planets within each solar system. - If each player could colonize about 8 or 9 worlds (for example).\n\nRandom/Unique Solar Systems First off, I want to clarify that I agree with you on creating truly random and unique solar systems. My argument is that if a single player could colonize entire worlds, your options for uniqueness could be somewhat limited -- even though the order and quantity in which celestial bodies would appear would differ from system to system. My idea for planetary occupation would not limit exploration or unknown space, although it very likely could increase the amount of unknown or unexplored space regardless of the number of players who play the game.\n\nFeeling Crowded In a game of outer space and exploration, it would feel too crowded because of some 300,000 solar systems being already occupied. If there were fewer solar systems already occupied, it leaves a lot more room for space exploration.\n\nYes, the planets themselves would feel crowded, but I think this is more realistic. Think of cities on Earth. If the population of New York City (8 million) was spread out over the United States (nearly 10 million kilometers), so that each person in New York City (metro area) were given 1 square kilometer (their own 'planet'), all the sudden, you have a pretty crowded United States. But each square kilometer is not crowded. It's lonely, it only has one person on it. Cities are crowded. Planets are crowded. Outer space is not crowded. When you bring in a factor of realism, crowded planets are more realistic. Crowded galaxy is not.\n\n50 players one one planet is a very VERY small planet, a very small city, and certainly a very small town. Although I'm not against doing a limited number of regions, 3, 5, 10... whatever. I think more players to a planet would still be more realistic.\n\nOur Solar System LetsYou Control Your Land IfYour ability to control your own land, own multiple plots of land on multiple worlds, would not be hindered. You would still have control over what you build, but instead of the player being an entire civilization, you are instead a captain, a leader, an emperor, or whatever you want to be. And you don't occupy entire planets all by yourself - although you could own them, usurp them, or rule them.\n\nConfused by the Numbers You, as a player, should not care about the numbers. Because in the game, it doesn't matter to you. It only matters to the developers. People would likely choose a larger friendly crowd (a more populated planet of their own race and alliance) rather than a sparse hostile crowd. Having a higher player count on the planet could dramatically increase the player interactions in the game, which is one of our goals. The game interface just has to be simple, the game learning curve for the player cannot be complicated. But the game itself for the developers, can be as complicated as it needs to be. (why did i bring this up? because one player per planet is also so not realistic. ). Besides we can add different objects to the game, that would be interesting ... we could eaven add some clearly theoretical elements like stars orbiting black holes, or protoplanetary discs (that's not a theory ), we could also add randomly found planets without suns (there is a theory that \"solar systems\" are a lot more common than we think, but the central object never gets massive enough to start nuclear fusion of any elements and as an effect also to become a sun (or at least a brown dwarf), so it remains a dead and cold system of horribly cold planets orbiting a \"back sun\" that is sometimes only few times more massive than our Jupiter). I know that a bigger database would take longer to load etc., but since nobody is able to wiev more than a cuple of systems away (+allied line of sight) that shouldnt be a problem.\n\nAnyway with 250 000 players it would leave a LOT of space to explore if only we would have made it a lot more systems ... actually if every solar system (or \"something else\") would be generated randomly and added to the database on the discovery, there could be from 100 000 or 10 000 000 ponts on the map depending only on the players activity and how stron would their explorers insting be , what makes it impossible to explore and explore and explore more? I'll tell You ... not the star count, because there can be NO limits at all, but a limited immagination. We would only have to figure out a good system to locate players in the galaxy in a way that would maximize the space able to be explored. That's all\n\nLetsOk, but what if there are moons with atmosphere dense enough to breathe by some races? What if there is a race that needs no atmosphere? That's once again only a matter of our immagination, and using OUR sun as an example is pointless. Why? Becaause our sun is relatively one of the smaller suns in the galaxy. A lot of suns are much more massive, brighter and just bigger. In other words: there is a high possibility that more than 10 planets or maybe 15 is pretty common in the universe.\n\nNow only using OUR solar system as an example there are 8 planets : 2 capable to be colonised by \"human like race\". 2 extremely hot to be colonised by an alien race that can adapt to the conditions. 2 ice planets to be used by another alien race, And let's say 6 to 8 moons that are big enough to be colonised by a robotic race that does not need any atmosphere or sunlight. That makes 12 to 14 spots where an alien race can start it's colonisation (human are aliens for all that they call aliens themselves, right ? ). That's not realistic? That's very realistic, and almost every scientist working on possible aliens and their typed will tell You: a chance that an alien race develops on a similar planet and evolwes into a race anyhow close to human race is EXTREMELY LOW.100 to 200 players ? I'm not sure if thats not to much anyway. It would be pretty much like starting multiple game servers for the same game, that takes place on a single planet. I fear that 90% of the games trade and social life would end up in only one planet, or max in one solar system. Other solar systems would NEVER really interact because there would be so many players in one, that multiple wars would take place ony in that single solar system keeping everyone busy. I fear that it would just kill the whole traveling aspect of the game, because nobody would really move ... what for? All his enemies and alies are on just 2 planets ... why a player like that would ever move? Yeah ... he would send a fleet or two to get more exp and find alien techs, but everything else would be on that single one planet.\n\nIfReally ? We don't need to set any upper limit to make players occupy nax 5 or 6 planets. This could be limited by slowly growing levels. First levels are obtained quickly, but after a while it gets harder and hader. It works like that: If a players main planet is lvl 1 it can't rule any colonies, if it has a lvl of 2 it can controll one colony, lvl of 4 is 2 colonies, lvl 8 for 3 colonies , lvl 16 for 4 colonies, lvl 32, lvl 64 ... in theory every player can get up to 100 or 1000 colonies, but how long would he jave to play? 20 years? 50 years?\n\nDavid: i know thats a bit different form the fleet idea, but it's purpose is the same ... limiting without limits\n\nI agree with David in that, instead of having hundreds of thousands of populated star systems, the more we reduce that number the better. Then we can have a universe of endless size, but with only a handful of populated star systems, it will make the galaxy feel very unexplored. Even if we have 10 million players, at 100 players per planet, that's 100,000 planets; and at 8 planets per star systems, that's 12,500 star systems as opposed to the 1,250,000 star systems we would require if each of the 10 million players owned an entire planet.\n\nAnother issue of 1 player per planet is that, once a lot of players are accumulated, everybody will become very scattered, which will be a severe disadvantage were we to include storylines. (That's a subject for a different discussion.)"

      "text": "So my group started using the Navis Primer for warp travel and such. Our luck died at the end of our last session where we got stuck in warp transit for an approximate 275 days. Then, lo and behold, we got spat out 5 years in the past where my friends Explorator hasn't left his Forge World yet and my Astropath is currently on Terra. So many options but overall, we're screwed+1It isn't their proximity to their \"time ancestors\", but rather proximity to the Imperium itself.\n\nTime travel is tricky business, and the Imperium (and likely Ordo Chronos, depending on who you ask - they've \"disappeared\", but I wouldn't be so sure) is probably rather paranoid about the possible effects of said Time Travel. Add to that the effect that none of their positions or whereabouts, possible assignments, and so on - they just don't add up. The Astropaths can have no contact with the Adeptus Astra Telepathica (at least no contact that may end in someone wanting to verify who they are), because there's probably Astropaths in the crew that hasn't even been assigned yet. For all we know about the scenario presented, the Rogue Trader may not even be holding his Warrant of Trade (yet). And just forget about contacting your Dynasty, since that would instantly screw with the damn timeline.\n\nAnd your Profit Factor? All those assets? Forget about calling on them. They're just not there. Yet.\n\n5 years.. that's rough as hell.\n\nI'd go far, far away from the Imperium for about 5 years. Just lie low as hell. Take your crew, visit some minor planets, stock up on supplies, and find some small settlement or uninhabited world, just stick around there for a few years - 5 or so. When push comes to shove, 5 years isn't all that much. You could look at it as an opportunity to start a new colony somewhere. Set up a geostationary voidstation in the Expanse, for repairs and resupplying. Find a remote enough location and you don't have to worry about much more than possibly dark eldar pirates or something.\n\n\"It's never too late to panic.\" ~ Popular Valhallan folk saying\n\nSince so many seem to have trouble understanding Technology, Machine SpiritsMechanicus: Link.\n\n'ordo chronos' never heard of them (no pun intended here) but I like the ring to that.\n\nThere are however a couple of 'softening' circumstances.\n\n- first off, communication within the empire is slow so its reasonably safe to say that NO ONE has an up to date overview of who actually is an official RT, these warrants will be in flux constantly and it may take years for them to get updated at hubs. Granted within the sector where you got your warrant and where the house operates things are likely more up to date, but even then it might take a year or so for it to get updated.\n\n- given that, the second question is: how many times does a RT actually have to show her warrant? Usually trade is done in the name of house X and the presence and official documents of ownership concerning the 'to trade good' are usually enough. That and in the sector if you start more emphasis on exploring you will encounter new planets anyway and you can colonize those.\n\n- You should however indeed be weary to entre places like the Solomon planet of administration or Port Wander. Footfall however… who cares, they mainly be looking at the size of your gun and the air of your chin.\n\n- As for astropaths… fair point, so hire new ones, might be a bit tricky but hell you're still a RT\n\n-Assets… also good point, but the house WILL have had assets 5 years ago, you SHOULD have the documentation of these…but…trading them might indeed seriously screw up the timeline. There are however also intangible assets e.g. blackmail, status, favors etc which you know have not been called in for the past/future 5 years by your time ancestors so you can call them in now.\n\nAs for 'timeline screwing' itself, here there are choices to be made into which theory you follow. The 'best' IMO is the one where Terminator (movie) is base on and IRC Primer as well. This Simply assumes that as soon as you travel back in time you create a new time-line which, if you were to do absolutely nothing, will *look* very similar to the one you already lived in (but is different altogether). Its called a N type (based on the form of the letter:\n\n| originally time path\n\n/ (this forum does not allow the backslash) travelling back in time\n\n| again travel the same time distance\n\ncreating a time travel that looks like N also showing that the first | and the second | are NOT the same.\n\nHopefully one of the characters kept a journal of where they went and what you did so you could avoid yourselves. Things you could do are:\n\nGo deep into the expanse and see what profits you can make there\n\nChange your name and retag your ship to assume another identity all together (GM could allude to a rogue trader doing big business that you heard of but never met)\n\nSecretly help yourself out by hiding out until your group gathers and then create conditions favorable to your past selves(sabotage a trader you know you need help from and your group can easily help him out, attack a base before your group would have to, go recover loot you couldn't get to, kill a rival before he would have screwed you, ect.)\n\nleave a note to tell your past selves those were the droids you were looking for\n\nI might not be familiar with canon material regarding time travel in the WH40k universe, but I don't understand the reaction of, \"OMG! Stay Far Away from the Imperium!\" Five years is not a long time in the lives of people who can live to be 600-700 years old, so staying away wouldn't be a big deal, regardless. You could just have it occur out-of-session too. The next time you meet to play just have 5 years as passed, and make cosmetic changes; everyone's a bit older and fatter, etc. This might be an opportunity for your GM to start a radically new set of endeavors or to run the campaign on an entirely new tack.\n\nWhen I put myself in the boots of a rogue trader in this situation, I think: \"Hey I just won an extra ship, fully stocked crew, a new family member who thinks just like I do and a physical back-up of my warrant of trade!\" I would try to find that person and stop at nothing to make an immediate alliance. 'Double your money and power overnight!\n\nIf you can't trust yourself to have your own back, who can you trust?\n\nThis gives me all sorts of adventure / endeavor ideas:\n\nParty learns that their past selves were killed / destroyed after they entered the warp trip, which lead to their time travel; paradox solved! Now the explorers may set out to discover what happened to their old selves and maybe salvage what's left of the party or their assets. Maybe they find their old selves in a coma (wounded or otherwise). These \"old selves\" might be placed in stasis fields to be \"thawed out\" when the explorers are killed, a great way to justify Fate point burn off for surviving an impossible situation, like a destroyed void ship. How do they have such great memories? The party seneschal kept an excellent adventure journal! Maybe they could even divert the situation that lead to their destruction?\n\nDispense clues to some future adventure / endeavor: the Explorer(s) suddenly recall being approached by a stranger in a market a few years ago who gave them dire warnings, which if they did not heed they would surely be destroyed. \"I though he was a mad man; I'd nearly forgotten the whole thing! But . . .It all makes sense now! He did look awfully familiar!\"\n\nUse this to justify a sudden, unexpected surge in Profit Rating; \"A few years ago the dynasty received a servo skull with instructions to invest in certain holdings. It seemed like a ridiculous long shot at first, so we just put a few thousands thrones into it. Couldn't hurt, right? Well, if we had known of the resultant windfall we would have put the entire family's fortune behind it! I wish I knew who sent us that servo skull, I'd like to build him a statue. . .\"\n\nThe explorers of the past are caught in \"warp loop\" caused by the time travel incident, which leads to their being trapped in the immaterium (while the time traveled explorers did not). When they finally escape, they are hopelessly insane having spent decades lost to the Warp. Their only wish is to find and destroy the time-shunted explorers, the current party, which they somehow believe will end their torment.\n\nLook at the new Star Trek relaunch that came out in 2009. Time travel is a story-telling opportunity by which you can tell all new stories with well-known characters. Don't be afraid.\n\nLet him who is with sin cast the first plasma bolt. - WarmasterPicklehauber\n\nI should have elaborated further. There's basically a page report in intot he storm about a navy ship that came out of the warp before it had even left the dockywards. There was no record of this ship on the imperium's rolls so naturally they were detained. The Admech and Church portions of the crew were remanded to their patron organzations. The captain went into Inquisition custody and the common ratings and officers were executed by spacing.\n\n5 Years isn't presumably as big a deal but it still is going to cause some problems. The default assumption if they linger in the imperium itself is going tob e they are imposters, especially in areas as heavily patrolled and regulated as major shiping lanes and port wander. Going out into the backwater will help considerably. Going out into the expanse is even better. The further you get from the maw the safer you are. Also they've got a problem if their their warrant is of a very recent vintage as they've suddenly got a post dated warrant. If they have an older warrant they could stay in the imperium as long as they go somewhere far from where their current selves are located.\n\nAll this is based on the Imperium's natural paranoia and inflexible nature about irregularities. If there is actually a concerted effort by shadowy powers within the inquisition to protect the timeline then they've got even bigger problems.\n\nPersonally I would go for black ops. Deep dark and covert. I would begin setting up events to stay hidden but culminate in the 5 years that would ultimately aid in what ever endeavor the time travel so rudely interrupted. The key things would be it has to stay secret and it has to have no effect on the timeline till you catch upIf I were your DM I'd rule that entering the warp in the same place and the same time produces the same result, and you're now in the past again, along with your past selves.\n\nDon't forget that it's not only about you. You have a crew of at least 10,000 - possibly many, many more. I don't know the nature of your crew compliment. If they're all basically void-born and have lived generations aboard that ship, sure, fair enough, there won't be many problems.\n\nBut even amongst a fairly solid crew with their homes with them, there's possibly thousands of workers that were just signing on for a single trip, or have families elsewhere, or were hitching a ride from point A to B, hitchhiking through the galaxy. There could be workers that send their earnings home to far-away relatives and whatnot.\n\nWhat about them? You, the maybe 20 or so senior officers, career folk with your families aboard - there's no problems for you. You can kill your former selves, screw them over, you have no attachments that are dependant on temporal causality or space-time location. But out of the tens of thousands that are working for you, I bet there's at least several hundred that do, if not thousands.\n\n\"It's never too late to panic.\" ~ Popular Valhallan folk saying\n\nSince so many seem to have trouble understanding Technology, Machine SpiritsMechanicus: Link."

The PC has a knack for raining fire upon large ships which tend not to shoot as much is broken. I like the concept of heavy fire vs light spit fire, and you have to find a balance between heavy hitters or a large amount of light fire. Try making the large ships have more health and hit harder. This should help balance it out a bit more.\nTo prove my point try building a ship, and on the count where it gains its seventh light upgrade, release it. you will win the game.\n\nUnder rating threshold (hideshow)\nSorry but with my message: AI aiming is terrible...\nI really have meant aiming! The problem is the calculation where to shot to get a moving target even when it continues to move... In your game it is broken and not logical. They miss because choosing an angle which is out of any sense... Just look at very old games like Wing commander or such and you know what i mean... I know it is hard to balance a game with so many possible units, but in fact there is no relation between time spend and miss rate... I understand to strategical term and aiming sure follows a programmed code, but still the result is far away of being, lets say \"finished\"...\n\nUnder rating threshold (hideshow)\nHaving ships fire if they have line of fire to any enemy ship and not just the one they were targeting would be good. Also have targeting based on angle of approach and not proximity would be an improvement. And either have ships be unable to loop around or shots do and simply fade after a distance.\n\nActually, you might notice the larger ships fire less rounds more often, and the smaller shoot more rounds less often. This was sort of a way to add some strategy. Now I could make it where the ships rarely miss, but I'm not sure how well that would work into game play.\n\nUnder rating threshold (hideshow)\nOkay, I like the idea of generating ai ships to do combat but as it is the game is far TOO simple. I don't mean that you should make it complicated but the player needs something to do rather than watch their ships circle the enemy ones endlessly.\nPerhaps adding a different method of choosing your ships. Maybe a resource that accumulates and then a menu to buy them from so that players have more control of what type and when they release their ships.\nAlso the AI needs some tweaking. I found that groups of ships often get locked into each other's \"orbits\". Maybe the ability to select specific enemy ships to be the target. Alternately perhaps AI parameters that the player can vary the level of or a handful of preset configurations (e.g. target strongest, weakest, line of sight... etc.)\nI think there is a lot of potential here but right now this just isn't that"

That is one the main reasons I tend not to use them.\n\nI would have done it for 5.033, as I know that a lot of people don't use them mostly for interface rather than stat reasons, but having them have separate points for \"this is where I'm going\" and \"this is where stuff I'm building should go\" is a pretty major change under the hood and I just don't have time to implement and test that right now. And if it broke a bunch of stuff now is not a great time to have to stop working on AVWW for a couple hours to fix a critical AIW bug\n\nThe main method of use I was seeing in the enclave starships with current mechanics is bringing them to the planet I'm attacking, parking them either in a beachhead area or off near the edge of the inner grav well ring, in FRD mode, and putting them on loop build of whatever I felt I could/should afford to loop build for that battle.\n\nI mean, if blade spawners are OP, what about Enclaves producing FRD cutlasses? Or vampire claws? Imagine how you'd feel if the AI had blade spawners that produced cloaked blades (chemical_art appears to have the idea)\n\nOut of curiosity: what happens when you have a rally post on the planet with the enclave starship?\n\nI'm okay with the present Enclave controls for now, they're very Zerg-like for FRD'ing everywhere. Would imagine that enclaves will be a bit OP in the next patch. I did end up with both cutlasses and vampires in one game, and well, cutlasses outperform vampires in most duties as well as being spammable from enclave starships.\n\nAny unit with 1 second build time is essentially spammable and OP from enclaves... *cough*\n\nI've actually already done the zerg idea before, after the cutless but before the vampire buff. Here's how it would go with the current tactics.\n\nThe key is that you need both cutlesses and vampires. Shredders are better suited for defense because with their mechanics so you can't spam build them because most of the time you are already over the cap. So instead for that reason you want vampires and cutlasses.\n\nThe cutlasses are the tanks and general damage dealers. They are fast, cheap, tankish, and oh so many. They take up the vast majority of the ai's time because even before the enclave buff they are made quickly. Now it will be hilarious.\n\nThe vampires are sneaky. They are cloacked to right when they smash the ai. So the ai will be firing upon the cutlasses as they decloak, so the distraction combined with their vampirism means they don't die. But they will eat some of the shots so the cutlasses alone don't get overwhelmed.\n\nTogehter, the only thing they fear are forts and gravity. Hence why in my desired game you want a super long range weapon too. Sentinel frigates, snipers, or bombards work.\n\nThe only shame is right now in the lower caps the vampires suck because so many units are over the 1m health mark. So I can't make us of that tactic.\n\nCan the 1M health immunity to vampires and shredders please be changed to scale with unit caps, so it increases with decreasing caps?\n\nRight now on ultra-low caps I think MK III triangle ships go over 1mil health. So in essence by mid game most units are immune to vampires/shredders, and by late game 95% of the ai is.\n\nWhat was the reason for the 1 million health immunity to melee? Seems so randomly arbitrary, almost like a quick-fix.\n\nIt's not immunity to all melee, but only certain types of melee, fusion cutters. I can think of only two units that have fusion cutter attacks, vampire claws and Z viral shredders. Notice how both of these have mechanics tied to HP of damage inflicted. This rule was put into place to prevent high HP units from becoming \"farms\" for viral shredders and \"practically infinite health sinks\" for vampires. With the Z viral shredder nerf making the penalty to reproduce count all shredders of that mark and not just ones on the same planet (and I still think that the 4x per cap is too high), this rule might not be needed anymore. The the \"practically infinite health sinks\" of the vampire claws can be solved by just throwing more firepower at them (enough that rate of the health they are regaining starts falling behind the rate they are taking damage). This is especially true if neither of these ships types have very high hull type bonuses (which IIRC, at the time this change was made, they did have same crazy high bonuses, now they don't, so it isn't as big of an issue anymore)\n\nI still think the split should stay, so we can have continue to \"levels\" of melee immunity.\n\nYeah, I tried Nanoswarms and loved them every time. Just FRD them in, send the rest of the fleet through and then collect your 50 new ships. Not to mention everything being paralyzed. Cutlasses, Vampires and Nanoswarms it is, sounds like a fun game. Just need to decide on caps setting, since it seems that my usual Ultra-Low wouldn't exactly mesh well with this strategy.\n\nWith the current state of affairs, I don't think the arbitrary system of health is needed.\n\nShredders, as pointed out, do not farm anymore because of the expodential costs for caps. Farming is still possible, but its farming in general, not being tied the hp directly.\n\nFor the vampires, I think high health has the opposite. When the vampire attacks a small health unit, it kills it quickly, reducing fleet battle dps more rapidly and allowing the masses of vampires to concentrate attacks on a smaller group. There is no real lag time in team fights because all the targets are bunched anyway. When it whacks larger targets it takes longer for the vampires to concentrate fire and attack (if not microed). The only theory I can see to why you'd ban the vampires is because you'd have them be able to attack the same target 30x before it dies as opposed to 10x, but as I pointed out earlier in large fleet battles it doesn't take more then half a second before its attacking at full speed again.\n\nIn conculsion, I feel like the limit nerfs shredders and vampires a little on normal and above, and really hard for us who use low caps or worst. If the limit was determined to still be needed, it should be on the ships themselves and not on their given health. So starships and buildings and super low cap fleetships could be banned, but others are left alone.\n\nI agree with chemical_art. I think some things that might be getting the 1 million health immunity to Fusion Cutters might need that immunity added anyway (if they don't have it already). Because Vampires able to attack Home Command Stations would be very bad."

      "text": "Sergeant: Shouldn't have Command, Scholastic Lore (Tactica Imperialis) or Air of Authority. Sergeants are usually raised from amongst the rank and file who either proved themselves through bravery or just living longer than everyone else. Skills like Intimidate make more sense for them and talents that revolve around survival or team work (team up anyone?). Skills like command and talents like Air of Authority should be left for an Officer specialty not a NCO class. You can save yourself lots of work by changing the specialty to Officer and not that it covers both commissioned and non commissioned officers.\n\nOgryn: Should be a homeworld not a specialty. Just with a narrow specialty options (such as Heavy Gunner only)\n\nRatling: Should be a homeworld not a specialty. Just with a narrow specialty options (such as specialist only)\n\nSpecialties should be placed after the creation/advancement rules so you read how it works before you read what you can be. It's an esthetic thing that's all.\n\nSkills: Much like there is a dodge and parry skill, I am a big fan of making weapon talents into skills. So you use have your BS/WS if unskilled, your full WS/BS if trained and gain the +10, +20 and +30 as with normal skills (and perhaps even the talented talent for +10 more). Or you can do blanket skills like Shoot (BS) and Strike (WS).\n\nTalents: Lightning attack should go back to the Dark Heresy styles as should Swift Attack.\n\nI think you are defining \"command\" too narrowly. It is more leadership and making people accept your authority and so do what you tell them. Sounds perfect for a Sergeant (and an officer, though the actual way of expressing it may be different). It doesn't matter the size of the group. And remember, they affect a number of people equal to their Fellowship bonus (unless they have the relevant talents), so its not like they \"command\" a huge number. Now maybe they shouldn't get Tactica Imperialis, but personally I don't have a problem with it being a specialty to allow you to make both officers and sergeants (even if technically it is just called Sergeant). Two different leadery classes doesn't make much senseSpecialities being placed before character creation seems fine to me. Makes the players think about what they are going to be before seeing which is \"the best\".\n\nIf you want a return of the old Lightning Attack etc, then parry should no longer be a skill. Allowing it to get to +40 (or even 50) over WS makes it too good, unless you have the need to negate multiple hits from DoS. I personally prefer the old DH way of doing it myself, but you have to choose one system or the other, not bits of both.\n\nMaking Weapon Talents into skills is also messes around with things. That gives another +30 on top of the already generous bonuses that can be grabbed from all over the placeFrom what I can see from the main GW sources, most Abhumans are full Imperial citizens. Only beastmen and similar are subject to official restrictions. The idea that there is officially sanctioned discrimination against all Abhumans seems to have no 'cannon' support - please reference it if you find it. Obviously it's not an unreasonable assumption, but the Imperium being an aparteid society isn't the GW position - I stand to be corrected on this.\n\nThe IG codex only mentions Ratlings as snipers, but reading this as a hard limit is an over-reading imo. Ratlings might make excellent gunners on fixed emplacements or on aircraft. They might make good pilots. Modifying controls or given them MUIs isn't beyond imagining. Why not a Ratling medic? An Imperial Governor with a 50% Ratling population might wish to fill as many positions as possible with Ratlings.\n\n1.) I don't think that reducing the points is going to work. I'd want more randomness. Doing away with the points, and adding numbers from 1-00 for rolling.\n\n2.) Heavy Gunner should've had +5 BS, after all you want to hit things.\n\n3.) I disagree with this, Sgt are from the ranks but they are leaders. If you watch any war film you always have the tough ass Sgt that barks orders when needed. I do believe renaming it to NCO, allowing ranking up rather than just being Sarg.\n\n4.) I agree specialist should at least be specializing instead of generalizing.\n\n8.) I see STs as grenadiers the toughest and best armored person on the squad.\n\n9.) Agreed\n\n10.) Agreed\n\n11.) That'd be nice.\n\n12.) Eh, they're fine as is. Skills do need to have a \"b\" on the character sheet to determine which skills at basic\n\n13.) I like Swift Attack & Lighting attack working like S-A & FA.\n\n14.) So far you can't learn new ones, but it'd be nice to do so.\n\n15.) Sgt should be NCO, We don't need a scout but specialist could be the scout, Technician is a companion, Grunts aren't needed they're NPCs your playing specialists people who're worth mor to the guardso why do they have a whole melee weapon arsenal dedicated to them specificly and start out with a best quality low-tec weapon?\n\nof course they have STR as an aptitude, because psykers are known for their bodybuilding heritage.\n\nso it makes more sense for them to get the STR aptitude then a WS aptitude?\n\njust to hit… so i guess in their training sessionsI mean they buff using psychic powers. Instead of relying on sheer strength or skill they prepare themselves mentally. Abilities like Iron Arm or Warp Speed replace any need for straight WS or Str advances. As far as Swift Attack/Lightning Attack, well… Swift Attack is cheap enough to buy on its own. Sure, its still alot of XP, but its not unreasonable.\n\nHeck, even invisibility is useful.\n\nAlso, where are your psykers magically getting their force weapons from? Its not really something covered in \"training.\"\n\nso it makes more sense for them to get the STR aptitude then a WS aptitude?\n\njust to hit… so i guess in their training sessionsIn their training sessions they meditate, train in focusing their minds, learn rites of protection, recite chants of abjuration and generally learn how not to be the cause of a daemonic invasion. In fact, most don't see a psychic weapon in their whole lives, so it's unlikely they give them such a rare weapon during their training. They'd likely blow themselves up."

      "text": "I am going to go out on a limb and assume you are not looking for an answer based on role playing or lore.\n\nThat said, the import and export taxes mechanic regulates the on going cost to produce your PI items. Your costs are therefore fixed and predictable. Without it, PI would be practically \"free\" after the initial expenditure on facilities and thus valueless.\n\nYou should thank CCP that they choose to regulated the costs of running your chain with taxes instead of say..POS fuel. (shudder) Imagine having to load isotopes and heavy water into your command center every couple of days. Also imagine that each different type of command center used different types of isotopes You think the click fest is bad now?\n\nDoing anything in a wormhole is already a logistical nightmare. Be careful what you ask for. PAY YOUR TAXES, AND LIKE IT!\n\nIf they ever made a change away from taxes it would most likely be to a system that required fuel for you factory. Your costs then become variable based on market and probably require multiple types of fuel based on your planet type (knowing CCP). YOU DO NOT WANT THIS!\n\nThinking of it, I wish they would extend the import/export tax feature to running a POS for moon mining and reaction chains instead of POS fuel.\n\nVisit your POS once every few weeks in an empty hauler, export moon goo, pay a tax, and go home.\n\nHere's a compromise. Take away the taxes, but randomly have some of your pins/links destroyed by some of the annoyed Sleeper population who aren't getting anything out of you (tenderly loving) their planets.\n\nNo reason why you can't have some sort t3 (wh space) hauler that only works in WH's (letís say due to some spatial effect in w-space) that can deploy, shoot down / receive from the planet... and then undeploy and haul. To prevent a new hauler, it can be limited to pos / planet only (if youíre in a WH doing PI odds are you have a pos and the coding may be their as freighters can do stuff with cargo at a pos but not in space)\n\nThank you all for answering my question so fast. However I have to clarify that I'm not against the actual tax, the problem that I have is that is not consistent with the whole eve universe. I just don't see how a tax gets levied on an uncharted part of the universe,and for that matter how can there be even a customs office. I just don't believe CCP thought out a good explanation for it. I guess you could say you are paying the tax to the people that inhabit that particular world, but then how do you explain the tax on uninhabitable planets? Also, it would actually make sense, and be interesting to see, if CCP would implement mobile COs for those uncharted parts of the universeIf you want a RP interpretation, taxes is a misnomer, it is a transportation cost. Every time you send something in orbit or bring something from orbit to the planet you incur in a cost as you use up fuel, need to ready a rocket/drop capsule, pay people to load it and so on.\n\nEven in a WH you will still pay those costs.\n\nSame thing for the custom office. It should have been a orbital station.\n\nCCP has chosen the simplest way using 1 station for each planet instead of multiple station(surely a good choice against lag), one for each colony.\n\nBut using 1 station for multiple characters in multiple corporations require them to tag it as a \"neutral\" station, not one linked to the corp of the first guy building a launchpad on the planet.\n\nA potentially good addition in the future iteration of PI would be sovereignty linked custom stations with the possibility of a corp tax and sov discount for 0.0 but I doubt we will see them.\n\nAnother, simple fix would be to change the name of the cost from tax to a transport costsThink about this: you need fuel to move items from and to the planet, so you are paying for that fuel. Who are you actually paying? Well, the people working in the custom office and in your factory/labs/command center/launchpad on the planet (who did you think is doing all that work? magic? )\n\nNow a good question could be: who onlined all the custom offices in wormhole space\n\nI reckon that PI taxes for Wormhole based PI customs offices should be payable to the corp that holds POS or \"tentative sovereignty\" in that particular wormhole. If some loose sovereignty mechanic could happen for wormhole systems based on whoever holds the highest number of POSes in there, corps could even tax non-member friends for access to \"their\" planets, more passive income? Dumb idea, or?\n\nOriginally by:AviamondCan anybody explain to me why there are planetary taxes in WH space? It makes no sense to have import and export taxes on Planets that reside inside a WH. Who are we paying those taxes?\n\nCCP did not have time to think of a mechanic to deal with export/import of goods in PI that would take non empire/WH areas of space into account. Personally, I would do away with customs offices and make command centres orbit planets to be used in a similar way to customs offices. Taxes would be taken using sec status as a multiplier, so sec 0.0= no tax 1.0 = the normal tax rate. I am sure they will start to thinking about how to fix it in 18-24 months timedear god the tears are just streaming down your face\n\nif you hate the game so much, unsub your accounts and stop posting your drivel\n\nThis thread is older than 90 days and has been locked due to inactivity."

      "text": "About Me\n\nFriday, April 6, 2012\n\nGoons: enhancing our game, destroying the game\n\nThe Goon motto is \"Goonswarm is not here to destroy the game, but your game.\" The burn Jita event is one of their latest action in that. At first I did not even understand how could their idea to blockade Jita make any effect. I mean you can mine ice where the ice is, but you can trade on any stations, and while Jita is convenient, it has nothing that makes it essential. I assumed that people will simply trade somewhere else nearby and the Goons will not shoot down anything but lost newbies who can't read the news, so the event will not fail but drown in boredom as Goons will spend all day in a Tornado, doing nothing, their all day killmails will contain a dozen lowbie ships.\n\nI still think that their event holds no danger to the trade or smart players and their killmails will only contain lost newbies, morons, slackers. However I'm now convinced that it won't be in dozens, but in thousands. Actually they can shoot down so many ships that they run out of Tornados in a day or two.\n\nThis is good news for us. Remember that the traders biggest competition is the \"i farmd for free lol\" moron, who does not purchase services, but do it himself much-much less effectively or undercuts with items he farmed with terrible amount/hour. The Goons now make us the favor of exterminating them. When they finally run out of ships, declare themselves victorious and go home, we will be stronger than ever as our trivial competition is down. Gallepirratlulz will no longer pollute my Logistics book profit by the single books he bought 10 systems away and transported here in his laser fitted Dominix, since he lost that thing to a Goon Tornado. More profit for me.\n\nEverything that make the game harsh, dangerous, widen the gap between those who can and those who can't. We can asses the risks and avoid it, so we'll even make profit on the event. Those who \"play for fun\" will fall. Long live the Goons!\n\nExcept the \"play for fun\" won't linger defeated, ripped from all his wealth. He'll quit the game. I repeat what I wrote, the griefers are the sole obstacle between EVE online and blockbuster success. Profitable pirates don't really matter here as the morons and slackers don't have anything that worth pirating. If CCP let the Goons massacre the idiot who transports a single Logistic book in his Dominix, thinking that 1M profit is good money for 2x10 jumps, the bad players will leave in masses.\n\nRemember, 80% of the players never leave high sec and something tells me that they aren't station traders or haulers. Rather mission runners and cruiser-miners who want to farm for some \"awsom ship\". Another 10-15% are consensual PvP-ers. They do the same except they go for some reachable ship and every week or two they team up, have a roam to kill random people and feel like PvP gods. Then they lose their ship, reiterate that \"we had fun lol\" and go farm more. None of these are up for non-consensual PvP and that's exactly what the Goons are bringing in. The result will be exactly the same when Blizzard made the \"scourge invasion\" event in WoW. People stopped logging in and raged on the forums as they were too dumb even to relocate to Silvermoon or whatever-named-goat city which were unaffected. And in WoW they lost nothing but the ability to do something now. No property was lost. I know that EVE players keep telling themselves that they are better than WoW players, but my 300M/day income strongly disagrees.\n\nHere the interest of me and the Goons is directly conflicting with the interests of CCP. We don't want morons and slackers (pubies they call them) in the game. CCP wants. The difference between The Mittani and me is that I'm capable of recognizing this and properly responding, he can't. That guy still thinks that he can defeat CCP in its own game. CCP is not another alliance ingame, they are gods here. They could delete every ship of the Goonswarm with a few clicks. Messing with gods don't pay. I learned it the hard way (in short: I figured out how to kick bad players from an open WoW battle, therefore greatly increasing our win chance. Blizzard removed the option instantly to prevent bad players from being kicked). The Mittani don't just want to mess with gods, he wants to wage war on them. Seems his removal of CSM, forcing to write apologies and banning for 30 days did not teach him who's the boss here.\n\nCCP will somehow protect its bad players from being massacred. Has to. However they are indeed in a bad situation as outside the game they are not at all gods. They are a publisher company who has to serve paying customers: us. The selling point of EVE is the competitive environment. The announcement of \"EVE turned to space WoW\" would cause them lot of lost subscribers and not just Goons. I quit playing WoW as an MMO, I'll just consume new content when available and unsubscribe until another bunch of content is published. CCP can't even hope on that as they don't have storyline content. They can lose their selling point by making PvP actions impossible.\n\nWhat can they do to protect their bad players from Goon massacre without losing their selling point? In the short notice of April 28 no major overhaul is possible, but they still have options:\n\nIncrease the security status of Jita to 1.0. There are already such systems, many directly next to it, why not Jita? This way the Concord can respond even faster, increasing the costs of ganking. They could also tune up Concord to throw in more ships, making sure that even a destroyer can't fire two volleys.\n\nIncrease the strength of the faction polices. They fire on everyone below -5 security status just for being in empire space. They already capable of calling reinforcements. Tune up these reinforcements. If the faction police can't clear the system in 5 minutes, it calls battleships. If they can't kill everyone with -5 sec status in 10 mins, time for the Caldari Navy to drop some Leviathans.\n\nPlant some more sentry guns\n\nWarn players of this event in a popup window on the loading screen and in official news. Maybe the Concord could send a mass-evemail too.\n\nOn the long term, some more permanent solution is needed that protect both interests of CCP: to provide a stress-free environment to bad players and retain the highly competitive nature of EVE. My solution is simple: high sec is almost completely safe and completely poor. The first part is tricky as we want to protect newbies and bad players, not idiots who autopilot a frigate with 20B inside. My suggestion: security status can only be increased by paying to the Concord (they should have \"fundraiser for the good cause\" agents in lowsec), about 500M to offset the effect of a kill. You can't just rat yourself up, so suicide gankers will only jump on fat targets and ignore the losers and newbies.\n\nThe second part would mean removing L4 missions, incursions, wormholes, archeology and hacking sites, battlecruiser and above rats from highsec and ban the usage of miner modules besides Miner I (environmental protection). This way anyone who choose to be a \"high-sec carebear\" would be able to play safely forever but would be so poor that no serious player would choose this way. Since the bad players are uninformed, they wouldn't even know that the 3M/hour they get for running L3 securities or mining veldspar with an Osprey is a joke and would be proud of their achievement of getting an empty Navy Raven hull after a month.\n\nAn interesting comment was addressed to me on Syncaine's blog: \"In WoW you have been battling the M&S endlessly, you've lead\nganking campaigns against the Ensidia fanboys on Magtheridon, you've\ncampaigned against bots, you've ran a herb interdiction, you've ran\ncomplicated and evil (for wow standards) metagaming schemes in BGs and\nTol Barad, and you even wanted to deny BH to the horde for a week after\n4.2 launched. You've ran mail and chatlog 'porn' sections on your blog.\nAnd you dreamed of the day when MMOs would be liberated from all M&S. ... Honestly I was expecting you to be in Goonswarm or some other\ncriminal outfit, robbing morons blind, organising mass campains, and\ncoming up with evil metagaming schemes for domination of all space.\"\n\nThis question is good enough to get a blog post level answer:\nI want two things: first I want the smart and hard working to stop being compassionate towards the M&S. I want them to stop boosting them, attributing their failure to \"being new\" or \"being casual\" or \"being unlucky\". As there is no other way to defend against Jita gank than hiding, the losses of the M&S will only bring sympathy to them.\nSecondly I don't think that the M&S is beyond help. They are lazy and dumb because they can afford to be such. They are carried by welfare provided by the game developers (the state) and friendly helpful people (charity). In absence of these they would be broke. I want them to be poor and without status symbols. I want them to be, feel and be observed by peers as losers as only these things can force them to cut the bullshit and start doing something useful. I want them to reform and be better, no less than the worst leftists, I just strictly believe that the only tool that can make it happen is the whip. Goons don't want to change them, they just want them to suffer, die and disappear.\n\nBusiness report: 4.63B (0.3B gifts as gave another 100M to girlfriend, 3 PLEX behind for second account). A week ago I was at 2.5 (-0.4), so in a week I made 2.2B. Let me put this number into perspective. In a month I can buy 9 PLEX-es (-1 for second account). Or a more understandable way: if I'd choose to pilot titans, I could buy the materials for the hull and full set of faction fittings before I'd have the skills to use them.\n\nRemember that you can participate in our EVE conversations and soon group activities on the \"goblinworks\"\nchannel.\n\n19 comments:\n\nCelery Man\nsaid...\n\nJust a small note on the motivations behind the Goons attack on Jita - He announced that he planned on doing so as a celebration for getting 10 thousand votes in the CSM well before any of the drama happened. The motivations have undoubtedly changed, as has the scope of what they plan to do I'm sure, but just to be clear this was simply what the Goons do when they get happy and exited about something.\n\nThanks for the reply Gevlon. A few corrections (as always): - the Jita invasion was planed long before this whole suicidegate business. The first mention was in the victory update after the conquest of Branch, back in January. - this is not 'waging war' on CCP, but a shock-test to see how they react. But mainly it's epic, dynamic content at it's finest. You can't google the outcome or watch a tankspot video, nobody knows what will happen, goons included. It's a test for them as well. Plus, you can get in a combat ship and try to fight the goons, to defend your fellow bears. You you can join the goons. That's a better MMO moral choice than whether you want to give a rude or polite answer to some NPC, wouldn't you say? - they already know that you cannot get 2 shots in Jita, that's why Tornadoes are used in the first place. Concord is ineffective against alpha since they only attack after you have fired the first shot, and police can be evaded too, even at -10. Also, you can be sure all the tactics, mechanics will be theorycrafted and fully tested, and lots of preparations made, just like it was for the ice campaign. These people have been playing the game for years. - the Leviathan is the only titan that cannot blap subcapitals, due to the way missile mechanics work, just so you know. That's why you don't see them used by Raiden&co. Obviously CCP can hax whatever they want - that's what we'll find out. - Mittens has been playing the game, and dealing with CCP for years, spent months every year in Iceland discussing internet spaceships, intimately knows the devs and their culture, and several exgoons are CCP devs in high positions. Between you and him, I guess I'm going to go with Mittens. - Reballancing the risk/reward between high and null has been the holly grail of the Mittani and CSM since forever. It's currently the main sucking chest wound of eve. The other is nullsec stagnation, due to supercap imbalance, horrible SOV mechanics and the forementioned risk-reward thing, which has depopulated nullsec. That's why we run campaigns against hisec, there isn't anything else to do in null much. Fixing 0.0 would go a long way towards letting hisec bears leave in peace and love. - as for the broader 'gank the bears and they'll leave', I'll let Syncaine deal with it, as he never seems to tire of this. Oh, look, it's Friday already\n\n@Steel: I have no doubt that it's content and a real choice. I indeed wanted to get a \"combat\" ship to fight the Goons, but despite prioritizing it above all else I can't get into the hull before May 5. It was an Orca, fitted for 250K EHP, paraded front of the Goons after I publish some post telling that I'm transporting billions in the corporate hangar. Since Tornados can do one volley, to take down my Orca they would need to use 24 tornados (1.7B) while after insurance costs only 250M to me, which is one day income.\n\nHowever the point is exactly that while I'm capable making such choices, the bad players unaware of the choices themselves and everything seems to be an unstoppable disaster for them, so they leave.\n\nMost players tend to understand the Goons' motivations; iirc Bartlett categorizes about 30% of players as \"killers\". What I completely fail to understand is why CCP would indulge them. In particular, they are going to have a F2P console game through Sony.\n\nI can't see Sony executives or undecided console players being overly excited by true-EVE sorts of PR. And someone who has $0 invested in a game may not be willing to put up with much griefing. And CCP purchased two companies in two countries in order to do DUST.\n\nIf they let dozens of millions of dollars of development be dissipated because they can't reign in the players, then CCP, and their shareholders, are far bigger morons & slacker than any you have discussed.\n\nYou keep repeating the 80% number as the high sec population share. Latest numbers show it as 67%.\n\n\n\nWhile the supply constraints of EVE are impossible to pin down, I'd be very surprised if they can sustain an intense level of Tornado attacks for anything like a day. Thrasher and Catalyst attacks maybe.\n\nMore than likely, Jita space shuts down because of high population and allows no one to enter very early that day. Besides the Goons, there will be 10x their number of spectators/kill mail whores.\n\nYou make one false assumption - that Goons will attack with their main/alts and with BC/BS. Much more probable is that they wil make several 14 day free accounts and fit them with cheap destroyers - like hundreds of destroyers per account (or at least I would do it that way).\n\nIf someone have the free time - calculate how much destroyers would be needed to kill the same Orca and what is their cost compared to the cost of using Tornados.\n\n\"In the long term, I would like to see hisec itself become a realm of misery and fear. In the past two weeks as I have been murdering miners, I have found the average hisec dweller to be truly execrable. Imagine the worst iskmonger of the Northern Coalition, selling supercaps to the very people trying to destroy him, and then imagine that smug fuck protected from any and all risk by Concord. The most common insult I have seen in hisec is some trivial \"I'm richer than you\" wallet e-peen contest, as if any of them have riches from scrabbling at veldspar with their bloodied fingernails.\n\nPerhaps I've taken the Stalinist gimmick too close to heart, but this enrages me. It is my hope that through a combination of technetium, targeted strikes on bottleneck assets, and the service of Dread Pirates we can send these people into a paroxysm of misery.\"\n\nPoking for another grand philosophy post. Can you explain again what the difference between these is? Between PvE and PvP? Why, if this stuff is a bunch of scripted NPCs and bad voice acting it's epic lore and content, but if it's actually player driven and dynamic, it's grieving, asshatery, and bad community, and will drive players away? I know you have explained this a million times before, but I just can't get enough gevlonist phylosophy...\n\nThe Lich King was just talking about destroying Azeroth, but never actually left Icecrown citadel (not in the \"lore\" but in actual gameplay). He did not kill a single player who did not went to his room and pulled him.\n\nSame for the Shansas. If I don't explicitly pick a fight with them, they leave me alone. I can even come and go in incursion system, buying, selling, running distribution missions, mining and the Shansas won't come and gank me. I must actively go to a Vanguard to see one.\n\nRift tried \"PVE griefing\" and quickly nerfed it, exactly for this reason. M&S players must be left alone or they quit playing.\n\nThe difference of WoW and a good gameplay is NOT that in the latter they can be harmed. They should not be harmed if the publisher wants subscriber money. The difference is that in a good game the M&S can't win, can't parade in top ilvl items on whatever colored dragon.\n\nVanilla WoW was a good gameplay. Bad players could quest and farm unharmed on a PvE realm, but they couldn't get epics or even epic mounts. EVE should be the same: they can run crap missions and mine crap ore unharmed but shall never be flying a faction battleship or higher unless they learn to play.\n\n\"I know that EVE players keep telling themselves that they are better than WoW players, but my 300M/day income strongly disagrees.\"\n\nWow, seriously Gevlon? I was sure you were smarter than this. Do you have an understanding of even the basic precepts of economics?\n\nLet me ask you this: I presume that IRL you have a job. I further presume that in this job, you earn a solid income. Does this demonstrate that your employers/clients are somehow morons because they're part of an economy that generates income for you?\n\nOf course not. You make money IRL (and in Eve) because generating wealth is a natural function of any economy. Eve, as a consequence of its design, has a particularly robust economy, which means there are many opportunities for one to generate wealth. That doesn't mean the players of Eve are morons, it just means the economy is working as intended.\n\n1) Increasing the security status of Jita won't help. With the insane cycle time and alpha strike of tornadoes, you don't get a second shot in 0.9 space. A suicide ganker will quite literally be loading one round of faction ammo into each of my guns.\n\n2) Suicide ganking isn't new. There's been multiple hulkageddons, where people are rewarded for killing the maximum number of hulks. Suiciding L4 mission runners in pimped out CNR and similar (to scoop their dropped modules) has been going on since 2003. A bunch of bloodthirsty idiots descending on Jita for a weekend isn't more than a bump on the galactic plain.\n\n3) Your orca plan isn't likely to do any good, even if you could pull it off. Goonswarm is rich. Mining a technetium moon pulls in 100 units of the mineral per hour. Jita is currently at 146,615 ISK on technetium buy orders. This is 10.6 bn ISK per month, per moon. The goons have 50+ such moons. The point of the interdiction isn't to make money, or to be ISK-efficient. Indeed, it's designed to waste ISK in an amusing a way as possible.\n\n4) This Jita campaign was being openly discussed well before the post-fanfest shitstorm went down. It's not a result of CCP hastily reacting to the gaming media.\n\n5) Deklein is well-defended. The only major risk from everyone going and riding bikes in Jita for a weekend is roaming gangs shitting up the space for a couple of days. If someone were to launch a major invasion, VFK is only a pod-jump away, and I'm sure Pandemic Legion would be willing to let you know how successful their last attempt at headshotting it was.\n\nOut of curiosity: Ignoring real world economic considerations (= pve players leaving), would you like high-sec removed completly? That is: ffa pvp as soon as you undock without any npc force interacting?\n\nI think that in your blog you are forgetting a important thing, CCP's motivation and goal.\n\nCCP did things different with EVE online, they made a true sandbox and not a themepark. They have full PVP without any safe area's.\n\nEspecially if you look at subscriber graphs or login graphs it is clear that eve is different then the rest. Where other MMO's spike hard after an initial marketing blitz and then coast downwards until the product gets discontinued or put in maintenance only mode, EvE has actually seen a humble beginning with a steady growth over the last 9 years.\n\nThey are not aiming eve to be a common denominator, they have found a niche that is working for them and especially after last year they are focused to stay in that niche.\n\nCCP also has a culture of hiring from the player base. As some other commenter already hinted at, some prominent CCP members like CCP soundwave (lead game designer) and CCP skreegs (security team) are both ex-goons. Skreegs being a former CEO and soundwave a former director.\n\nThose are only the known employee's but there are many more, a common story employee's will state is that they where already eve players before getting hired.\n\nWhile it is obviously nothing more then speculation, I truly think that if CCP ever made a hard split and would say \"hi-sec is now a designated themepark with fun rides, and if you want sandbox go out into low or null or W space\" Eve wouldn't be eve any more, the economy would break, and a big chunk of the current players would probably slowly trickle away.\n\nEve is eve because space is cold uncaring and harsh. You have to make social connections to survive, to compete and to get stuff done.\n\nAnd that's the biggest part of eve anyway, the social aspect. Stories get made in eve because people interact with each other. That's the content.\n\nDoesn't matter if it's a lowsec FW alliance that kills a titan, or the goons who lay siege on Jita; Perhaps even a single player who decides to pour billions of ISK into dominating a certain market item.\n\nIt creates stories, unscripted events. Things we can experience and share. Even if that sounds a bit mushy, it's what eve is. Doing things that effect the world for everyone.\n\nAll mmo are theme parks because theme parks make the most money. The 67% that never leave high sec, and the 80% that never enter null sec shows how much of a theme park eve online really is. The fact that high sec even have security if the first place is certain that it is a theme park. The difference between this theme park and other theme park is that the slum (null sec) is nearby, and that law enforcement (concord) does not exist in this slum (null sec).\n\nGevlon wants to convert the slackers into more informed and better quality players. However, he knows that the morons are unchangeable, and it is not his task to convert these people into better players. His delusion is that he believes that he can convert all of them, even though he does not know which people are morons and which people are slackers. However, the more he tries, the more he can differentiate between the morons and slackers, and that he will see that morons will never change. Some people, on the other hand, believe that there are only morons and don't bother with trying to help others. Another group of players want to get rid of morons by the method called \"grieving,\" but that fails too, as the game company itself does not like the method of grief. Converting the slackers into able players is one thing, but trying to convert the morons is such an idiotic idea that only fools would continue to try to enlighten the morons.\n\n\"Vanilla WoW was a good gameplay. Bad players could quest and farm unharmed on a PvE realm, but they couldn't get epics or even epic mounts.\"\n\nLet me guess: You didn't play in vanilla WoW? In most MC raids I was with about 10 of 40 people of the worst kind of M&S*, the level you find in LFR now. Wearing epics afterwards anyhow. Or maybe that was just my realm.\n\n*Sure, what was an informed player was a lot different now and then. But I am talking about simple stuff like not being afk during a boss fight. Owning a shield as warrior (as they were the only real tank class then). Or actually knowing how to heal as hybrid as that was their only raid role, emphasized by the heal-only drops."

Most fittings I find though rely on 3 gyros, only 1 TE and no speed rigs/mods. Sure, the base speed is fine compared to other Command Ships, but if you fly solo and get tackled by anything faster that you can't mid neut to death, you're **** out of luck.\n\nA standard HG Crystal Sleipnir with 1 TE and no speed mods would get me (CS skill 4) ca 1200 dps burst tank (Dread Guristas XL), 1300 m/s and 660 dps with EMP @19 falloff or 525 dps with Barrage @29 falloff.

      "text": "this is a 2 part post the guard units will be posted here while the ships will be posted in the rogue trader forum.\n\nafter the glorious death of rogue trader Darrius Austin, no descendents were located. the family fortune passed to the imperium. the ships were pressed into the imperial guard and the house guard was pressed into the imperial guard. all tithed to the \"Margin Crusade\". while most of the ships were sent to battle the 'nids, commander Ebongrave requested Conquest squadron. these 5 ships were formally the planetary conquest squadron of House Austin. these 3 transports and 2 light cruisers contain: 7 extreamily well equipped and trained regiments, 5 penal legions, 2 battle servator cohorts, 12 squadrons of air support, and all the ships were specialized for air support. and best of all they had no ties to the area. these are the guard units of the 1257th imperial guard group.\n\ncommanding officer: Regina Holt, independent and strong willed she doesn't usually play well with others.\n\nhistory/summary: the crawlers were not drawn from the world of burnscour itself, instead the best of other regiments, big game hunter guides, hive scum, mercs, and almost anyone else that thought they had what it took to be a crawler were sent to this death world and dropped into it's jungle with minamal supplies and a tracker linked to a beacon on the other side of the planet. anyone that arrived at the beacon was accepted. they are the elite. used to working behind enemy lines in small units, each squad has both a sniper and a demolitions expert. experts in the jungle environments, and outfitted with the best a wealthy Trader house could afford. stealth and recklessness are their bread abd butter. fanatically loyal to their commander they have had some issues adjusting to the new commissioners. having fought in several campaigns against various xenos in the expanse, more xenos shouldn't be any different.\n\nmiscellaneous: having been the elite unit of House Austin they recieved only the best equipment, from storm trooper carpaces, to customized sniper rifles.\n\nadventure hooks: dropped behind enemy lines the kroot may be just as good at strike and fade as the squad.\n\nhistory: hailing from the war world of zayth, this regiment came from the remains of a shattered hive. after their home was destroyed the to to being mercs. after fighting for several contracts with landships they took contract with House Austin and decided to stay on in a permanent capacity. raised as soldiers, they are unshakeable in combat. \"there's nothing we can't knock down\" is a common saying among these troops.\n\nmiscellaneous: each of the regiment's Leman Russ tank is outfitted with a powerfield. due to this they can survive much more of a pounding than many enemies expect.\n\nadventure hooks: after taking their tank to the local town for \"a good time\" a sudden advance by the enemy has cut them off from their platoon.\n\nHistory: given to House Austin after the planet was saved from an ork invasion, these men and women are no strangers to battle. serving as a fast reactionary reserve, they know how to plug holes and hold the line.\n\nmiscellaneous: each of the chimeras of the unit were equiped with power fields, like the tanks of the zayth hammers. having faced some of the worst fighting on damaris and holding the line is several other campaigns many of the troopers are augmeted with different bionics.\n\ncommanding officer: Reverend Marius Gold, the teaching of Saint Drusus and the glory of the of emperor must be spread. he will not wavier in this.\n\nhistory: raised after the second settlement of Grace by Drusus pilgrims house Austin raised a regiment of the faithful to spread the light and cleanse the xenos from the expanse. they don't see how their mission has changed and out of all the regiments are adjusting the best.\n\nmiscellaneous: a few converts from the first settlement made their way into this regiment, they have a tendency to end up with supplies they have \"found\". trained in the mountains of grace, they are most at home in mountainous environs.\n\naventure hooks: the squad stumbles onto a tau sympathizer cell. do they cleanse it or try to bring them to the light?\n\ncommanding officer: Dyson Hunt, stubborn and ill mannered, having been raised in a warzone he is constantly looking for infiltrators.\n\nhistory: tired of fighting a dead man's war on Sheldon Folly they begged to be taken off the cinder of a world. agreeing if they would serve the house, the unit was lifted off the planet. use to fighting in urban wastelands they excel on most battle fields. they gained their nickname from their trench warfare tactics, \"fighting from a grave\".\n\ncommanding officer: Jillian Brooks, she leads her men from the front, but like most of the regiment many wonder at her intelligence.\n\nhistory: raised from the narcogangers of footfall, house Austin saw something few others could. that mixing drug addled phychos with grav chutes would be a \"good\" idea. suprisingly this has worked out excellently. these fighters cause complete chaos in the enemy's rear areas. running off combat drugs and adrinalin they may not be safe to be around but they manage to destroy everything in site. strangely the crawlers get along well with the seekers and the 2 regiments are often in close support of each other.\n\nmiscellaneous: if there are drugs to be had in an area the seekers will find them. raised from generations of additics, they don't do well sober and become harder and harder to control.\n\nadventure hooks: the squad is being supported by the 21st, the drugs ran out a week ago and they are all in withdrawl.\n\ncommanding officer: Cameron Ellens, depressed over the death of House Austin his troops sometimes have to fend for themselves.\n\nhistory: as House Austin grew, so too did the families of the officers serving the house grow. not having enough positions on ships, stations, or other holdings the warrant holder at the time raised this regiment from the families of his officers and lesser branches of those families. each and every member of the hunters has felt the loss of House Austin personally. many of them having family serve it for thousands of years. another of the favored regiments they have felt the loss by being regulated to one among many regiments. distinguishing themselves in some long gone battle they earned the name tank killers, however they are trained to deal with almost any type of unit and destroy it. to do this different companies differ wildly from one another.\n\nmiscellaneous: like all other vehicles used by the better regiments raised by the house their vehicles have power fields. being drawn from the elite they tend to be \"snooty\" to others. other regiments sometimes refer to breaking a snoot, this refers to them getting into a fist fight with one of the 25th and breaking his nose. others will talk about calling in the 25th to deal with a problem such as a tank. saying they had it \"snot shot\" referring to them holding their noses in the air.\n\nadventure hooks: the 25th take over the squad's favorite drinking hole, and won't let anyone not in the 25th or \"good looking\" to enter.\n\nhistory: grace was founded as a retreat for the criminal scum from the imperium. those that could afford to retire or run from the law, made their way to grace with their fortune and lived like king on inported food, wine, and women. surrounded by servants and waited on hand and foot. this changed when warp storms cut the colony off from the rest of the expanse. nothing on grace was suitable for human consumption. within a year the stores had been consumed leaving the inhabitants with nothing to eat……… except each other. when the storms receded House Austin investigated the planet. finding that most of the population had decended to eating each other, they resettled the planet with Drususan missionaries and drafted most of the rest of the population into penal legions. the circumstances around the orgins of this legion have been \"lost\". the imperial guard don't know about it's past and the other regiments arn't talking since they don't really like the commissioners assigned to them. quietly laughing every time another commissioner from the 346th goes \"missing\". 43 have had \"accidents\" or \"deserted\" so far.\n\nmiscellaneous: charismatic and welcoming to outsiders, these hardened criminals have other motives when getting outsiders drunk.\n\nadventure hooks: the squad has been pinned down for a month in ruins by the enemy. the only other unit there are 2 squads from the 346th. the food has run out and all the officers are dead.do they join in or fight to survive?\n\norder of battle: theoretically 10 companies of 1000 men, they have divided themselves along tribal lines, so only the officers know exactly how many subunits there are. total man power 10,000 troopers.\n\ncommanding officer: Janace Grimhaven. after serving with these P.O.W.'s she has become suspicious, several assassination attempts have reinforced this.\n\nhistory: during the conquest of Dross, the defeated tribesmen were rounded up and pressed into a penal legion. these desert primatives were unsuited for standard service so were left their traditional spears and clubs made from the fallen crafts on their planet. excellent in desert fighting, they excell at strike and fade tatics. originally intended as cannon fodder they have proven useful in several engagements.\n\nmiscellaneous: they are very religious in their belief in the \"sky father\" and each tribe beleaves their version is the \"right one\". this causes tension within the legion. thinking any crashed flying machine is a \"holy offering\" from the sky father makes driving them into battle interesting.\n\naventure hooks: the squad has been tasked to transport a company of the 387th through a battlefield where a massive air battle took place.\n\ncommanding officer: Jak Rillings, not really caring about anything his troops included he drinks himself stupid every day.\n\nhistory: the 400th is one of the dumping ground for any \"noble\" defeated foe of House Austin. most of these come from captured rival Rogue Trader ships that compeated with the house. pulled from the officers and others that might rebel against new management of these prizes ships, the 400th has a rather high education and discipline level for a penal legion. knowing they can fight or die they choose to fight.\n\nmiscellaneous: discipline was taught to these troopers long ago when commanding voidships. now they take orders well. also being in the void for so much of their lives has taught them how to fight in cramped spaces, be it tunnels of hive halls they excell while open spaces make some of them uneasy.\n\nadventure hooks: the squad is detailed to guard the landing zone. there are 3 habitable planets in the system, only one belongs to the imperium. several of the 400th want out before they become cannon fodder.\n\ncommanding officer: Hal Pilsworth, seeking promotion out of this legion he is willing to sacrifice his men for glory.\n\nhistory: when the wreck of the emperor class battleship \"Light of Terra\" was discovered so were the descendants of it's crew. having gone feral they had divided into tribes. at first relations were strained until they realized that these newcomers worshipped the \"throne god\". this relation held true until it was realized thet these tribals \"throne god\" was the captain of the ship wired into the ship and still alive if helpless except for the ship's vox. 3 of the tribes survived the resulting war against the herasy. one renounced the \"throne god\" for the emperor. the other 2 were taken and formed into a penal legion, their god destroyed. eventually they accepted the emperor.\n\nmiscellaneous: these tribesmen fight with the spears and clubs they made when on the Light. they are experts at fighting in enclosed spaces.\n\naventure hooks: the light of terra was returned to the navy and is orbiting the planet. serving close to the 432ed someone in the squad hears several of the tribesmen talking about the \"throne god\" and that the Holy land is in the sky. they are talking about joining him and re-takeing the holy Light.\n\ncommanding officer: Jill Taggart: she follows orders but could really care less\n\nhistory: raised from pirate crews, mainly officers, this legion and it's sister legions usually had a steady stream of new recruits. from either attacking the wrong convoy or being hunted down they were captured and pressed into service.\n\nmiscellaneous: these thieves haven't changed much, them \"finding\" supplies is common. usually drugs. having to be driven into battle these troops are hard to control and harder to get to stand and fight. if not for their usefulness in close quarters fighting they would all be turned into servators.\n\naventure hooks: removed from the 1257th this legion is being moved on a imperial navy cobra to a new warzone. the crew have no idea about the origins of this legion. the squad are also onboard being transported to their regiment as reinforcements."

I am playing a game and I have researched the technology that grants me the ability to use them to travel and I see my enemies use them but I see no way to do so.\n\nIs there supposed to be a graphical clue as to how they connect much like the phase lanes? I can see phase lanes between planets but I do not see phase lanes between stars so at first it was confusing just to figure how to travel between stars.\n\nJust move your ships to the center, they'll jump through automatically. You do see a thick white line once you discover the connection, but not before. Meaning, you have to use it before you see the link.\n\nNo, there's no link between stars. To you may need to hover your mouse over the wormhole to see the connecting link, I know it's not always visible. It may also highlight when you hold down alt (tactical overview). I actually don't play with wormholes much, so someone else can confirm when exactly the link shows. But it does!\n\nIt will look like on this screenshot, you can easily see the connecting wormholes:"

Having a dread or two is nothing much to ask for.\nAs for lower class holes... Just camp them or something? If you gank them in/at the end of anoms all the time, they will eventually stop trying to do stuff.\n\nI just really don't understand what the problem is. If you can't assemble a fleet to take down a tower, then you're either just bad or you don't play the numbers game. Yeah, a tower can do what 5k DPS, but if the guys owning it won't engage in PVP with you, they most likely don't know that you can man POS guns either.\n\nIt's just a basic whine because no one and I mean no one enjoys grinding through a pos. Everyone complains about it, even the people with shit tons of dreads. It's the pvp equivalent of being forced to mine trit without the benefit of making isk.\n\nMore importantly, it's just stupid. If you want to force carebears to fight, your only answer is to gank them if they're in a C4 or lower. I understand that in wormhole space it's important to have a bit more security, but a small 4 man corp shouldn't be able to hide for days behind a POS while a significantly larger corp has no opportunity to force them out. I don't have a suggestion that would work, I just think the system is broken.\n\nNo.\n\nThe best thing about W-Space is that it does, to some extent, counter the usual Eve logic of more people = better. Just because some corp is just a few buddies playing the game, or doesn't just take on any fucking idiot into their ranks, why should that then make them subservient to some bigger corp/alliance? Your post typified the 0.0 attitude of \"why can't my blob win, it's not fair, I have more friends\".\n\nWhy do you even care that a few noobs have a WH fortress? It's not like the gudfites are going to suddenly flow because the POS has less EHP.\n\nYou just want a few pathetic and easy ganks. WH POS mechanics are fine as they are.\n\nI don't think your grasp of WH mechanics is all the way there m8.\n\nNoobs shouldn't have a WH fortress.\n\nA few GOOD people are welcome to have a WH fortress. This already exists without POS - if someone comes into your system, hop into 1-2 triage archons, 2-3 tracking dreads, 2-3 lokis/bhaalgorns, and you can easily rape an exponentially larger group (just make sure u blap the bhaalgorns first, or use your bhaals to win the capacitor war (Only reason you'd do this is if you REALLY hated them, or wanted to invade their WH in which case they're fucked unless they pay my alliance a lot of money to come save them. =D )\n\nThis does not make for good or engaging gameplay for the odd passer by just looking for \"good fights.\"\n\nCCP should do something to make the \"run to POS, hide/log off for a few hours\" method much less effective, or counterable besides \"setup cloaky dictor inline, bubble when u make urself known, hope their t3's arent nullified.\"\n\nSo it's not okay for them to have an easy time sitting in the pos, but it should be okay for you to have an easy time killing the pos? Double standards much?\n\nHi there my name is duckslayer and i live in a wormhole so that at no point do i ever have to actually shoot pos or sov structures. i think that lordsservant may be doing it wrong. Maybe if you want the 4 corp of noobs to pew, turning up with a 20 man pos bashing fleet isnt going to get fights of ~:HONOURE:~\n\n\"If there's one thing we can practically do in our sleep, it's churn out expansions\" Kristoffer Touborg, CCP 2013 wrote this this morning and realised it was a bit strongly worded so I trashed it, but then I read Lordsservants post and dug it out of the Recycle Bin.\n\n___________________________________________\n\nI realise I'm going to piss off some people with this post and will get a lot of 'didn't want you in w-space anyways' replies but fuck it.\n\nI recently left w-space to head back to null-sec, and one of the factors was the recent entrenchment of the mantra, I think originally touted by K162 and relentlessly copied by many other sycophantic wannabes of 'contribute to w-space or get out'. This is bullshit; people who espouse it come across as looking like they have limited understanding of both human interaction and eve-online.\n\nDont get me wrong, I love the mechanics of w-space, and i dont deny that there are some awesome fights to be had, but too many people seem to fail to grasp the fact that eve is a sandbox, and that wormholes are not the arenas of world of warcraft where you line up against each other, proceed to attack in a gentlemanly fashion before bowing to each other at the end and proceeding back to their respective POS'es. No. Eve online is a sandbox game, and whether you care to admit it or not - the majority of w-space is a gankbox game.\n\nIt appears to me that the 'contribute or get out' club has evolved over time in order to act as a comfort blanket to those corps who use it. These corps think that not doing much and using expensive ships makes them good at PVP when actually it mans that, they don't have to put as much effort into invading other peoples space to make themselves look hard since they only invade people who don't have the intention of defending themselves. Additionally, it prevents attack on their own systems by the only people that have the capability to competently mount an invasion.\n\nThe recent unification of many said corps to send a 'message' to that shit AAA corp, confirmed my perception that the higher echelons of w-space are gagging for another large-scale invasion/battle similar to when Starbridge & Co. invaded Aquila so they can try and stay evenews24 relevant, yet are far to risk averse/lazy to co-ordinate an attack in case it ends up with another miserable failure like when they tried to invade Guillotine therapy space.\n\nBack to the sandbox part, obviously in this game people set your own goals, and if making a big wad of cash is your goal, then safe-ing up every time a Narwhals/whoever guy jumps into your system is probably a wise thing to do. As long as w-space is the most lucrative form of ISK income (besides possibly moon goo and being a whiz at the markets) it will be filled with alt-corps for people who plex-to-play, people who are saving for a titan, whatever. Part of the sandbox is creating your own content. There are plenty of ways to force a conflict with someone and if you can't be bothered to put in the effort or don't have the imagination to make that happen… deal with itDingduckding and we have a winner....Figured you all knew this......I guess not\n\nA corp doesn't need a pos to be complete isk whores in WH all they need is capitals and in the lower classes they don't even need that.\n\nIn fact POS's represent investment in WH and in the system itself. the more POS's the larger the investment.\n\nOnce a corp has put some up you actually have means of hurting them before that If a corp or hell a multiboxer does it right there is no actual ingame method of catching them. besides perhaps logging off in the site you think they are going to do next and praying and hoping that somehow you land directly on top of them when you log in..which well you won't if they do it right.\n\nPerhaps CCP could do something to make pos shoots more fun or whatever tbh I would be more worried about them breaking the game if they tried but that's just me.\n\nIn any case that's 3 pages worth of emo/hurt feelings/vague and not so vague insults. These kind of discussions always end up this way there's 6 classes and people with hugely varying playstyles there will be no agreement here........\n\nCould we perhaps take this discussion somewhere else now ?? . I keep seeing this thread updated and I get all excited as it's usually excelent content yet there's 3 pages of pure disapoint nowI wrote this this morning and realised it was a bit strongly worded so I trashed it, but then I read Lordsservants post and dug it out of the Recycle Bin.\n\nRead your post and the only real argument i see is that \"Because eve is a sandbox, carebears have the right to bear without fighting and we should deal with it\", which is a pretty bad argument (no offense). Hell, same logic: because eve is a sandbox, i should be able to kick whomever i don't like out of w-space, for whatever reason I want - including for being unapologetic carebears. Point is, there's already space where you don't have to pvp and can bear everyday, it's called highsec. W-space should be for something better.\n\nAs to the other parts of your post:\n- a good portion of the evictions we (AHARM) do have been against groups that had the capability and numbers to fight us but wouldn't, and we've gotten fights after invading them - Ash alliance, Strag3s, Lightning Knights, 4U holdings. A further good portion have been against groups that should have had the numbers to fight us after invading but basically gaveup and started SDing.\n- I can count on one hand the number of times we've had ~honourduels~, and they only happen when numbers are vastly inequal and the alternative is blueballs for everyone.\n- The 'security blanket' thing is pretty lol. We dont evict people who fight us because if we did we probably wouldn't have anyone fun to fight.\n\nedit: also, i agree with the honourable gentleman from No Holes Barred (sandslinger). There should be BRs here, not hate\n\nAlso also, i thought it was called 'leashing', like the thing that would keep sleepers attached to their structures instead of burning out to shoot you in the faceYeah I agree there. To be honest it wouldn't be a terrible idea to limit the size of POS you can erect in lower class wormholes and/or even impose some kind of penalty for POS hitpoints in lower class holes to deal with the restrictions on ship types people can bring in. A large tower in a C1 is to all intents and purposes invulnerable unless you really have a problem with the owner, although the new T3 BCs make this a bit more bearable."

      "text": "fire a torpedo at a ship which then cloaks, the torpedo will still accurately track and hit the ship despite you properly losing target lock (after the ship has fully cloaked itself). Ideally, if the ship has fully cloaked before the torpedo hits, the torpedo should also lose target lock and count as a missTorpedoes tracking after cloak is initiated is intended, and part of the cloak balancing. I'd rather have a period where the shields are down but everything stays locked, and then drop tracking for any projectile weapons that haven't hit by the time cloak is total, but this way kinda works.\n\nI wonder if its also a function of the way attacks/hits are calculated. Does the game check when the weapon is 'fired' or when its projectile/beam/etc 'hits'? Its kinda the same thing on why when you duck around hard cover on ground maps sometimes you still get hit.\n\nIf it checks when the weapon is triggered/fired, I don't see a way to prevent it, other than cloaking before someone actually fires at youI agree with this - simply having a torpedo continue to track a cloaked target to \"balance it\" just takes away from the experience. If you implemented the logic behind shields when cloaking and decloaking, then there's your balance."

      "text": "Still trying to figure out what to do with these. I created them for a client that just wanted the images and not the actual designs and let me keep the models to use where I wanted. Thinking of having the Free Colonies use them as they grow out of the Terran Protectorate's surplus hand-me-downs...\n\nHrmm, the issue with texturing is that unless you're UV map painting, which I haven't got down yet, each rendering engine is different. I've found that I learn by experimentation and trying random settings to see what they do in different ways. As for the mechanics of texturing, the one thing people tend to forget is that there is a lot of human psychology that is involved. Slight undertones of color make us instinctively like, dislike or fear certain things. You look at these ships and, even if you couldn't see the guns, you'd probably think \"human military\" just because of the colors. They also say \"authority.\" You immediately know they're not pirate vessels. Even the textures are rather an orderly patchwork of metal plates to give you that mindset. If you're doing some alien vessel, lurid reds, oranges, greens, whatever we would NOT use but could still look believable as metal is good. Stay away from orderly tile textures and use something unpredictable, like an animal print, or a random fractal scale,like pattern. Or even a tile shape that we don't usually build with, like triangles or octagons. One of the most important things is to make your ship look used. There's two ways to do this: in the program or in the postwork. Some programs (like Carrara) have a really good texturing room where you can do things like mix in a dark colored noise pattern. You do that right and you'll get a nice, non-repeating dispersion of dirt and wear. If you do the same thing to the bump map, you can really make a ship look scored up. Alternately, soft cloud and smoke brushes (like Ron's smoke and fog brushes at Daz3d.com) in post work are great for that as well. You just switch to the \"burn\" tool in your photo editing program, use a smoke or fog brush and dirty the ships up that way. That was what was done in this pic. Hope that helps some. A lot depends on the program you're"

Like I said, I'm not modeler so take my view as you will\n\nI'm going to make a suggestion that may seem silly, but is at least half serious. Turn those guns all to face one side of the ship. Then put engines on the other side of the hull. Then turn the ship 90 degrees. If it's going to be a broadside battler, why not have it be broadside all the time? Its not like it has to worry about drag being higher in that configuration, and it'd probably allow for more maneuverability and redundancy in the engines if you're looking at it from a engineering point of view. And it'd remove the thing that's always bugged me in HW2 where a ship will go broadside and then wiggle back and forth perpendicular to the direction of its engines without any visible alternate means of propulsion.\n\nSpoiler\n\nthe red bit is PTV's Needleship, imported for size and stylistic reference. it fits cozily inside of the main opening bay...\n\nHead Of The Terran Defense Network and longtime Homeworld fan\nanyone who plays Turanic Raiders needs to read this epic (Ongoing!) tale of daring space piracy and life on the fringes. \nthen, every time you catch yourself going 'ohhh, shiny' when about to run off with a battlecruiser, you will know why.\n\nI'm thinking about big honken' doors to cover the main assembly bay. then I need to do a carrier and destroyer (I've even got names for 'em, the big needle there is aPillar-class assembly ship (SY analog,) while the carrier and destroyer will be the Haven and Chaplin, respectively.

It's still lacking UVmaps, and I need to make more subsystems for it, then put it into .obj format and test it with cold-fusion, then hand the completed model off to the hodder-type folks until I'm better at it myself. and the PTV Kadeshi are perfect, even if their capital-class vessels need a buff and there frigates consist of only one type of anticapital and on type of antifighter....\n*hint hint wink wink nudge nudge*\n*edit* hey, how does HW handle smoothing? I'm unsure how to get it to work, as the kadeshi needleship, while smoothed in-game, has no soothing groups when imported. any hints?\n\nSince you said you're using 3Ds Max, I'll tell you how I do smoothing. Smoothing groups don't matter, you need to divide the geometry, it means to make an open edges where you want the edges to be sharp.\nHow to do it: First give the whole mesh an unified smoothing group, so you can see the changes later on. Then simply select your polygons you want to seperate as one smoothing group, but instead of assigning a smoothing group to it, detach them (make sure you have checked the \"Detach To Element\" option, so the polygons will stay as part of the original mesh).\n\nPics\n\nDoors\n\ntextures in progress\n\nI like it, but the doors have too many polys for such a simple shape. If the needleship is a perfect fit why don't you use it as the door?? then when it's built it's replaced by another needleship dish, apearing from behind?? do you understand? like mololu's missiles, it's always there until it leaves and is replaced by another one.\n\n\"I'm having enough trouble porting GC Lizaanj into PTV (as turanic mercs\"\nWhy are you using the Lizaanj and who gave you permission for it??\n\nyeah.

Do you think the will be in the new version and if so do you think that the reason that they haven't been listed is beacuse they are aliens that you meet later in the game like the ethereals which have also not been listed.\n\nI for one hope they are in the games as it was a sign as to how far you were in to the game as to what alien you were facing.\n\nIf you check the E3 trailer there's a brief scene by the end where you can see chained Sectoids and a tall lean dark figure in the background, which some consider to be the first glimpse of the Ethereal.\nI'm expecting Snakemen to be revealed later - the only two original aliens that I'm not expecting to see are the Silacoid and the Celatid.\n\nI also can't imagine the game without ethereals, but since they are the late game alien race, I think they're probably not showing them to preserve a sense of awe when players see them in the game for the first time.\n\nIf you are talking about the armored aliens that materialize on the beginning of the E3 trailer, it can be the Snakemen although my bet is that it's a new species. There's a demo being commented by Jake Solomon where he mentions that the Drones can repair robotic units like the Cyberdisk, so my guess is that we haven't seen all the robotic species yet.\n\nI'd be really amazed if Snakemen aren't in. As for abilities, as I 've said before, let them make some use of the fifty eggs they carry inside them. Also, maybe they should have a melee tail-whip attack.\n\nWell like any good serpent like race maybe they got harden scales that provide extra kinetic and laser defense. They could camoflauge themselves or have regenerative health. They can spot your units better because they see in infrared?\n\nYeah but they were a joke/harmless on the original game since by the time you encountered them you'd be wearing Power Suits. I'd wish that they bring them back to Alien Base missions though.\n\nWhat makes you think alien base missions are gone? There's been no evidence that they're removed.\n\nOT: Ethereals definitely in, it's my gut but still...Sadly I agree with this. Snakemen in the original were pretty much a non-issue even you were still using conventional weaponry so long as they didn't bring any Chryssalids with them. However, given what Firaxis did with the Floater (another very low threat enemy IMO) I think they can and will do something super neat with the Snakeman.\n\nIt could be cool if snakemen could spit venom that would temporarily blind a foe (like a cobra), lowering their attack percentages greatly (and make them sitting ducks for Chrysalids) or if they could use a constrict attack when next to a foe that could kill them in 2-3 rounds (making their melee attack less dangerous than that of the berserker, but still lethal if your squad member is alone; plus, they use guns when in a distance -- think of them as a mixture of Muton and Berserker -- a jack of all trades, but a master of none)\n\nWhat makes you think alien base missions are gone? There's been no evidence that they're removed.\n\nOh, that's not what I meant at all. What I was saying is that I hope that they make an appearance during assaults on Alien Bases on the remake. For some reason I see Silacoids being used by the aliens to dig up alien bases (since they eat rock), while Celatids could be deployed as patrolling watchdogs - if they spotted an XCOM unit their first action would be to multiply themselves, as it is described on the original's UFOPaedia article.\n\nEthereals will have to be in. It's not X-Com without Ethereals. I do hope that there will be some way to boost psi-defences, though... nothing was worse than finding out that your three best soldiers are complete psi-wimps... finding out by having to watch them wipe out your entire squad, of course.\n\nas for the Snakemen, I don't know either. Then again, they have soooo much creepiness-potential... I hope they turned them into something really amazing.\n\nDoes anybody else think that the weird crystal-morphing-into-armored-humanoid aliens might be the replacement for silacoids? non-organic beings... rock-like... \"silacoid\" kind of alludes to \"silicon\", as in computers/androids...

This thread should hopefully answer the majority of such questions in future!\n\nMission payouts are calculated dynamically, and rely on past completion data to calculate the underlying difficulty modifier by which payouts are scaled.\n\nThe calculations are based on the number of times the mission has been completed and the average completion time. There are dynamic floors and ceilings in place to prevent payouts deviating outside prescribed boundaries.\n\nDue to the way this is implemented, the first few times each mission is run these numbers will be very low due to the way the ceilings are calculated.\n\nHowever, by the time each mission is run around a dozen times it should settle down and result in target ISK/hour payouts.\n\nThisIn summary, all new missions can be expected to pay out below the odds for the first dozen or so times they're run on Tranquility. After that threshold has passed they will settle down and pay out normally. This is a normal and expected part of the mission-introduction process.\n\nWe are investigating the possibility of adding into the production schedule a change to alter the default value to be more in line with \"expected\" payout rather than starting at a minimum value, but this has not been assigned to a specific release slot.\n\nWith some missions offering 20-30m/hr and others 5-10m/hr peoples faith in the reward system is somewhat low.\n\nThe dynamic system should lead to missions evening out somewhat instead of having people cherrypick the more profitable ones.\n\nThis is of course all tied into bounties, salvage, and loot. Three things the system doesn't take into account and yet these three often come to many, many, times the value of the ISK and LP reward. It also ignores travel time and doesn't take particularly good account of system sec status... if your going to tempt people into the possibility of being under fire they'll want more than a couple of thousand ISK for the trouble.\n\nThe level of the mission or is irrelevant. The time it take the complete the mission is important since you might end up having to wait a long time before being able to go in and do it. But the most important part off all is how freaking far you have to travel to go do it. That is the real danger factors in these missions because the further you go the more likely your gonna have people waiting for you. Hence more risk a **** load more. But clearly from you post the auto-balancer take ship regards for distance the main danger factor hence you mission will have a simmiller payout to regular missions since their using the exact same calculations.\n\nOriginally by:CCP GreyscaleThere is a vital factor missing here: bounties and loot.\n\nObviously bounties and loot are hard coded into the mission design. Such is the way the game works.\n\nFrom my experience, the missions that have the most/best wrecks always have the highest ISK/hour return.\n\nThat would seem to indicate that dynamic balancing of ISK payout, LP payout, Bonus payout is near to insignificant in comparison to the hard coded reward provided by the bounties/loot.\n\nPlease set the record strait, what sort of counter measure is there in the balancing of mission rewards to account for the base reward from bounties and loot?\n\nHow is Completion Time calculated? Does it begin when you enter the mission complex or does it begin when you accept the mission?\n\nIf it begins when you accept the mission than the rewards should even themselves out relatively quickly, because the increased risk and the increased distance equate to increased travel time.\n\nHowever, if the mission completion timer does not begin counting until you warp to the mission complex then you have a problem, because the majority of the risk associated with these missions is expressed in getting to the mission site successfully.\n\nIf the mission reward balancer does the latter instead of the former, you guys should strongly consider creating a special case for all FW missions so they consider either the number of jumps between the agent location and the mission location (static but reliable), or the length of time between when the mission is accepted and when the mission is completed (more dynamic but possibly more exploitable).\n\nOriginally by:MarlenusYup, it's just a factor of number of completions and average completion time - uncompleted missions don't factor in.\n\nOriginally by:TarminicHow is Completion Time calculated? Does it begin when you enter the mission complex or does it begin when you accept the mission?\n\nTo the best of my knowledge it's a \"mission acceptance to mission completion\" timer, so yes, it's including travel time in the calculations. I believe it's the same code as used for courier missions in that regard.\n\nOriginally by:Vaal EritThe problem in the case of the L5s was that payouts weren't correctly scaling by level, as the code wasn't fully forwards-compatible. Rectifying this issue resulted in the revised payouts you're seeing today\n\nthis is a huge mistake, failing a mission should be equivalent to needing 3-5-7 days to complete it otherwise, \"hard\" missions will have deceptively low LP/isk gains, the reward system should reflect the difficulty of a mission, not stay at some arbitrary lowermost level until somebody actually finishes the mission\n\nalso, why isn't the \"starting point\" higher for LP/isk gains? the best move would be having a new mission start with the MAXIMUM POSSIBLE lp/isk gains, so that more people will be inclined to test it and bring it down to it's \"real\" value\n\nOriginally by:Frecator Dementathis is a huge mistake, failing a mission should be equivalent to needing 3-5-7 days to complete it\n\nI suspect because the devs feel this would be more susceptible to deliberate manipulation. Just pick a mission, especially new ones where the data set is more \"fragile\", and deliberately fail it a few dozen times to bump up the rewards.\n\nOriginally by:Frecator Dementathe best move would be having a new mission start with the MAXIMUM POSSIBLE lp/isk gains, so that more people will be inclined to test it and bring it down to it's \"real\" value\n\nThe only problem there, of course, is that if a few dozen people agreed to take a mission and sit on it for a few days to artificially promote the inflated mission reward during the early days it's on TQ. While the skewed effect wouldn't be permanent, it would likely be significant for longer than it should be.\n\nOriginally by:ElaronThe only problem there, of course, is that if a few dozen people agreed to take a mission and sit on it for a few days to artificially promote the inflated mission reward during the early days it's on TQ. While the skewed effect wouldn't be permanent, it would likely be significant for longer than it should be.\n\nThat would not be effective. The first dozen people to complete the mission would allow the balancer to adjust correctly. Sitting on the mission would only serve to hinder you from getting the mission a second time within the most profitable time window.\n\nOriginally by:ElaronAdding a per character counter for every mission would be an obsurd amount of work both in code and DB load.\n\nI agree that adjusting the balancer to start at or near the max is the most effective way to ensure that the balancer reaches the correct value as quickly as possible.\n\nThe simple reason being that anytime the auto-balancer is reset there will be a rush of players running the missions to get the increases rewards.\n\nCurrently the general strategy is to stay away from the content until the balancer has a chance to rebalance. IE, there is no point running missions the day after a major patch: let the noobs run the missions while the auto-balancer works the reward back up to where they should be, then go back to it after the rewards have adjusted. The problem is the more people who follow this strategy, the longer it takes for the auto-balancer to get the data it needs.\n\nIf the auto-balancer started on the high side of expectations and worked down, it would encourage people to be early adopters. Players would rush to complete the missions while the payouts were higher than usual, and in the process ensure that the auto-balancer gets the data it needs to correctly balance the rewards.\n\nThe only way to abuse the auto-balancer is to ensure that the majority of mission runners intentionally delay mission completion. That remains constant regardless of the starting point of the auto-balancer.\n\nOriginally by:CCP GreyscaleYup, it's just a factor of number of completions and average completion time - uncompleted missions don't factor in.\n\nThe number of times a mission is failed is probably second only to the number of times it is rejected as an indicator of the reward it should offer. If people are losing ships, quitting in frustration, or refusing to take the mission at all then the reward needs adjustment.\n\nOriginally by:CCP GreyscaleTo the best of my knowledge it's a \"mission acceptance to mission completion\" timer, so yes, it's including travel time in the calculations.\n\nNot only does the reward system ignore other reward factors such as bounty, loot, and salvage but it also ignores anything really relating to the missions difficulty. Floating across deadspace to a beacon 60km contributes more to the LP and ISK payout than killing the NPC's that spawn once you get there.\n\nFurther the reward has nothing to do with the actual travel time, it rewards for the average, so it will pay you the same whether it has offered you the mission to do in the agents system or several jumps away.\n\nUnder the current system an easy but drawn-out mission will always be rewarded more than a short but intensely difficult one.\n\nWorse, this system is being applied to a new form of mission (FW) where the variables are immense, the enemies don't have mission NPC bounties, and the returns on loot and salvage are far less. A form of mission where people are going to fail repeatedly due to factors beyond their control, where ships are lost, and where there are no guarantees of a perfect mission set-up.\n\nWhile the primary reward for FW should always be PvP it wouldn't hurt to ensure people earn enough doing it that for every ship lost they don't have to go and run standard missions for several hours.\n\nGood arguments, and generally I'm agreeable to having the default on the high side. I still stand by the assertion, though, that the balancer is set to start low to reduce the chance of players gaming the system. The history of EVE has proven, time after time, that if there is a loophole in a game mechanic then players will drive Titans through it.\n\nOriginally by:Elaronif there is a loophole in a game mechanic then players will drive Titans through it.\n\nFor sure.\n\nFor example, now that I know this, I am going to accept my next mission before going back to salvage my previous mission.\n\nWhen running two characters, I will get a mission for each and wait until both are complete before handing them in. This will have the double bonus of increasing the average mission time, and decreasing the number of times that I need to dock to get a mission.\n\nMight as well do what I can to help increase the average time it takes to complete a mission.\n\nGreyscale, thanks for the explanations on how the autobalancer work. What you say is mostly what we had gathered from pieces and snippets of information, but never got a complete and official description in one post.\n\nSimilarly to what most people is saying here, I think that not considering the failed missions, especially for the FW missions, is an error.\n\nI can see why that was done, as before the introduction of the Faction Warfare patch all the missions had a week completion's timer, so people was failing them mostly to recover the wreck of a lost ship or because they left the game/didn't used the character/forgot the mission.\n\nNow the change in the completion timer for some missions (the militia missions that I tried on Sisi had a 13 hours 30 minuter timer) this will change.\n\nA player losing a ship doing a militia mission hasn't the option to say \"I will retry tomorrow, after DT has reset the mission\". If the target system currently is hosting a fleet battle he has not the possibility to join the battle or to avoid the system while the fight boils down. Waiting some hours could spell failure for him.\n\nSo, at least for the FW missions, considering the number of failed missions is important.\n\nAverage number of jumps to the mission location Raw DPS of all rats in each wave/stage, and total mission. Raw Bounties of all rats in each wave/stage, and total mission. Averaged median market valuation of loot tables for rats in mission Averaged median market valuation of salvage tables for rats in mission.\n\nFind an existing mission with similar stats, set the sliding scale to start there and adjust accordingly.\n\nIt makes good farmable missions even more rewarding. It makes poor missions that get blitzed even less rewarding. It makes legitimate courier missioners suffer because of macro farmers. It does nothing to make missions that get declined more favored. It makes NPC mechanics interfere with the sandbox.\n\nAnd all that because CCP is lazy to do what has been mentioned in previous post. Actually they do it, just lazily and roughly. If they really intended to ballance ISK income rats would have variable bounties for starters.\n\nThe \"ballancer\" is just crap and utterly fails to achive anything. But I guess it is pet project of some lead dev. Like the UI windows that never get fixed even though fix is as simple as axing buggy unnecessary code.\n\nAs pointed out above however would it not make sense also to take into account fails and/or declines for the mission as this is significant indicator for mission difficulty.\n\nIf taking those indicators into account would be too complex then perhaps keeping track (even if it's just for internal statisticks) how many and what class of ships are lost within mission deadspace would be most definately interesting information. If nothing else then for that quarterly ecenomic newsletter as line in statistics table as people have been a while been argouing about 'risk in missions'. Say 'in last quarter 5 marauder class battleships were lost in level 4 mission deadspaces vs 300 tech 1 battleships and 250 battlecruisers' for example.\n\nI know that basically none of what I suggest is going to be listened to greyscale but ill put it out there none the less..\n\nProblem: 1: Faction warfare missions are unlike any other missions CCP has introduced in the game before 2: FW missions dont have a set dynamic for standing increase 3: Faction Lp stores offer the same equipment as regular high sec navy missions 4: FW missions can be warped to by anyone, and seen by everyone 5: As you stated, Mission payout dynamics are based off of completed missions only\n\nResult: The result of these seemingly and individually small problems comes out to one factor. Faction warfare missions will maintain a low dynamic payout and not entice players to attempt them. The reason for this is simple. After Several attempts at missions on the live server I have completed only 2. One level 4 and one level 2. The reason for this was that moving a ship through enemy space is far to dangerous for the payout of the mission. Therefore prompting me to end the mission rather than complete it. And as you stated because I did not complete the mission that trip does not factor into the dynamic to adjust the pay scale. And I'm positive this has happened to other players as well.\n\nScenario 1: While attempting to reach the level 2 mission I was poped. I grabbed a new ship, and was popped again, finally I purchased a ship 1 jump from my mission and completed it. Sadly None of this will factor into the dynamic.\n\nScenario 2: Running a level 2 I make it the whole way to my destination and sit around and cap a few other cps then complete the mission. According to the way you described the dynamic, to eve those missions were the same, if completed in the same time frame.\n\nAs you can see this will throw off the factoring of mission payouts substantially... Especially for lvl 4 missions where a ship that could run the plex cost would be quite substantial.\n\nIn addition to these problems with the dynamic you have 3 last factors. One being the fact that the standing increase is pathetic compared to the ease in defending a contested system. When I completed my level 4 it gave me a standing increase equal to half of securing ONE minor compound. Thats almost a quarter of what defending a compound would be. Add to this the lack of anything worth while in the Lp store for the militias. ( yes I know this will change one day). But for right now it just adds to the problem of not many people taking missions and even fewer completing them. And lastly but by no means least. The randomness of systems you run missions in needs to be addressed. You can use the same agent multiple times and get sent to a different region every time. This makes for random victory points in random systems, which for those running missions to help their militia capture an enemy system sucks.\n\nFIX: I would suggest several things as a temporary fix to these problems( not that you'll listen but )\n\nA) Cut the cost of items In the lp store by 10% or 20% for the time being. After all it is the militia they would be trying to give pilots fighting for their side the best equipment. At least until new items are added.\n\nB) Have designated zones that each agent gives missions in. Do not restrict it to systems of course but at least restrict it to a specific constellation. Ie. if i go to agent \"X\" that has -18 quality I know I'm going to be doing missions in this star cluster. However If I do missions for agent \"A\" with 20 quality I'll be doing missions in this other constellation. (Quality should effect the range of systems the agent sends you)\n\nC) This is the easiest. Increase the standing gain to a realistic level, seeing as how missions are viewable just like cps.\n\nD) (also very easy) Increase the pay manually for now. Increase the pay to what all the other level 4 missions are, why is that so hard? Theeeeeen let the dynamics take over. Why must the dynamic start of with missions paying the same for all 5 tiers its silly\n\n1. New missions should start at the average payout/completion/bonus time. This way mission will still look ok and not hand out the maximum payout.\n\n2. Counters should be per agent and time dynamic. This would allow the most farmed agents to scale down on rewards and unused agents increase their rewards. Helps to spread the mission runners. F.e. an unused highsec Q-15 agent should scale up to the level of a same sec status Q+20 agent after some time and quickly drop down after a couple of missions.\n\n3. Include mission composition into the balancer calculations. Missions with roids and good salvage rats should have lower rewards than crap salvage rats. Or drone missions that don't have bounties.\n\n4. Mission rejection is usualy based on a couple of factors where reward is only one of them. F.e. I always reject or let a mission expire where I would get any kind of faction standing hit (I am leaving out storylines always). There would have to be a nice juice reward to make me take that standing hit.\n\n5. Per mission counters could identify \"farmed\" missions. Offered vs completed counter should say a lot here. Also related to point 4. above.\n\nOriginally by:CCP Greyscale Thisthe quality scaling is just so\n\nonce you use a q18 in a .5 you just cant go back to other agents. unless you are just using 5 agents at a time going for the high isk bounty missions.\n\ndid a blockade level 4 in a .8 system for a -13 agent, okay so I wasn't expecting any great reward, but under 2000 lp just left the taste of sick in my mouth. 9.x corp standing, no agent standing, but damn, I'd rather use my other agent and run the risk of getting some courier missions.\n\na) Some missions have total bounties that are a few times higher than the mission reward, and there are other missions, where the mission reward is almost all you get. So the balancer doesn't balance the ISK/hour earned but only the ISK/hour reward. This leads to some missions being totally crap in terms of total ISK/hour while others pay very decent.\n\nb) Factional warfare missions where introduced to introduce people to pvp in an enviroment where risks are limited. Rewards should just help you to compensate your looses. However it was never intended that you make much money with this missions. Another difference between npc-missions and fw-missions is that fw-missions are meant to be done in groups.\n\nSo a balancer, like the one used in the normal NPC-missions, fails here in general. Its a solution for a different problem.\n\nImho the whole reward system of fw-missions is useless. From the devblogs I personally expected a system that would encourage people to do factional warfare. Just making a mission where people can shoot each other really doesn't do this. IF you would give them access to very special items in the lp-stores or would give them more lp/hour than they can possible earn in any npc mission, THEN you have created a real reason for carebears to do pvp.\n\nThe reward system as it is, with all its imbalances, is a solution to balance npc-missions. Because of the differences between npc-missions and fw-missions it cannot be a solution for the problem of balancing fw-mission rewards.\n\nOriginally by:CCP GreyscaleThere is of course room for improvement in the way these systems work - this thread was intended simply to explain the current workings\n\nYes especially mining mission since you can earn 20.5 time[1] non-mission mining vs what an average level 4 mining mission give out which obviously mean it is EXTREME unlikely a solo miner, I don't add corporate miners since they will likely gang and complete mission way way faster, will actually seriously consider doing them. While this may seem like a minor problem however is not in anyway better off than kill mission [2] since kill mission get bounty/loots that is much more valuable vs mining mission ore where you can't do anything other than turn in.[3] Most level 4 are at averagely from 1 million m3 *not sure on mininum* to 4.5 million m3 which only service to force solo miner to either have gang members or corporate mate come and help which can severely throw off the mission complete vs time completion. So to even remote fix the aboves problem you would need to at least consider how to make them more attractive for the solo miner, would be something along the line of payment higher for solo miner vs lower payment 5 people mining/courier.\n\nExample(The number may not be balance but you get the idea):\n\nSolo miner get full payment as long he got no alt/gang/etc... help. 2 miner/courier get split 2 way payment time 85 percent 3 miner/courier get split 3 way payment time 75 percent etc.... *the percent is to purely discourage macro miner*\n\n(2: In most level 4 mining agents system are relatively barren at least compare to crowd systems however for the purpose of this post I will ignore that)\n\n(3: There are still some mission only loot that have problem however they are mostly .1 m3 in case of kill mission drop or large m3 which are normal for courier anyway so they will be ignore for this post.)\n\nSo in closing, you, the eve online dev team, have a lot of work to do.\n\nThis thread is older than 90 days and has been locked due to inactivity."

      "text": "I ask: There are skills & devices that increase projectile weapon damage, and other devices that increase kinetic damage. Now in the case of launchers, both should apply since they are obviously both kinetic damage & projectile weapons. Mines are also kinetic damage, but do they count as projectile weapons as well?\n\nMore confusing: Let's say I'm using the Breen mine-launching-torpedo-thing. Is that considered a projectile weapon, or a mine layer? It fires out a torpedo that bursts open into a dozen or so transphasic mines. So would a console that increases transphasic projectile damage give those mines it's bonus?\n\nRight now I have a console that increases all forms of kinetic damage, which I'm assuming includes my mine because it just says kinetic damage and doesn't mention projectiles. But I also have another console sitting in my bank that boosts projectile damage - and the same kind of damage type that my mines are. Should I mount that console or not? Would it have any actual effect on my mines?For all intents and purposes Mines and Torpedo's are the same. But your better off powering up say Quantum than kinetic in general. Anything that is not energy and therefore launched is on the same level. It would probaly be better described as launched.\n\nThe Transphasic Mine Launching torpedo, can not be modified by Mine skills or Torpedo Skills. That being said it is effected by Transphasic Consoles, Kintetic Consoles and Projectile weapons skills.Quantum is just the middle ground between photon and tricobalt. Photon is low damage, but fast firing. Quantum is medium damage with a slower rate of fire. Tribobalt is massive damage but takes forever to reload. If you crunch the numbers, as Cryptic has, you'll find that they pretty much even out in the end.\n\nAs for the mine launcher, it's not crap - just replay the mission & get a new one at your actual level. I've had plenty of fun keeping it on as an aft mount, right beside my actual mine dispenser. This let's me smack down two minefields simultaneously on anything that tries to get on my tail; there is no cool-down separating them because they're technically different systems. Usually they get visually overloaded by all the transphasics popping up right in their face to notice that one lone tricobalt in the middle... until it's too late."

      "text": "I've been dabbling with the idea of a MMO space game using the top down orthographic approach kinda like the new StarDrive game. It would be point and click but more in the style of diablo like movements and RTS style attack modes( I engage an enemy and the AI takes care of moving my ship, evasive maneuvers, etc..) Probably could not support as many players as eve in a battle BUT would be scalable to MMO levels. Be on the look out for my kickstarter!\n\n'Twichy' controls cannot currently be done due to technical limitations. The reason EvE Online's simulation engine can support so many players on the same battlefield is because instead of reading a constant stream of joystick movements from the player, the server only has to process aggregated commands from the player. This reduces the communication bandwidth needed incredibly and enables the simulation engine (on servers and clients) to figure out where the next position of a character is simply by their current state(ie this guy is orbiting you at 5000m until he issues another command).\n\nChat Windows : A new option 'Blink off unless pinged' where a chat window doesn't blink unless someone links my name in that window and then it should blink a different color/frequency/or some other fashion.\n\nDoesn't it just mean you can take your (suitably fit) battlecruiser into a medium or large site that someone is running in a frigate, then tear the frigate to shreds?\n\nThis is already the case though with the current implementation. I am not trying to get rid of the max ship size restrictions.\n\nYour second point is sorta what I'm getting at. However, I believe it will be the other way around. A frig can out run a BC or BS easily but a BS or BC cannot out run frigs..force people to use their larger ships in those sites...more risk because they may not be able to even warp out before a frig gang is on top of them.\n\nMy only concern is that medium and large sites would become less valued but when you've run all the novices and smalls it's time to upship (or have a mixed fleet) and take some risk!"

The Armor Boost Calculation gives exact numbers but in-game the ships being boosted will have thin yellow lines connecting the Armor Booster and the ship being boosted.\n\nHow to use in your fleet\n\nArmor boosters are effective survival multipliers, and give players a larger advantage in long-running battles versus the AI. The actual armor mechanic in 5.02x is a flat reduction in damage, so armor-boosters shine most against enemies with weak individual attacks (admittedly not that many). Note that the maximum reduction in damage is 80%, so the player cannot create invincible armies.

Defensive equivalent to Munitions Boosters.\n\nHow to counter when in the AI fleet\n\nIn the current version 5.026, armor has only a small affect on general gameplay. Armor boosters will enhance the survival of all enemy ships by a small percentage, but is itself very weak in damage. They only become significant problems when combined with Armor Ships, Space Tanks, and other such crafts explicitly emphasising armor protection (1500+) - in these cases it is prudent to down them first.\n\nThis forum thread is a 5.02x discussion on armor mechanics and useful for further perusal."

      "text": "Right now, it's possible to make special hulls or ship parts that regenerate fuel (in fact, Bigjoe5already did one). So, perhaps some parts for fuel generation when stationary (may be tied to the current system's star and planets types) and a part that would refuel any ships of the same allegiance present in the same system. Then, ships that need no ammo will go very far, but will have to stop and wait to regenerate fuelAs to the \"supply ships\", it would be a viable idea if supply is made differently. E.g. like in ASC. Not that carrying things around was a bad idea, it's just too unwieldy to do manually and automation requires extra programming which doesn't look like a high-priority thing. Also, trucks zipping around may both clutter screen and eat extra machine resources to process. For very small fleets it would be good and fun, but the more ships are here to supply, the worse it will be. So if you don't want to care about it all the time, just assume there are many little lame trucks and the supply range is defined as supply ships' range in first place.\n\nGeoff the Medio wrote:\n\nTBeholder wrote:Of course, if it's too easy, it removes the very point to have any support system in first place. But if it's too hard to do in unusual circumstances, why not have one more option. Maybe, keeping a pile of non-producing, but resupply-capable outposts just costs too much. Also, outposts are hapless sitting ducks, so once the enemy hit the line, it's broken, and rebuilding it means more time and expenses.\n\nIn the early game, it's OK for ship's fuel to dominate how far they can go, with supply range being secondary, since the strategic game in that point won't involve a lot of blockades. Later on though, it's more fun if supply lines dominate fuel range so that blockades become a valuable and effective tactic. I don't really see building a lot of outposts ever becoming bothersome. If supply range is great later in the game, you won't need that many outposts anyway. In an unpopulated empire you can get anywhere fairly easily, sure, but if there are enemies cutting off outposts which could supply your ships further away than they can actually get back on their own, then that means trying to go deep into enemy territory is potentially an extreme liability, which is a good way to add range limitations without force-feeding them to the player as hard limits. It's best if such liabilities are dependent on the actions of the opponent, because that enriches the competitive game.\n\n_________________ Warning: Antarans in dimensional portal are closer than they appear"

Make the pay for WDing dependent on the sec stat of the system a skirmish takes place in (the higher it takes place in, the more isk you need to pay officials to look the other way). Make the WD activation and cancelation player customized (e.g. min time to WD should be 0 to 24 hours. Canceling should be the same). Make a skill or use an existing one to reduce the WD cost in corporation skills (should be N/A to trials ofc). Let it be dependent on the differences between corp sizes - a much larger corp should pay more to mobilize through a system just to hunt down a much smaller group. That would even the odds a bit and still keep it real. Let people who just want to do missions create sub-divisions within NPC corps that would function like a normal corp but would not be possible to WD it and put a very long buffer to join it. Some people - a.k.a. carebears - don't want to play this game in any other way other than doing missions and trying to live through the game storyline. They enjoy co-operating with each other against no-one rather than anyone and that should be respected, even by those who excel on Pointless vs Porters...\n\nStarting to indeed wonder if this now should be about the part where offcourse it is a loophole and not entirely the way the system is meant to be, or if it should be about a GM comming in here and just stating, 'OMG IT IS AN EXPLOIT!!!' thereby ignoring their own rules completely.\n\nBy the ferocity of the GM's response i'm starting to wonder if the GM itself has any benefit in it beeing called an exploit.\n\nOriginally by:McEivalley YouWTH does this has anything to do with this tread's discussion?! Or indeed what does this mean?!\n\nOriginally by:000Hunter000 By the ferocity of the GM's response i'm starting to wonder if the GM itself has any benefit in it beeing called an exploit.\n\nOriginally by:PhantomVyperccp rarely responds quickly, especially on blurry matters such as these, which is where some of the surprise and speculation comes in with GM Novas statement. you MAY have a point but you're just plain speculating along with the rest of us here. don't pretend it's anything more.\n\noh lets whine some more about the mechanics of eve being abused because we can't shoot at people who don't want to be shot at... you play the game your way, and i'll play it mine. If you really want to go after a certain group of people, them joining a newb corp isn't the end of the fight. empire combat takes place even with out war decs, it's just slightly more costly. If you were true merc's nothing would get in your way of delivering on a contract.\n\nHi again dear players. There has been some controversy regarding this issue on all fronts. I think it would be best to apologizeIt's a good thing we're not a bogus alliance who's sole purpose is to give corps a way out of wars, or I might feel insulted by the tone of that news item.\n\niMune Empire is a real alliance who paid a real billion isk to create a one of a kind business model that succeeded in no time flat. One of the things we found was a one-click self-advertising perpetual way to bring hot headed action right to our doorstep, it worked flawlessly. Corps brought us free wars and donated hundreds of millions, our pvp corps/players got loads of hi-sec action, and we had tons of belly laughs watching it all unfold.\n\nI would of rather seen a new post made by GM Nova, but I appreciate the apology. This is the type of thread that should of been locked by a mod and a note to the OP telling him to file a petition. That would of made a world of difference here. (this item contains a hint)\n\niMune Empire is still open for business, read the new rule, understand the parameters and then come join the fun. We'll take those wars off your hands, you just can't leave right away.\n\nAs for the new nerf in our honor, Ashley Sky and I take a bow.\n\nOriginally by:GM NovaIOriginally by:WynonaIt's a good thing we're not a bogus alliance who's sole purpose is to give corps a way out of wars, or I might feel insulted by the tone of that news item.\n\ndo you think it would be possible to make yourself look any more stupider?\n\nim sorry if this seems like a troll, but god! you did set up your useless alliance for the sole purpose of beating the system, you did allow a corp to use this loophole against us. you did threaten to contact all of our present and current war targets and give them the same option 'as there was nothing we could do about it'. you did FAIL very hard. you did then whine like hell in 30 different threads. you did then try to make out your orignal intentions were to high light a loophole hehe. you did then get your mates to war deck us who also failed! you are now making up some other unfeasable reason you are still here.\n\nyou did fail at everything you tried to do\n\ngo back to rens and stick to dropping cans outside the brutor tribe treasury\n\nNo, you're not, it's a clear intention. You Wyliee, of all people on this thread should read and comprehend the forum and game rules, as you have clearly broken a number of them. Try to remain calm, I know you're a bit upset about all of thisOriginally by:Ashley SkyFirst, I doubt GM Nova was apologizing to you, as she definately did not have any cause for that. Second, I've been meaning to ask you: How exactly is this a business? It's all free, right? How do you make money from that? Unless you actually fight the wars you inherit and consider potential loot as a business, in which case a better business would be to actually declare war on fat incompetent corps and take their loot.\n\n/Edit: Looking at your alliance membership, you don't really have any PvPers to fight any wars, so you're still a bogus alliance trying to save face on the forums. Good luck with thatSolved.\n\nDumb and unoriginal.\n\nSince you have failed to prove 'dumb', I will take your post in a congradulatory manner.\n\nCould CCP just be honest with us, and tell us which dev's character is in a corp trying to make a war declaration? Privateers played by the rules until the game mechanics were changed by changing the cost. No - some dev is ****ed that a corp found a way to use game mechanics to their advantage."

      "text": "EDIT: The core proposal is revised twice in this thread. See Proposal #2, and Proposal #3 if you want to skip ahead.\n\nI did a search and read the relavant threads i could find. I'd like to propose the simplest solution i can think of that is strategicly interesting and intuitive. I'm following what seems to be the consensus that commerce should happen implicity, i.e. you don't build and control the ships that move non-military resources between planets.\n\nI've thought of elaborations, and exceptions that could reasonably be added to this, but like i said, i'm trying for the simplest intersting solution. If it doesn't allow for something of strategic value, it could be elaborated with stuff like ideas about partial blockades.\n\nI'm going to explicitly use the example of food redistribution, but i think very similar rules could be used for the redistribution of other resources, trade, military resupply (if this is implemented), and possibly even population migration. I will take into account the ownership of planets within the same system by different empires, which neccesarily complicates things.\n\nDefinitions:\nyour side = belonging to you or your allies\nuncontested = there have been no enemy fleets in the system this turn.\n\nFriendly Node: The full exchange of food occurs between planets that can be connected by an unbroken line of friendly starlane nodes. The starlane between 2 friendly nodes is colored the color of your empire (as per current version). A friendly node is a system that fulfills one of the following:\n\nNetural Nodes: Partial exchange of food occurs between planets whose connection must pass through a neutral starlane node. Partial exchange is 50% of full exchange. A neutral node is a system that fulfills one of the following:\n\n* Has not been explored by your side. * Contains planets belonging to your side, and enemies, but the enemy ships do not have uncontested control of the system.[edit: added these 2 lines] * Contains no ships or inhabited planets. * Contains only netural ships and/or planets. * Contains your side's planets, and a both your side's and enemy ships at some point in the turn. (i.e the system was contested)\n\nHostile Nodes: No exchange of food occurs between planets whose connection must pass through an enemy starlane node. An enemy node is a system that fulfills one of the following:\n\nThis would give strategic value to the shape of your empire, since divide and conquer is a more viable strategy if you can try to starve out a planet or group of planets. Building far-flung colonies becomes a calculated risk. War disrupts commerce. And it makes disolving an alliance with an neighbor who you've intermingled with a mutually damaging proposition.\n\nLast edited by eleazar on Thu May 24, 2007 10:14 pm, edited 4 times in total.Another question: do If a blockade occurs and subsequently resolved, the two systems need to establish trade again in 5 turns. The 5 turn figure would diminish as more engine/starlane/fuel techs are available.\n\nAlso, is it a consensus to treat civilian trade and military supply in the same manner?Not having \"partial exchange\" also avoids the issue of what % to make partial, (why 50%?).Alternatively, stockpiling could be non-automatic... as in you'd need to build a building to enable stockpiling, and the building's location would determine what location needs to be connected to a planet to allow that planet to make use of the stockpile. For simplicity, we'd likely only allow one location (different per resource?) to function as a stockpile centre.\n\nThat might be a bit off-topic, though the whole stockpiling / trading system likely needs to be considered together to arrive at an optimal design...\n\nSowerCleaver wrote:\n\ndoHowever it has been suggested to have the rate of supply or cost of supply change with distance for fleet resupply. ie. you'd have some max rate of supply for a fleet, and the actual rate would fall with distance of fleet from supply point.\n\nFor planet resources, likely all supply would need to be at the same rate... which is instantly fast, regardless of distances.I find this persuasive from a KISS point of view, but I also like the idea of mine-neutral-theirs for supply. This indicates that the only area in which you can operate with impunity (\"for free\", in a sense) is inside your own territory. Outside of that, you cannot get supplies nearly as easily. In enemy territory, you can't get them at all.\n\nOne the subject of cut-off partial empires, I think that subempires should be able to produce and distribute supply and resources as before, but just not stockpile anything. This discourages fragmentation (and makes it an option for attackers), and dramatically reduces the UI and micro burden of having lots of stockpiles to keep track of. Restricting resource distribution to the planet or system of origin is too much, IMO, since I think this is a simplifying rule that would be extremely frustrating as a player (\"There's a surplus right here, but they're starving right next door!\", etc.).\n\nThis second bullet point indicates that a neutral node can contain neutral planets, and the third one indicates that it cannot. Was this just miswritten slightly, or did you mean something I'm not getting?Geoff the Medio wrote:\n\nI don't see a need to have a concept of \"partial exchange\".The game doesn't need \"neutral nodes,\" but IMHO the minimal increase in complexity is justified by the increase in strategic interest. It sort of an ad-hoc garrison. Commerce to multiple outlying colonies can be partially disrupted by destroying a garrison, or blockading a strategic system. In an \"open/closed\" system described above, the only way to disrupt commerce to a group of planets is to completely surround them. Of course completely blocking commerce is the same in either proposal.\n\nFrom a GUI perspective, the colored lines drawn between adjacent systems that you control, were a far too obvious and elegant item, for me to avoid thinking of game-state information for them to communicate.\n\nAlso it seemed too lenient that battle in a system would not disrupt commerce, and too harsh that battle completely disrupted commerce. So i proposed a half-way state.Geoff the Medio wrote:The above approach seems congruent with the previous design decisions like the global production queue. It's also pretty simple. It's my preference. AlternativelyGeoff the Medio wrote:\n\nSowerCleaver wrote:This second bullet point indicates that a neutral node can contain neutral planets, and the third one indicates that it cannot. Was this just miswritten slightly, or did you mean something I'm not getting?\n\nEach of the 3 points are independant descriptions of a \"friendly node.\" I don't mean the 3 points to be cumulative. Does that clear it up?\n\nI edited the first post for clarity, and added a condition to take into account a system where enemies both own some planets.\n\nItsort of an ad-hoc garrison.\n\nNeeding to \"fill space\" with ships to have efficient intra-empire resource exchange is appealing. It gives a purpose to have roving groups of fast attack / long range cruisers that can take out an enemy's behind-the-front-lines space-filling sentry ships, but which would be too weak to fare well against powerful but slow-moving main battle fleets. It also gives a way to disrupt commerce with groups of cloaked ships in a similar role that doesn't involve magically creating a group of freighters for them to battle...\n\nThat said, much of the same results could be had by requiring all resource sharing to be along secured routes. Presumably those freighter captains don't like risking unprotected routes. Sounds a bit harsh compared to what's been assumed, but it might work...\n\nAlso, regarding partial sharing, it's not clear how it would work. You say that (perhaps) 50% sharing is allowed. What does that mean exactly? The planet can export 50% of its surplus, or get 50% of it's needed imports for locally-produced things? That would imply a planet can import more if it's building more, which doesn't make much sense.\n\nIt might make more sense to talk about partial import restrictions if we had a larger system of import limits, unrelated to just blockades. ThereQuote:\n\nAlso it seemed too lenient that battle in a system would not disrupt commerce, and too harsh that battle completely disrupted commerce.\n\nI think it's reasonable to block civilian shipping through systems in which battles are occurring...\n\nQuote:ThereI can understand why it would seem unfair to build a shipyard on the other side of the galaxy, and then start pumping ships out with the full industrial force of an empire far away. However that is can be dealt with using my concept. If there's no netrual or friendly path to the shipyard, it can only produce ships with the resources of the connected planets (if any).Quote:I'm pretty sure that when he said \"supply depot\" he was thinking about a way to store resources.Agreed.\n\nWill population immigrate with instantaneous speed also? If so, what prevents a player from depleting 20 pop planet to 0 pop in a single turn when the enemy armada is approaching? If not, why the difference? Since all ships move FTL on starlane, I don't think the acceleration/brake time should affect the ship speeds measured in turns(presumably years).\n\nAlso, note that this is not something a player should keep track and micromanage constantly. Actually there's nothing a player can do about this other than researching engine techs. Therefore I don't think abstracted supply (no freighters flying around) logically has to be instantaneously on-off.\n\nThe game play value of this is that it takes longer for your pop to grow from 1 to 2 if you settle farther from your closest colony. Since it adds a factor to consider in deciding where you settle your colony and does not require microing, the only down side of this is coding complexity, I think.\n\nQuote:Another alternative is trying to choose the most important factor and disregard other factors. For example, we can calculate the % by simply comparing the \"power\" ratings of the two fleets.\n\nWill population immigrate with instantaneous speed also? If so, what prevents a player from depleting 20 pop planet to 0 pop in a single turn when the enemy armada is approaching?.\n\nFrom what i've read players will usually not be able to instantly evacuate a planet. However, the question of \"why\" and \"when\" the migration of populations happens is a matter for a different topic. However the possible destinations of population could be determined by my first post here.\n\nIf you wish to argue for time-delayed redistribution, please explain how it's more fun or more stategicly interesting, or even easier on the AI. The fact that it may be more \"logical\" or \"realistic\" is a very weak recommendation for this game.\n\nNo, there would be a limit on the rate of population transferred each turn, however the transfer would start or stop instantly with no delay between it disappearing from one system and when it appears at another system.\n\nQuote:\n\nThe game play value of this is that it takes longer for your pop to grow from 1 to 2 if you settle farther from your closest colony.\n\nThe rate of migration calculation can depend on distance to sink from source.\n\nThe fact that it may be more \"logical\" or \"realistic\" is a very weak recommendation for this game.\n\nI agree.\n\neleazar wrote:\n\nIf you wish to argue for time-delayed redistribution, please explain how it's more fun or more stategicly interesting, or even easier on the AI.\n\nStrategic implications from instantaneous redistribution:\n\n- it takes longer for your initial colony pop to grow if you settle farther from your closest colony (if no migration is involved).\n- it further rewards races investing in engine/fuel/starlane techs.\n- (partial) blockades are more painful; the victim is further motivated to fight blockades rather than sit through.\n\nWhether these strategic implications justify the coding complexity is a fair question, but instantaneous redistribtion seems oversimplified to me.\n\n• It's harder for the computer to know how much to ship.\nThere are no stockpiles on individual planets. So if planet B needs food, and planet A has extra, planet A sends out an invisible ship with X amount of surplus food to B. Suppose it takes 5 turns for the food to get there. In the meantime:\n\nB may no longer need the food, in which case it will be sent somewhere else? The enemy fleets may conquer additional systems, possibly causing the invisible transport to go the long way around, or to be boxed into a corner. If the transport gets boxed in or forced along a longer route, does the auto-economy send another transport or hope the first one gets through? Will the computer be able to predict a outlying system's shortfall before it happens?\n\n• It's harder for the player to know what's going on.\nThe whole point of invisible transportation, is so the player doesn't have to manage it. However, if you have an unknown quantity of goods tied up in transport, which will arrive at an uncertain point in the future, the invisibility becomes a problem. The amount of resources you will have next turn becomes hard to predict.\n\n• It's harder to code. Since playtesters won't directly see the redistribution it will be hard to figure out what kind of weaknesses the redistribution AI has.\n\nWho is online\n\nYou cannot post new topics in this forum You cannot reply to topics in this forum You cannot edit your posts in this forum You cannot delete your posts in this forum You cannot post attachments in this forum"

We have no idea. That scene in the end of ME2 could be one theory or the other. They could come up with some silly plot reason to have them show up, or maybe Shepard searches for a way to prevent their return completely (but not ultimately kill them off) or at least for generations to come. If it's the former, I eagerly await the nerd rage here about how that doesn't make sense.\n\nGiven the knowledge we have now, it's a reasonable statement. Of course, maybe the Reapers have some other drive system. They invented mass effect relays after all. So yeah, there are other ways in that don't involve slowboating it in, maybe.\n\nAs for what Shepard does...we have no idea and it's in the realm of pure speculation. I can't wait to see what they actually pull out--I just hope they end up being consistent and plausible within the universe while still being insanely fun.\n\nI suppose in some respects it depends how the Mass Relays themselves are supposed to work. If they pitch and then catch ships entering them, then the problem might not be in getting here quickly, but rather arriving \"here\" and not way way way past the plane of the galaxy. So again it would all be about deceleratingMass Effect 3's gameplay will consist of a single 30-hour-long conversation tree, in which a haggard, alcoholic Shepard morosely narrates a series of noir black-and-white flashbacks to the Asari bartender's not a deus ex machina if you've been striving for it the whole game. I'd hope they handle it less clumsily than they did in ME1 however. Vigil was a deus ex machina. The Conduit was a McGuffin (just clumsily handled).\n\nI think I have to disagree on both.\n\nSpoiler:Right on, padnuh. Vigil isn't a deus ex machina; he's a plot exposition device who appears at the end of the game to pull the story together. ME2 informs Shepard that Vigil's version of events is not even correct, altho that is probably retconning by ME2's writers.\n\nThe rain on the windows, the subtle encouragement to investigate without the sense that your doing a 'level' or 'mission' in a game. And the goddamn rain. Games need way more environmental effects. But yeah I fucking loved it, and I loved how it didnt involve the anatomy of an asari in any way.\n\nI really liked the cops doing their thing in the cutscene. For one thing, I always like seeing them put neat-yet-mundane effects on omnitools (scanning fingerprints, flashlights, etc), but more generally I enjoyed the whole crime scene drama feel. I sort of wish I'd had the opportunity to talk to the police and be all Phoenix Wright before they got dismissed, though.\n\nThat was a great scene. I loved the futuristic take in CSI. As was said Liara's apartment was a great section all together.\n\nI really liked the whole Ilium sequence because it actually included civilians. The main game mostly segregates the action to keep non-combatants out of the area during shooting sections (empty warehouses, merc bases, etc - or they're all dead by the time you arrive)), so it was kind of neat to see how the average citizen of Ilium reacts when shit starts exploding and people get shot. I mean, the way the world is presented it would be easy to assume that everyone in the 22nd century is totally accustomed to power-armored space marines running around shooting each other.\n\nReally, that's an opportunity I think they've missed several times, especially with the Battle of the Citadel in ME1.\n\n\"I saw some Krogans down by the water recently. I steered clear of them.\"\n\"Disgusting creatures, I hope I never see another.\"\n\nI can't really remember anything specific right now; what do you mean?\n\nVigil tells us that the Reapers wiped out the Protheans, whereas we learn in ME2 that the Collectors are actually Protheans captured and deformed by the Reapers to become useful and obedient Reaper slaves.\n\nME2 informs Shepard that Vigil's version of events is not even correct, altho that is probably retconning by ME2's writers.\n\nI can't really remember anything specific right now; what do you mean?\n\nI don't think he's right.\n\nSpoiler:\n\nThe version of events that you get from Vigil gives you the events from the perspective of Ilos, and I'm not sure Vigil is even wrong: the visions certainly allude to the repurposing of protheans several times (all the parts of circuits and wires griding into flesh). I think Vigil just took an objective view of the situation: the Reapers obliterated most of the Protheans, and if you survived then they kidnapped you and turned you into a Collector, which is about as far from being a Prothean as you can get.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSpoiler:\n\nOr I suppose you could put it another way: the Protheans probably knew the Reapers did fucked up things to their prisoners, but didn't know about the overall Collector initiative of theres. They were afterall trying to hide on an isolated world at the systemsME3 will reveal the reapers had one last back-up plan or other way into the universe. some of them get through but not all.I imagine for the Reapers it's like going out to pick up a sandwich from the corner shop,only to find some little shit has stolen your car. So you have to walk down, which takes longer and isn't desirable but is still possible. But now the same oik who stole your car has a chance to barricade the shop and defend it with his gang of hoodlums.\n\nOK, I admit, the analogy goes a bit off towards the end, but you get what I meanSpoiler:\n\nIf you hadn't gone to Ilos, you wouldn't have been able to open the Citadel's arms. Remember that Vigil gives you an OSD to take control of the station.\n\nNot to mention that you'd have to face of the main assault force by yourself. Probably wouldn't even have seen Saren. I thought the main reason you managed to get to him was that no one saw you coming?I think it's still better tey went to Ilos.\n\nThat program\n\nSpoiler:\n\ndidn't just grant control of the Citadel - it granted control of the Mass Relays around the Citadel as well. Without you wouldn't have even been able to let the Arcturus fleet in to attack Sovereign.\n\nSo you'd have actually been completely screwed: locked in the Citadel with Sovereign.\n\nThere's also the issue that at the time, for all you knew the Conduit was actually the master relay which let the Reapers back in know its pointless, but I like finding everything possible in any given mission. I've only been able to find 58500 credits over the course of the mission, but the wiki says 67500 is available. Has anyone found that amount over the course of the DLC? I swear I've checked every room in every area, I even ran around the area where you fight Vasir, trying to find something."

A simple screenshot would even be enough to give most of us something to hold onto that (at the very least) the Ambassador project has begunEver so trying to look at the \"bright side\", for the past year I have been very patient. That is, until I started seeing a small fleet of new Cryptic-Only ships come into the game recently. You hit the nail right on the head. The Devs need to prioritize starship classes initially by introducing official Star Trek Canon ships into the game. I know of 5 or 6 individuals that were paying customers that have closed their accounts because of issues like this. A couple of them left because the Ambassador Class has been put on the back burner forever. Others left because of other things constantly being pushed back, some left because of issues with The Foundry, and so forth. The Devs have a gold mine of a game in STO, however they need to do a better job listening to the players who pay for, and play the game on a consistent basis. I know they left for a fact because they messaged me and told me they were calling it quits. My point being, It makes no difference whatsoever to me that they lost half a dozen paying customers. but imagine this.....6 more leave....12 more leave...dozens MORE quit. It is not something anyone likes to see, but it should be noted by the devs to at least consider things like that, which are completely preventable and a loss of game revenueI agree the new Akira class ship (thunderchild) is another good example. Very untrek like.It's a Galaxy variant. I can see why you'd think it was an Ambassador. But when you play it slow you can see that it's the deflector dish from a Galaxy along the lines of that class.

We can use that same equipment on the two configs so why not on multiple ships?\n\nI am not going to upgrade lasers and box out LF4$$$$ for 3 ships and believe that this is a bit ridiculous. Bcuz i would have to get them then upgrade them as well buy 3 hstrm 2 rocket launchers and upgrade them as well. In the end some game will have cost me 10,000 dollars not to mention how much ammo costs. It seems to me that this is an easy solution that would bring less flak to your game.\n\nSIXGUNZ\n\n13.04.2012, 00:29\n\nyah i got a 2nd hanger with my venge! it came with all 10 iris and my pet. enough lf3 to arm them. a few shields and such. i bid on 10 slot 5 shot rocket launcher etc... all the stuff you need to hunt bad guyz. i had to buy protocols for pet as it had non. now im happy cuz i love the venge and the goli,i have muli skinz for them both. i dont need to bid on venge and then goli. also if you drive a venge and want a base goli to do gates this is a rocking set up for you!! good luck and God bless!! :eek:\n\n=SERAPH=\n\n13.04.2012, 04:44\n\nHello -gorillawarfare-\n\nPlease adjust your signature.\nYou are allowed a maximum of 4 lines of text and 2 blank lines.\nFor more information, there is a link to the Rules in my signature.\n\nYou can still use all of your existing equipment, however you cannot have the same item equipped to more than one ship at a time. If you remove the items from your current ship, they will then be available to equip on a different one.\n\nDo you have further questions?\n\n-gorillawarfare-\n\n15.04.2012, 03:40\n\nYes my original question.\nWhy is it set up this way, is there any intention to fix it? We can use the equipment for both configs why not both ships. Why give us a hangar we have to constantly modify. As with many other users i dumped all the extra clutter when you all brought out the upgrade option in the skylab. Simply because it was hard to sift through what was on my ship and what was not. Now I have enough upgraded items to equip out all the ships, but must config each one if I want to use them \"waste of time\". Just seems like a giant hassle and for ease of use I must spend yet again more money. I along with many others have continued to be loyal to this game and it seems to me more and more of the decisions are either not well thought out/tested, or intentional.\n\nUID 29606884\n\n=SERAPH=\n\n15.04.2012, 06:35\n\n-gorillawarfare- - Because having the same item on two configurations still makes sense. It is a different set-up for the ship, where features shift and modify into the alternate configuration. All of the equipment is still attached to that ship, but it is 'readied' as needed - this is why configuration changes can also take place ingame.\n\nHaving the same item equipped to different ships is completely unfeasible, since one of them is flying around space, and the other is sitting back at base in a Hangar. You can't have the same laser/generator in two locations at once! :eek::rolleyes:"

      "text": "being able to use titans/MS as mobile outposts is a great idea, I believe the problem is it requires rooting around in that code written 10 years ago that is crucial to EVE and nobody understands anymore. This is why clone vat bays are so useless and broken: that's as far as they could get in the code. I'd love it to work but I suspect it's beyond CCP's capability.\n\nWhy not just rewrite the code for them?\n\nThere's nothing worse than having a good idea for a post not being good enough to pull it off :negative:\n\nWell my corp owns like 3 titans never did we used them in battle , I'm all for a logistic platform , as for grath ideas i don't see how making it a death star in any way will prevent it from being a pwanmobile really , eitheir way i know for sure CCP woint do that shit:\n\n-1 One because they donīt have the \"manpower\" as they said it.\n- 2 Titans were going to be like that in the beginning but they changed them and rushed them because they couldnīt code something better.\n\nI would rather CCP changed how sov works , because titans ,supers are all tied to that and it probably is a better way and safer too do it.\n[...]Yeah, CCP has never ever ever fucked over a large segment of their player base. Ever.\n\nHe didn't specify, but his point is (if I'm understanding it right) is that maybe CCP hasn't removed entire ship classes, but they have done things in the past to totally fuck over a large number of their subscribers.\n\nOriginally Posted by eddict\n\nConfirming: Titan pilots are a large segment of their player/payer base.\n\nIf you seriously don't consider the massive amount of titans in game as a \"large segment of their player base\" your nuts...For some alliances maybe they can afford to have boat loads of characters in titans, but alot of alliances are forced to save isk to be able to afford corp, or even alliance titans..Which means serious changes to the titans will have an effect on more then just the pilots.I suppose my only question is, how much time where you able to spend in game/how long did it take to make the isk to buy your own supers? \\\nI cant deny how stupid my first post seems when looking back at recent conversations pertaining to incursions/etc and the amount of isk anyone should be able to make now...But some of us have no interest in spending our time in game saving up for a single ship(and I do realize this post changes my first post considerably...but ). Guess my point is; anyone can field supers instead of going \"whaaawhaaa only peeps with tech trees can field supers, so CCP save us\".\n\nHow long did it take you, in actual ingame hours, and how long would it take for you to get back in the fight if you were to lose said ships?\n\nI was going to explain why you're wrong, but since literally both sides agree this is whats going to happen, and the why has been explained in this very thread I think Lorren Canadas explanation works best:\n\nYou're pretty stupid.tgr: well, it took a while before I got into the isk making mode, just fucking around like everyone else. But once decided to make isk I was making 1-2b per day profit.Well, im not gonna go into detail, but there are things in eve you can do that will make you isk after you log off.. Not really hard, or so I like to think.\nThen again, anything requiring a bit of effort is a no go, so ppl just go an moan \"I cant afford this shit, game is broken\".tgr: well, it took a while before I got into the isk making mode, just fucking around like everyone else. But once decided to make isk I was making 1-2b per day profit. ISo a month for a super and 3-4 months for a titan. I guess the war'll wait while you grind up a new super or titan and get it built.\n\nEDIT: ye, something like that tgr. When I see people playing since 2006 or whatever still moaning about the price of battleships, then its a mentality problem. Everything has to become effortless.If I had kept doing what I did from when I got my supers, I would have been able to replace said supers instantly. And looking at how much time people spend ONLINE/INGAME doing fuck all, they could have stockpiled isk if they even used a fraction of that online time somewhat focused.\n\nJimmy; hardly a sekrit that market/trading is profitable, and I said \"per day\", not \"per hour\".\n\nAnyway the premise of the original argument still holds. You're wrong and nerfing titans won't lead to greater production given comparable substitutes.\n\nOk so who should I believe? The random redbar pubbie with 54 posts; none of which I can remember - or the guy who flies supercaps in PL, has a history (several thousand posts) on kugu of being a good poster who has proven again and again he knows his shit. Consider that and then realize how conceited and foolish it looks for you to say he's wrong and to call him out on his posting.\n\nAnd for the record I'm not whiteknighting Grath, I'm just trying to keep you from being his next piece of roadkill. (Why do I even try?)\n\nThere's nothing worse than having a good idea for a post not being good enough to pull it off :negative:You know, the funny thing about your defense, is though I used the word wrong you still know what I meant.\n\nThe fact that my mis use of a word was your only defense to what I said makes you look like more of an asshole than you already do.\n\nTitans will still kill subcaps after the nerf, so if you have a few titans now, or even a lot of titans, and they're going to be slightly diminished in power, but still relatively effective in large groups, what would you do with your titans?\n\nOh, whats that? In a total shocker you would obtain as many as you can to add to the safety of the herd?Which brings me back to the concept of sustainable warfare.\n\nI cant afford a titan, because if the titan dies I cant afford another titan\n\nGet into a good incursion group, run 4 hours a day at 180-200 mil an hour, problem solvedIt's something to do with the mouse when all I feel like doing is chatting"

      "text": "I imagine it really depends on the regiment in question. There are some guard units that have more than their share of conscripts and try to bury the enemy in bodies and lasbolts. After all, those are things the Imperium has in abundance - why not play to your strength?\n\nSome regiments are definitely elite units, but that doesn't mean that all are to the same high standard. Either way, I laughed out loud when I read the core book descripion stating the Guard is \"often outnumbered and outgunned.\" That works for the Space Marines, but if it happens to the Guard - well, someone had blunder'd.\n\nAs much as I'm shocked to be in this situation, I agree with AluminiumWolf.\n\nFundamentally, the Imperial Guard must possess a certain degree of per-soldier quality - it's actually a requirement of the laws of the Imperium. A tithe of Guardsmen consists of at least ten percent of the armed forces of the world being tithed at that particular moment - whether that forms a single regiment or many varies for numerous reasons. The Departmento Munitorum is within their right to demand sanctions be placed upon a world that provides fighting forces of insufficient quality. Now, every world is required by law - that is, the Lex Imperialis, which is enforced by the Adeptus Arbites - to maintain a standing Planetary Defence Force. Failure to do this is a criminal act on the part of the Imperial Commander (the official term for a planetary governor) of that world, and one that will be punished swiftly. As the primary standing armed force, this means that PDF forces will be the primary source of Imperial Guardsmen.\n\nIt stands to reason, then, that the regiments of the Imperial Guard will be at least as effective in battle as local PDF forces... because they were drawn from those forces and then given further training. And that's just the baseline. Worlds which produce almost nothing but Imperial Guard tend to produce an extremely high standard of soldier in large quantities as a matter of pride and/or because their worlds are just so dangerous to live on in the first place.\n\nThis doesn't preclude a 'bury the enemy in our corpses' strategy... but that's a matter for the Generals to decide more often than not (many of whom view strategy as a mathematical equation and the soldiers under their command as nothing more than a quantified resource to be expended), rather than officers within the regiments.\n\nYes, the Imperial Guard do get outnumbered and outgunned - in the Imperium, as abundant as many resources (including manpower) are, their distribution is frequently uneven and access to those resources isn't always where it needs to be. It isn't unusual for Imperial Guard forces to be cut off from supply or reinforcement (indeed, the reliability and rechargeable nature of the lasgun is an asset in precisely such circumstances - lasguns keep firing long after you've run out of flamer fuel or autocannon shells), stuck on a world where their numbers are dwindling and the enemy outnumbers them heavily.\n\nThis is key with the Imperial Guard - they're the primary armed force of the Imperium, alongside the Imperial Navy. That means, if there's a ground war somewhere, whatever the conditions, then it's more than likely that the Imperial Guard will be fighting itGame mechanics are going to be close to BC, because FFG has been tinkering and improving the game mechanics everytime it produces a new game, which is something I appreciate. Power level is probably going to be close to DH, but a little bit higher because baseline DH is simply too low. We know there will be Careers like Heavy Gunner, which is going to require better starting weapon talents than DH by its every nature and that equipment and starting abilities for Careers like Commissar (chain weapons usual showing up around the 2k mark in DH) and Stormtrooper have to better than DH or render those starting Careers a joke. There will probably be less gear creep so the upper levels won't get crazy as things like force fields and power weapons are very rare in the Imperial Guard."

      "text": "In my eyes varients should be very small like switching an PPC to an ER-PPC or uninstallall a laser for an additional Heatskin or switch normal to clan tech. For non-omnimechs.\n\nOmni-Mechs should be abel zu switch in an lager range of varients but nerver you should be able to creat some unreal or stupid settings like 3 Ultra-Ak20, or bringing a Madcat without rockets in the battle.\n\nI prefer canon 'mechs with cannon variants and dev variants. The one option I might not object too is kind for kind replacements. For example, a medium 45 ton 'mech carries a Large Laser, 2 Medium Lasers, and two machine guns. The Large Laser could be replaced with an ER Large Laser, or a Large Pulse Laser, and the Medium Lasers could be replaced with ER Medium Lasers or Medium Pulse lasers. Since there are no other machine gun options they cannot be replaced.\n\nHowever, these weapons could not be replaced with a completely different weapon or none-weapon equipment. So you cannot rip out the two machine-guns and their ammo bin and suddenly have room for two more heat sinks. Neither can you replace the Large Laser with a PPC or Autocannon (even if you could find some way of staying within the weight limit) because it would not be a kind-for-kind replacement. These kind of massive changes require a major re-configuration of the 'mechs basic design and thus would require a new variant (either a Dev built variant or a Canon variant).\n\nI am strongly against the restriction of customization in the MechLab. I can't put my finger exactly on the source of this anti-MechLab movement, but it's absolutely bizarre to me. Every MechWarrior shined because of its elaborate and flexible MechLab.\n\n...Until the entire game turns into \"Who has the best build\" and not \"Who has the best mech\". No mech is going to be good when the entire game devolves into tier lists and netbuilding.\n\nA Mix would be OK. What I would deem a necessity is that every Weapons system be rated for Cost, Weight, Slots needed and HEAT.\n\nIf they allow the players freedom of choice then they also have to force the player to deal with those choices. Namely, removing a LRM15 can get you those 2 LL's you wanted but they also come (auto-magically) with a required 4 (2 dbls.) Heat Sinks. Thus the Lasers can only be placed if the space (waepon slots) and added weight (HS's) are made available.\n\nEverything has to have a HEAT value that cannot be ignored when creating your \"Custom Killing Machine\" so have at it, just remember to tell the Techs to top up the Coolant tanks. LOL That directly helps keep the playing field even at all timesI know that there are variants that have changed reactor sizes, I just think that this is something that should have never happened in the first place.\nA Charger that only goes 54 km/h but is armored and armed like a Mauler is not a Charger any more, but a Mauler with a different name instead. Changes like this that break the \"soul\" of a mech just annoy me.\nSame goes for FF armor and endo steel chassis that were added to already existing mechs.\nI have always thought that those 3 things should be locked for each mech.\n\nMaybe later when the tech for this arrives, we could have Marauder REFIT as a completely different unit that is using a XL Engine and all variants that are based on this, but if you buy a Marauder with a 300 standart engine, normal armor and normal chassis then it should stay that way.\n\n...Until the entire game turns into \"Who has the best build\" and not \"Who has the best mech\". No mech is going to be good when the entire game devolves into tier lists and netbuilding.\n\nThis, we've seen it time and again... Laser boats in MW2, Laser boats in MW3, ERPPC/GAUSS boats in MW4. is it the only way to play... no it's not... but is it the way the majority of the 'old guard' play, yes... yes it is.\n\nLet me give a bit of clarification as to why I agree with this. List building is something that happens in any game that allows customization, be it online, or traditional.\n\nWarhammer Fantasy and 40K have this problem.\nHordes has this problem\nEven Battletech has this problem.\n\nI've been playing Classic battletech for 2 years, and I've noticed a trend, especially with 3025 era players, but it extends further also, to avoid autocannons and missiles due to the ammo explosions, and to run exclusively lasers. Mostly Mediums usually backed up with larges. [yes the LARGES are backups] Medium lasers [talking 3025 tech here] do 5 damage a hit... that means if 2 medium lasers hit the same spot, they do the same damage to that location as a PPC or an AC10. So why really boat anything but medium lasers on something quick?\n\nTo the same extent you see this in Warhammer 40,000, X faction sucks, if you're running space marines, take this, and this and this... if you're running Grey Knights, this is the exact tournament winning army that's set up vs everything.\n\nMagic the Gathering and YuGiOh all have decks that you see time and again in tournaments, where as the home brew, you put work into your list deck will rarely ever see a tournament.\n\nI voted for a mix, and the simple reason is that while the books and technical manual have a pretty thorough account of different variants, it doesn't really represent every last mech. This game is meant to be a reboot, so I believe it has a right to grow and rewrite the cannonical account as necessary. What are in the books represent the end results of the fictional happenings, but this game turns back the clock and allows player's actions to contribute to how this war plays out, there shouldn't be anything to prevent the developers from translating that impact on the setting into new developements. If certain players do exceedingly well, to such a degree that within the games setting should make them a notorious character, the developers once again shouldn't be hampered by the table top \"cannon\" in interpreting this game. To put it another way, to be so orthodox as to demand specific singular sources of the games inspiration, it limits the game and hampers its ability to exploit the advantages of online gaming.\n\nHave only canon 'Mechs orr variants available to acquire. Be able to make customizations, but have any customized systems not function as well as standard systems, representing difficulty of reconfiguring the 'Mech.\n\nExample: when a 'Mech fires a customized laser, that weapon has a short delay in firing. projectile weapons might be less accurate, missiles might lose lock easier. Electronics fail if the 'Mech is rocked hard, etc."

      "text": "Technical Briefing: Starships by Cameron Olson\n\nSUMMARY: This is a technical briefing on the starships used in my story universe and the technology associated with them. I'm only putting it here in case someone is actually interested.\n\nGrand Narrative Technical Briefing: Starships\n\n(Authors Note: These represent the physics applying to ships in my story world, not at all the real-world physics of which I have little understanding and often ignore entirely. I've been told numerous times that artificial gravity is essentially impossible and that shields are completely insane. I guess that's why it's called \"fiction\". )\n\nMilitary starships from the Grand Narrative Universe fall into two major classes: Interstellar and Strike. The main difference between these two classes of craft is that the former has a hyperdrive while the latter does not. The second, and less distinct, difference is size. Interstellar craft are generally large (not less than 600 meters long) while Strike craft are generally small (almost never longer than 700 meters). The two classes exist because a hyperdrive is such a massive and power-hungry device that there are actually serious combat benefits to be had from not fitting one to a ship. The main one of these is acceleration and top speed, as any ship not fitting a hyperdrive can devote all the mass and energy it saves to having and running a larger and more powerful engine and a much more effective shield, as well as more weapons, though the lack of a hyperdrive has specific benefits to shields and engines. These benefits cannot be understood until the major functioning of a starship has been discussed and that must be done piece by piece.\n\nShape: Most starships are shaped like an oval with a crescent shaped bite out of the back end where the engines emerge and a large bulge above and below the area where the engines emerge from that contains the hyperdrive. Military vessels are more elongated and flattened, with an upper and lower shell of thick armor that leave only a narrow opening all the way around for weapons, sensors, and small-craft bays. Although aerodynamics have no place in space, the oval form works the best with the engine technology used, as well as with shielding technology and armor.\n\nPropulsion: The Grand Narrative universe has two modes of travel, those being sub-light and cheating (hyperspace). Sub-light speeds are generally kept below 0.4c (maximum of 0.6c for warships, 0.7c for strikecraft, 0.8c for very small courier ships), firstly because time-dilation is a nasty effect to mess around with in combat and secondly because the faster something is going the more energy it takes to speed it up more (or slow it down)."

It's another one of their secret tricks against their victims. Use the Citadel to help kill their victims' leadership and gain a large amount of data, shut down the mass relay network to isolate their victims and use their alternate FTL tech to bypass any mass relay blockades.\n\nWhat do you think the political complications will turn out? Another thing to note is there are very few mass relays (easy for humanity to blockade) into human space plus a sizable number of human worlds are located outside the practical range of eezo-based FTL. Meaning human developed FTL tech is the better choice.\n\nWeapons are mostly based on kinetic energy weaponry (eg. like chemical propellents, Gauss/railgun/linear tech) with some DEWs usually mounted on ships, vehicles or fortifications.\n\nI prefer Halo's pre-Covenant war political/historical background as a good setting prior to the discovery of element zero physics or mass relay technology at some colony a few years prior to first contact with the Citadel species.\n\nWell, the idea is what if humanity was already a spacefaring civilization before encountering element zero physics or mass relay technology?

This makes sense.\n\n3) Balance actually seems ok, I'm doing 1654 damage per torpedo Vs 4K+ from my quantum torpedoes, and only 6 will hit any single target, at most (taking the equivalent in damage to 1 1/2 quantum torpedoes, at most)\n\nIt's a PDS, it's not going to ruin any big ship's day, but it's going to beat the hell out of smaller ships. combined with the lower hull strength the Armitage has a decent niche as an anti-carrier"

      "text": "I was told by a corp member in beta that they read on early pre-release web site that there was a way to get a 'License to Kill' from Concord if you had sec level 10.0.\n\nNow, due to the new *cough*horrible*cough* sec gaining system - no one starting after the change will have 10.0 sec for nearly a year or perhaps well over a year. So while I like the idea - I'd like to see a lower threshold.\n\nI like License-to-kill for \"professional\" bounty hunters. If you do act as a bounty hunter, you will eventually go \"pirate\" in Concord's eyes because of the sec gain speed - which is a prob unto itself but I will keep digressions short.\n\nThis should have a sec requirement. This is Concord (or DED I don't know the fine points) based. It only solves the sec rating loss from concord. I don't think there should be a 'fee' for this.\n\nA separate \"Faction based\" license to operate in a single region or an entire sovereigny. This one would require a fee and ANT positive rating with the Faction. This license only prevents faction losses for the faction in question. This does not protect vs Concord sec loss.\n\nEither of the 2 licenses will be revoked upon: 1. Firing at a faction drone, facility, or convoy of the faction in question. 2. Falling below min requirements: Sec for Concord or Faction for the faction license.\n\nYou will note, under this system pirates (with neg sec) will never be able to get a 'license' - this makes sense.\n\nHowever, I would keep in place the current system for 'vigilante justice' where you can pod a wanted felon without a license and collect. This allows for spur of moment Bounty hunting, but at a price (well, no worse than now - its the current 'price')\n\nOne final change I would make is that you cannot collect a bounty on a kill if you are considered a \"pirate\" BY CONCORD. This means whatever the KOS point for Concord is set at. (-2.0 or -5.0) UNLESS that person has a HIGHER bounty than yourself (alternatively lower sec? but I think higher bounty works as a better indicator of how much a security force is likely to 'overlook' the source of the kill.) In addition, optionally, CCP can make the amount collected on the bounty be lessened by \"processing fees\" when the collector has a negative rating of any sort from -1% at -0.1 sec to -100% at -10.0 sec.\n\nPerhaps if this is POSSIBLE within game abilities, there could be a new channel added for those with the BH license. Of course, this channel could have mules or spies in it but it will be less popluated by them than the Bounty *cough*Pirate*cough* channel currently is everyday.\n\nWell, I don't know about a licence to Kill as such, But there should certainly be a way of attacking legitimate targets in empire space without being on the receiving end of a Concorde beating.\n\nMaybe a licence could be purchased for an amount of isk and maybe a trustworthyness skill which would make concord leave you alone unless you broke the rules in which case you'd lose the licence concord would slap you hard or fine you.\n\n1. Increase 'legitimate' PVP 2. Help have an 'in game' way of countering pirates.\n\nPlease don't mistake the \"License to Kill\" thing as ANYTHING other than a 'license' to not get a 'penalty' for killing known and higly negative individuals. Why place a concord bounty and penalize those who would wish it to be a career choice to the point where they become the hunted after ridding Concord of known pirates?"

      "text": "I bought AI War last week, having great fun so far. I just was wondering about the classic RTS rock-paper-scissors relationship at the core of the ship balance: Fighters > Cruisers > Bombers > Fighters. This seems really quite strange to me, both in terms of how it reflects \"reality\" (not that that's of overwhelming concern in a sci-fi game, but it does help intuitive understanding) and how it works within the game balance.\n\nI was wondering why the relationship isn't: fighters beat bombers (because bombs are too big and slow to hit them), bombers beat cruisers (because bombers are small but pack a ton of firepower - and cruisers are easy to hit), and cruisers beat fighters (because fighters don't pack the firepower necessary to take down a big cruiser, plus the guided missiles don't have the same disadvantage as the big slow energy bombs).\n\nThat sort of seems to \"fit\" better to me, and sort of parallels other spaceship battles games/movies/fiction better. It's the old WW2 dogfighting metaphor which is the classic action sci-fi inspiration - assuming you map cruisers to naval vessels.\n\nI can kind of understand why fighters should beat cruisers - because they can get up close and hit vulnerable bits, but bombers make more sense. I can also kind of understand if the relationships are tied to the ranges and speeds of the ships - I haven't thought too much about how my proposition would change balance there (For example, cruisers beat fighters but could never catch them - so if fighters are rampaging around your system, you can't easily get to them with what they're weak to). But the one thing that really irks me about the current arrangement is why bombers are effective against fighters, small, fast things, *and* static structures, big slow things. Maybe I'm missing something, but that doesn't seem logical somehow.\n\nSo this post is sort of half a request for justification from the admirably-active-in-this-community game dev (Hi! Your game is cool!) and half a suggestion that the balance triangle be revisited. So I hope it's in the right forum.\n\nWelcome to the forums! And thanks for your support, glad you're enjoying the game.\n\nThe fighter/bomber cruiser balance is the way it is for a number of important reasons. Basically, the cruisers are big and slow artillery, which as you know tend to generally be weak to small, faster \"common\" units (footsoldiers, fighters, whatever). Fighters, by the same token, are built to be up close and personal to those sorts of giant ships, and thus don't take a lot of damage from them.\n\nThe bombers are heavily shielded, which is the main disconnect from many other RTS games -- that is vital for the functions of the bomber, such as for extended sieges of force fields and other similar heavy structures. The way that shields in this game works, range of the attacking ship plays a big part. So cruisers, because of their high range, become the natural enemy of shielded bombers.\n\nBombers, by the same token, have an attack that does a huge amount of damage, and fighters have relatively lower hull strength. So it's entirely logical also that they would be weak to bombers, and they are all but useless against bombers in return because the low range of fighters makes them unable to effectively penetrate the shields of said bombers.\n\nAll of this came about from a logical analysis of the gameplay mechanics in this specific game, and the niches that all of the ships needed to fill. It would be extremely game-breaking to change it, though I understand that it is inconsistent with other RTS titles. That inconsistency was not casually done, and given the shield mechanics I can't think of a more sensible way to handle it.\n\nBut thanks for checking! It's good to do a sanity check every so often. I'll put this up on the wiki, because this has come up before and I don't remember where the other answer was posted (but it was essentially the same as this).\n\nThe bombers are big armoured hulks, so they get past base defenses and such. Fighters don't have the firepower needed to punch through their armour. Cruisers missiles on the other hand do. Cruisers themselves are lightly armoured, which is why fighters can kill them easily.\n\nNow, bombers used to do terrible against fighters (they'd win, but it'd take years). This was really fixed in 1.201 (and late into it too). They gained something like a 10x damage boost against fighters. So yeh. XD\n\nOK, that does make sense, I agree. And I wasn't aware of the link between range and shield effectiveness, either. Or that there isn't a relationship between speed/size and hit chance - that's the assumption that led me astray.\n\nI'm wondering, then, if the names and/or descriptions of the Bomber and the Cruiser could be tweaked to better reflect that it is the bomber that is the heavily armoured unit and the cruiser that is the fragile artillery platform. Since, as you say, that's possibly inconsistent with how people may view the ship types, particularly while first getting into the game and trying to grasp the unit relationships. I don't know what the best way to indicate that would be. \"Missile cruiser\" does sort of give the right impression, maybe the bombers could be renamed \"heavy fighter\" or \"heavy bomber\" or something to indicate that they're the tanky one out of the basic units, while if necessary fighters could be renamed \"Interceptor\" to differentiate them. I don't know that I like those names specifically, and I wouldn't dream of telling you what you should call your units, but in general I think that just \"bomber\" does not convey what the ships really are.\n\nVeterans of the game may discount this as an unimportant and trivial thing that just has to be learnt, but consistency and intuitive naming and description play a huge part in game learning curves. And reducing cognitive load on trivial things free newer players up to focus on learning what they really need to learn - how to stop a 500 ship raid half an hour into the game!\n\nI think there is something to be said for continuity, and not renaming ships too frequently. There are quadruple digits of AI War players already, and renaming something as basic as fighter to \"interceptor\" is something I'd be hesitant about doing. That said, I do like the term \"Heavy Bomber\" as it is more descriptive without renaming the base part of the unit name itself (people can keep calling them bombers if they prefer). And I think that is more akin to the heavy bombers in other games, so that's a fit. Good call!ighters would become Intercept Corvettes and Bombers Attack Corvettes, MRLS could even stay the same MRLS Corvette to Cruiser (Would also work even better in german)\n\nBut i haven't yet thought this through entirely.. | I do agree though that the one thing i would immediately change in a mod is Starships (because they are Capital Ships, a starship is everything small and large that can fly in space) Basically Starship translates to Raumschiff in german. That is going to cause a LOT of confusion in the translation\n\nSome stuff in-the game is just named oddly i guess Nothing a Mod couldn't change\n\nYeah: The Space Fleet Naming Doctrine Guru shines through - i'd probablly call Parasites - EW (electronic Warfare) Corvettes too, this is one of these things a mod can change and achieve a great \"felt\" change that is not really a change at all, just cosmetics. But one that doesn't even need changing stats\n\n« Last Edit: September 06, 2009, 01:36:42 AM by eRe4s3r »\n\nLogged\n\nProud member of the Initiative for Bigger Weapons EV. - Bringer of Additive Blended Doom - Vote for Lore, get free cookieighters would become Intercept Corvettes and Bombers Attack Corvettes, MRLS could even stay the same MRLS Corvette to Cruiser (Would also work even better in german)\n\nOh man, do I ever like the idea of renaming the units like that - to keep the Bomber part but adding a prefix like mentioned above. Adding custom prefixes to all of the existing names would just be faaahbulous. The method of diffrenciating levels of the ships would still be the I, II, III, etc under their names. But I can see why you'd be hesitant in renaming all of the ships for the sake of continuity. It would add even more to the game's polish I think, I would think that instead of the basic MkI MkII it would add a certain spice to the game, and make it feel like the second level ships (and beyond) are more different than just being stronger with a few token improvements(even though that's what they are =P).\n\nBear in mind that any mods you make will get wiped out with every new version of the game, because it's one big file that has all the unit names and such. I'm not so much a navy guy, I named these more after their land/air counterparts with a hint of navy in there.\n\nAnd it depends on what you read as to what starships, etc, are called. In 70s/80s novels, often it is starships. In more recent space games like Homeworld, they call them capital ships often. Seeing as I've never liked any of the modern space-based RTS games too much (just none of them really caught my attention, for whatever reason), I have a strong aversion to the capital ship / corvette way of naming things. I took most of my inspirations for naming from other media, such as books, movies, and television, and the game is consistent with those.\n\nBut as for large file, thats not really a problem, i would probably write a script that replaces text parts, i won't do it by hand ;p That way it will be valid even if you add new stuff. But yeah, atm i have like 0 urge to mod\n\nLogged\n\nProud member of the Initiative for Bigger Weapons EV. - Bringer of Additive Blended Doom - Vote for Lore, get free cookie"

      "text": "Contents\n\nThe Condor is an often overlooked frigate, due to its very fragile build, tiny powergrid and CPU, and limited slot configuration. Most people write it off as being of little real use. It isn't really viable in any PvP role, but there are situations where it can be a handy ship to have around. With a velocity of 375m/sec, this ship is fast. Add an Afterburner or MicroWarpdrive in one of the mid slots so you'll cover distances in short order. It is a very agile ship as well, meaning it is quick to align for warp. One of the best uses for this ship is running small items up to Empire space to sell. Due to its speed and agility, it is hard for a gate camp to lock this ship down before it warps. It can also prove to be a reliable ship for running level 1 agent missions. With a couple of launchers and an afterburner, you are capable of taking out low level mission rats and drones while moving fast enough that they are unlikely to even damage you. Overall, it's a fun ship to fly. And since they cost between 25-45k, they're cheap to lose as well!\n\n\"Cheap\" being the operative word here. During one gatecamp job, a crow jumped through that two rifters and a condor tackled, the crow blew away the condor that caught it and one of the rifters; the last rifter finished off the job. The pilot, before being podded, smacked on local about how it took three goons to take out his interceptor, but he didn't stop to think that the two goons who lost their t1 frigates weren't out 40 million isk.\n\nNote: Without Warp Drive Operation to 3 or so this thing will double jump all over the place, making it a very crappy fast transport if you don't have said skill.\n\nAlways fit rocket launchers, two t1 rocket launchers provide more DPS than two t1 standard launchers and it allows you to fit a railgun. Yeah, we're talking minimal DPS here but standards demand more cpu and grid which this ship just doesn't have, and it's also a tackler so you're going to be up close and personal anyway.\n\nIf you're Caldari and are looking to buy a tackling frigate, this ship is vastly superior to the Merlin. The Merlin may have more slots and cap, but it's slow, which means that for tackling purposes its a useless piece of shit. With decent navigation skills this ship will hit 3.4km/s and costs nothing. With decent cap skills and a Fleeting Warp Scrambler I (a named warp disruptor) you can perma-run the point with the MWD off. Approach your target, get a point on him, and activate your rocket launchers once you're in a close orbit. If your target has a web, you can orbit outside 10km and still keep your point (don't use 7.5km warp scramblers, oh god).\n\nThe biggest advantage of the Condor is the price. It's dirt cheap, and so is this setup. This setup is capable of running forever, and when it is, it's extremely difficult and annoying to kill. Orbit at 6000m, turn on your guns and have a blast!\n\nCredit: Conan Shlatz\n\nAlternatively, replace the rocket launchers with standard launchers and the railgun with an electron blaster."

      "text": "ordes Mk2 Heads UpTFG are not immune to fire damage. I've been seeing in other places where people think that the Protectorate have a bunch load of Fire damage immunity. We don't. It's Cleansers, Castigators, and the Feoras. That's it. Both the unit and the jack don't see a lot of board time in Mk. II.\n\nI wish TFG were flame immune, that would make them the perfect combo unit to go with the Cleansers. I'm also annoyed that one of our casters didn't get a spell like: Fire Shield Cost: 2 RNG 6 UP: Yes; OFF: No: +2 DEF (or ARM, could go either way), and immunity: fire.\n\nIf we could, I would take Assault Kommandos just to pair them up with Cleansers.Manifest Destiny only works on battlegroup models in his control area, not all models, so it's not nearly as rough as S&P.\n\nHe is a nasty wartlock, that is for sure. Try to play games against him and submit feedback. Hordes feedback is not just for Hordes players. It is for people who play against Hordes as well.\n\nI would, but I'm also the local Legion player in my group. I think I'll get high off of the power that radiates from him and end up saying nothing's unbalanced for him. Course, if I could get someone to play me using my models, I would. But no one's willing to use a faction they don't already know a bit about, let alone a whole new rule set.\n\nI REALLY enjoy playing against eThag. He is always a tough nut to crack, but makes for a great game IMO. Many people say he is OP. I think he is prefect the way he is. Sure MD is strong, but so is the choir.\n\nTwo things I remind myself when I play him.\n\n1) He does not have eyeless sight. So with passage hymn and support behind your large based jacks, his target selection should be minimized. Now the Typhon is another story.\n\n2) He does not have much to increase the speed of his beats, well besides UA which you can account for.\n\nI played against Rhyas with a merc army and she's still tough to kill, but the popcorn bit is gone and she has to forfeit the rest of her action to go incorporeal (which is a bugger). I shot her to death with Croe&Co. I'd put in that Rhyas is fairly balanced now. The loss of mind ripper and the change to decap makes me even more happy. I found myself wanting to camp focus and not wanting to camp focus... Crit decap, or mind ripper, you pick. Decap is still nasty as hell, but at least it doesn't give buffs to everyone and other insane things.\n\nI play both Legion and PoM, and as a PoM player I was much more afraid of Legion in Mk I. Legion is a lot less tricky now, it's a lot easier to protect basically every caster except Harbinger against most of their assassination threats.\n\nEven in Mk. I Legion was pretty easy to crack if you could manage to survive the initial hit (which, playing PoM, I became pretty accustomed to doing).\n\nLegion beasts really, really don't like being on fire (and, of course, none of their infantry does).\n\nAfter much testing of legion vs Protectorate here the top 5 hitlist of things to watch out for.\n\n1. Striders with UA, Deathstalkers (or Raptors) flanking the cheese wedge, killing your support, wrecking your idrians. Striders look puny and expensive now, but the ability to quickly flank, with stealth, and ignore forests, concealment and cover, means that they are fantastic at hunting our warjack support. They also trump idrians pretty badly, unless you can get a DEF buff on the idrians, in which case the striders struggle to hit in the volumes required. You would think that our massed AOEs would solve this problem, and they certainly help, but striders can spread out quite a bit and still operate effectively. They also tend to draw our AOE jacks out of formation, which is never good.\n\n2. Saeryn and flying beasts, mainly Angels. This combo is more powerful than it was in Mk1 even. Now when she uses her feat the angels can still ignore free strikes, but now with Flight, the angles can even target through intervening models when declaring the charge. They go right through your defenses and kill your caster, or other important models and very little can defend against it, except killing the angels first. Saeryn uses far more of her excellent spell and ability list now. She'll blightbringer your infantry, copy your best buff upkeeps, and hose your melee with Breathstealer.\n\n3. E-Thagrosh and beasts. Not just manifest destiny and dragonstorm, this guy is the whole package now. Beatstick extraordinaire, fantastic army support, fantastic upkeeps, knockdown spell, staying power. He turns all his beasts to killing machines, so if you leave an opening to any one of them, you're in trouble. And he can also get stuck in himself, to devastating effect.\n\n4. Vayl, like Thagrosh, except the beatstick part. She can get a pseudo arc node easily and has decent spells, but basically buffs her beasts and hangs back because she's so squishy. Her main distinguisher is leash, allowing scary threat ranges on a single beast. her assassination potential is somewaht better because she can stack chiller and incite to get most things to effective MAT10/11.\n\n5. Incubi, usually delivered with striders or cannonfodder legionnaires. Don't be fooled that you can just ignore the legionnaires because they will clog up an area and you'll need to kill them. This releases incubi, who always get a charge or a backstrike, and have two medium power attacks, that damage ARM 19 warjacks significantly on the charge. Their only weakness really is MAT and they are easily dispatched afterward. The main value is that the few attacks that hit hurt a hell of alot, they can often get angles that allow them to take out solos and support, and they clog up your formation just long enough for the second wave, usually warbeasts going for the assassination, to arrive.\n\nI play against Legion more than any other faction, and while I have yet to beat eThags (not that many games against him, honestly), there are things that you should keep in mind when facing any Legion player:\n\n1) Legion hates the Jackwall. They have few magical ranged attacks, and fewer still that can punch through ARM:18 or 19. Hymn of Passage on the Jackwall is a big hard wall of armour that can't be weakend at range. This is a huge advantage against about half of Legion army lists.\n\n2) Legion hates Fire. It'll kill most infantry on average rolls, and even their heavy infantry and light Cav will die after a second turn of POW:12 damage rolls. Lesser warbeasts aren't fond of it either, since it's doing straight damage in their case. This makes the Feoras a fantastic tool against them. I have a buddy who will concede if I put my eFeora auto-Fire Template List of Doom on the table. In fact, it's quite good against every Hordes faction but Trollbloods.\n\n3) Knockdown. pKreoss is one of Legion's biggest foils. Most armies have some sort to Knockdown resistance3) Knockdown. pKreoss is one of Legion's biggest foils. Most armies have some sort to Knockdown resistanceWe've got Safeguard as an animus on the Nephilim Protector. It's 2 fury, so we can't spam it on everything in Kreoss''s control area, but it can keep eThagrosh himself standing during the feat turn.\n\nWe really do hate burning infantry, though. Especially burning Striders, if you can violate their Stealth - POW12 is instantly fatal to everyone but the UA.\n\nIn a tournament when I'm facing Legion I usually reach for Kreoss. Hold back his feat and camp some focus and you will make a Legion player very nervous. None of the Legion warlocks likes being knocked down and their beasts tend to fold up like wet tissue paper if you can take away their DEF.\n\nThey'll often be paranoid about getting within 19\" of Kreoss, especially if he's packing a Redeemer, and it's difficult to make an assassination run from 20\" away.\n\nThe only thing to be careful of is to not let them bait you into popping your feat too early, since the threat of the feat is almost as powerful as the feat itself."

      "text": "^^ I've never heard of anyone playing with this so I wanted to try. The AI doesn't get warned when I attack, so why should I? It's just fair, right? RIGHT?\n\nRight.\n\nAll expansions are enabled except for Ancient Shadows, which I haven't bothered to install on my new computer yet.\n\nOnto the game:\n\nAfter spending some amount of time trying to get the map into a readable state, I end up with this: The massive network at Vanguard Party makes reorganizing the map somewhat difficult, but this will have to do.\n\nI'm focusing on defense since I will be being attacked without warning and therefore my fleet may not always be able to arrive in time, so I need a decent safety net to hold off aggression until backup arrives. The AI has Mini-Rams, which the grav turrets can hold back and laser gatlings, which MLRS gets bonuses against. The Laser turrets are good vs. Bombers, which would otherwise take out much of my defense, so that's the logic behind those. The AI types I have are Mine Enthusiast, which shouldn't be a problem, and Experimentalist. The Experimental translocators are why I invested in more Bombards, which have enough range to not care much about translocation.\n\nScouting reveals some good stuff. There's a hive golem on Sloths II, an ARS on Atmospheric Spire and a Starship IV fab on Augustgrad. I'll hack the ARS later, but right now the Golem is top priority since the Hive is probably almost as OP as the botnet golem.\n\nSome waves come, but nothing worth mentioning happens.\n\nThe first subspace signal is, obviously, on my homeworld. Blah blah, wait for the timer to count down, and so on. Once it finishes, it tells me that the next signal is on Eastasia, 2 hops away. My fleet is not big enough to deal with the interception fleet, so I take Vanguard Party to provide supply on Eastasia for mobile builders. My fleet neuters the planet and I establish a beach head consisting of mines, assorted turrets and mini fortresses. Vanguard Party gets its own defenses as well.\n\nWith the knowledge from VP I unlock Crystal harvesters II. That should help my economy a bit. Once I finish with the beachhead, I send in the Survey ship.\n\nUpon viewing my homeworld in order to grab the surveyor, I see that the home command shield is a little under 50% and being assaulted by bombers which slipped past the miniforts. I must have missed a wave, which does not bode well for the future. The miniforts are moved closer in and make short work of the bombers. It was a close call, though.\n\nSorry guys.\n\nThe survey ship moves to Eastasia and starts looking for the signal. It finds the shard, as usual, and large numbers of AI ships begin to pour into the system (again as usual). It turns out that making the beachheads was a good idea, since my fleet takes almost no losses.\n\nEscorting the Shard\n\nConveniently, the wormhole to Mimoulette (my homeworld) and Eastasia are very close together on Vanguard Party, so it takes very little time for the shard to get to its destination once it clears Eastasia.\n\nFighting on Vanguard Party\n\nThe subspace reciever is built and begins searching for another shard. Meanwhile, I've decided to pursue the ARS before the golem. I don't have the resources to sustain one at this moment, and Atmospheric Spire has not only the ARS but a Data Center as well. As I expand, though, the whole \"no wave warnings\" thing is going to start to hurt. At least it still plays the little sound when one arrives, but that doesn't mean I'm always going to hear it. :V\n\nSince my last game ended in a kind of stupid manner at the hands of the frankly quite annoying Dyson Plot, I have started a new game with Hybrids on 1/10 to disable the Dyson plot, but have amped up the difficulty elsewhere to compensate.\n\n^ My map. The marked systems have Backwater Wormholes on them, although my altplanetnames.txt has a planet called \"Backwater\" on it, along with several other Humorous names.\n\nGAME START:\n\nI'm faced with the problem of having to deal with Core ships early on, so my plan is to fast tech to III as soon as I can, although this also leaves me vulnerable to the large numbers of Neinzul ships that will be coming in waves. I'll have to hold those off with Turrets.\n\nFirst unlocks: MLRS II, Riot II (Tazers will help keep the Neinzul at bay), Adv. Warp Sensor and Gravity Turret. The Shadow gets two of each module.\n\nFirst wave at 12 minutes. 72 Core Tachyon Microfighters, no big deal. I suppose that I'm not seeing large enough numbers for their strength to show, although the fact that the AI has them is worrying, as my Anti-Eye strategy involves using cloaker starships with heavy artillery to kill guard posts, and with the Tach fighters present cloak will be harder to maintain. However, I'm not worrying about that too much.\n\nAt seventeen minutes the first Neinzul wave arrives. I forgot to turn on Auto-Kite so I took some damage from the Nanoswarm despite my Gravity turrets. Fortunately it wasn't too bad.\n\nScouting the nearby systems shows little of value save for a Mk. I Zenith Reserve on Sandvich. Not too useful, but I could save it in case I get into trouble.\n\nThe recent mappacks reinspired me to make some more maps. The number is nowhere near as impressive as the others, but some of the rooms are kinda cool. I tried some new stuff with these, hopefully they work. There's a chance a few won't, though (does rubble need to have floor between it and the \"Inaccessable\" area? If so, I'll need to fix a few rooms.)\n\nSo they're found in extremely large buildings, right? The only ones I can think of are the Pyramids and the huge buildings in the Ice Age regions. Are there other valid buildings for this? I'm not finding any large ice age buildings at all (Are they really rare now? I've searched many regions, it might just be bad luck) and the continent I'm trapped in by windstorms has no deserts. I'd like to be able to do one of the mysteries but alas I'm not sure what's a valid target to look for.\n\nInspired by GUDare's \"Disposable Heroes\" AAR, I'm doing something similar, but with Spire ships. Specifically, I'm playing a self-set scenario in which the Spire must regroup and rebuild their own empire, the humans having been destroyed long ago. To make matters worse, a faction of Spire traitors has sided with the AI (one AI Type is Spire Hammer, the other is Turtle)\n\nMy rules: I cannot unlock any upgrades to human tech or unlock and tech not related to the Spire. This means no triangle ships above mk. I, no starships above mk. I (I did accidentally unlock Mk. II Riots, but supposedly those are based on Spire tech so I'll kinda accept that one). If I get things in Zenith caches or ARS, I'll take those but otherwise I won't use anything the Spire wouldn't have. The human triangle ships will only be used on defense, since it'd be a bit too challenging to only use Spire ships.\n\nI've got some stuff on, most importantly Dyson+Hybrids (Never been able to see this combo in action), Fallen Spire, Medium Golems+Spirecraft (The medium versions I find more fun).\n\nI'm going to play a game of AI war in which I will attempt to win after detonating a mk. III Nuclear Warhead. Not at the beginning of the game, of course, as I must build an economy to support the construction, but as soon as I can I will detonate it.\n\nMy strategy is to rely heavily on alternate means of gathering a force (I have a Botnet Golem at the time of writing, I'll be using Neinzul Enclave Starships and my bonus ship is Spire Blade Spawner. I'll load everything into transports upon detonation so that everything survives then go on the offensive. My AIP is going to skyrocket, but with no guard posts or command stations on any planets I might be able to blitz and overcome the AI quickly enough before the core worlds begin to lay on the pain. The map is on the smaller side, so the Core worlds aren't too far away.\n\nI don't have anything special on, really, except the dyson sphere and Easy Golems.\n\nOn to the actual game. I'm starting this after a little progress, so I'll sum up what's happened. I'm playing with Vanilla and Scorched Earth AI Types (I think that was a random pick). Two nearby planets have been destroyed, a third captured for the valuable stash. A regenerator Golem, good for sustaining my fleet I suppose, and a MK. V BLADE SPAWNER FABRICATOR. THANK YOU RNG!\n\nI also have Armor boosters somehow, must have had an ARS somewhere.\n\nNuclear Development progress at 40%.\n\nThe AI currently sees me as worthy of a 29-strong fighter wave. Oh, how that will soon change.\n\nIs this intended to be possible? I discovered that a player can jump great heights by jumping, putting a crate below his/her feet and then jumping again. if it's done right, you can do it theoretically infinitely, if it weren't for the vertical boundary. I kind of like it as it's really useful for escaping holes in the thawing plains without wasting a lot of crates, but I'm not sure if it's supposed to be a feature or not.\n\nI was doing well in my current Fallen Spire campaign until this happened.\n\nIn case it's too small to see, that's an exogalactic wave, a marauder attack, a rebel colony, a cross-planet attack approaching and my existing rebel colony is close to being steamrolled. My fleet of resistance ships from the last colony combined with merc ships is the only one close by to Path, the battlefield in the screenshot. A Mk. I fortress may be able to help, but it's doubtful. Also not shown is the 200 ships in the carrier that's inbound.\n\nThe Rebel colony planet is reachable and has an ARS so I was planning on taking it anyway, but this is sooner than I'd like. It has an AI Eye and Mk. III Ion Cannon so taking it will be tough.\n\nThe screenshot is a result of allowing buildup for hours on a planet I had assumed I neutered but left unscouted. It had accumulated almost 1,000 ships, so I nuked it, having no other viable option. (Moving my fleet in would have been costly and exposed my main front to attack. Perhaps I'm underestimating the power of a Spire city+fleet, though. In any case, that nuke is seeming like a worse and worse idea as stuff keeps piling on. My AI progress is approaching tech level III.\n\nA pretty large \"outdoor\" room designed as the top of the Overlord Keep. There's the floor, side wings and the central extractor device. Somewhat untested as my overlord mysteriously disappeared after a few revisions (There isn't a way to get him back is there?) so there might be some issues.\n\nThis map consists mostly of a large, central shaft with concentric circles at the top forming a sort of \"Eye\", hence the name. There are smaller features below the eye and mid-sized rooms/passageways along the sides for cover.\n\nSo far, It's been tested with a giant Skelebot (not the best for this map as it hangs out near the bottom all time, but I hope you'll still find it fun) and a Red Ameoba Leiutenant (This one was more interesting, it utilized the whole space, mostly circling around the eye.)\n\nI started a new game with the most recent update and, well, it spewed errors. Stuff like row 2: col;0 and so on. The attached image has the whole list. I'm unsure of what exactly this means and what happened to trigger it. It says it's an error, but I've never seen it before.\n\nAnyways, I'm starting a Fallen Spire game. Note that I only have a rough idea as to what I'm supposed to to. (Based on random talk on these forums and on the mothership description, I believe it involves building cities and somehow making a Spire-Human Alliance.) Because of this, I'll probably be stomped into the ground, but we'll see.\n\nAI Plots: Avenger, Advanced Hybrids (This is probably a mistake. However, they're not proving much of a problem in my current games, so It's worth a shot.)\n\nOh, and AIs are Zenith Descendant and Attritioner.\n\n(I'll important events and/or major battles, just to make it a little more interesting. Later in the game, though, the narrations will probably get shorter, and less frequent as interesting things happen less often. Or will they happen more often? FS will probably suprise me.)\n\nAn urgent message from Telemetry Lab popped up on the High Command viewport, Titled \"Subspace Signal\". The message described an unusual signal that had been discovered, and requested more research equipment in order to investigate further. The request was acknowledged, but since defenses were lacking in just about every way, construction of a Survey Ship had to be put on hold until some defensive emplacements could be completed.\n\nIt took four minutes to decrypt the signal. What appeared to be a message faded out quickly, but another signal, more distant, was detected two hops away from the Human base. Problematically, there were hordes of AI Ships in the way, and there was little chance of slipping a Survey Ship through undetected. We would need to, as the message from Telemetry put it, carry a big stick.\n\nAlternatively, Cloaker Starships might do. An AI Wave is incoming, so defense is again our immediate priority. With luck, our defense will be adequate and the odd signal can be pursued.\n\nI'm playing a game with 10/10 Entrenched Homeworlder/Support Corps on a 10 planet map, and my strategy for taking planets has been first to clear out the wormhole with a lightning warhead or two, and then send in the fleet. However, recently, I've had a core world on alert for a little over an hour, and there are about 1600 ships there. I have a botnet, hive, regen and artillery golem, so if I can clear out the wormhole, I could theoretically take out the planet. (including hive wasps, I outnumber the AI).\n\nThe problem, though, is that half of all the ships on the planet are Missile Frigates! About 800 of them, double the amount of the next most common ship, bombers (400). Did the AI wise up to my warhead strategy, or is this just an unhappy coincidence?\n\nWell, more questions from me. There are a few things that have been bugging me for quite a while, as well as some things that just happened, so I thought I'd ask here.\n\n1: Most ships uncloak when they attack, but Riot Starships (I'm using cloaker starships to cloak them) are able to attack while cloaked, and the AI Ships just swirl around in confusion. I suspect this is because the Modules are counted as separate from the ship itself but the AI are incapable of targeting them without the ship being uncloaked.\n\n2: I don't know if this is already known, but warhead interceptors show that they do not increase AIP when destroying missiles but it happens anyways.\n\n3: Just out of curiosity, why are cloak starships not counted as military? I now know that you can use ctrl+click to select them too, but for a while this threw me off.\n\n4: Random question 1: The armored Golem seems to be a reference to the Ohmu from the old movie Nausicaa: Of the Valley of the Wind. It looks similar, is incredibly well armored in a similar fashion and from the wiki the cheat to spawn them is \"Ohm\" so it seems to be.\n\n5: Also random question, why is the icon for AI War a Botnet Golem? Not really relevant to anything, I was just wondering. This is what I'm referring to, by the way.\n\nThis is the story of my adventures on a 10-planet map, which I heard from the Wiki was very hard to play. Deciding to test that theory, I set the AI types to Zenith Descendant and Attritioner, both difficulty 7. Most minor factions don't work on 10 planet maps, but the ones I have enabled are Mauraders, Resistance Fighters and Golems-Hard. My starting ship is the Bombardment Frigate. This is a little wordy, so if you don't want to read it all a summary is included at the bottom of each chapter.\n\nThe Base at planet Lusitania was arguably doomed from the start. Those who staffed it had been assigned to the most difficult sector of the galaxy. A mere 10 planets within the range of any ship, and no chance of escape after the blockade runners had ferried them there. Surrounded on all sides by High-level planets, gaining territory would be extremely difficult, and maintaining the garrison itself had been a nightmare.\n\nBut then, the officer in charge of Lusitania was killed by an AI bombing raid, and needed to be replaced. As such, the Human High Command sent a new commander to the garrison, who's skill turned out to be the best thing to ever happen to the tiny sector.\n\nChapter 1: Hold the Fort\n\nIn the battle in which the previous general was killed, the Human fighting forces had been decimated, and needed to be rebuilt. Our space docks began churning out Mk. I vehicles as the scouts began to locate key targets, and our scientists use what knowledge we had to develop new ship designs. Turrets were mounted, mines laid and shields booted up. Everyone knew that the AI would not wait to let us get a head start, even now our scouts detected forces massing at our borders. The low amount of worlds did give us one advantage though: Almost every planet had something of value. It would be impossible to take a planet needlessly. The scouts found that all but two worlds had Research Stations, and Fabricators, Factories and Golems were abundant. Both planets adjacent to Lusitania had advanced factories, but one also had two golems and an ARS, as well as next to no heavy defense. After we fought the initial AI wave, our ships quickly took Talnon.\n\nAfter erecting our command station and building the basic defenses and material harvesters, we built a full cap of basic ships as well as a few mk.II and III ships. The advanced factory gave us Mk. IV ships, and we also built a cap of Sentinel Frigates and Parasite Mk. Vs from the fabricators. The ARS gave us acid sprayers, and a fleet of those was built too. We began to repair the golems, but the next AI wave arrived before they could be completed. The AI was still underestimating us, so their waves were easy, for the moment. After both Golems were completed (A Botnet and Hive), we looked for other prime targets. There were two available wormholes, one, Iridia, containing A Hive and Black Widow golem, as well as an ARS, and the other, Earth, which was of little use, and bordered a world with two armored golems and another ARS. We hastily valued Iridia as a higher target, and once the hive golem had amassed its 500 wasps we sent an EMP in and immediately after launched all our ships, including the Golems. It was a mistake. Iridia bordered the AI homeworld, and was stocked entirely with Mk. V ships. The botnet golem could not attack them and they ate up the 500 wasps, not to mention they were unaffected by the EMP. We immediately fell back and rebuilt our forces, defending against the backlash.\n\nNeeding more ships, we attacked Earth to gain knowledge, as well as energy and materials, which were abundant. Oddly enough, command withdrew the units before the command station was even damaged. We would go for it later, because our scanners had detected an incoming exogalactic wave: Golems would soon be entering our territory. We needed to build defenses fast.\n\nWorryingly, Iridia had massed almost 1000 ships. Desperate to reduce the numbers, fearing that should we have to move ships elsewhere, the AI would attack, command resorted to the tactic of \"Fling lighting warheads at them until something good happens.\" It was surprisingly successful, taking out half the ships guarding the wormhole. A few missiles were destroyed by warhead interceptors*, but most of them got through. A quarter of the remaining ships began to retaliate, but were slowed by gravity turrets, bombarded by fleet ships and swarmed by wasps until the number of Mk. V ships was down to 400. Now it was time to brace for the arrival of the Golems.\n\nSUMMARY: We build initial defenses, beat a few waves, and then take planet Talnon for it's Advanced Factory, ARS and Fabricators. After an attack on Iridia with 500 wasps and 600 standard ships is beaten by the Mk. V ships (Which, I was too late to discover, are immune to EMPs and Reclamation making my Botnet Golem useless), we are forced to launch missiles at them repeatedly, hoping to get their numbers down. We destroy several starships in the progress, but are forced to stop as an Exogalactic Strike Force warning puts us on defensive mode.\n\nNEXT GOAL: Capture one of two Mk. IV planets, as well as Earth. Survive the Exogalactic Wave.\n\n*This increased my AI Progress, yet the warhead interceptor's tooltip said that it did not increase the AIP?"

Seems a little light to me since I've opened a couple of the duty officer packs I got from leveling up. What's more concerning, however, is that I can't do most Assignments as they require kinds of duty officers that I don't seem to have, such as a Bartender. How do I get the neccessary duty officers? Any help is appreciated.\n\nHead to Starfleet Academy. In the round building near the water, there's a personnel officer. Talk to them and take the General Recruitment (gives a pack of random doffs), Tactical, Engineering, Science, and Civil Corps recruitments (2 random doffs of the specific devision). There's also Vulcan, Andorian, and Telarite exchange officers around the grounds, their missions give you one random doff of the specified race.\n\nThese assignments all have cooldowns between 24 and 36 hours, but if you stay on top of them you can get a bit over 30 doffs a week.\n\nThere's some occasional cultural exchange missions around various sectors. Some require giving up one of your doffs for one of theirs, others are just a freebie.\n\nWhen you have a large enough crew to be comfortable, you can trade in 5 of one quality for 1 of the next quality for a dilithium fee, or 1 for 3 of the next quality lower for free. This is done through other options from the same contact as most recruitment."

Also, I should point out that scans of an image that you claim shows something that supports your argument, isn't an extraordinary request for evidence. Its pretty basic.\n\nOn the other hand, insisting on hi-resolution images of stuff I have already quoted, because you are bum-pained about being questioned is frankly silly and childish, and clearly not what I am demanding of you.\n\nA simple, legible and clear image supporting your claim is fine for me.\n\nAlright?

They can't detect cloaked units in-universe? Pretty heavy evidence against them being able to do it in this scenario.Apparently not very well.

Multi-spectral capability obviously indicates seeing in more than one spectrum. i.e. More than visible light. That you can post \"it can be summed up as sensory equipment, because thats all it means\" is simply wilful ignorance. It isn't uncivil of me to point this out I feel.\n\nYour reluctance to substantiate your claims with regards the capabilities of DT cloaks is obviously an obstacle here. You \"just pointing out what doesn't work\" still comes with a burden of proof.\n\nI've bolded the bits you keep posting about, without actually substantiating. Is that clear enough for you?\n\nI'd also point out that when I expanded my information about their Auspex capabilities, I gave examples, radiation, gases, biological life signs. I appreciate you need to try and needle me about little bits like that as part of your style, but I'd ask you drop the attitude, and be objective about this. but your insistance on claiming its \"useless\" isn't really justified. I'll happily continue argue about it with you if you like, but I'll continue to add information as I post that could be relevant.\n\nRadiation is obviously not visible light, you don't need a special tool to detect that in the context of a battlefield scanner. The reference to things invisible to the human eye gives us basically the electromagnetic spectrum, how much of it is unclear. \" TerminatorInvisible gases probably reflects this description of Power armour auto-senses.\n\nAngel of Darkness\nBoreas paused for a second and looked at the villagers who were gathering close by, the auto-senses of his skull helm casting a red tinge on the proceedings. Olfactory filters allowed him to identify the contents of the atmosphere - mostly oxygen and nitrogen, but with heavy traces of sulphur, carbon from the fires, the sweat of the villagers;\n\nSigns of biological life is seperate from these, It could incorporate all of the above, thermal imaging for heat signatures, respiratory byproducts etc that fit the profile of living organisms the auspex \"knows\".Hilariously, biological electromagnetic fields are associated with the \"biorhythm\" madness you linked in an attempt to be silly, so thanks for the link! But obviously detecting electromagnetic fields isn't silly in itself.I'd normally go with a bit of give and take in a versus debate, but you won't budge on anything, and you've admitted before you are willing to misrepresent things because you think \"the opposition\" is doing so.\n\nDoesn't leave me much option to take stuff on faith man.?\n\nJust to be clear on the matter, I asked a specific question, can they attack whilst cloaked anywhere else other than the gameLiberty's Crusade\nIt was blood poetry, war ballet. She had reached the center of the command center now, armed with\nher knife and a slugthrower. She would wink into existence, slit a throat, then wink out again. Marines\nwould rush to that location, and she would appear a few feet away, firing a burst point-blank into the\nhelmet of her target. Then gone, then back again, this time with a spinning kick that roke the neck of a\nbellowing officer. WhilstGiven their mobility advantage, they could probably exploit that pretty well I suppose. The context of the debate isn't enough to discern that methinks.Firstly, you claimed Marines had an entire range of sensory capabilities, includingThird time I asked for multiple things and you've dodged or refused mate.\n\nAnyway, I take it you are claiming that \"motion tracker\" in this context means some sort of vibration sensor? So something that detects the vibrations of footsteps would detect Dark Templar, or simply the noise they make potentiallyOne that apparently would detect Dark Templar. Enhanced aural abilities might hear them as well, although at this point, it looks like a collective approach of multiple sensor feeds might the thing.\n\n'Report,' Nisri said as Hussari saluted him. 'Did you see what crashed?'\n'No sir,' Hussari responded, 'only what you saw, and it didn't crash. I swear it was decelerating before it vanished.'\n'Auspex,' Turk called out, 'anything yet?'\n'Negative,' the operator called out. 'We picked up a slight impact tremor, but nothing even close to a meteor or orbit strike. 'Whatever it was, it made a controlled landing.'\n'It was guided down, sir,' Turk told Nisri. 'Anything on vox?'\n'Negative,' a vox operator responded. 'More background static than normal. Whatever fell or landed disturbed the sand and generated an electrical field like the ones we've experienced. If there's a vox signal anywhere in there, they can't hear or receive.'\n'No contact,' Nisri instructed. 'There's no reason to alert them to our presence just yet.'\n\nIn other words -- no. They can't detect cloaked units in-universe? Pretty heavy evidence against them being able to do it in this scenario.\n\nThis rather reminds me of the time you decided EMP couldn't work against Protoss, because not all EMP is made equal etc. I sense you don't want the same sort of logic to apply here though.Its difficult for me to compare and contrast, because of your point blank refusal to provide basic information to back up your claims, followed by continuous dodgingI probably didn't, I think at this point, wikipedia is a lot better sourced than you are! I took a look at biological signs of life further up.\n\nl33telboiI'm really not playing the game of restating my position every other post because you are trying to turn this into another drawn out grindfest. My posts are clear, get on with it, and provide evidence for your claims.\n\nTry quoting properly. There's an alarm function on this forum but it doesn't work unless you're quoting someone correctly. And I'm not so much restating my position as I am pointing out that you carry the burden of proof if you want to say they can see through Dark Templar cloaks. Similarly the evidence for my position has been provided.\n\nMulti-spectral capability obviously indicates seeing in more than one spectrum. i.e. More than visible light. That you can post \"it can be summed up as sensory equipment, because thats all it means\" is simply wilful ignorance.\n\nNo. It's the unfortunate truth. Multi-spectral and energy sensors means exactly nothing without further clarification. They mean even less considering everything from marines upwards have multi-spectral and energy sensors. The simple IR vision marines have counts as multi-spectral sensors, not to mention sensor towers and what they have.\n\nIf you want to say these sensors can see through Dark Templar cloaks just because they're multi-spectral then marines would also be able to see through cloaks. But they can't.\n\nYour reluctance to substantiate your claims with regards the capabilities of DT cloaks is obviously an obstacle here. You \"just pointing out what doesn't work\" still comes with a burden of proof.\n\nNo it doesn't, because then you'd be asking me to prove a negative. If you want to claim they can see through the cloaks then find something to substantiate that. \"Because they have sensors\" is not good enough given that everything presented so far can be replicated with bog-standard marines.\n\n[uote]I'd also point out that when I expanded my information about their Auspex capabilities, I gave examples, radiation, gases, biological life signs.[/quote]\n\nAnd which of these do you think would work and why? Radiation? We already know that they're not visible on thermal vision, and don't show up on radar, so unless there's greater reasoning behind this then it doesn't work. Gases? What gases? You need to clarify. If you think the protoss emit some form of gas that the opposition can detect then state what that gas might be and why they would be detected. Biological lifesigns? Again, what does that mean, what specifically are the sensors looking for?\n\n\"\n\nWell I don't think Dark Templar are radioactive to any significant degree, and we've already been over electromagnetic radiation.\n\nTerminatorSigns of biological life is seperate from these, It could incorporate all of the above, thermal imaging for heat signatures, respiratory byproducts etc that fit the profile of living organisms the auspex \"knows\".\n\nLet me just stop you there. Unless you can specifically prove that the capabilities of one system is also present on another, you need not bother. Just because Termiantor auto-senses are the equivalent to auspex stuff, doesn't mean they replicate every feat or work exactly the same. You've mentioned space marine sensors and even IG sensors to support your position... but they are not what the Dark Templar are fighting in this case.\n\nOh, and you realize of course that you're holding a double standard here, don't you? If you can take a Terminator's sensors and say they exist on the auspex stuff, then I can take ghost cloaking devices and attribute their function to that of dark templar, because they too are each others equivalents.\n\nAlso, ultraviolet and X-ray are a form of electromagnetic radation, which you already mentioned.It detects various radiation emissions, yes, you've said this a few billion times by now.Uh-huh. So it's the same story as last time. The pictures are too bad quality for you? Even though I admittedly have a crappy camera on my phone, I have to say that the pictures posted in this case are good enough to demonstrate dark templar cloaked and attackingGhosts remain cloaked when attacking, unless they specifically chose to reappear. If you ever played Starcraft 2 you probably even saw Nova stabbing Tosh to death... while cloaked. Truly there is no unit in Starcraft that has been show to have to drop the cloak when attacking.\n\nFor good measure, from Spectres: \"Still cloaked, Nova raced forward, took quick aim at the zergling on Godard's back, and fired, using her psionic abilities to teek the round slightly to the right as the marine stumbled again. The alien's head exploded and the creature dropped, twitching, to the ground. Not breaking stride, she leapt over a zergling carcass and put ten rounds below the bony carapace of a roach, avoiding its steaming blood as it jerked and writhed in the dust. Before if could regenerate, she met its alien, glassy stare and sent a teek blast directly into its skull, killing it instantly.\"\n\nNot so much thin as it is obvious grasping at straws. If they can \"see\" air currents, then no doubt that would be said. Similarly I have a hard time figuring out why these can't see invisible critters in 40K if indeed they can see displaced air currents. Far as I know cloaking doesn't make you intangible in 40K.\n\nWhilstDark templar don't have a distortion on them, far as I know. Unless they're using the weird chamelon thing described in Queen of Blades.\n\nFirstly, you claimed Marines had an entire range of sensory capabilities, includingYou've been in a billion debates regarding Starcraft before, and it's been mentioned and quoted just as many times: \"The display on the inside of his visor began to flash insistently. The motion sensors had picked up activity in the blackness of the spore tunnel that stretched before him, but Ardo's mind seemed frozen, unable to grasp its importance.\"\n\nThird time I asked for multiple things and you've dodged or refused mate.\n\nI haven't refused providing anything. Quotes from novels I can do easy peasy, ask and you shall receive.\n\nAnyway, I take it you are claiming that \"motion tracker\" in this context means some sort of vibration sensor? So something that detects the vibrations of footsteps would detect Dark Templar, or simply the noise they make potentially.\n\nI don't know what they do. It's not clarified anywhere. They're motion detectors, but that means quite a few things. They detect hovering units, so you vibrations? Maybe, maybe notThis sounds an awful lot like the novel where IG fight tyranids on some desert world, where they, among other things, get killed by invisible tyranids they can't see. And naturally these are IG, not Eldar.\n\nThis rather reminds me of the time you decided EMP couldn't work against Protoss, because not all EMP is made equal etc. I sense you don't want the same sort of logic to apply here though.\n\nReally? Is that why every post of mine so far has started with that exact same logic, \"senors\" and \"sensors\" doesn't need to be the same just because they're both called sensors? And you once again hold the contrary opinion, stating that auspex must be the same even though found on vastly different systems and other races?\nLet me make this easy: Instead of throwing out a billion different suggestions that have already been mentioned and some of which you don't even know how work, how about you try and provide a single system and argue why it would be able to find Dark Templar? You've probably mentioned electromagnetic sensors a dozen times over in this thread, but repeating the same argument in different parts of the post does not mean you've provided two separate arguments.\n\nI think Terrorsight was mentioned to be a psyker thing in Decent of Angels. Though, that could be another `sight` that is mentioned then. I don't have the book on me, but it when the initiate fights his first monster before Dark Angels show up."

Will a commander be expected to devote all of his time to micromanaging his teammates, or will he be fully able to engage in combat? What will happen to his lance if he is killed? What happens if too many players choose one role vs. the others? Such as a team that has a preponderance of commanders, or scouts, or a total lack thereof?\n\nCan players who choose faction allegiance still form named regiments and pre-formed lances? Do they quickmatch, or face other \"premades?\"\n\nThirdly and sorry for throwing so many questions. Modules in mechs. Are they intended to follow the avatar around? Does he climb into the mech and fit in a series of cassettes or circuit boards to the ejection seat? So that if you need to punch out of your doomed ride your expensive and useful modules go with you?\n\nSemyon\n\nWow, I think you might have just won a \"No-Prize\" if the Devs haven't already thought of this. This perfectly answers my question about retaining modules from destroyed mechs!\nSo, uh yeah. Can I add this to my question too?\n\nDefense may want to skew their attributes to heavier armor and friendly assistance modules, while the assault may want to skew their attributes to targeting and assistance modules. Both roles need to be combat effective in both long and short range abilities.\n\nWhat does it mean: \"friendly assistance module\"? What kind of assistance mechs are able to provide to each other? Is it just a covering to enemy's detectors e.g. AECM or something really improving other mech's attributes, so-called \"buffs\"?\n\nWill experience gained be related to the mech that you are piloting? For example, if someone is piloting a mech that is \"inferior\", will they have an experience multiplier to compensate? An Urbanmech and a Centurion can cover the same function, but an Urbanmech is clearly better, so would someone piloting the inferior Centurion have something like a 1.5 exeprience point multiplier to give them some sort of incentive to try out something other than the \"best\" mech?\n\nLocationHiding in a cake, left in green city called New A... something.\n\nPosted 02 February 2012 - 05:14 AM\n\n1st question \"ATK/DEF - balance\":\n\nWhat separates the defenders from attackers? I mean, if those two have so many similarities, it woud be far easier to just go full on attackers and leave some of them defend. Proficiency would not go down very much (targetting is better than detection... mostly) and it would be very easy to send them on offense when the time is right, winning the game for the team. Are there any counter-measures considered to balance this fact?\n\n2nd question \"Commander\":\n\nHow is commander \"class\" handled? Is it a specialised proffesion people choose just like evry other and are then sent onto field or are there some differences? Not everyone can be a good commander, since it takes a lot of effort to master this kind of warfare and having a bad commander on the team will kill you, no matter how good you are and vice versa. So, are there any criteria for becoming one? Or, do the players themselves elect the commander? Do you plan to do something about this?\n\nWhat is the difference in capability of a player character just starting out (level 0) and a player character who has achieved max level (or equivalency)?\n\nAssuming the skill level of the human behind the stick is our constant, would the level 0 character stand much, if any, chance against a player character that (again, driven by a pilot of equal skill) has achieved max level?\n\nQuestion 2\n\nWould you kindly clarify what, exactly, the Target Acquisition module's function is and what makes it ideal for the Assault class?\n\nWill we have rigid company composition (3 lances each of 1 scout, 1 assault, 1 defense, 1 commander) or company will be allowed to have mixed lances (i.e. recon lance with 3 scouts and 1 commander on light 'Mech + couple of mixed assault/defense lances with commanders in different weight class 'Mechs)?\n\nEdit: My original question has been answered by Devblog 4 (Role Warfare part 2) so I'll replace it with a new one.\n\nQuestion 1: Airstrikes, Naval Bombardments, etc all seem like wonderful things, but they all feel somewhat detached from team combat. Do you have any plans for Commanders to give nearby mechs inherent bonuses as a reward for the commander being alive? For example, every 5 minutes a (Lance) Commander is alive his three lancemates get minor bonuses that stack, like +.5% speed and radar range. I feel like this would be a good incentive to keep your Commander alive, which also reflects morale. If an assassination attempt on the other team's Commander is successful, their morale should drop, which would be reflected in the loss of minor bonuses. This shouldn't be game breaking, but would give the winning team a slight advantage towards winning the match.\n\nQuestion 2: If a Company Commander dies in a 12v12, will a Lance Commander be promoted to take over the job if he has the right modules installed? If both of the other Lance Commanders are alive what is the decision process behind transferring or assuming command?\n\n\"The player first starts off by selecting Contracts or entering Quick matches and playing the game in general.\"\n\nQuestion #1 is: Given the quote above:\n\nWhat will be the ratio/difference, if any, of XP Bonuses between a Contract match and the Quick match?\n(can a Pilot Quick match 5 games and generate as much XP as if they played in 5 Contract matches?)\n\nQuote\n\n\"Bonus XP can be gained from the meta-game which can give XP based on faction/allegiance to a House.\"\n\nQuestion #2 is: Given the quote above:\n\nIs the meta-game another term for the persistant Contract based Matches, which in turn, generate faction/allegiance XP and LP's?\n\nCould you elaborate on why the commander needs to be protected? What will the commander be doing that requires other players to watch over him? EDIT: How does a player protect/defend the commander or any other lance mate?\n\nWhen you say that Elite Tiers can only be unlocked by \"tiering-up\" all initial variants of a chassis, does that mean we'll have to work with the default weapon and equipment configurations inherent to each variant, or will we have some MechLab-sway with those variants?\n\nEdit: This is intended to be a Role Warfare question, not a Mechlab question... because different weapon loadouts could force you to change Roles.\n\nIn the role warfare update, one of the unlocks was 'weapon convergence speed'. This is a massive piece of information considering how contentious the debates about aim have been. Could you elaborate on this mechanic, and how it contributes to the aiming system as a whole?\n\nA match with all commanders and no scouts won't be a fun one. Or a match with all scouts and no commanders.\nWith that in mind, will Role's be selected before you try to join a quick match or faction match?\nOr will the Role be selected after joining a match, so you can see what roles are selected already?\n\nYou get mention in the blog that you get 1 Pilot point per tier that is unlocked. Is the amount of XP required to unlock a tier the same or does each tier require more XP the higher you go. For example if tier 1 takes 150 XP to unlock does tier 2 take 150 as well or does tier 2 now take 300 Xp to unlock.\n\nOn the pilot skill tree, some skills have more than level (i.e 0/3) to them. Do I have to unlock all of the levels for a skill before I can put points into the next skill or does having 1 level open the next skill in the tree?\n\nBased on the number tiers on a specific mech (9 or 10 if it has jump jets and counting the Elite tiers) will I be forced to pilot different mechs and/or variants to max out a skill tree? Is it be possible to accumulate Pilot points after unlocking Elite 2 based on XP generated so I don't have to change chassis and/or variant?\n\nThe blog implied that if I wanted to have a module on multiple mechs I need to buy one for each mech. Is there the ability to remove/uninstall a module from one mech and put it into another mech or is the module \"fused\" to the chassis and must be destroyed to free up module space?"

      "text": "So there's general discontent with the power of the miranda charged laser and lamster feels that even the whole concept of it isn't great. So it falls to us to come up with some cool alternative weapon concepts for the miranda.\n\nI personally like the spammed lasers and reverse and only find the charge shot distasteful, but all ideas are welcome.\n\nI think it would be interesting if there was no different kind of shot at the end of a charge, just the normal sniper shot-type thing but simply HOLDING a charge bestowed some effect. That way you'd have to weigh out the value of the charge effect versus being able to shoot. Most basic idea is you start giving out sparks in all directions and damage everyone very close by to you. Alternatively, perhaps a forward-facing shield would be interesting. Or there's always the option of cloaking.\n\nI have one, came up with this myself, tell me what you think:\nInstead of a laser have a shot that bounces off things. Bonus points if you can get a skilled shot on a base that bounces around and does a lot of damage.\n\nWell whatever it may be changed to it may need more health. It is to easy to kill one and if they dont have the charged laser a little more health would make it work. The bouncy weapon sounds cool. Maybe it would bounce off 6 objects then blow up in a small exposion.\n\nI realize too late that this is probably the kind of thing that belongs more in the suggestions forum than general. Feel free to move the thread and deduct 45 biplane points (biploints) from my record. Otherwise we must be careful to only discuss possible changes in broad, general terms (as befitting the General Discussion Forum) rather than suggesting them outright.\n\nI think the laser is pretty cool, though it does have the potential to wreck havoc in large multi player games and seems a bit strong.\n\nMaybe making the laser quit after reaching a certain level of damage or as presently after 3 seconds, whatever is first.\n\nOr a sort of shields down, in which the ship is especially susceptible to damage while firing a fully charged shot. In general having a portion of ships health being shield and the other structural that can't be repaired by landing/health pickup might be good.\n\nChanging it from a steady stream to a series of spaced laser shots.\n\nAlong the lines of Esocentric holding the charge too long causes the ship to shutter and slowly lose health.\n\nDunno, tis all i got. I think the mirinda is the most fun plane at the moment, though over powered. Maybe its just because its new.\n\nmake the laser drain continuous so they're constantly losing energy while charging.No need to put so many abilities in one place. Between Bouncing, lazer, sniping, reverse, warp, and all the rest, there's plenty for two planes.\n\nYou could tone down the range or damage a little and it might be fine the way it is. Or keep the strength but make it thinner so it's not as likely to take down as many targets at once. But, concerning the movement, I think it would be down right nifty if the reverse could be charged to go farther and have the old miranda-through-anything effect, not too far but you know maybe 2-3 plane lengths?\n\nI'd say get rid of the charge-up altogether. It's already a plane that takes a lot of management to fly properly... imo it'd be more fun if you just let people concentrate on dogfighting and going nuts with the turnaround ability. Currently I don't see people using the secondary all that much, mostly because they're concentrating on lining up a perfect laser shot. And that's a shame, because it's a super fun ability.\n\nAlso, you could still do something funky with the miranda's attack if you wanted to make sure it wasn't another boring standard projectile. just get rid of the charge-up part. :O\n\ni can see it where if you press fire once it's just a ball\nbut if you press it twice rapidly or hold it's something else.\n\nmaybe hold=beam?\n\nNO\n\noriginal miranda plz\ni got used to the new one and im good at it, almost perfected but it is too under powered\n\nand speaking of putting everything on an even keel, biplanes are good but do too much damage upclose, or miranda needs more health, loopy is good, explodet i feel is so overpowered, and the bomber needs +dmg, lots\n\nAnother idea for the recharge is instead of having 1 very large shot that bounces. Have a machine gun effect whereby alot of bullets are fired until the energy bar is depleted. Would be nice if the bullets bounced because it took alot of skill to perfect the bounce and I think thats the difference between a skilled player in miranda and a not so skilled one...\n\nBut the bouncing machine gun idea is probably a nightmare to sync over a network..."

My main fleet is more than enough to defend Moatbiqui but Kuu only makes it thanks to some well-timed Resistance fighters showing up.\n\nNext on the list is to eliminate that antagonizer. The Dyson is slowly destroying its old underlings, time to put an end to that! However, as my fleet moves into position, Hybrids attack my rear and bring my home command to half health before they are destroyed. Worse, as soon as I defeat these, a second hubrid warning comes from the other end of my territory! I rush to defend and again only arrive just in time.\n\nAnd so the battle for Agria begins.

Their Armor rotters will come in handyIt depends on which particular group of Spire you're dealing with, though I don't think any of them would object to mercenaries in the face of incredible odds unless those mercenaries were obviously really really untrustworthy people.\n\nAs for actual availability, hmm; I doubt Spire themselves would be interested in being mercenaries (for the \"good\" ones because they wouldn't really want to leave their community, for the \"bad\" ones because they wouldn't be interested in working with \"lesser\" races merely for financial gain), but presumably if it's the Milky Way galaxy and the humans and zenith (and even neinzul) have been bopping around for however many years, there'd be somebody to hire.\n\nIt's just that I have this colossal pile of resources and nothing to do with it.

A few gatlings are no match for sever heavy beam cannons and laser turrets, but it should be high priority to destroy whatever the AI has constructed.

If I want a faction of oppressive shady individuals leading unwitting pawns and suppressing the truth, I will start an Inquisition force. Leave the Tau to the people who want to be the genuine 'good guys' in a setting I say.\n\nAssuming that they do so at all, since the only real evidence of it is just short of fan fiction. (an alternate ending to a 3rd party produced video game).Re: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nOriginally Posted by TheDungen\n\nIts also possible that its like with the channellers in wheel of time, while some extremely few may be born with the ability a much greater number have the ability to learn to be psykers. The imperium needs psykers so they find theese and train them. the tau dont so they only ever meet the naturally occurring psykers.\n\nnot knowing that you're a psyker seems to be a good defence mechanic aswell.\n\nAs stated, you can't \"learn\" to be a psyker, you're either born one, or you're not.\n\nSecondly, not knowing you're a psyker is actually incredibly dangerous, because it essentially turns you into a ticking time bomb, waiting for the time when your powers finally manifest, usually in a moment of extreme stress, and usually results in massive problems (pyrokines/telekines creating a massive explosion, telepaths shredding the minds of everyone close-by, etc, let alone the damage caused if they opened a warp breach/got possessed). There's a reason the Imperium is so strict in the detection of psykers, and it's not just because they want to send them to the EmperorOriginally Posted by Kakapo42Unless the Ethereals are incredibly foolish and short-sighted, it would not have been unintended.\n\nRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?also have we ever been told how biologically psychic powers work, if its a genetic trait or so on. Considering that we probably haven't then its really open to interpretation.\n\nRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nOriginally Posted by TheDungenNo, again, it's not something you learn. You don't start off as a weak psyker, and then improve your way to Alpha Level through training. If you're an Alpha-psyker, you're born as an Alpha-psyker, you just haven't manifested your powers yet. Psykers can learn to control their powers more thoroughly, or how to safely draw deeper from the Warp, but not how to move from Delta up to Alpha. A psyker first learning they're psychic unintentionally is an incredibly dangerous thing for that reason. A pyrokine doesn't learn he's that by forming a candle-size flame on the tip of his finger, he does it by immolating the supervisor who was berating him for taking time off work to care for his sick wife, or by burning down the hab block when he has a nightmare. If he's very, very unlucky, he does it by having the nightmares in his head tearing a hole open inside his brain, and using the portal to wreak havoc in the material world. \"The records of the Witch Hunters detail many instances which serve to caution any who underestimate the danger posed by a nascent psyker: storms of energy kilometres across, psychic shock waves strong enough to shatter plasteel and towering infernos of power are but a few of the details recorded by servants of the Ordo Hereticus\".\n\nWe're also told that untrained psykers are beacons for daemons, because they have no idea how to protect themselves. They don't know what daemons are, they don't know what they are themselves. To them, they're just particularly vivid nightmares, or a whispering at the edge of hearing. There are a great many instances of a daemonic incursion starting from a daemon possessing an untrained psyker. This is why the location of psykers is so important for the Imperium. If it were as laid-back as you describe, they wouldn't have to bother hunting for them, as when they manifest their powers, they'll do crud-all, and then word will spread. The truth is far more risky. Most develop their powers \"safely\" at adolescence, but there's the chance of them staying latent until later, when a moment of stress causes them to unleash their potential, or the risk of it happening earlier. Being a psyker is not a good thing in 40k. It's a curse, not a blessingRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nOriginally Posted by TheDungenTwo things. Firstly, game rules do not equal fluff. Inquisitor also had Marines doing more damage if they threw their bolt pistol rather than firing it. Secondly, absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence. We've been given absolutely no information about the rate of psykers appearing in Tau-held areas, so to assume that it's less than Imperials is wrong. We have no GW sources telling us that humans have raised psykers in Tau-held space, therefore we have no GW sources telling us that humans have raised psykers in Tau-held spaceI don't see how that's relevant in any way whatsoever. The fact remains that we've been told absolutely nothing about the Tau and their dealings with human psykers, so to assume that it's any different from anywhere else is just an assumption. There's no evidence for it, and no reason for why it should be truePerhaps the Tau's pheromone control dulls emotions to the point where using psychic powers becomes very difficult for low power psykers, and given the small size of the empire they haven't had any truly powerful psykers.\n\nRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nI understood it this way: That the Tau do not have a warp presence and as such don't really have psykers. It could have something to do with the fact that the Tau, as a race are only about ten thousand years old. They are only at such an advanced societal and technological level because of the warp storms surrounding their planet for 6,000 years. While I don't think there's any canon that says warp storms ever do that, it is implied in the fluff. I think it has also said somewhere that no Tau has ever fallen to Chaos. This makes sense, because they must understand Chaos on a basic level, and the Greater Good demands they seek prosperity and success.\n\nRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nWell, one reason could be that despite the Controll of the Tau over the local populance they allow them a broad margin of self-government. You have to work (and die) for the greater good and accept that the tau are the noble overlords of yours but how you achive it is up to the local bodies of government. And so you still have witch-trials/burnings which have been ingrained into the local customs over millenia and the tau don't swat an eye. Because they know, as long as we allow them to burn and kill a few weirdos every year they keep quiet and do what they are told.\ntau: \"Why do you want to kill that man?\"\nformerly imperial citizen. \"He's a witch! He shows the three known signs! If we don't kill him, the world will end! It is known!\"\ntau - looking at the agitated mob armed with electro-pitchforks and torches - \"Well then. Carry on!\" Walks away muttering to himself \"Those poor backward souls, but what are you gonna do about it? Keeps 'em happy.\"\n\nRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nOriginally Posted by ryng_sting\n\nI don't think it's impossible that Chaos could corrupt a Tau. But due their position, weak warp presence, culture, lack of psykers - and the overwhelming fact that there's easier pickings elsewhere - it's probably that, for now, Chaos can't be bothered with them.\n\nIndeed. Chaos can corrupt inanimate objects, so they can certainly corrupt Tau. However why would a daemon go for the dry Tau crackers when he can also have a nice Human Big Mac (or, for that matter, a delectable Eldar steak)? Not to mention that the galaxy is absolutely filled to the brim with Big Macs, while the dry crackers are in rather short supply. Daemon do not need to watch their weight, after all.\n\nI like Corvussanctus's idea, I could see that work (they haven't completely stopped the Kroot from eating their enemies, after all, so even if the Tau find something rather gruesome they're not going to stop you if you join in for the Greater Good). I could also imagine that it in fact has gone wrong a few times, but that the Tau interpreted the whole thing as a simple human uprising and just killed the offenders when they couldn't be reasoned with. Apart from that, in-universe, the Tau as a race have simply been absurdly lucky so far.\n\nLast edited by Crazy Ivan; 19-08-2012 at 22:16.\nReason: spelling\n\nWhen in deadly danger\nWhen beset by doubt\nRun in little circles\nWave your arms and shout\n\nRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nThere is probable no 1 major reason why the tau haven't had to deal so much with chaos it more a combination of things, 1) tau have little or no warp signature, 2) they only have a small empire on the scale of things. 3) the Tau-va mentality generally is an infertile ground for chaos. 4) we also for get one thing the tau have is the Technology. i wouldn't be surprised if they made implants so human psykers could suppress there powers. remember this is the race that out adapted the Nids\n\nRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nI think people are forgetting that Imperial worlds have the Black Ships that weed out most psychers, and they also have the Imperial Creed that encourage humans to turn on anyone they fear is a psycher.\n\nHuman communities in Tau space (some which seem to be quite large in the Third Sphere of the Tau Empire, more like human worlds in the Tau Empire), would have to deal with the threat of untrained psychers without the aid of the Black Ships. Seeing from how the Tau allow other races to keep their culture, The Imperial Truth could remain more or less as it is (with less focus on 'Kill the alien!' maybe), but the Tau seem to try and have a civilising influence on the natives (meaning they would most likely try to encourage humans not to kill each other. Unity and the Greater Good and all that), meaning human communities would be even less able to protect themselves from daemonic and warp-based catastrophes because of the Tau mentality.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the Tau are wholly immune to possession, they have a lot of humans living under their roof now, and those humans are certainly not immune. The Tau presence also takes away most of the defences the humans have from chaos, meaning the problem of possession and daemonic attacks should be much greater on Tau-held human worlds than on Imperial worlds.\n\nRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nThe Black Ships can pick up maybe a dozen individuals from an entire world during a single trip. The number of psykers in Tau space would be somewhere in the tens of thousands, and most of them fairly weak, assuming the rate at which Alpha level psykers are the same as the rest of the species. This is a very easily contained number on the greater scale.\n\nFurthermore, the Tau have been fighting the Imperium for quite a while now. It's quite likely that they've encountered things like Sanctioned Psykers and Librarians hurtling lighting and fireballs at them. Now, what does an intelligent, inquisitive species who has evolved at such a stunning rate do do when it encounters new enemy assets? That's right, it researches into them. I'm fairly certain that they have performed autopsies, genetic sampling, and all manner of tests in order to get a scientific explanation as to how some humans can manifest these powers. So, what I'm saying is their knowledge of how psychic abilities work might actually be better than the Imperium's. Just because they have no innate psychic powers and no interest in developing them doesn't mean they would automatically want to be oblivious to the phenomenon. I'm fairly certain the Tau Empire can spot a psyker when it emerges, and could probably even screen for them at birth. After all, even though the humans would govern and police themselves, it's still the Tau administration that keeps the census, while health facilities, schools and generally the whole infrastructure uses Tau know-how and technology to some degree,.\n\nRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nthe thing is thay my theory that everyone (humans) is a psyker to some extant, actually explains why \"non psychic\" humans emotions have a warp echo (they basically broadcast their emotion uncontrolled through the warp at all times). Since in my theory they're not non psychic but just unable to control their psychic power. and while i a can agree that a beta psyker will never be an alpha psyker an untrained beta may become a beta+ as he becomes better at his thing, we've seen in all the role playing versions or warhammer and warhammer 40k psykers and wizards increasing in power as they get more experienced.\n\nno the lack of evidence isnt proof but it fits well with the evolving into a psychic spicies and evolving away the chaos gods stuff."

      "text": "It's NOT decided yet, but we'll do that soon. What's kinda established is that they're not gonna be replacing any of the current units, in terms of specialized efficiency. They won't excel nor suck at anything. They would be filling the gap between:\n\n- melee only and siege only units - having both ranged siege weapons and melee weapons. - short range (proximity) building damage (sac, demo, behe) and long range siege damage (balli, cata, summ) - having about half the range of the latter, 90-100m. - regular units (sprint, block/leap) and siege units - yet being siege units, they can sprint and block/leap like non-siege, but it won't help them a whole lot, except maybe for escaping. - low hp siege units (balli, summ) and high hp units (behe, cata) - only they're closer to the weaker ones. - 1-hit-1-kill units and regular units. They both should take about 3 hits to kill a pred/lego, melee or ranged. - siege that stops when shooting and siege that can hit while moving - they both are able to attack on the move. - units w/ special skills (medics) and units that have none - they would get 1 or 2 of those.\n\nWe are thinking about adding some special abilities. Already testing a 1 time use mag shield for the Mech - reducing damage to 50-60% for 10 seconds. For Glider, we wanna add corrosive effect to its ranged shots, effective on buildings, inflicting damage over time.\n\nAnother option would be dropping some objects when they die. The Mech would produce a fuel tank, which would explode when hit by friends or foes, and the Glider's spilled blood \"pool\" would be damaging to those passing through it, fire-buff style. Both expiring/exploding on their own after a while. Could make those into regular usable items too.\n\nThe Glider would be particularly better than summs/behe at coming closer to shields/hum buildings, along with preds, to hit them, as it moves fast and has high siege DPS. May take down rather fast a shielded tower, if it manages to survive this close to it.\n\nThe Mech would be good for tanking, spear-heading human pushes, shielding ballisu and demorunners by soaking up just enough damage to let friendly units do some in return. It may live long enough to take down a spire on its own.\n\nI have the same access as anyone else in testing. The textures that I contributed towards this project are already and have been for some time in RC3 so everyone has access to them. The models shown in this thread I have never used, I assume they are now in XR testing? Not sure as I haven't touched the editor in some time.\n\nI really like the mech & glider, but on the other hand a lot of work has to be done to fit in:\n\n- attack sound and animation must be exactly timed - the aiming has something odd to it. At close it becomes very hard to aim, and large distance easier but you need to aim to the right of the target ... - allow for left and right movement (applies to the mech only) now you have to move forward and turn left or right. Holding left or right key by itself doesn't do anything - the transition of some animations are poor: for example spamming left key - right key with the glider - the effect of the mech weapon is too fast. You can only spot it at large distance.\n\n- the aiming has something odd to it. At close it becomes very hard to aim, and large distance easier but you need to aim to the right of the target ...\n\nIt is intended to be this way. First, it's because it shoots from the left side, where the cannon is placed, so you have to compensate. Every weapon aim has some kind of \"bias\", Mech has its horizontal bias. Second, it's supposed to be a siege weapon with a dead zone. Don't shoot units with the Mech. If you really do, well, shooting close units will be made hard to do . And last but not least, it's a game, it has to take some skill!\n\n- the transition of some animations are poor: for example spamming left key - right key with the glider\n\nThen don't spam them! The transitions are whatever silverback allows for any other units, the difference is the Glider has a wide wing span and that makes movements more visible than hands hanging along the body. But i'll look into it, see what can be done.\n\n- the effect of the mech weapon is too fast. You can only spot it at large distance.\n\nStill not decided if you will gonna be able to see it at all. After all, it's a high velocity canon shooting small and fast projectiles, not smoking rockets. Will have to be decided upon during balancing games."

It's intended for just that: allow another hit and have the ship sink from flooding, instead of depleting hull HP and triggering that \"spectacular\" fireworks display.\n\nOne possibility is to take the RFB aproach; greatly increase HP so you have to sink by flooding. I left the HP system in so you wouldn't get into a situation where a ship soaks up 5-6 torpedoes, where 3 would have been enough with proper placement. It's there as a fallback mechanism, considering I'm not shooting for absolute realism, trying to strike a balance between realism and gameplay (that doesn't frustrate you to the point of quitting the game).\n\nOh, I like BARF, I thought the hp tweak was included in the full....? Though It would be nice if it were possible to have some ships that do sink after an hour or two... not sure... I did like the RFB system, I thought even though some hits would take forever to sink a ship, if you were in that much of a hurry then you could always sink another fish into it... and I dislike being able to pound away with a deck gun until it explodes (which i often do accidentally, while trying to sink her a tad quicker without the expenditure of another torp) But very good work on the mod\n\nLocation: Land of windmills, tulips, wooden shoes and cheese.

Don't think it would be that popular, but it might interest the realism fans.\n\nThank you for the compliment, and the feedback. Good point on triggering the pyrotechnics while shelling; had only considered torpedo damage to be honest.\n\nyeah, it's an issue for a smaller ship like a liberty where a second torpedo might not be nessisary... and I would LOVE a hardcore hp tweak\n\nHow do HP tweaks work in terms of critical locations ie fuel bunkers or a tankers cargo?

I'm nowhere near as competent as most other modders.\n\nThought I had it figured out, not so sure now; each compartment has several attributes, including one that sets it as a possible critical hit location, one that sets percentage chance of critical hit, and one that sets a damage multiplier.\n\nI'm not sure about the multiplier: does it always come into play, or just on critical hits?\n\nIf only at critical hits, you would just have to increase that multiplier to make the critical hit powerfull enough to deplete all the HP. Otherwise it might be a little trickier to rebalance it.\n\n(if no multiplier is associated with critical hits, you could assume that a critical will always destroy the ship, regardless of HP)\n\nSome testing will turn up the answer soon enough.

Perhaps this is why their violent initial expanse was so shocking - in the span of a week 7 million soldiers and crewman had died in combat. By the end of the war, it was estimated over 50 billion total lives were lost in combat. It took no time at all for the other empires to respond, yet even with 5:1 odds on the ground and 2:1 in space battles the humans caused another 300 million casualties while taking only 1 million themselves. These wars led to unfair treaties for both sides and, eventually, the grudging acceptance of these pinkies who biologically created designer drugs. Today the Trans-Anatolian military still has the largest standing army, and the 10th largest military. Yet despite this nature within the nation itself things are surprisingly accepting of every species and ideology. Indeed, those that were assimilated in the initial expansion have both become full citizens and prospered greatly; about .5% of the total population are citizen non-humans and reportedly the process and waiting period to become a citizen after immigration are incredibly speedy. When asked by reporters, an average street-walker replied thus: \"We live to fight, and we fight to free or be freed. We defend what we fight for.\" Disadvantages: average-power space forces, method of election is longer than most, lack of ready access to large amounts of hyperdrive fuel. Last Words: none; generally the sharp end of a knife up into the chest.\n\nSorry if I had part of destroying your last thread (I'm not sure if I did), but would it be ok if I play as long as I obey the rules? Empire: Mistel Species: Elven, who live until killed but reproduce very rarely Gov't type: Monarchy, with a royal family and large group of nobles and warlords Political parties: Loyalists - 70% Neutrals (aka those who are fine with anything that doesn't kill them) - 25% Warmongers (want military control) - 5% Ships (as of posting): 17 Imperial frigates, 8 heavy frigates, 15 mon calamari frigates (I got the types from here, since I'm not very imaginative with ships) Number/names of Stars Controlled: Sorne531, Sorne534, Jaren73, and Jukai42 Number of habitable planets colonized: 3 Number of Military outposts: 27 Population: 47 billion citizens, 500 million immigrants soon to have legal status, and 2 million aliens of other allegiance Description (of empire): Starting thousands of years ago as a small empire of forest dwellers, Mistel plotted many years of the downfall of their neighbors until they finally took over their first planet under their leader King Jaren, who named the planet after himself. They allowed the other races to live on Jaren, as long as they paid respect to their King and showed no hostility. Many years later, after a warlord named Sorne lead the first attack upon the stars, new planets were discovered in the general vicinity of Jaren, and were colonized under the warlords command. The new planet was named by King Jaren after the warlord, and thus the Empire Mistel then controlled the planets Jaren and Sorne. During the third exploration, a small rebellion of Humans and Dwarves on the planet Jaren led by an elven noble named Jukai had stormed the King's castle and forced Jaren off the throne. Jaren lived from that moment on for 2000 years on a prison base in the planet conquered at that time (named after the new leader, Jukai) and still resides there to this day. King Jukai appointed Sorne to conquer the stars, and as each star was conquered it was named by both the planet it was conquered from and the number of the first ship to claim it. The empire realized its losses soon after the conquests, and because of the difficult and long process of reproduction the nation became aloof and passive to avoid the loss of any more of its citizens and soldiers. If provoked, they will take the most powerful action until the threat is no more. Disadvantages (must include at least one military and one resource disadvantage): Military - Because elves live for thousands of years, and do not die of old age, it is much more rare for infants to be born. This means that each soldier or citizen killed is almost irreplaceable. Soldiers can die by any means that humans can die, which means that battles with human nations must be taken with precaution as humans gain population much faster. Resource - Because most space technology Mistel owns is limited, resources such as weapons and food being shipped between planets is a long process and van be disastrous if interrupted. Last Words: Elven practice is to keep a paper with the words they would like to remembered by at all times, although the paper is usually lost with the body.\n\nSorry if I had part of destroying your last thread (I'm not sure if I did), but would it be ok if I play as long as I obey the rules?\n\nEntirely okay. I think you are an okay guy despite the postbest friendry you may or may not have caused.\n\nBut is it okay if we assume that your empire is in a different star group than Sol's due to the names? It's not that I'm disallowing inventing your own stars/names for stars, it's just we've got to assume they weren't found in the 21st century etc etc. Also it gives us an actual chance to use the Gates.The former, mostly. Things like fighting can occur over what each empire does.\n\nSorry if I almost singlehandedly destroyed the last thread with far too much interpersonal chatter.\n\nEmpire: Gerministic Empire Species: Germin. Offshoot of humans, mostly descendants of human pirates Gov't type: Single-Party Republic Political parties: War Party Ships (as of posting): 225 Mörder class interceptors; Other types are in development Number/names of Stars Controlled: Sirius only Number of habitable planets colonized: 2 Number of Military outposts: 4, in the outer planets of the Sirius system Population: ~6 billion. This figure changes rapidly due to frequent births and deaths Description: This empire is highly warlike, and recently founded. They still recognize the need for trade, however, and will build up trade alliances before daring to strike at another empire. Disadvantages: Medicine is very underdeveloped, and disease runs rampant. As such, they are highly susceptible to bioweaponry. Their two planets are very poor in nutrients, and obtaining food is very hard, however, these planets are very rich in rare metals and gems. Last Words: At least you won't be making it out, either."

      "text": "My friends and I came up with a new option for those who suffer from players who don't like them attacking other players (ie., husband on wife fighting). We came up with a pirate race. Here's the rules:1) Roll a d10/2. This is the max number of \"pieces\" to build at a pirate owned space dock. You have 6 resources with which to build (no matter what the planet/space dock does - since the pirates can't get tech, that seemed the fairest option). The speaker gets to choose which space dock to build at, if the pirates have more than 1 dock out.\n\n2) All pirate ships in a system move as one fleet. Any ships that end up landing in a system with other Pirate ships automatically become part of that fleet and stop moving (we usually start with the smallest fleet). The pirates have no fleet size restrictions. All pirate ships ignore red bordered tiles, they can freely move into, out of or stop in any tile. The Pirates also do not activate any Domain tokens or bother any neutral planets. There is a 50/50 chance that a Pirate fleet will use wormhole (if they are in the wormhole nexus, they randomly go through a wormhole).\n\n3) The speaker rolls a d6 to determine the direction the fleet moves (we originally had a rule that they would move automatically to an adjacent tile if there was a player there, but when one of our players had a War Sun parked on the tile adjacent to the Pirate home world, the pirates didn't stand a chance).\n\n4) The Pirate fleet moves as fast as the slowest vessel in the fleet. If the whole fleet can move more than 1 tile, they roll their direction on each tile they land in.\n\n5) If the Pirates land in a system with a player or a player owned planet, they will attack. If they attack a player owned planet, the fleet will drop all their fighters/ground forces/mech units on that planet. On their next turn, the Pirates will build a space dock on that planet. If all the Pirates space docks are already out, the fleet will leave the units on that plant and take as direct a route as possible to their nearest space dock to resupply the fleet.\n\n6) Pirate ships and planets count as \"enemies\" or \"players\" for any cards, strategies or objectives.\n\n7) If a player wipes out the Pirates home planet (typically for an objective), that player must move their ships out of the Pirate's home system on their next turn. The turn after that, place a free space dock on the Pirate home world and begin building again.\n\nI believe that covered everything. We played once so far with this and it was great fun. The husbands finally got to blow things up. :) Have fun pirate hunting!\n\nThere is a similar variant that I discovered at BoardGameGeek. It involves neutral or independent planets. Instead of a fixed number of resources, the creator had a die roll determine what the neutral force would build. Different ranges on the die corresponded to the various ship types with War Suns being removed.\n\nIn general I like the idea of a neutral force that just does their own thing but will defend themselves. I'm working on a scenario that involves independent planets tied to game events.Oops. I meant to say the system with the highest Resource adjacent to Mecatol Rex. :P\n\nI'll have to find that option about neutral planets. Maybe I can integrate it with this idea. We like the idea of the ships flying around hunting players."

      "text": "this is the Alternate Universe Server B mod chaos theory. This is a mod that runs 24/7 365 days a year\n\nhere are the rules of the game:\n\nThe following outlines LOS (Line of Supply) rules.\nCurrently we are using only LOS rules not AO at this point. Many of the following rules mention \"poor sportsmanship\". Players exibiting excessive poor sportsmanship will be deleted from the server without notice. Also at any time an admin or Race Moderator may be online. They have the right to order a player to leave, come to, or stop in a hex. Players must follow these orders.\n\nThe Admins are: Tech, Eliminator, Lancer\n\nRace Moderators are\n\nFederation: StormBringer\n\nKlingon: Scully\n\nRomulan: ZED\n\nBorg: LordShlong\n\n1. Map movement - These rules define when you can enter an enemy controlled hex and are the cornerstone of what makes the campaign so fun. You can only move into hexes that your race has \"influence\" in. Your race automatically has influence in all hexes of your empire. Your race has influence in any hex that is adjacent to a hex controlled by your empire if an unbroken line can be drawn to a friendly base or planet. If your supply line is broken at any time you must withdraw to space that is within LOS and continue from there.\n\n2. Any intentional disconnection from a Human vs Human mission will result in your account being deleted. All cases will be decided by the Race Leaders and Server Admin on a case-by-case basis. Repeat offenders will be banned from the server.\n\n3. Any form of outright cheating, exploiting of game bugs or similar activity to destroy ships or gain prestige is considered being chance to be banned. If you're not sure weather what you're doing is cheating, ask your Race Leader for clarification.\n\n4. Self Destruct Rule - If you lose connection during a Human vs Human battle in which your ship was destroyed by enemy fire or by collision with a space object such as a planet, asteroid or Black hole, you should self destruct your ship upon reconnecting to the server. Failure to do so constitutes being banned.\n\n5. In a Human vs Human battle you may not attack your enemy before he has raised his shields, charged his weapons or begun moving. It is considered poor sportmanship to suckerpunch your opponent. This includes warping right next to your opponent and waiting for him to drop into the game. Maintain your distance until your opponent is in the game.\n\n6. Forfeits - Note that causing players to autoforfeit by attacking them before their movement que is complete is considered poor sportsmanship. Wait a couple seconds to make sure they are fully in your hex.\n\n7. Hex sniping is expressly forbidden. Hex sniping is when players of one race have turned a hex neutral, and someone from an opposing race runs a mission in that hex to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. When a hex turns neutral, the race that reduced that hex has all the rights to it, and if the hex goes neutral and then for any reason turns any color other than the reducing race's, your race will be penalized in territory, and your account will be deleted. This includes going into a mission while the hex is still colored and coming out of the mission while it's neutral. Don't even think about stopping the enemy from turning your hexes after they have spent all their time working the hex DV down. You will pay a lot and gain nothing.\n\n8. Race Leaders - A Race Leader will be appointed for each race, and that leader may choose an assistant. Race Leaders are free to retire their assistants and appoint new ones at their discretion. Race Leaders will be in command of their race's strategy during the campaign. It is strongly advised that all players follow the plans and orders of their Race Leaders, as this promotes teamwork and good sportsmanship, and improves the quality of the game for all players. Your Race Leader is there to help your team win, and answer questions about the campaign, your empire and the game. Neither piloting skill nor flying the biggest ship will win for your team. Only teamwork will bring victory.\n\n9. This is the established dispute resolution policy: If you have a complaint about another player, take a screenshot of the offensive activity (if appropriate) and talk to your Race Leader about it. Please keep in mind that out of thousands of players and almost a dozen campaigns, I have run across less than ten real cheaters. The guy who tractored you at range 180 is probably not cheating, one of you is probably experiencing lag. Laggy games and poor dialup internet connections can cause the game to do some crazy stuff, so think about it before you accuse someone of cheating.\n\n10. Players and poor connections - Not everyone has a smoking internet connection. Those of you using dailup internet connections such as AOL (lord help you poor sods...) are still welcome to play, but if your poor connection interferes with normal human vs human matches, you should avoid large battles. Race Leaders and server admins may ask some players with poor connections to not engage in pvp battles in extreme cases.\n\n11. Lost prestige due to bugs, ect will not be replaced.\n\n12. The fallen empire have to switch to another empire.\n\nYour empire has no planets.\n\nYou have to Switch to a new empire.\n\n13. Scouting - Any player may go \"scouting\" within enemy territory, provided they follow these rules. Note that scouting can be used to traverse enemy controled space to get to other areas of the map.\n\n...That has to sound like the most pathetic SFC server I've seen. It makes SFC looks as bad as people trying to turn first person shooters into role-playing games! (Examples being the Elite Force or Jedi Knight series)\nIn my opinion, if you're able to do it and everyone else is, then it is allowed as the creators have made it allowed. However, it seems quite clear people who thrive on some kind of power like this, don't follow this. So, whatever floats your boat.\n\nActually, if you spent time playing the game rather than running your mouth, you'd know that Alternate universe is probably the best server out there. The ships are ballanced, and they are not super fast either. The Chaos theory mod as seen here is set in a time durring the era of TOS. Slower ships, weaker weapons, but all ships are like that so it's still evenly matched. I invite everyone to download the newest mod \"A Call to Arms\" Available now. Rock on"

      "text": "Pirate Dilemma\n\nYarlen\n\nBy order of the TEC, Advent, and Vasari ambassadors, we've been asked politely to open a dialog to the Pirates about their recent strength and incursions.\n\nThey, quite undiplomatically, told us what we could do with our demands.\n\nObviously, such disregard for the peace of the local cluster can't be allowed, so a task force has been formed to extend a more reasonable diplomatic effort to the Pirates. One which our Vasari colleague called, \"Forceful\" and \"Prudent.\"\n\nThe task forc...err, peace envoys, are due to arrive next week to creatively express our feelings to the Pirates. Rest assured, a diplomatic solution is forthcoming.\n\nShout out for IC, for addressing the pirates. Good or bad? That's an opinion... but they definitely have game-changing potency as is. Although I'd love to see a \"nerf pirates\" option, acknowledgement to those dig them... and I do have to admit I've taken some pleasure in using them as a monetary wand-of-death +5...\n\nOnly gravity gets it all perfect. I'm new to Sins but am thoroughly impressed by, the complexity it tackles, and the intuitive + sophistocated interface. As a dev, I imagine that takes guts, because you know there are going to be game-changing imbalances you missed with testing, if nothing else do to the skill level of the test group. Thanks for a beautiful game and your responsiveness.\n\n2. Once this cap is reached, you can have multiple raids without increasing the raid fleet number to avoid slowdowns. IE, you get pirated, but they hit two or three planets simultaneously with medium fleets. Hurts even more to defend on multiple fronts.\n\nI think that as another late-game option for more pirate power, instead of ridiculously powerful ships, is letting them launch initially one , then more stealth raids without a bid. They would just pick one player - usually the most powerful - and attack it. if the game goes on longer, pirates will attack the 2 most powerful, then the 3 most powerful etc.\n\nI've said so before, but I still really like the idea of the pirate timer either being unknown or at the very least randomized. What pirates stick so well to a timetable?\n\nRegarding possible solutions to their current ridiculous overpowered state late-game, I was going to write something like FlyingNinja but he put it much more succinctly and so I'll just agree. Pirates really should be about hitting weak points and even if the AI can't determine that, it must be smarter to hit a few different worlds at once than to send everything to that border world that has a starbase and the entire player's fleet sitting at it.\n\nWould it be more annoying? Yes, but it would do so without having to have the pirates possess godly strength.\n\nIt would be nice if pirates could return home after a successful attack. Success could be defined as X number of credits stolen and/or destruction of a colony. This could match up with the timer idea as a returning pirate fleet with spoils could stay at the base for a while upgrading ships or if enough ships were combat-ready, soon after launch another attack. I'm not sure the code allows it, but I'd still like to see the pirates after gathering enough credits research shield generators and equip at least their heavier ships with them.\n\nA lot of those suggestions are not probable to make it in or not even possible I'd imagine, so below is what I think should be done minimally:\n\nFor the strength of the units itself, I'd like to see what others have proposed and give them either copied abilities, or even better, unique ones instead of raw numeric stat increases. In regard to the DPS numbers, I could actually buy their ships being slightly above whatever max the races can reach at end-game as I'd imagine they care much less about crew safety and are willing to install dangerous upgrades that regular fleet captains would scorn. Reasonable limits again though as in 5-15% stronger, not mobile starbases.\n\nI knew that I could not tolerate their incursions into Trader space any longer, so I did the unthinkable. I ordered that 2 novalith cannons be used to eradicate the menace once and for all. We nuke their base.\n\nI then decided to send in a clean up force to rid the last of them and take the base for my own. I sent a small advance scout force to assess the remaining threat and they were greeted with defense canons that could do 57 points of damage per shot and had 11500 armor points. Keep in mind that is about half of a fully upgraded starbase and then note that they had like 20 of these. They also had about 200 overpowered ships in the grav well.\n\nI knew that today would be one of the bloodiest and told my men to be brave and fight well, we had to remove them before they attempted to flee and rebuild some where else. so I committed my entire fleet (fully upgraded and with 6 pacts from the advant)\n\nNeedless to say we lost many men that day. Good soldiers all willing to fight and preserve the TEC. In the end we were lucky enough to get an assist from our Advant allies. The battle to rid us of the pirate menace, but wow such power should not be in the hands of men who serve to home world.\n\nI like the pirates as they are. IMPO they are still quite weak but more anoying now for sure.\n\nDo you play modded or something? I'm getting pirate cruisers with more hp/armor/dps than any of my level 10 cap ships. If you consider that weak, you're either cheating or playing a mod, or just trying to talk up your ePeen. I mean ffs, these things can rickroll a fully defended system in less than 4 minutes.\n\nI think perhaps they should be... well, more piratical and a bit less like a massive military power. I think the high-power raids should still happen, but only through suitably lucartive mission offers (the idea being that such offers would draw mercenaries from across the galaxy, or some suitably fluffy explanation ).\n\nRaiding on multiple fronts, focusing more on economic damage (maybe give pirate ships a few econ-hurting abilities, similar to embargo?) both seem like good ideas to me. Sabotage also seems like something pirates would be well suited to. I think pirates should be in it for the money. Craftier pirates, pirates that make you pull your hair out because they did something clever, as opposed to the flying-tanks-from-hell that they are now, would be much cooler.\n\nFor example: Right now there is nothing you can do, short of taking over the planet, when someone discoveres an artifact. Giving pirates an ability to roll back planet exploration would be an interseting twist.\n\nThat said, I do like the the fact that in Diplomacy it is usually more cost effective to keep the pirates alive and bid them up to damage your opponents. I'd really prefer that this not change, because I like the idea that pirates are difficult to exterminate (even if I did grumble when I discovered the flak defenses on those turrets... oww my bombers ).\n\n2. Pirates doesn't fit properly in the Sin's background. How it's possible to have a small ship more armored than a space station ? How pirates living on an asteroid can be more evolved than a space empire with billion of people, research centers, universities... ? TEC have surely a strong industrial capacity, after all they are an economic power, but their ships seems to be build in pulpboard when they fight against pirates.\n\nMy ideas : Dramaticly reduce the buffs (or simply remove it, that sucks). Pirates uses a new type of weapon (some kind of radioactive ammunitions, not sure) that can bypass shields and armor. The purpose is to have pirates who kill less, but can seriously damage a fleet. Other civilizations don't use that kind of weapon because it's extremely dangerous and instable. Pirates are nuts, or they uses slaves, or they don't really care about their health... anyway a good pirate is a dead pirate so TEC&co scientists never really got the chance to study it.\n\nAnd I read some very good ideas : Give pirates some economic \"damages\". A planet attacked by the pirates have debuff on metal/crystal extraction, very high debuff on trade, and no impact on taxes (we all know that tax collectors don't have feelings) due to the fear they inspire amongst the population (like when wisigoths/mongols/babarians attacked the roman empire). On middle/late game, pirates can attack one or many planets. We never know if we will encounter 1 strong fleet or many weaker, and with economic debuff it can be devastating.\n\none thing i would like to see if it is possible is the ability for a single player to secretly pay the pirates and publically pay the pirates at the same time. potentially winning in both auctions. right now it seems that it is all just one big auction with two different venues from which to pay. this is really too bad because there is much potential strategy thwarted by merely having the one end result.\n\nquestion: in the game as is right now - can a team of 3 (locked or unlocked) participate in the auction such that one team members public auction activity does not negate another team members private auction activity?\n\nedit: i mean of course the end result presupposes negation in terms of who wins but what if the team wanted to give the appearance that they were buying publically but were actually buying privately by funnelling money to one player to use as auction money?\n\noh yeah well also....maybe just up the experience points that the pirates give and not even change how tough they are or how they level up....at least thatll make someone think twice about paying for the services of pirates if they are potentially paying for your caps to level up\n\nWell, I managed to invade a pirate baseafter a few hours of gameplay. It's no walk in the park, you have to really devote yourself. 9600+ hull gauss guns, 4000+ hull ships... but I wanted the achievement!\n\nI think it is a bit ludricrous that the devs refused giving capital ships to the pirates because they are supposed to be low tech, yet they have super-duper infinitely growing powerful friggin FRIGATES stronger than capital ships. Ludicrous.\n\nI think on a futuristic setting like this, education would be pervasive, thus it would NOT be uncommon to find all kinds of Ph.D. scientists willing to wage war on civilization and 10-star generals disgruntled with their governors, willing to defect to piracy. I say get rid of the notion of the pirates being low-tech. Give them star bases and hangars for their defense, give them ships from all 3 factions, and give them capital ships.\n\nIf you are willing to make changes a bit deeper to the game, let the players pay bounty with ships as well as money. Giving a capital ship is a pretty convincing way of telling the pirates to attack the target I want. You could put in an incentive for players to give them ships, like being safe from raids for X raids, depending on the amount of ships given to them. Erm, scout and colony ships should have no value to pirates.\n\nyes but it seems like the way it is working right now, and i could be wrong on this as my last couple Dip games have been 1v1....but if you try and buy into the public auction it cancels out the private auction....you know what i mean?\n\ngo into the private auction and bid there. wait for the timer to start.....now go into the public auction and bid there....now go back into the private auction....the timer disappears (and if you wait until the end of the auction time the no-longer-timed private money wont count)...now pay some more money into the private auction....timer starts back up from the beginning and only one of the auction prices count towards the piracy auction result....i have never seen it occur that the private auction timer ends and the pirates just go do that right then....which brings me to ask the question: why does the private auction timer exist in the first place? what is its function other than potentially evening out the bidding war playing field?\n\nseems almost like a contradiction in terms thats all. its not that its horrible right now its just that its falling short of its potential\n\nright now there are 2 auctions ending up in one result. it seems there should be 2 auctions ending in 2 results, one of which is publically transparent, one of which is not. that seems like a better and more consistent/meaningful way of doing it.\n\nim also wondering whether or not the computer recognizes the targets/missions chosen in the private auction and compiles money for bids that are similar and acts according to the compiled result or whether the result is decided by the single highest bidder. it seems like if 3 people are paying 2000 dollars for a hit on one planet that that mission should win over 1 person paying 4000 dollars for something else....but then again....perhaps this is not a good idea as it makes ganging up too easy and narrows the scope for strategies allowed\n\nI hadn't realized that they had beefed up the Pirates so much - I now realize what you all are saying.\n\nI guess, with respect to the Pirates, is what should their role in Diplomacy be? What was wrong with their roles in original Sins and Entrenchment?\n\nSimply making them gain power throughout the game seems like a good idea at first, but the problem is that there is a point where they are more powerful than any planet in the game. This has been said throughout this topic. The way it is now, you really need to focus on eliminating them, but you cannot divert resources unless you have a bunch of allies.\n\nCase in point, I just played a 3-player game with 2 computer players and me. I tried to attack the Pirates after I had eliminated 1 player and I couldn't believe my eyes how powerful they were. I had a fleet of 2x every Vasari Capital Ship (all at least level 5); 12x Jikara Navigator, Ravastra Skrimisher, Kanrak Assailant, Karrastra Destructor, and Junsurak Sentinel; and 6x Lasurak Transporter, Stilakus Subverter, Serevun Overseer, and Skarovas Enforcer - that's 96 ships! All fully upgraded and I ended up losing a significant number of ships without even starting on any of their defenses. I decided to simply reload and take care of my other computer oppenent and then went after the Pirates after the last computer was defeated by selecting \"Keep Playing\".\n\nSo if the developers don't want the Pirates being destroyed easily by a single player, then I think they succeeded. However, is this what we want the Pirates doing in Diplomacy?\n\nI'm partial to a setting letting you select the Pirates strength, but as other people have alluded to it seems like there should be a different way to make the Pirates more interesting than simply overpowering their ships and defenses.\n\nHere are some things to think about:\n\nIt has been mentioned to scale the experience points of the Pirates as they increase in strength - this may make it worth your while to try to go after them.\n\nIt seems like there should be more ships that are less powerful than fewer ships that are more powerful. An interesting thing may be to allow the Pirates to salvage ships they destroy (this is similar to the capturing idea someone mentioned) such that on the next raid there may be a salvaged TEC, Advent, or Vasari ship (effectively a \"reincarnated\" version of that ship with all its capability when it was destroyed). This would give them a bit of power without making them ridiculous.\n\nIt may make sense to give the Pirates some kind of effect. Some people have alluded to an Embargo type ability - this sounds really interesting.\n\nAnother effect may be to give them the effect of a moving Culture structure (like a Broadcast Center, etc.) such that the loyalty of planets is affected by the size of the fleet attacking planets (i.e. a certain fleet size scales the loyalty effect accordingly).\n\nAnother effect may be to give the player who paid for the raid shared intelligence from the planet the Pirates attack (essentially shared ship vision while the Pirates are attacking said planet). This gives even more incentive to pay for a raid.\n\nAdding a sabotage capability to Pirates might be interesting where if they are able to deploy a saboteur team to a structure or planet, it either suffers damage or has reduced capability for a period of time.\n\nWith respect to Pirate planets, if the developers want to prevent their planets from being captured easily maybe it makes sense to let them (once again) salvage destroyed planetary structures and add them to their planet(s) for defense. The more you lose to the Pirates, the stronger they get.\n\nThese are just some ideas to help spur the discussion and give the developers a bit more to chew on - I do agree, though, that it seems like Pirates should not be the Dread Lords of Sins.\n\nI don't mind having strong pirates. But at the moment I see 2 main issues:\n\n_ Pirate ships are way too strong compared to faction ships. You can't guess the balance of powers until it's too late. I outnumbered them by 2 in a system they attacked and my forces justed melted like snow under the sun. I saw them coming and I had reinforcements but I never thought that so few of them could steamroll my defenses in a few minutes. You can't manage multiple fronts if you can't get an idea of how strong they are in a matter of seconds. Give them as many ships as you see fit but please, lower their strength so that we can assess their strength more quickly. The ideal solution would be to have their number vary more and their ship strength vary less.\n\n_ Faction AIs don't know what to do with them. They rarely spend money into the bounty system (in hard, at least). The result is that you can double your fleet with a thousand credits worth of bounties and then throw your fleet into the huge breach they carved. An AI in normal difficulty gave up in one of my games a few minutes after a pirate raid. They had several planets remaining. I suspect that they got overwhelmed by pirates and gave up like they would do against a faction player. It looked a lot like a ragequit to me.\n\nSince some people gave suggestions, here is mine. I want pirates to last long, and I want them to be a threat for any faction. Here is my scenario:\n\nPirates' homeworld is an asteroid and can be conquered. But, being an asteroid, it has little value for any other faction. The cost involved in its taking would not be worth the reward.\n\nPirates have the whole map revealed. (They have people infiltred in every faction). When they strike, they strike where a faction is the weakest.\n\nPirates goal is not to kill people. They need those people to produce goods, so they they can rob them again and again. When they attack, they target civilian structures and destroy them quickly, they bomb the planet up to half its health for the fun of it and jump to another planet if they didn't face any resistance. When they get their ass kicked, they retreat to their base.\n\nTheir bombing could have an impact on planet allegiance, it would reflect the feeling of insecurity left in their wake.\n\nPirates remember who encouraged piracy by gaving them money. After their base has been crushed (and some time has elapsed), they spawn again on the nearest asteroid/planet belonging to the player who gave them the most money (pirates are more likely to hide where they are welcomed).\n\nResults: _ There will always be pirates. _ Pirates are a real hindrance but don't put a whole faction into jeopardy. (They raid planets, they are not world eaters). _ Abusing of the bounty system and of the strength of the pirates can be risky: if two players got tired and gather their fleet to wipe them out, you lose a planet/asteroid. _ Players won't try to crush pirates as fast as possible because there will always be pirates anyway. It's better to know where to point the guns than having uglies spawn on the other side of them. Besides there is no need for their base to be better defended than the death star. _ It's funny to see the richest guy have a pirate base pop in his empire.\n\nJust decided to try taking the pirate base, at the end of a 9+ hr game. took a maxed out fleet of 6 lvl 10 caps and about 260 frigates, 150 of them LRFs, with all military research completed. I managed to take out about 1/3 of their ships, and didn't even touch the 20 or so turrets.\n\nThere were also about 35 more ships out raiding one of my planets at the time I attacked.\n\nJust counting what was actually at the base when I attacked, they had a total of 729658 hull points. My orkys had about 21000, so that's the equivalent of about 35 fully upgraded starbases in one gravwell, in terms of defense. Possibly more, actually, because the ships have more armour than my starbases seem to get. If I could be bothered to calculate the damage I'm sure it would be in a similar area.\n\nJust in case anyone was curious but didn't want to play a massive long game to find out!\n\nmaybe another good idea (or maybe not)...but what if the more research the pirates do, the more expensive they become, the more experience they are worth and the longer the bidding period lasts....something like that...."

Or, see if you can get a Titan on loan from one of your buddies, and scout that thing right in the middle of his army. You might be a little gimmick heavy if you do that, though. Just the Baneblade, showing up to hammer at a flank, would be a good hammer and anvil with the rest of your forces. That, plus Deathstrikes, would at least give you a nice large killcount.\n\nYeah, that's what I was afraid of, and why I mentioned drop pods in the second post. Reserves-based armies are a pain in the rump. The best thing I can think of for them is either plenty of plasma-Russes or a couple tooled-up Vultures. Actually, would a squad or two of Valkeries do the job? Or would the SMs just be able to field too many marines for the lascannons to gun them down? I'm not too familiar with that, I usually don't go up against SMs with loads of drop pods.\n\nArtilery's no good if the enemy can just drop-deploy right on top of you. But, if you're fighting an army that isn't drop-oriented, then you can moonscape 'em pretty good with a Deathstrike or two.\n\nIt's only going to have a shoe-box sized hole if he's not running them in Drop Pods, which is the only way to actually run a Battle Company in Apoc. There's too much ordnance, too much 'D' weaponry being thrown around to make it worthwhile to put them in Rhinos. Drop Pods let you get closer, double-tap the footsloggers, and provide 106 Marines as a distraction while the heavy-hitters on your team get set to rock and roll.\n\nFoul traitors! How dare you turn the Emperor's most blessed gifts against... psshahahahaha, oh man. Yeah, I kinda twigged to that when you asked about the SM Battle Company. Just make sure that Deathstrikes are codex-legal for L&D armies. Also, they're freakin' expensive. 1 Deathstrike is $60, I'm pretty sure, and if you really wanna mop the floor, you're gonna want 2 or 3 of 'em.\n\nOr, one Deathstrike and a couple of Basalisks. Manticores are iffy, they eat blobs but SM's are hardier stuff. I'd recommend you have a ton of blob guard out front to soak bullets while the artillery gets cocked and ready in the back row.\n\nAlso, watch out for deep strikes. If he's smart, he'll try to land a drop pod right on top of your artillery park, or sneak some Termies in. Bring along an Officer of the Fleet, and you can make him re-roll which side of the board he brings his guys in from. Not sure what to do about drop pods, though. Bottom line, if you're going heavy artillery, make it a surprise. Pay that extra 20 or so points for camo netting, unless you have Fantastic Obscuring Cover. Otherwise he's going to longrange you with a Conversion Beam or something. (Also, if you really wanna troll, bring along a Master of Ordinance. One more mini-basalisk will only help, and it's Apocalypse so you won't notice the points. Hopefully.)\n\nOne awesome thing about Apocalypse games is that the models are usually crammed in on top of each other on a small board. If you know he's only got about 5ft by 3ft or less to deploy in, then bring a squad or two of Leeman Russ Executioners, your usual dudes, and 2 Deathstrikes. If Tzeench is with you, you'll roll well and wipe out 2 big ole pieplates worth of his dudes, then follow it up infantry backed with armor.\n\nA question. I've seen Heldrakes used to great effect on SMs at my FLGS. Have you tried them?\n\nDude, it's an 8in-12in pieplate of death that ignores cover saves by default. It's AP 1. It's gonna cremate all those Termies and footslogging Space Marines, and it deals its full strength of 10 to anything inside that huge pieplate. Unless you really screw up on the scatter roll, you're gonna wipe out their command squad and evaporate most of their heavies. It's mainly a psychological tool, like Sly Marbo. The enemy has to space out his guys massively to avoid offering up a juicy target for your Chimera-portable ICBM, which means they can't offer as much covering fire for one another as they should.\n\nIf the dice are with you and you can chuck it on turn 2, then it's like an I-WIN button. That Battle Company is gonna have a shoebox-shaped hole in the middle of it. If not, and you can't haul it out till turn 6, then you can still atomize whatever's been annoying you. In my experience, a couple of Basilisks are better, just chuck ammo downrange and moonscape 'em. Still, Deathstrike is a great way of scaring the tar out of the opposition.\n\nPewter is a bit much to ask of Hasbro, but praise the Emperor and pass the Promethium, for the Death Korps of Krieg are lookin' good. I'm talking about Forgeworld resin, not the poor models who look like they lost their Gellar Field on their trip through the warp. If Forge World made a Pinkie Pie model, I would frickin' have her crewing the Basilisk.\n\nStrike that. She's a Deathstrike kinda girl. T-Minus five minutes to PARTY HARD! And counting."

When they reach the appropriate density, the shuttle releases both an encoded warning signal and a burst of electricity, which travels on the collection of conductive crystals onto the surface of other ships.\n\nThe coded signal is an automatic thing that lets nearby ships know to disconnect the secondary hull from the primary hull - enabling the electricity to travel straight over the hull as if it was part of the crystalline network. (similarly to how lightning can strike an airplane and leave everyone alive) >.>\n\nLogged\n\nIdeas? Suggestions? Concerns? Bugs to be squashed? Report them on the Mantis Bugtracker! *ballpark, it's the **electromagnetic waves (which would be a closer referent to the word \"electricity\") that move at significant fractions of c.\n\n*ballpark?\n\n**electromagnetic waves is going more into the forms of radiation(which is electricaly charged particles), but the electric shuttle is not shooting out radiation, it is shooting(or rather \"releasing\") out just plain electricity(not particles). Electricity is the movement of elections, electromagnetic waves do have something to do with electrons, but that does not exactly make it electricity.\n\nIt depends on the medium; you could be looking at a millimeter per second, or 18,000 miles per second.\n\nQuote\n\nElectricity is the movement of elections, electromagnetic waves do have something to do with electrons, but that does not exactly make it electricity.\n\nIt depends on the dictionary, it seems, but I was referring to the presence and flow of electric charge, which does not depend on significant net movement of the electrons themselves.\n\nThe electric weapons in AI War presumably function by delivery of an electric charge sufficient to disrupt the normal operation of the target (including important stuff like, you know, reactor containment and nervous systems), as opposed to simply bombarding the ship with electrons like a particle beam or some such.\n\nLook i'm sorry :-) I did not want to spark this discussion and it is not like AI War is aiming for realism. From a physics point of view, the first thing to object would then be the movement of space ships and fixed structures around a planet or even spider turrets. I mean...if you kill the engines of a space craft it does not stop. It keeps on moving, and moving, and moving...\n\nSo i was basically yammering about lightning in space where the lightning supposedly visuallises flowing current (or as keith words it- charge delivery). Because the glowing jagged lines (in air such as during a thunderstorm) is a glowing plasma of heated gas as the current flows through the gas and additionally without medium there cannot be any current in the first place.\n\nI liked the idea of an artifical medium, although the Faraday-Cages probably would protect the ships even without warning. If the hull is conducting, the current will flow around the ship (but through the hull). If the hull is not conducting the current will flow around the ship (through the artificial medium). After the attack most of the ships will then probably be charged. This probably wouldn't have any larger effects as the inside of any charged object is free of electric fields. (The ships would repel each other though :-) ).\n\nAs for the drift speed vs speed of electricity the analogy of a garden hose explains the difference quite elegantly. Imagine a long garden hose (filled with water). Now you open the faucet and water will almost immediately pour out of the other end. However, it will take some time until the water that just left the faucet reaches the end of the hose."

      "text": "When i was relatively new to the project, i created this topic on terraforming. Looking back, i think the idea was too complicated.\n\nThese are the basic rules for terraforming. It has been argued that something more complex should be put in place, but you can always add complexity later.\n\nWith the terraforming tech you can terraform a planet to any EP. However you can only terraform one step at a time. Functionally terraforming is like a building project. It has a rather high PP for each step around the EP wheel. Thus planets with an EP near your desired EP will be much more desirable targets because they can be terraformed at 1/4 the time and PP that would be required for the worst EPs. This is IMHO sufficient.\n\nOnce the step is complete the terraforming \"building\" disappears and the planet's EP is changed.\n\nSome have argued that terraformed planets should be \"fragile\" and with some sort of attack could be reverted to their original form. However this only make sense with certain EPs. For instance if you terraformed an ocean planet into a barren one, it would make absolutely no sense for the barren planet to revert to it's former state for any reason. Since reversion doesn't make sense for all EPs it should not be included.\n\nTech tree:\n\nPlanetary Geology (30) + Planetary Ecology (30)\n\nallow Terraforming (45) —requires colony on the planet. each step on the EP wheel requires\n\nNanotech Production (80) + Orbital infrastructure (30)\n\nallows Advanced Terraforming (120) —faster and only requires a colony in the same system\n\nIt may not be necessary to make more advanced terraforming cost less PP. Just being able to do it (much) faster is probably enough incentive to get the more expensive techs.\n\nIn your proposed new techs, do the later terraforming techs require the earlier ones?\n\nThe tech tree scripting should be trivial - just copy an existing theory tech or application that does nothing (there are a few) and change the stringtable entries and cost. Since there won't be anything to unlock and the techs won't have any direct effect, there's no complicated effects scripting to be done.\n\nTo make it possible to build a terraforming project, we'd need to add the capacity to add \"actions\" or \"projects\" or somesuch to the production queue. These would cost PP and take time to build, and when complete, would cause an effect to fire, probably for one turn. That effect would change the planet type (environment) in the case of terraforming projects.\n\nAlternatively, something like the above could be hacked with the current system by making a building that changes its planet's type once, then does nothing in subsequent turns. I forget if there's a destroy effect, but if so, the building could destory itself after firing the terraforming effect.\n\n(Aside: we might also want \"ongoing projects\" or somesuch, which cost PP each turn, but which also have effects that fire every turn...)\n\nAlso, FYI I've made (almost?) every tech cost 1 PP and take 1 turn to research in SVN. There's not much point in maintaining a pretense of balance at this point, especially when it comes at the cost of making things much slower to test.\n\nAlso also, there are ships in the tech tree now. You could make a tech that unlocks a nominal terraforming ship part, although it wouldn't yet do anything. See the techs in techs.txt that have names starting with SHP_ Unlocking is done in a manner resembling\n\nI kinda like the idea of having the game \"remember\" the original state of a planet. this way you can restrict terraforming to only changing environment by 1 or 2 steps(from native state) instead of changing it completely. (Stars! did something similar.)\n\nThat would pretty much remove Gaian Terraforming as a possibility* since Gaian is always the best for your race, or it is a self terraforming world that soon ends up as the best for your race, I forget witch was decided on.\n\n* Unless you were talking only about the earlier techs.\n\nAlthough I must say I like the idea of war affecting a planets environment, while it might make little sense in some cases the idea has merit so we should at least have a discussion on it.Another related possibility might be a partly terraformed planetary special that also makes a planet further away on the EP wheel, it depends on how expensive we want early game terraforming to be. there are numerous reasons why this might be realistic, massive terraforming inferstructure that is a drain on the economy until its finished and packed up. Sudden violent storms and floods as environment finishes assimilating the aritifical changes (or until the tech team irons out the bugs), it might even be semi-deliberate. Boiling off part of the sea would have serious effects on day to day life until the temperatures are back to normal.\n\nYes I meant the Early techs. But I was also considering the possibility of adding anti-terraforming techs. Like a bomb that causes a planet to revert either to, or towards, it's original state. Or maybe just move it away from it's current state. Or we could add techs for all three.\n\nIt may not be necessary to make more advanced terraforming cost less PP. Just being able to do it (much) faster is probably enough incentive to get the more expensive techs.\n\nI didn't suggest a lesser PP cost. I agree, being about to complete a terraform in (for instance) half the time would be a sufficient motivation to get the tech.\n\nGeoff the Medio wrote:\n\nIn your proposed new techs, do the later terraforming techs require the earlier ones?\n\nI was thinking it should require the earlier version of the tech, though i didn't make that clear.\n\nI've committed the first two terraforming techs, though the descriptions are rather quick.\n\nKrikkitone wrote:\n\nIs Terraforming going to require PP to build or Food?\n\nSince it's a building it requires PP: unless someone makes a sufficiently strong case that it should require Food.\n\nmarhawkman wrote:Tortanick wrote:\n\nAlthough I must say I like the idea of war affecting a planets environment...I like the general idea myself. Elsewhere i've mentioned specials such as \"exotic radiation\" and \"nanite swarms\" as the results of certain kinds of weapons which would permanently harm a planet (unless they are cleaned up).\n\nI like the idea that attacks or other events could harm or change the planet in some way... but it just doesn't make sense for that change to be movement around the EP wheel. Unless, of course the weapon is specifically some sort of late game \"Genesis Device\" terraforming weapon. somewhereso it doesn't just increase the speed, it increases the range\n\neleazar wrote:\n\nKrikkitone wrote:\n\nIs Terraforming going to require PP to build or Food?\n\nSince it's a building it requires PP: unless someone makes a sufficiently strong case that it should require Food.\n\nWell I thought that was one of the ideas of a potential use of food (to keep it from fading in importance as technology improved)Well, i agree that it's fun to gradually gain more abilities, which is different from marhawkman's idea of a hard limit on the range of terraforming.\n\nI would rather have the practical limit based on the undesirability of the starting EP of the colony. For instance if you colonized a planet with an extremely hostile environment (for your species) in order to terraform it to your ideal, you would still have to deal keep that colony alive while it was in it's beginning stages. That colony is certainly going to be a resource drain until it is terraformed near to your EP. If you compare the cost and time of actually making that colony useful, compared to starting with a colony closer to your EP, it will be a rather impractical choice nearly every time (assuming there are other options).\n\nWe have later techs (environmental encapsulation) which i think should make it easier to live on non-ideal EPs, and thus easier to terraform them.\n\nWe also might connect the speed of terraforming to the infrastructure meter (at least for early terraform techs) which would increase the difficulty of terraforming the more unsuitable worlds.\n\nQuote:.\n\nWith increasing Minerals you can also increase focus on Industry (essentially they are one usable resource produced by 2 seperate meters) and those PP are pretty much always useful... same with Research (until Transcendance is reached) Money... well we aren't really doing anything with it yet\n\nbut Food becomes less and less important as tech improves\n\nAs for the limit on how much you can terraform a world... I wouldn't go with Just a practical limit as opposed to a hard (tech determined) limit on the range [My idea was an increase in range of terraforming... in the ability to do a farther Range of terraforming like I'm assuming marhawkman's idea was (not that there would be a permanent lmit to the range)]\n\nThe practical limit should be there... the total change from Inferno to Terran should be longer and more expensive than the change from Ocean to Terran. However, the Ability to go from Inferno to Terran should also be later than the Ability to go from Ocean to Terran.\n\nFood probably will probably require less focus as the game progresses, which is the intention, and there's nothing wrong with that. You expect a more advanced civilization to put less of it's total effort into feeding itself.\n\nBut the idea that tech increases food production but can't increase max population is groundless. We have techs like N-Dimensional structures, planetary Rings, and Environmental Encapsulation, etc. Even if you didn't know about these techs, why in the world wouldn't we have something like them?\n\nIn addition, a thriving empire (i.e. one that's not loosing) will probably be more or less continually adding new planets through colonization and conquest.\n\nWell, i agree that it's fun to gradually gain more abilities, which is different from marhawkman's idea of a hard limit on the range of terraforming.\n\nIt's not really a hard limit. It's an alternative to automatically moving from step to step when terraforming. Since we're doing a \"wheel\" instead of a graded scale like MoO2 did, going through steps in sequence doesn't make as much sense. Especially since you won't necessarily be going the same direction each game. It adds two more things though. It lets you have limitations on terraforming and gives a reason to have and research multiple levels of terraforming techs. It also makes terraforming no longer strictly a one-way street. This approach greatly facilitates the usage of techs with negative consequences.\n\nCan we treat terraforming as strictly an increase in max population size?\n\nIf the only effects were increases in population limit, then we wouldn't really be terraforming, as the environment type wouldn't be changing, which is basically the definition of \"terraforming\". You can argue that there shouldn't be terraforming, in the sense of changing environments, but I don't think we should redefine the term.\n\nHandling terraforming in a more discreet, abstract fashion has it's advantages. You can still have gaian specials and stuff like that, but the convoluted nature of the EP chart lends itself poorly to strict changes in the environment. The player shouldn't have much to keep track of, but failing that it should be predictable and simple.\n\nedit: hmmm. I don't want to redefine terraforming, just the way it's presented"

      "text": "Looking through the posts since 6th release, there has been a lot more talk of using Ethereals. I have never used one myself in a game but have always liked their fluff, the option to have BS4 fire warriors intrigues me intensely too .\n\nThe purpose of this post is to see how the brilliant minds of ATT would incorporate the ruling caste of tau, things to think about would include:\n\n1. What equipment to take. 2. Honour guard or not. 3. Tactics.\n\nWith 6th making our FW far better I think the Ethereals ability to help with morale checks will be invaluable, plus the option of having better (fearless?) FW is always niceNow Shadow sun is not an IC (with drones) butt the Aun is. Shadow sun and her drones cannot join other units but nothing states ICs cannot join her. All kinds of shenanigans arise from this possibility.\n\nShadowsun and suicide ethereal is a tactic worth experimenting with I think. Shadowsun will be very resilient with stealth, and will help reduce the damage of the price of failure. Run an ethereal up for the greater good and use the command-link drone to take the morale tests on a 10. Also keep in mind that Shadowsun will become an IC if all her drones are killed, and when she joins a unit the unit will gain stealth and shrouded (ka-ching!)\n\nAlso worth consideration is a stealth-bait-ethereal: Bring the ethereal and attach him to a big unit of stealth suits. Make sure your opponent is familiar with the \"price of failure\" rule, so that he will target the ethereal. Then kick back and roll so many 2+ saves it will make his head spin. Still risky; if you lose that ethereal things could go rather badly.\n\nI think that other configurations of the ethereal are non-competitive; they are extremely vulnerable, and you still have to bring a fire caste commander anyway, so you don't save points by taking himIf nothing else, he would make a great lure for Kauyon\n\nYou can only field 2 ethereals. You still have to obey the 1+ requirement for a commander in the second force org chart.\n\nI would argue that you wouldn't have to take a second commander, as the second FoC is simply increasing the maximal and minimal sizes of different things in your army, not a seperate army in and of itself. Therefore, I believe, you wouldn't need a second, as your army (the collective pair of FoC) has 1 commander, which would satisfy the 1+. Similarly, if you had an irrational hatred of Firewarriors, you could take 1 unit of them and three of kroot at 2000pts, to satisfy the requirement, meaning that you could have 11 units of them! That's up to 385 kroot, if my math is correct.\n\nSorry man, the second FOC is basically considered a whole sepperate army. You have to follow the requirements for it, including 1 HQ and 2 troops, along with any codex specific requirements (this does allow a Farsight army to have kroot though).\n\nCarrelio, specifically, it is not \"basically considered a whole seperate army\", but rather grants YOUR army a second FOC in addition to your first. The contention is that some believe this \"adds\" to your current. This is incorrect.\n\nThe second FOC is treated literally as a second FOC. Standard game rules require that an FOC has a required 1 HQ and 2 Troops. The addition of the second FOC therefore requires that you take a minimum of 2 HQ units and 4 troops if you utilize the second FOC in any capacity.\n\nHang on... now I'm confused... was what I was saying wrong because of the casual nature of how I said it... or did I actually get the ruling wrong? To take a second FOC we do need to follow the rules as though we had a complete other force including at least one HQ of which must be our +1 crisis commander, and 2 troops of which one is the +1 fire warriors?\n\nIt's probably better to not do that. Plainly, we see how muchAgain, I would argue that that is incorrect. It increases the maximal capacity, but it is not a separate detachment, requiring it's own crisis leader and fire warrior team, but rather a larger battlegroup of tau forces. The tau commander is 1+ for an ARMY, not a demi hunter cadre.\n\nIt's probably better to not do that. Plainly, we see how muchI will be more precise in my discussion in future, and thanks for clarifying, I was worried I'd gone astray on the rule somehow.\n\nI am inclined to believe that the extra FOC is in addition to your existing army and not to be treated as an extra \"army\". RAI Farsight would never be able to have kroot because by that logic he could be fielded with Shadowsun or any Ethereals.\n\nWell, the line from the rulebook is \"[I]f you're playing a game of 2,000 points or more, you can take an additional primary detachment\"; it doesn't say \"double the amount of choices in each category\", \"change the Force Organisation chart to...\", or anything similar. This would seem to imply that the two detachments are independent of each other. This is supported by the phrasing later on:\n\n...either of the primary detachments...\n\n...an extra primary detachment...\n\nAll primary detachments...\n\nHowever, the issue is neatly confused by the second sentence in the paragraph, which goes ahead and lists the merged totals for how many of each type of unit you can have.\n\nPersonally, I lean towards the \"each detachment is independent\" view - this is what the majority of the wording implies. I think the (potentially confusing) second sentence is an example that is supposed to be helping you, in case you can't work out what 2 + 2 is, but is actually confusing the issue.\n\nCodex: Tau Empire says that the army list is \"used in conjunction with the Force Organisation chart\", which therefore implies that any restrictions are per Force Org - this would include not only the 1+ Commander and Firewarriors, but also the limit of 1 on Special Issue items...\n\nWell if you are interested in tactics for your Ethereals, I wrote up an idea that I had and other people have contributed to this as well. Take a look [url It is a risky tactic, but if used correctly can largely benifit your"

As soon as you target another enemy (which happens quite often, since boarding parties are most efficient against larger ships that deploy mines or fighters) the shuttles drift lethargically in space and do nothing anymore. Forever - except they get shot down. Which is quite annoying since the Boarding Party skill has quite a cooldown, and you wasted it for nothing in that case.\n\n2.\nWhen you launch boarding shuttles at an enemy, and that enemy is destroyed before they reach him, they just drift along in space and wait for you to leave system or get shot. This is not as bad as my first concern, but I think they should at least return to your ship or \"beam\" back. Those shuttles drifting in space and doing nothing are annoying."

The only thing left unmodified were the engines that received their power straight through the powerplant. Because of the insane speed and minimal protection, even Minmatar pilots them self didn't dare to pilot it, as the smallest bump on entering warp or getting shot at, usually meant the shield generator blades getting unbalanced and stuck between the plating, causing the ship to explode on itself... So the design was exported to pod-pilot market, as they didn't have to worry about the dieing part.\n\nSince then, pod pilots have even found an ingenuity to balance the shield-generator blades out with carefully placed duck-tape patches, minimizing the dieing part noticeably"

      "text": "Saturday, December 8, 2012\n\nFweddit - The Proper Use of the Word Epic\n\nThe first kill happened at 04:23, the last kill happened at 05:23. It was the longest damned fight I've ever been in. One straight hour. I was on field the entire time. Sitting out at 60km and target painting every primary Almity would call. Firing some heavy missiles as well.\n\nThis was a fight on a medium plex. Cruisers on down.\n\nWhat a long-ass fight. I'd brought eleven refills of ammo, and would have run out entirely, early on, if I hadn't started conserving half way through. After awhile, you just knew which targets you weren't going to break before the Minnie logi got on them, so I wouldn't bother firing missiles at them. InsaneJecke, for one. His tank was too heavy, you couldn't eat through his armor fast enough to make a quick difference. There were other people, like Zostralis, whom you knew you had a fighting chance of killing before logi could rep them up. There were a number of people, we'd get them to a sliver of their lives, only 20% structure, and the reps would kick in.\n\nThere were a lot of people on both sides who survived deep into structure. It was that kind of fight. Seeing ships with flames shooting out their backends, not unusual once we hit the 30 minute mark.\n\nWhen we could get people down, it mostly seemed to be people not in Late Night Alliance [LNA]. The ten logistics the Minmatar had seemed to be mostly Late Night, so it stood to reason that they were watchlisting mostly Late Night people. So if we didn't recognize a name, we targeted them. And mostly got them down. We killed far more Ushra'Khan, Damu'Khonde, and Defiant Legacy than we did LNA, even though there looked to be an even number of Late Night to the other Minmatar in their fleet. In.\n\nThere were long stretches too, when nobody was shooting at anyone. Just Almity and his peeps discussing how to break the Minmatar reps. A long stretch where we did nothing but remove a hundred or so drones from the field.\n\nThere were scary moments too. A Blackbird on short scan. All targets dropped to pop it as it landed on grid. That thing could have decimated our six logistics had it not been destroyed quick enough. Then there was the realization that the Minmatar had brought in ECM burst at some point. The struggle to get it off field, since it was causing a certain amount of havoc in the logistics channel, was causing tempers to flare. Eventually we did remove that threat.\n\nI don't remember who it was, but at times, someone would lead a frigate out to the edge of the battle field, where I'd help take it out with missiles and painters.\n\nIt was my first time flying a Bellicose. It might be my last, in this type of engagement. Apparently, the word on the street afterwards, is that the target painting may have been helping the Minmatar as much as it was helping us. I'd target paint the primary about a second before Almity's count down to switch targets ended (to ensure every bit of damage was hitting for its maximum amount), but my target painting may have been helping their logisitics lock up our new primary target faster as well. Their logi were being sensor dampened, but the target painting may have been offsetting that. (I'm no expert with all the sig radius math going on, so if this is wrong, feel free to explain why. If it is the correct analysis, feel free to agree.)\n\nPinky at some point was trying to get help from Agony. (I think. It wasn't entirely clear, other than he wanted us to hold position while he tried to get more people to break the deadlock.) Whatever he was trying to do, didn't pan out.\n\nWe were already an hour into the fight, the restlessness was growing. Almity wasn't about to do anything dumb, risky, for the sake of breaking the tension and the boredom that was creeping into this fight. Pinky's reinforcements weren't coming. So the decision was made to leave the field. We left the looting to the Minmatar. So there's that victory to them, the spoils. As for the ISK war ... I have no idea. Eve-kill kinda sucks at creating battle reports for fights this long. I've seen battle reports where we lost the ISK war, I've seen a battle report where it was all even, and Susan posted a report that shows us winning the ISK war. I'm happy to call it a stalemate. There was no clear outcome during the fight, that's for sure.\n\nI'm not sure anyone, but Almity, could have called this fight. He had the calmness and coolness to put up with something this long. There were tempers here and there (especially when the ECM burster was roaming about unchecked.) Almity handled it all. He kept the fleet from erupting when there were those moments of frustration that crept in. Pinky as FC? He probably would have lost it half way into the fight, gone entirely insane from the stress and pressure. DurrHurrDurr? He's a good FC, but his style would have frayed every nerve in fleet, and at some point impatience would have won out and he'd have whelped us all into some overly-risky bid for glory.\n\nSo a one hour fight. I've never been in a fight that long. Epic in length, to be sure. Epic in action. Maybe not so epic in terms of it ending in a stalemate, but it was a logistics war. I've learned what logistics wars are all about now. It's not something either side focused on pre-Retribution. I can see these types of fights becoming more commonplace. I'm not sure if that's going to be a good thing, or a bad thing. Talk to me in a couple months on that point. After Fweddit and iLaw have completed their analysis of what went right and what went wrong in this fight. After they've theory-crafted some possible counters to these cruiser logistic chains. If we can't find viable counters, then these lengthy slogs are definitely going to become the norm.\n\n(If you want another outlook on the fight, Susan wrote something. She focuses more on the action itself. So it's a different perspective than my overview of the battle.)\n\n***\n\nThere was some trouble, for both sides, from Caldari awoxers on the acceleration gate. The Rifters. Apparently the Gallente are kicking Caldari ass so badly, that they've come down south to vent their frustrations.\n\n13 comments\n:\n\nTarget painters just increase the signature radius of their target, full stop. They're kinda iffy compared to just webbing targets down due to ~math~, with the exception of helping oversized missiles work.\n\nDamps reduce the maximum lock range and of their target. They're (unfairly imo) considered worse than ECM due to not totally shutting off targeting.\n\nI don't have any painters besides the one on my bomber, and I've never damped or ECMed, but my gut feeling is that the negative interaction there is very minimal, partly because damps do more than just reduce signature resolution, and partly because painters are so meh that I'm sure the dampener outdoes it handily.\n\nThat said, I wouldn't use painters as anything but support for oversized missiles, and you mentioned heavy missiles against logi cruisers, which is the proper size.\n\nThis comment is not intended as fitting or doctrine advice. Please consult your own alliance's FCs and pyfa warriors before acting on this information. (and switch to an amarr doctrine ffs you're the amarr militia and you should act like it)\n\nIt depends on # and quality of the Damps, because two/three target painters can blow the sig anything to 2x np, which with increase lock time quite a bit. As for exact % change either way for both idk, it will definitely help lock times a lot for both sides though.\n\nIf you really want to have fun in a fight like that, fly a frigate hull. There's a surprising amount of useful stuff for someone in an Assault/faction frigate or a interceptor or even a plain old t1 frigate to do. E-war, killing the e-war frigates, killing the people killing the ewar frigates, blapping ECM drones, killing light tackle, looting high-value wrecks while your friends die... The list goes on. More fun than sitting in some Fatty McFatfat armor cruiser that doesn't go 3.5 km/s, and you probably won't get primaried.\n\nI think this is pretty much true especially for us low SP players. I did just this (and died three times but who cares). Took those three deaths to figure out a role and the right way of staying alive. Finally lasted a while in my TD/sensor damp condor orbiting the blob and generally just whooping it up though I doubt I brought much value at that point since it was late in the fight.\n\nThe only point I disagree with is the ass frig/faction frigs. Those ships wear a target on their back due to their value to softness ratio in a fight this size. A few volleys from the fleet will pop an ass frig worth 1.5-2x as much as a ruppy that takes multiple rounds of target switching to bring down. Cases in point:  vs \n\nStill this was an unbelievable fight and great fun in so many ways. More please!\n\n\"In.\"\n\nActually, I flew an Exequror during that fight (as a member of U'K) and was pleasantly surprised by the seamless cooperation between U'K and LNA, who were technically still at war with each other. Their logis were mostly in cap-chaining Augorors while ours were mostly Cap-Booster-fed Exequrors. We repped their guys, and they repped ours; I had several of their people on my watchlist. When our Exequrors ran out of cap boosters, they sent some cap our way. We were all in the same fleet, on the same coms, following the same broadcasts. Everything just kind of... worked. Whatever our past differences, we came together as one fairly well oiled machine to engage in the most glorious battle I've ever participated in.\n\n\"So a one hour fight. I've never been in a fight that long. Epic in length, to be sure. Epic in action. Maybe not so epic in terms of it ending in a stalemate, but it was a logistics war.\"\n\nI can not understate how good that fight was; Over an hour-long adrenaline rush from trying to ensure the right rep hit the right person at the right time, trying to manage the damage my rep drones were taking, having to spend a period of about 10 minutes with only two reps active at any given time because I needed to repair the other one from heat damage, manually piloting through the blob to overcome the sensor damps while attempting to stay out of range, putting a remote sensor booster on whoever needed it at that particular moment, dealing with ECM"

Caffeine mode, maybe?\n\nNot at the moment, though as you progress, bigger, boss-like enemies make their first appearance.\n\nYou get a new weapon when you kill an enemy carrying it (or other upgrades and powerup items). It is limited per stage, though, so you don't end up with weapons that are way too powerful for where you are in the game.\n\nWe should probably mention that we've heard the comments that want a weapons store - and we'll add one... just not to this game. We actually want to do another space shooter, probably top-down, with somewhat different gameplay, different-style levels which you can explore, and, of course, a weapons store. And possibly even a spaceship store.\n\nYup, the arena is pretty much endless. And you've guessed correctly, the enemies do spawn in a general area where the player is, though we do try to distance them from you so they don't spawn right on top.\n\nThank you.

Why is the game called \"Violet\" Storm? I never really understood that\n\nAlso, with the spaceship store...will it have the ability to choose the weapon you want like using laser rather than electricity or 3 bullets etc etc? And will the weapons be upgradable?\n\nI have a question. Why is the game called \"Violet\" Storm? I never really understood that\n\nWell, we were looking for a cool-sounding name that at least somehow relates to the game. So \"Violet\" is because the color is close enough to the main color scheme of the game (sure, sure, it's actually closer to magenta, but that doesn't sound nearly as cool), and \"Storm\" because when you go to level 4 or 5 or 6 that's what it feels like - being caught up in a storm of enemies, bullets, explosions, and homing missiles. Just don't google this title...\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by GloBaller\n\nAlso, with the spaceship store...will it have the ability to choose the weapon you want like using laser rather than electricity or 3 bullets etc etc? And will the weapons be upgradable?\n\n\n\nThe enemy spawn proximity to the player and slowdown are the two biggest issues I'm having with this otherwise fast paced and entertaining game.\n\nWe've increased that slightly. The real problem seems to be when a swarm of enemies (i.e. a formation) spawns up - sometimes, the leader of the formation is far away enough from you, but the rest of it is much closer to the player.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by gunxsword\n\nA caffeine mode sounds pretty good . How bout naming it the 'Swarm' mode instead? Double/3x/4x enemies on screen, but half/one-third/one quarter health.\n\nThat's likely to come in an update. Also, you'll need a beast of a machine to handle 4x the enemies... Although iPad-3 might be able to handle it. Or a Mac, for which we'll also release a version.\n\n[/QUOTE][/QUOTE]\n\nI Think more traditional looking space ships because they never end up looking as cool traditonal style ships prob because of the retina display that makes the ship look very detailed. Like Phoenix HD for example, their ships are stunning and the details are very real and in my opinion look better than glow outline spaceships. for this game I think the glow works because it is a geometry wars type game, so you wouldn't want to put in a realistic ship with geometrical enemies, it just doesn't look good."

      "text": "Cheers\n\nDavid\n\nThe normal build-time comes as the last step of the tactical action. Thus, building in a system requires you to activate the system in question. And since you only can activate non-activated systems there is, in general, a \"one build per system\" limit.\n\nCertain circumstances (i.e. strategy cards) allow you to build in a system that is already activated though. They are, off the top of my head, the Imperial and Imperial II secondaries, the Production primary and the Industry Primary. The latter is only used in the \"Fall of the Empire\" scenario from Shards of the Throne.\n\nThat might sound like a limitation, only one (possibly two) build action per spacedock per round, but you have to plan around your space docks. Placing all three in one trinary planet system, allowing for one very big push of units but only from one point on the map, will play very differently to having them spread to 3 different systems, which has its own strategic advantages and disadvantages.\n\nIn Memoriam: Lest we Forget their Brave Sacrifice, Citizens of Arkham!\n\nI should also mention the tactic of using the Warfare primary to pick a placed CC back up from an activated system allowing you to activate, and subsequentially build in it, a second time.\n\nThis leads me to conclude that with some luck and sly persuasion/mindgaming you could potentially build up to four(!) times in the same system.\n\nOnce via the [8]Imperial or [8]Imperial II secondary.\nOnce via regular activation\nOnce via either [4]Production primary or the above mentioned [6]Warfare primary tactic.\nOnce via the Action Card that is essentially a copy of the [6]Warfare primary.\n\nIn a three or four player game you actually have the possible potential to build up to five(!!) times IF you can procure both [4]Production AND [6]Warfare.\nIf you can actually afford to build five times, however, is another matter.\nYou should also try to move the built units away from the system in question between builds. So to pull this sequence off effectively you would need at least 5CCs to spare.\n\nIf you have Sarween Tools and all Space Docks in a triplanet system You can use the above mentioned tactic to get 30(!) fighters or ground forces without paying a single resource. Perfect for a Sol player with his flagship out…\n\nThere are other Action cards and that will allow more builds if you combo them.\n\nI am not sure if these action cards came with the original game? Action cards like these is why you get the expansions.\n\n\"Touch of Genius\"(duplicate an action card), \"Synchronicity\"(take any action card from the deck and shuffle the deck) , \"Unexpected action\". Hint….there is sometimes more then 1 of these powerful cards in the deck\n\nYou have not reach the limit yet in how many times a space dock could be activated to spam fighters.\n\nIf you have alot of trade goods stored up, you can probably make as many fighters as you can support."

It remains the same no metter how much ore is in it. There is also a \"Size\" column in the overview which is different for the roids of same type. People were using it to estimte what is left in the roid. Lately this value don't change also. At least for me.<nerd>\n\nYou're assuming that the Asteroid is completely Veldspar (or other ore). Much more likely that it's a heterogeneous mixture of Veldspar and other unusable rock/metals and that the mining lasers are designed to target the veins of Veldspar in the otherwise unusable rock. So from that 4.186 x 10^6 m^3, maybe only 200,000 is actually Veldspar. Hence why we here \"Asteroid Depleted\" and it being a \"Shattered hulk\" than \"Asteroid Consumed\"...

      "text": "The Worldbuilder supplement to which I referred was a booklet by Digest\nGroup Publications and was designed as an adjunct to the MegaTraveller\nrole-playing system but the points made by Cam are no less relevant and\nvalid for that. The points he makes are in line with what I was saying.\n\nI believe the way Heaven & Earth - a Worldbuilder based program, as I\nrecall - does it seems to be satisfactory. At least, from a gaming point\nof view.\n\nGames are full of times where the reality of the science has to take a\nback seat to the fun of the gaming. For instance - and, realizing this\nis a movie, not a game, but the imagery illustrates the point well - in\nStar Wars I, The Phantom Menace, Qui-gon shoves his light saber into the\nblast doors separating him from the bridge of the Trade Federation ship.\nA very dramatic moment as the power of the light saber is displayed,\nmelting the metal of the door, turning it to red-hot slag, as his hand\ntwists it to open a way through.\n\nThere's his hand, holding the light saber deep into the molten metal,\ncutting a hole in the thick doors.\n\nRight next to the red-hot metal is his hand holding the light saber.\n\nEver put your hand in an oven while the element is glowing? And, that's\nnowhere near the apparent temperature - going by the color - of that\nmolten metal.\n\nHad that been reality, Qui-gon's hand - at the very least - should have\nbeen char-broiled.\n\nSo, to suit the drama of the scene, the reality of convection heating\nhad to be suppressed. And, no one complained. It is accepted as part of\nthe suspension of disbelief.\n\nAnd, again using Star Wars, every space battle uses World War II\ndogfights as a foundation. So, every ship in space behaves as if it is\nflying through an atmosphere. But, the mind expects this, so it ignores\nthat they are not behaving realistically, given the environment. For\nexample, when Obi-wan and Anakin are flying through that space battle in\nthe beginning of Attack of the Clones, those little bots are eating away\nat their fighters. R2D2 zaps one of them and it slowly slides off the\nwing of Anakin's fighter.\n\nThat's what should happen, right?\n\nNot at all. There's no evidence of any acceleration of that fighter, so\nit should have stayed right where it was until some sort of course\ncorrection. But, instead, the dead bot behaved as it would have in an\naircraft's slipstream. And, everyone accepted it, because that was\nbelievable, within our realm of experience.\n\nSo, the same, I believe, is true of the placement of binary or trinary -\nlet alone systems with five stellar components - elements. Sacrifice\njust enough reality to make it acceptable to the players. After all,\nthey already accept FGMP-15s - even though, if reality were maintained,\nthe discharge from one would incinerate everything for hundreds of yards\naround, or more. What's one more little detail? Just keep the stellar\nsystem within our realm of experience; which is, have a central body -\nthe main star - and any other stars in orbit around that primary with\nbelievable dead orbits that would be in close proximity to the lesser\nstars.\n\n>Yep, that sums it up. Basically there's no way that I know of to\ncalculate stable orbits of >stars and their planets in multiple star\nsystems, particularly when there's 3 or more stars. >What I'll probably\nend up doing is assigning the component stars a fixed position in a\n>multiple-system display. They just wont orbit each other.\n\n>The way the \"Worldbuilder\" Traveller supplement worked was to place the\nsubsidiary suns >in orbits around the primary (orbit numbers generated\nrandomly). It then made certain >orbits, close to these, unavailable for\nplanets. Then, each remaining orbit was given the >chance of having a\nplanet using it.\n\n>No attempt is made to generate stable orbits or have the planetary\nbodies generated >behave according to astrophysical laws.\n\nThere might be a middle ground, if you like. Build a database of known\nstable *types* of orbits for multiples, including the *relative* masses\nand distances of the stars in it. That allows you to include \"common\ncenter\" orbits with no mass occupying them. Then if you generate a\nmultiple, generate ONE star for it and randomly select a multiple orbit\npattern. That tells you the mass and distance of the other star(s),\nright? They are what they *must be* in order for the one star you have\nto be in that place in *that* orbit.\n\n\"Close\" multiples will be a separate, more complex problem, but with\n\"long\" multiples the orbits should be far enough apart that \"wanderer\"\nplanets between stars should be a vanishingly small percentage, no?\n\nClose multiples, where the gravity wells of the stars interact closely\nenough to interfere with planetary orbits.... now that will be the\nreally hairy problem.\n\nSam\n\nP.S. If all I'm doing is showing my ignorance of both astronomy and\nprogramming, just kick me and I'll shut up again.\n\n\"Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by\nstupidity, but don't rule out malice.\" - \"Heinlein's Razor\""

      "text": "AF, is it okay if I use your Kzinti tech tree and ship style in a mod I'm making. Also I think me and you should do a sequel to this mod once if it's succesful. It could set in the Next Generation Era.\n\nCorrect I'm already going to do a NGE expansion. I'm more concerned in getting the 24th Century ships looking right then anything else. It will also include a 24th Century ship style for the selected races that way the Romulan AI will actually build the correct warbird and such.\n\nDo what you want with the Kzinti ships. As for all my stuff, I freely grant permission to anyone. Just a mention of my work in your mod would be appreciated.\n\nLyran Star Empire has a feudal system of government. The empire is composed of Duchies and those are broken down further into counties. The county known as Dark Star (because they have a black hole) were inspired by the virtues of the Federation and broke away establishing a democracy known as the Lyran Democratic Republc (LDR). This started a civil war obviously but luckily the Dark Star County was one of the more wealthier ones and was able to repel anything the Lyrans could throw at them. If the Lyrans weren't always busy with other wars, especially with the Kzinti chances are they could have crushed them quickly.\n\nEventually the Duke of the Enemy's Blood Duchy who once controlled the Dark Star County offered a sort of peace. The elected official would serve as the \"sector count\" and could remain autonomous as long as it sworn fealty to the Duke and the Empire.\n\nLike all Lyrans (except those in the WYN star cluster), the LDR loathe the Kzinti.\n\nThe Wyn star cluster was a grouping of stars that had a dense radiation sphere around them. It had been though of as to thick to pass through and you would die in the attempt. During the Kzinti civil war, the lossers plunged into it. Prefering death over capture. Because of the speed they were going at. They made it though alive. Thus the rebel Kzinti's learned that they had not been the first. That Lyrans and Orion Pirates being chased did the same thing. So all three groups made their own goverment and made plans of coming out for revenge later on. So is the creation of the Wyn.\n\nYou got it backwards, the Kzinti made it throught the WYN cluster first in Y116. Orions established their first base there in Y136. I'm not sure when the Lyrans made it but I do know that when the Orions showed up only the Kzinti were there. Lyrans have had so many civil wars its hard to make sure. These races were followed by Klingons and any other reject of galactic society. Think, Mos Eisley Cantina.\n\nThe WYN shipstyle which is player selectable will be very interesting. Like their diverse races within the WYN so are their ships. True the WYN have ships all their own but part of their fleet will consist of Lyran, Kzinti, and Orion ships. Few Klingon too I think. Anything they could buy or steal was added to their fleet.\n\nWhenever the conditions get better for supplemental \"work\" on that mod, we'll always be there for you - buddy!\n\nOne thing to be said about life is that it sometimes brings us right back to more important priorities... in my case, that means i will be getting a tough surgery to my left hand on 11/11, as a result i should also have to slow down development of CoSH & X-Worlds since i'll be stuck with some sort of 'Borg_like_implant' which would interfere with ANY or most computer tasks on a keyboard for at least four months. Here, crossing fingers (pun intended!) that they won't have to go through amputation -- IF i'm lucky.\n\nHey Ronin, thanks again for all the work on the ships and the CFG file. You did great stuff here. I do have a question for anyone that may know, Im looking to make up the other races in the game, but i dont know anything about them or what abilities they should even have. I can do the Fed, Klingon, Romulans, and prolly Gorn, but the others I have no idea. Any suggesstions for their abilities and super ability would be awesome."

      "text": "Titan issue: Why no void shield (or equiv) crits for some?\n\nWhile reading the AM proof I noticed something that seems out of kilter for the Reaver.\n\nSpecifically, that it has no critical hit which can bring down its void shields for the rest of the game.\n\nCheck me on this, but let's review\n\nWarlord Titan: In its critical hit table, under the carapace hits there are hits that bring down that void shield generators completely or until repaired or potentially destroy them completely for the remainder of the game\n\nImperator titan: In its critical hits tables there is likewise the chance to take out the void shield generators.\n\nEldar Phantom titan: Wing hits have the potential to take out the holofield generators either temporarily or for the remainder of the game.\n\nOrk mekboy gargant has a kustom force field generator set of crits that can destroy the force field generators.\n\nNow, I can understand that orks would be given a freebie regarding this because of the flicker effect and the fact that shields can't be brought back up, so that seems fair. the power field generators are scattered individually about the gargant so there's no single generator to destroy and bringing one down destroys its generator for the most part anyway, so yeah, it would make sense.\n\nHowever, I simply cannot understand why the Reaver, capitol Imperialis, Leviathan, and the drop ship would not have crits that can take out their void shield generators if a theoretically more robust unit like the Warlord or the Imperator do.\n\nI suggest that at the very least, Reavers should be given 1 box on the front profile and two on the side profile that read \"void shield\" and have a 2+ save.\n\nHits to these areas that result in a crit would use a similar damage table to the Warlord for Carapace hits that have the potential to knock out void shield generators.\n\nNow, dovetailing on that subject, going back and reexamining all the titans in question that do have location hits that take out their defensive screens I noticed a couple things that seem more than a little statistically unequal in regards to points value cost of the units in question.\n\nSpecifically, the issue of the number of locations that do lead to void shield generator knockdown and their accompanying saves. It seems to me that some units are more than a little unequal given the game effect and the statistical ability to avoid the loss of defensive capacity.\n\nGiven the baseline of the Imperial warlord, we see that the Warlord has 4 locations on its various hit templates which result in carapace hits, and thus possible void shield generator knock outs. We also find that these locations have a save of 1+.\n\nHowever the Imperator, while it only has 1 location which can result in void shield knock outs has a save of 4+ for that location (which given the save dice it has and the probability of a bell curve works out to about a 1.5+ save equiv. I'd think that the imperator would maybe pull a 3+ save for that area, which brings it more in line with the 1+ save seen on the warlord.\n\nLikewise the Skylock has 5 locations that lead to loss of void shields, and given its similar point cost to its other compatriot titans (which have 4 locations that lead to loss of void shields) This seems slightly unequal. Mind you this is a minor inequality, but still one that's present.\n\nHowever, the Eldar titans have some real problems in the area of defense field vulnerability. They have a whopping 6 (50% more than the warlord) hit locations that result in hits against its defensive field generators. Furthermore, each of these 6 locations only have a 3+ save (the worst save of any titan for loss of it's primary defensive screens) for those locations as compared to the 1+ of the warlord. Given the clearly greater numbers of crit locations (and thus greater hit probabilities for wing hits), and the 3 times worse save value, it's hard not to wonder why this issue hasn't been redressed.\n\nSimply put, given the high point cost of eldar titans, the limited utility of holo fields against artillery type barrages, and the low save value (3+ for wing hits), I conclude that Eldar titans are being overtly penalized in terms of their save values for defensive shield generators. Given the terrible statistical values given them for saving for hits on the wings, holofield loss for Eldar titan units is almost a certainty if artillery is used on them.\n\nI suggest that raising all pure \"wing\" saves to 1+ or 2+ would go a long way toward redressing this imbalance and giving eldar titans a more balanced survivability\n\nBut regardless, at the very least the reaver titan needs to have its crit tables modified to include the chance for its void shield generators to be knocked down. Otherwise it is granted a form of void shield invulnerability. That it's given the benefit of being able to bring void shields back up, without the chance of losing its primary defensive feature the way more robust titan units do.\n\nJust because they've not been modified does not mean that they are not in need of modification.\n\nThe point is, void shields go down due to fire, and come up on a 4+ roll during repair.\n\nHowever, while on warlords and imperators you can knock them out for good in a battle, on a supposedly smaller and weaker titan (the reaver, and the warhound) you cannot knock them down for good. They potentially can keep being repaired over and over.\n\nThink about it like this,\n\nA warlord goes into battle and takes damage sufficient to knock down its void shields. A hit sneaks by, hits the carapace and knocks out the void shield generators for the game.\n\nNow any hit that comes in on the titan does so without the impediment of void shields.\n\nOn the other hand we have a reaver with its 4 shields. It takes similar fire, and all 4 are down. A crit slips through and does some damage, but cannot knock out the void shields since there's no such thing to hit. Suddenly this lower point cost titan is able to regenerate 2 out of its 4 void shields during repair.\n\nIf reavers act as harassing units on the periphery of the battle, able to slip in and out of fire fights they never have to worry about losing their void shields and they can continuously regenerate them.\n\nThis is an interesting problem that made me think a bit. In principle I agree with you, it does seem odd. However I wonder if this really is a problem in practice? Lets say you strip the shields off a warhound. Would you, if you were the attacker, really go for disablng the shield generator? Would you not try to knock it out right away, aiming at legs, head or reactor? My point being that these smaller titans/preatorians are easy enough to kill that aiming at the shield generator would just be a waste of shots. The Reaver with 4 shields is problematic though, I still sort of agree with you there... However I believe this has been thought through (the flashback result on the weapons damage table now only flashes back on reactor or head, and the carapace is out completely - i e it has been noticed before). One good thing about the current version is that its simpler now (Titan sheets are somewhat simpler all the way now, which is very good).\n\nThanks for the lookup. So at the very least we now know that they intended the reaver to have the same sort of crit table (and thus vulnerability to void shield generator hits) as other titans. Good.\n\nNow then, I really do understand the points that have been brought up that this is something that has largely gone without comment since 1991. But the point is that it's both a physical inconsistency and a rules issue that I suggest is ripe for exploitation. That a specific class of titan can literally never lose it's capacity to keep bringing up void shields just seems wrong to me.\n\nNow, why hasn't this ever become an issue? Quite simply, in my opinion, because most epic games do not tend to last out beyond 3 to 7 game turns. This is an issue that we'd only see arise in games that hover in the 4+ turn category due to regeneration. However it also may have not been noticed for a simpler reason: Noticing something is missing is harder than noticing something that is there.\n\nHow many games have been swayed because a titan that should have gone down, didn't, because a regenerated void shield that should never have been there in the first place was there to turn a shot? There's really no way to tell. But noticing that a titan should have gone down... that's tough to do.\n\nBut there's also another reason for concern that I noticed last night. Specifically that of the inherent risk that void shields carry is something the reaver and the other units I mentioned are immune to. To review: As we all know, Void shields are capable of being regenerated 50% of the time (4+). So a warlord, on any give turn can potentially regenerate 3 void shields if all are knocked down. A powerful defense indeed when compared to orks who have flickering shields and who simply cannot regenerate downed shields. As such, GW determined a long while back that void shields should be a two edged sword. That they should be a powerful defense but also carry some risk with their use to keep them from being unbalanced. Thus we need to look at the risks that these shields carry with their use. To whit: their critical hit table.\n\n1-2: The void shield generators are shut down and the shields may not be used until repaired. 3-4: The Titan's void shield generators are shut down and the shields may not be used any further in the game. 5: The shields are in danger of overloading and you must shut them down before they explode. Roll a D6. On 5-6 the shields are safely shut down, on 1-4 they explode as 6 (below): 6: The Titan's void shields overload and explode. The Titan is destroyed but remains standing. Any models within 2D6 cm are automatically hit at 0 TSM.\n\nSo we have a 16 2/3 % chance of a crit on the void shield generator having the whole thing go critical and explode, and a 16 2/3% chance of them entering a potentially lethal situation (66% of the time) Or more accurately, there's approximately a 28%(based on (16.66+(16.66*.6666)) chance that a hit on the void shield generator will in fact destroy the titan outright.\n\nMind, Imperators use a slightly different table. The point being is that this risk is part in parcel with the benefits that void shields carry. That the Reaver does not experience this risk, as well as having the ability to regenerate void shields endlessly, seems to create a potentially very exploitable situation especially from a statistical standpoint.\n\nNow, consider that a warlord is 500 points vs the 300 of a reaver. Then consider a battle with 5 reavers in action vs that same battle with 3 warlords. (equal point value of 1500 points) Those 5 reavers will never experience lost shields, will be able to continually regenerate shields at all times, AND will never run the risk of a critical carapace hit destroying them outright 28% of the time that the void shields are hit. Is this a situation that sounds broken to you? If so, then I suggest that it should be corrected.\n\nLast edited by Ifurita on Tue Apr 13, 2010 3:47 pm, edited 2 times in total.\n\nIf you have some spare time, why not creating new titans datasheets for warhounds/reavers/warlords ?\n\nDwarf Supreme started working on titan tables with D10 damages results. I don't know the status of this project.\n\nScream is correct; I have been working on d10 based damage tables. I finished the tables for Imperial Titans, but my computer crashed and I lost my digital copy. I will re-type them on my computer and post them.\n\nI've known for a long time that there is no carapace hit location for the Reaver (or Warhound). I think I accounted for this on my tables so that when a weapon is blown off and causes a flashback, that the carapace can possibly damaged.\n\n_________________ Inquisition Army Champ\n\n\"I don't believe in destiny or the guiding hand of fate.\" N. Peart\n\n\"Dwarves are small and carry huge axes, They dig up Gold,and don't pay taxes.\"\n\nWell then, I'll see what I can do to type up something in the interim and we'll see which damage tables show the most promise.\n\nTo be honest, I'm thinking that instead of \"weapon\" on the main body hit charts that I'll go with \"hardpoint\" and a hardpoint hit will go 50% of the time to a weapon hit table , or 50% to a carapace hit table. If a weapon no longer exists in that location, the hit will instead automatically go to the carapace.\n\nSeems the easiest method for both the warhound and the reaver since all three weapons are in those regions.Quote:\n\nNot broke, don't need fixing.\n\nWe appear to have very different definitions of \"not broke\".[/quote]\n\nThe question also has to do with tactics: Do you focus a lot of firepower on a titan in one or two turns in order to take it down, or do you take a few pot shots and spread your firepower throughout the playing field. Although atmittedly it's been a few years, but my usual tactic when I've decided to take down a titan is to try and focus as much firepower on that single target as possible. Strip the shields and target critical areas such as heads or reactors with heavier weaponry. The titan's ability to regenerate shields becomes pretty insignificant if you can inflict crippeling damage to it in a single turn. Warlords and Imperators are tougher to take down even without shields, so to me it makes more sense that you'd be able to target the shield generator specifically. My point is just, that if I really want to take out a reaver or a warhound in a single turn and I got the right weapons within range, it is not really a problem. It doesn't matter if the titan is able to raise shields next turn, because it will either be dead or severely crippeled. Using the points value alone is also a bit tricky: Other factors such as speed, armor etc, and even the layout of hit locations (with regards to scattering shots) also has some bearing on the effectiveness of a titan, and not just the ability to raise shields.\n\nWould Warlords and Imperators be better if you weren't able to take out the shield generators? Sure. But these units are tougher to begin with even without shields. a Reaver and a Warhound is still relatively fragile once those shields are out, and can be taken out in a single turn if you are determined to do so. This is somewhat harder to do with an Imperator or a Warlord.\n\nAnother way of arguing: If the Reaver is percieved as too good for it's points because you can't take out the shields, would it be better not to change the crit tables, but to solve it with a simple raise in points value?\n\nMy point is just: Is the change mainly for the sake of consistency, or because the reaver gains some unfair advantage that isn't reflected in it's points value?\n\nIf it is the latter, then yes: Some change is definitely needed. If not: Well, I know it sounds a bit conservative, but change for the sake of change tends to lead to confusion. Epic /NEtepic has been around for almost 20 years now. NetEpic brought some significant changes, and there's been so many years to iron out glitches. Even the changes from NEtEpic 4 to 5 has a lot of people confused about how rules work, and which rules to use etc. etc. Fixes to gamebreaking problems are always needed, but changes just for the sake of change, should be handeled with some caution IMO.\n\nSorry if it comes across a bit negative. An addition of void shield hit locations to DS' updated optional titan rules sounds like fun, but the less rewrites to the core rules the better IMO. If it got really ugly, people could then begin to argue that all Iimplerial titan tables needed a rewrite with the addition of hit effects to stuff such as gyros, etc, just because the Imperator has them. It is just a matter of setting a bar for what kind of inconsistancies actually pose a significant balance problem to warrant a change"

You might just be encountering a group of tankers and cargo ships and DD's, or you might be encountering a group of warships just moving at a slow pace, possibly with a carrier in the group or a battleship (hence the slow speed).

Depending on your crew experience and morale, you'll get a reading, but not always correct, mind you. Consider running at \"Standard\" speed and going to periscope depth, but keep a low profile (meaning, reduce your speed DRAMATICALLY).

And warbirds are now, too.\n\nTangentially related to exos, have you thought about allowing motherships to spawn during the final \"push\" of the spire campaign once you complete it?\n\nThink about the epic showdown of 8 super-dreadnoughts vs. 5 motherships, plus a whole bunch of other stuff.\n\nNow I understood that you disabled motherships during the \"triumphant push\" for a few reasons. One, to ensure that the spire would win. Two, to not make it an instant loss if the AI makes it to you before the Spire can take out both AIs. And Three, because of their core shield gen properties.\n\nTo deal with one, careful tuning of the mothership spawn rate would take care of that. So long as the mothership's spawn rate (adjusted for firepower and durability) is less than the spire spawn rate (adjusted for firepower and durability), the Spire will eventually win. (Basically, make it such that once both start spawning, the number of motherships spawned over a time T does not overpower the number of super-dreadnuaghts + dreadnaughts spawned over time T) This may be a tricky ratio to find, but it would be epic.\n\nDo deal with three, you can make a separate version of the mothership that does not have CSG properties, but is otherwise identical, and have that spawn during the \"final push\"So even when the AI is \"panicking\" about the huge swarm of massive Spire stuff headed their way, they still don't get enough \"exo-points\" to afford motherships? That seems a little strange.\n\nAs I mentioned, the kill-all-CSGs logic could be sidestepped by having a version of the mothership that doesn't have CSG properties, and use that during this time.\n\nYea, the normal CSGs are there to force a certain number of planet captures (and thus AIP) before you can win the game. The mothership's CSG is there just to make sure you can't win without killing it. Otherwise to fulfill its \"defensive\" purpose it would have to just camp the AI Homeworld forever. I could make it do that, but I think you wouldn't like it very much, depending on where the wormhole exits were placed on that particular homeworld Being forced to engage that thing from maximum range is... extremely painful."

If you put in a fake bid and don't actually buy you will be ignored for any further bids.\n\nTheres no such thing as best ship. Its best ship for what purpose. You could just as easily argue indy is the best ship because of low build cost and high tanking ability which is all true. No other ship with as little agility as it has can tank as well as it can PVE. Plus you have to factor in time to research. Chimera you are researching not just 1 extra ship on top of the i28 stuff.. you are researching 3 more badge ships. So yes.. of course you would expect the stats to be higher… you just spent a couple hundred extra hours and similar amounts in millions of gold to research it.\n\nYou could just as well argue fleetfoot is the best ship. In terms of the number of instances you can get through purely by building just that ship beginning at the instance you get it. You people are so narrow minded :P best is an adjective but it has absolutely no meaning if you don't quantify it. It's like your use of the word good. Oh and notice in NONE of my previous posts have I ever claimed dullahan was the best ship. Only person arguing against that is you. I'd like you to READ what you are replying to instead of just typing up a response to some imagined thing someone said. Might be more productive than arguing with no one. :P\n\nSo I've never bothered posting on anything, but damn. This has the potential to be pretty awesome. I think there should be some kind of way to prevent someone from only sending in a single fleet with a high * commander to get seeded against people taking multiple fleets of 1-3* or so and facerolling everyone, but other than that this is by far the most intriguing thing I've seen here in a long, long time.\n\nremember. you are trying to get as many kills as you can. it doesnt matter how many people you are seeded against. frankly I just think as long as you dont end up at the bottom of the barrel, you will do great. After all this system gives absolutely NO incentive at all to attack stronger players even if they are on the other side. Why would you even target something that you have 0 accuracy and waste rounds shooting at something you cant hit? You dont of course. you target min ___. kill whatever is easiest to get your shootdown count up fast. All the WWs will be running 6x of their best commanders with sbw targeting min atk or min dura and max range :p remember they will 99% of the time go first if they get paired up against 3 players of 6x 2* comms. It doesnt even matter if they lose all their ships. they just need to kill more than they sent.\n\nActually in terms of speed to build, balance in offense and defense, total time to research up to (and including the ship) dullahan is ABSOLUTELY the best. It builds faster and cheaper than most other ships( 5 second build time, 130/100/140 base cost) . It doesnt take 46+65m to research like BH (1 MINUTE build time, 314+487+297 base cost), or (26+58) LW (27 s build time, 212/142/128 base cost). So it absolutely makes the best hybrids cause it has high defense, stability of a BS with the agility of frigates and is only 20 space shy from a LW3. Considering it takes 800 hours more to even simply research LW (base upgrade time). Yes they are pretty much the best generalist ship in the game. They might not make the best glass or best tank but just about everything in between they have it covered. And no. Top tier badge ships arent even that good. But I'll leave you to do the rest of the math yourself. I've already proven BH and LW aren't as good. I'll give you chimeras tend to be a little better but not by enough of a margin that justifies dullahan's INSANE build speed. In terms of that nothing else even comes close. add to that the numbers for stability, structure, agility and defense. Even if other hulls beat it in one area, they tend to lose in more areas. Do the math. Put all the ship stats on a table. Rank them by each of their stats. Total the ranks of every stat. Dullahan is pretty close to the top. Its a top tier ship no matter how you look at it. Sure you can find better SPECIFIC uses for a single hull type. but nothing else even comes close to excelling in so many different areas.\n\nYour second point is completely invalid: A. Singular. FB player demonstrated his(or her) willingness to spend.\n\nA fb server had a player spend 8k on the first day… they dump way more in. Secondly, they got better ships then dullas such as chimeras, LW, and BH.\n\nNot sure what you are smoking. I have LW and BH as well. Oh and dullas. you were trying to make a point?\n\nAnd yes. so what if A fb server had someone dump in 8k on the first day? I can tell you this and IGG can tell you this. It's not about how much gets put in on the first day. Its about how much gets put in overall. People tossing in 2k a week will outspend that guy in a month. That doesn't invalidate my points about how money literally buys progress and the fact that money gets dumped in shortens the lifespan of the game dramatically.\n\nDon't \"correct\" me just to correct me cause you want to act like a douche. If you are gonna correct me at least try and bring up a valid point instead of just trying to correct me for the sake of correcting me.\n\nThere are HUGE differences between D2 and this.\na) it doesn't have to consume your life. stop playing D2 for 72 hours nothing happens. stop playing this for 72 hours you miss out on 3 days of ez boxes, loads of resources from harvesting, vouchers, daily quests, a whole set of trials and a half, and if you didn't put up an advance truce you might have been hit.\nb) money cannot advance your progress. No matter how much you have, short of paying someone to level for you, and buying equipment on ebay theres no way to get everything with just money thats built into the game. You can't level faster, you can't hit harder.\nc) hardcore mode and ladder. nuff said.\nSure this game has huge amounts of content. but when it comes down to it, you can literally buy progression by buying more commanders, speeding up research, resources etc etc. Being able to buy progression disrupts the challenge vs frustration curve. Most of us had some serious problems getting past i9 or 17 because there was a difficultly jump. But someone who went off and spent enough money to get a 6* divine right away? There's barely any difficulty when you deal loads more damage, and take next to none. Not to mention when you farm for bps its alot faster and you spend alot less HE doing it. Then it just feels too easy. Imagine if i1-30 were replaced with i1 enemies (comms and fleets) you would find it boring as hell cause there's no difficulty curve. Thats what spending money does in this game. Money literally buys progress. So no. It could never last 5-10 years. You know why our server has progressed so far and have had people even do taurus already? Because our WWs dump money in much faster than facebook does. Judging by the fact facebook players still aren't heavily reliant on dullahan (when even free players here can farm it) to the point where they have a special maintenance to BUFF it you have to realize we are as far if not further than some facebook servers which opened long before us.\n\ntl;dr in a game where money can and does buy progression and throws off the difficulty-frustration curve. people that throw money at the game make it end faster.\n\nActually as pay2win as dullahans are, you can totally do libra without them (and farm dullahans for yourself). I started with 550mp (and thats all I ever spent and that was close to 4 months into the game) and I've farmed and sold 3 dullahans already (without any of the p2w hulls) and have used the 4th. It's not impossible just takes an incredible amount of time and persistence (not to mention help from experienced players)\n\n1. There is no incentive for WWs to spend money on sealing cards. I'm 100% sure ww's spend more money unbinding event rewards (cards) than unsealing them. WWs dont use every card as they get them. they spend stupid amounts on draws then merge and trade until they get what they want. Thats the mark of a WW – impatience.\n\n2. Badges are not a challenge. You might as well just suggest they add sealing cards to the mall under badges.\n\n3. IGG doesnt give a whit about rep. or listening to it's players. They care about making money. If they have to listen to their player base to make money, they will :P\n\nConsidering the fact that this is MP related, and you want it gone? No.\n\nThis change actually does stand a chance of increasing gain for them though. I've seen plenty of companies make changes if it stands a change of improving player-base happiness and increasing sales. If you think it might, then why not?\n\nI appreciate that you have an opinion on how it will turn out but let's just hope that is not the case. There is no point in trying to be correct here.\n\nthis will kill sales of sealing cards by like 90%. it takes all of 3 days to get a commander from 0-50 if you are slow and you can do multiple commanders at a time. as much as i would like to see this happen.. it wont.\n\n#4. This reminds me of when that DJ feller from Discord was trying to raid someone from BS. Instead of calling off the attack and taking his beatings, he talked crap in WC, and thusly got his entire corps farmed, while he galaxy transferred away.\n\nMoral of the story, listen to the Micky.\n\nHe GT'd away? are you sure? are you talking about DJareth? cause I hit him, killed his fleet.\n\nSome of you can try reading Kongregate Terms of Use also it's fine to generally have more then 1 kongregate account on this site.\n\ngotta love reading the ToS\n\nKong TOS\nAccount Termination/No Ownership of Account: You understand and agree that you have no ownership rights in your Account.

Can we challenge and call for an investigation on someone if they are using an exploit?\n\nWith all the rules added on the 31st, this tournament seems like a sham now. I believe it's in response to certain fleets getting their feelings hurt with a build that used the newly banned items. Not allowing all those items in builds makes this tournament really not worth it anymore. I hate to say it but Cryo has a point and it's unfortunate people can't think outside the box and build something original.\n\nIf you want a pure skills tournament then go with season 2 ships and outlaw all consoles.\n\nSeven of Eleven\n\"live long enough to be assimilated, resistance is futile\"\nSOB Super Elite STF available in queues\n\nIf participants took the time to investigate the broken status of these abilities and there being no effective counter against them, then there would be no issues with not allowing them in this tournament.\n\nThe vested nature in a lot of PvPers is of honorable proportions since most of them acknowledge some of the broken concepts being employed/released by Devs in this game.\n\nThere is a reason why a lot of us refuse to run the full temporal set, tric mines, grav pulses, AMS etc. There has been a lot of due diligence when testing things out in this game. It isn't that \"we can't beat it\". A lot of us can beat that stuff, but there is merited truth behind the idea of providing feedback on things that do need a nerf. Like tric mines which are an blunt obvious over powered weapon when used in junction with dispersal patterns.\n\nNow if this tournament is \"not worth it\" for you, then it's because you are unable to participate due to your heavy reliance on a certain set of things. Being one dimensional is perhaps the downfall of most of the creativity that can be achieved in this game when making a premade. I regret not to see all those that rely on all of that stuff to win.\n\nThe other side to this is the presumed stupidity of those that don't run this stuff. Are we stupid not to run it? The answer is no, we acknowledge stuff that's broken and try our best to provide feedback on working on it. Otherwise, we'd be glad to use \"time inversion\" on everyone while we nuke/scan/alpha, tric bomb, grav pulse, ams, etc.\n\nCan you imagine someone doing that to you? Would you want to play a game like that? I can tell you this much, if the more seasoned PvP teams decided to run this stuff, there would be no sense in competition in this gamePerhaps if you cry more it will fix the problem?\n\nIs the allotted 2 week time frame FAR too short to think of a new team set-up?\n\nIf participants took the time to investigate the broken status of these abilities and there being no effective counter against them, then there would be no issues with not allowing them in this tournament Who do I need to sleep with in order to get stuff that I don't like banned from tournament play?\n\nI'm not saying this is true, but powers that be should really take a look at things from the outside. Appearances of favoritism in order to promote a select few 'popular' fleets does more to harm PvP than any tournament could help it\n\nHuh, I wasn't aware that Photonic Shockwave was banned, brb, re-reading those rules.\n\nPS wasn't banned. Another counter to Extend Shields is something that is crazy OP, in fact, there was a recent thread about nerfing it...WEAPONS and DAMAGE! I was told by the most l33t PvPers that damage in fact counters Extend Shields, who wouldda thunk it?\n\nThere has been ZERO feed back about the ancient bridge officer ability extends being \"broken\".\n\nThe people who are NOW going on these forums to complain about the extends bridge officer ability have:\n\nA) Have been been hanging out with a crowd who has no idea what a photonic shockwave is or what it does.\nB) Have no idea what a new photonic shockwave doff does\nC) Have no idea how to work a tractor beam repulsor (watch some of my vids)\nD) Have no idea what a sub nuke is\nE) Don't know how to target shields and;\nF) You found it now to come on here and provide feedback about something that is widely in use and quite clean in it's use and it's counter by nearly everyone that play pvp in this game.\n\nWe have been talking about inversion field, and tipler console for weeks and weeks, long before the tournament was scheduled or thought of. And now you come on here upset now?\n\nTrying to stir stuff up? Both in OPVP and on here? People who do this talk, and don't play the game. If the rules are harsh on you, then employ a creative thought process and come up with something less one dimensional.\n\nThose few \"popular fleets\" have taken the stance on maintaining their set ups clean. Most notably and recently, Nova Core. The other fleets that run/try to run clean setups and acknowledge the necessity on providing feedback on this stuff are:\n\nIf I forgot your fleet name, I apologize. But these fleets and the people in these fleets and the leaders of these fleets have taken upon themselves to employ partially, or in total regard to employ a forward stance on acknowledging these things. These are gaming communities that are forward thinking in terms of the game needing work and providing feedback for it.\nAs I recall, your fleet participated in the rule making process. Your fleet agreed on extends being present. So when you come off and yell at Pascal like you yelled at me in your TS that TRH made these rules, and try to sabotage his tournament because the rules hurt your feelings then you're gravely mistaken."

Flights are ok too but need to be nerfed so either you cant have 8 of them or they get progressively less effective the more u have. Building mods are fine aswell. One can switch between these two whether they want to invade or build at the time. Mods did not ruin pvp. Special-Weapon mods did. People need to learn to seperate and not throw everything in to one group because some of it sucks.\n\nOn this subject. MORE weapon slots would be way to OP, as multiple weapons at once is already OP and annoying\n\nOn clouds comment on new weapons. That would be chill, as long as they didnt have stupid unbalanced abilities or ruined fighting more. Try this on for size. A new type of hacker missile called a \"bug\" very expensive and slow to build but tracks the enemy it hits for a certain amount of time and takes a certain percentage of the targets money and gives it to the shooter. when used on colonies it can disable mines and lasers for x amount of time instead of destroying them. would be helpful in slide strategies and to preserve defenses but not to OP that you could disable an entire colonies defenses.\n\nHeres one too if u want a different type of nuke. A dark matter missile. Takes 100 spice 100 equipment to build in WF and is very expensive at base. basically its a non locking hardware missile that does 6 or 7 times more damage then a nuke, it would be very fast but the non-lock on aspect would balance it out, this would be interesting to use in invading AND fighting\n\nCool idea's. I want nukes that do damage per second. Having the cool effect of poison or fire on the ship. Only Volc's can make the fire nuke, and Greenhouse make the poison, so these planet types will be useful again."

Don't tell me there are no blind spots on a ship that large - there's (almost) no way you'd have a full extremely close range coverage with just a few lasers. The ship itself would get in the way. Said screening elements are all engaged as we see. According to the \"lore\", GARDIAN is meant for engagements at about one or two kilometer range.\n\nHellNow that is true and what I meant by flak. No need for expensive nukes, enough conventional explosions (preferably with shrapnel) would turn the vessel into a crippled piece of metal, shields or no shields. Or if you want to get real fancy, warp bombs.\nLIDAR actually might not work, since it's based on reflection and the ship could absorb the tiny extra heat; optical could be confused in a firefight this large and a reasonably black ship.\n\nThe main problem is that they've just exited FTL - that according to their own lore should make them visible due to blue shift on the moment of exit. This would look like a huge blue lantern in the sky, ready to be shot down.\nA vessel like that would have to exit FTL at long range and close in using the fancy silent drive, then attack like a submarine (with quick FTL exit strategy) rather than with a boarding party. (although that could still work if the cannons were too weak)\nReminds me why they just don't fire the dreadnaught-destroying Thanix cannons at the signal source.Her eyes are also uncovered.\n\nSeems Bioware forgot that superheroes only use masks like that in space because the only problem they have with vacuum is the lack of air."

      "text": "Can we set up weapon groups in the mech-lab & save them for that particular variant, or do we have to manually assign weapons to groups at the start of each battle?\" please? Thank you in advance. -Soviet Alex/pursing\n\nI based that assumption on the MWO model having to be able to create all canon variants because of that very issue you mentioned of some variants being superior by way of having more hardpoints, if the MWO model were to allow different variants for 'Mechs to carry different types of hardpoints. The AWS-11M with its 8 LPPCs was the basis for the theoretical max of 8 energy hardpoints, and the 8R/T/9M variants the basis behind a theoretical maximum of 2 missile hardpoints.\n\nHaving this clear superiority of variants would go against the principle of balance they've introduced very early on in the development of the game, essentially allowing people with more C-Bills or with a real money option to purchase additional firepower capabilities that would cause the other variants to become outclassed in every way.\n\nHowever I agree with you that it's an assumption, and if possible it would be nice if the devs confirm whether hardpoints are variant based or 'Mech based... and if variant based, whether certain variants would be purchasable only with real cash superior to others. They could address this by for instance different in most cases. Sure in some one variant will still be superior. But you may have to decide whether you want that electronics package available at the expense of the mech having an XL engine or a less optimal hardpoint setup. They could address this by forinstance diffient in most cases. Sure in some one variant will still be superior. But you may have to decide whether you want that electronics package available at the expense of the mech having an XL engine or a less optimal hardpoint setup.\n\nI had that grand vision of all 'Mechs only having one hardpoint configuration each, so that if you wanted to mount a combination not available you'd have to choose a different 'Mech. Short ranged + fast recharge weapons which converge faster would do better in the arms, and long ranged/slow recharge weapons which need more space, and which will gimball less making them more accurate when firing straight ahead would do better in the side torsos. So the hardpoint allocation in total, as well as specifically the hardpoint location per body slot, would determine the general use to which players put the 'Mech, when considering multiple 'Mechs of a similar weight class.\n\nAnd variants would simply be different default ways of using the same default hardpoints... and different default variants are purchasable by different Houses/their affliated Merc Groups. When you buy the variants off the factory they'd come preloaded with their default weaponry, and customisation would be freaking expensive so that while it's possible to customise your dream loadout from any starting variant of the 'Mech, it'd be cheaper to start with the official variant that's already most similar to the one you're currently thinking of. The cost of customisation would give the House armies character, since players will in general follow the default variant of their region more closely.\n\nBut of course there isn't actually any dev confirmation yet, so it's still complete speculation.\n\n==\n\nThe only really confirmed things as of this point are that:\n\n1. Criticals and hardpoints are different\n2. Hardpoints are weapon type based, criticals don't care, and can hold equipment and ammo as well\n3. Hardpoints vary by 'Mech and location on a 'Mech\n4. Hardpoints will be sufficient to carry default configuration but may have spares\n\nAnd what I'd really need to know is\n\n1. Whether variants use the same hardpoints in a different way or have completely different hardpoints like this image of an incompetent pilot of a damaged Jenner jumping and ending up flying in an inward spiral until it plants itself facefirst into the ground. It'd start its own MWO meme for sure. But given that'd be difficult to implement I'm guess devs will limit jump strength to minimum number of intact jets per side... maybe if you have 3 per side torso and 2 on one side are destroyed it'll act as if there was only 1 on each side. Still, better to get them to confirm.\n\nLocationDieron District Gymnasium, learning to pilot 'Mechs until July\n\nPosted 18 April 2012 - 02:08 PM\n\nHayashi, on 18 April 2012 - 11:21 AM, said:\n\nSince we all love the Hunchback so much, I'll create a theoretical Hunchback hardpoint model, based on SARNA variants.\n\nverybad, on 18 April 2012 - 12:44 PM, said:\n\nThose are VARIANTs. They don't need to all be possible on each individual variant. That's the whole point of the variants system they've mentioned. If you want a specific loadout on a particular mech, a variant may have the hardpoints for it, but not another variant. I immagine hardpoints won't be completely limited to the number of weapons on a specific loadout, but a basic mech won't be able to load all variant loadouts onto it notInnerSphereNews, on 04 April 2012 - 09:00 AM, said:\n\nEach location on a BattleMech, such as the Right Arm or Center Torso, may include a number of hard points. The number of hard points in a given location is determined on a per variant basis, and is based on the weapons included in the variant's default loadout. For example, a 'Mech that, by default, comes with 2 Medium Lasers and an Autocannon/2 in its Left Torso may actually have 3 energy weapon hard points and 2 ballistic hard points in that location. So, if the player is able to satisfy the weight and critical slot requirements, they could equip an additional energy weapon and ballistic weapon into that Left Torso, or swap out the Medium Lasers for other energy weapons, etc.\n\nIn short, if Mech Prime had 4 energy HPs and 2 ballistic HPs, and you wanted to use projectiles on that chassis, perhaps a Mech Variant X existed which might have like 4 energy, 1 ballistic and 1 projectile.\n\nThat means you'd have to buy the Variant X model if you want to use projectiles. The variant's HP's actually differ (but only slightly) from the base chassis notI see the quote. You and Sprouticus are right, then; I'd have to take a lot of words back. So overpowered variants will start to be a real problem between chassis...\n\nUnless the devs do their balancing very carefully.\n\nThanks for the info. Though I can't say it was what i was hoping for, it's good to know.\n\nPersonally that's really the only gripe I have with this system, though. At least to me, it seems like a clear upgrade on the systems from the previous games.\n\nCRITICAL SLOTS are the methods by which an item takes up CRITICAL SPACE.\n\nEach Mech chassis has a BASE VARIANT (sometimes called 'Prime')\n\nEach LOCATION has a MAX TONNAGE, MAX CRITICAL SLOTS and HARDPOINTS\n\nMAX TONNAGE determines the maximum amount of weight that can be equipped in any given LOCATION. (As you add items to the location, there is less available tonnage)\n\nMAX CRITICAL SLOTS are the maximum amount of critical slots available in a LOCATION.\n\nHARDPOINTS are rated by WEAPON TYPE (Energy, Ballistic, Projectile) are are SINGLE-WEAPON MOUNTS for that specific weapon type.\n\nA weapon can be placed into a location as long as: (1) That LOCATION can afford the TONNAGE of the weapon, (2) That LOCATION has available CRITICAL SPACES which the weapon takes up and (3) That LOCATION has an available HARDPOINT of the WEAPON TYPE that the weapon belongs to.\n\nARMOR takes up TONNAGE in a LOCATION, but not CRITICAL SPACE or HARDPOINTS\n\nEQUIPMENT takes up CRITICAL SLOTS and TONNAGE in a LOCATION, but not HARDPOINTS\n\nAMMO for an equipped weapon can be stored in ANY LOCATION. It is expected to take up TONNAGE for that location, but has not been confirmed whether it will take up CRITICAL SLOTS\n\nWhen going from STANDARD to ENDO STEEL, the difference is that multiple LOCATIONS will gain available TONNAGE but LOSE available CRITICAL SPACE\n\nWhen going from STANDARD ENGINE to XL ENGINE, the space that the engine usually comprises of in the CENTER TORSO LOCATION will expand to occupy some CRITICAL SPACE in the SIDE TORSO LOCATIONS, however it will also free up TONNAGE.\n\nHEATSINKS, though not confirmed, take up TONNAGE and CRITICAL SPACE (double heatsinks dissipate twice as effectively, take up the same tonnage, but take up more critical space)\n\nHARDPOINTS are based on the default loadout of a Mech.\n\nNot all VARIANTS are using all HARDPOINTS with their loadout (ie, though a variant shows 1 energy weapon in an arm, there may be 2 energy hardpoints there, just due to critical space and tonnage, they were unable to put another energy weapon there)\n\nThe major difference between a prime chassis and its variants will be slightly different HARDPOINTS. (this can mean support for different weapon types in different locations or more/less of a particular weapon type in any given location)\n\nFor each TON of ARMOR, you will have 16 POINTS to distribute it onto different LOCATIONS of the Mech. (it is unknown what the conversion rate is from normal to ferro or other types of supported armor.)\n\nARMOR on TORSOS must be split between the front and back (does not have to be evenly split)\n\nCASE can only be utililzed on a TORSO location.\n\nAMMO that explodes does damage to the location in which it was stored\n\nFor Mechs with NO HARDPOINTS in certain locations (ie, the Hunchback's Left Torso), there still will be CRITICAL SPACE and AVAILABLE TONNAGE to place things like ammo, equipment and armor.\n\nWEAPONS in locations that are destroyed or even separated from the Mech during battle are not lost, but require repair before they can be used again.\n\nYou will be able to setup WEAPON GROUPINGS and save them with your loadout (You can also name your loadout, but there's no confirmation whether that will be shown in game or if it will just show the base variant model)\n\nWEAPONS TONNAGE and CRITICAL SPACE is being preserved from the TRO (PGI is choosing to instead, adjust the weapon's damage, ranges, reload, heat, etc.)\n\nI don't get it. Can I make Annihilator with 20 machine guns or I can not?If you think about it, mounting heavy weapons in certain hardpoints around the mech will now give us a reason to use lighter weapons. If you slapped a PPC on a mech and then, say, an LRM15 or 20, then you might not have a lot of tonnage left. Imagine then that you have a ballistics hardpoint. Well, you might as well put a machine gun there if you don't need any extra heat sinks or LRM ammo.And in other answer he says you can swap PPC for 2 or 3 medium lasers, does it mean that that arm had 3 hardpoints for beam weapons?\n\nAnd in other answer he says you can swap PPC for 2 or 3 medium lasers, does it mean that that arm had 3 hardpoints for beam weapons?\n\nAlso I'm tired of logging in each time I want to say something\n\nI think what he meant there was \"Since a PPC is 3 crits, one should not think that you can replace it with 3 1-slot items, like 3 medium lasers. Instead, it should be seen as 1 PPC = 1 energy hardpoint (mount) so you can replace the PPC with another single weapon (that has as many slots as are available in that location)\n\nI see the quote. You and Sprouticus are right, then; I'd have to take a lot of words back. So overpowered variants will start to be a real problem between chassis...\n\nI think evidence points out that some sort of valuing of individual chassis for matchmaker to work with is in order. Some have noted that a straight Battle Value based system would not work correctly, and I agree. I think at the very least a system based on BV with less value given to speed and jump ability would work quite well.\n\nConsider: Individual calculations could be entirely back-end and not displayed to the user, so: A) it would be relatively simple for the devs to change the way the system balances various values on the fly and B: with the values hidden, it would be rather hard for users to \"game\" the system by making configurations that were relatively powerful for low values. Also note that the BV system, even if modified, is relatively simple, so values could be given to custom designs with ease."

      "text": "After completing Broken Chains, Queen Scarna managed to cobble together about seventy or so (roughly) Exiles that could then be brought down to Q'Sal and traded to get some equipment, possibly repairs, that sort of thing. I took into account the size of the vessel, what crew/prisoners remained and how many had been left to rot/exiled down there.\n\nBut what I'm wondering is how much each soul would be worth? In the end I had Grath grant them full repairs of their ship for fifty souls, but I get the feeling they came off a little easy. At the same time I sort of wrote myself into a bit of a corner since without those repairs they weren't getting off Q'Sal any time soon (though I could have led into the Tome of Fate adventure I suppose).\n\nWhat would you estimate a single soul was worth? A box full of lasguns? What about Legion weaponry like a Bolter, or a Chainaxe? Things like that, a rough estimation of what you might be able to get per numbers. Thanks lads.\n\nI'd probably over complicate it and have different values for different souls. Flip acquisition tables around and refer to those to see how much a soul might be worth, and what you can get with it as a guideline, then apply the better judgement of the GM to sort out the details. A single soul of a devout follower of the Emperor might well be worth more than few dozen of those who dwell the lowest levels and sewers of hive cities, depending on who/what you're offering them to and how desperate/eager it is to get them.\n\nOh I'd definetly say that souls have different value depending on their strength. So the faded soul of a imperial drone citizen would be like pocket change, where as the soul of an Astartes would be like a bar of solid gold. It's grossly simple I know, but this would of course be influenced by other factors depending on who you're dealing with, what planet you're on, what you're buying and such.\n\nSo, in my game, if my players were on Q'Sal and wanted to get a semi-wreck of a transport voidship repaired, I would charge them a lot more than a mere 50 souls. I think you should have gone with something like sixty-thousand or something equally 40k'ish. This is a gigantic space ship after all.\n\nI think you sorta screwed yourself over a bit. Messed up the economy a bit when it comes to souls. Q'Sal is afterall a society that consumes silly amounts of souls on a daily basis. I think maybe they'd charge their customers a bit more for their unique services. Q'Sal supposedly produces some of the finest warp/sorcery tech in the Vortex.\n\nAll this said it's up to you, mate. Go with what feels right to you and your players. Maybe ask them what they think souls are worth? Could be that they have some great ideas.\n\navailability soul value (anything less than rare uses the rare value as asking them to waste their time on mundane things is insulting)\n\nrare (5)^1\n\nvery rare (5)^3\n\nextremely rare (5)^5\n\nnear unique (5)^7\n\nunique (5)^9\n\nAmount\n\nsingle (5)^1\n\nminor (5)^2\n\nsignificant (5)^4\n\nvast (5)^6\n\nlegion (5)^8\n\nimpossible (5)^10\n\nCraftsmanship (Q'Sal does not have poor quality things)\n\ncommon 5)^1\n\ngood (5)^10\n\nbest (5)^25\n\nAs per the normal acquisition chart, you add the exponents together to get the final modifier before doing the multiplication. You could further modify this by which city is doing the service or some such if you wanted, but this is what I use. And yes, I do use a calculator. I sometimes modify the type of souls desired by changing the (5) to a different value.\n\nIn response to this, one could effectively attribute collecting souls to infamy boons or xp gains as the souls are collected. Mechanically this maybe sound but as far as in game awarding maybe something simple as growth in power, corruption or mutation could become evident.\n\nUh… The value of a single best-craftsmanship item ranges in the 1017 souls, if using your method. Given a million worlds with an average population of 100 billions (which is very high, even for the Imperium), we can estimate the total amount of souls in the Imperium at… 1017. So I guess this is a bit overblown, unless there is something I don't get."

      "text": "Played factions are factions that contain player characters and role-playing plots. They are the heart of the site's roleplay and are living, ever-changing entities made possible by combined effort of multiple people. Played factions should have a comprehensive collection of information about them on the wiki.\n\nBackground Factions are setting resources usable by all GMs. These could be:\n\nEnemy factions to serve as opponents in plots.\n\nAlien factions to add flavor and variety to the universe.\n\nA starter for a player faction that hasn't opened plots yet.\n\nIt is important that each faction have a purpose and a use: if you're building a faction as a static personal display piece or one that no one is using, you're doing it wrong. Connect to other factions in the setting.\n\nBackground factions usually have a person in creative control of them. Please be respectful to their creation and consult them before using the faction if possible. Background factions are not used as the equivalent of player characters; Star Army is a character-based roleplay, not one where each player has/plays a personal faction or Empire. Once you make the species, it's for everyone.\n\nIt's okay for player characters to be from a background faction. In fact, this can be a great way to flesh the faction out.\n\nStar Army doesn't have a pressing need for more played factions. There are a number of minor played factions short on players. At the same time, there's a need of more diverse (more alien) background ones because existing factions are fairly similar. For these reasons, we recommend that, if you wish to create a new faction, you start out by making them a background faction. You can always upgrade them later to a played faction if there's enough player support.\n\nThe easiest way to make a new species obviously inhuman is to give them non-human heads. If they have a human head, there should be some plausible reason why.\n\nBe willing to work hard. Respect the process. Ideas formulate easily. Making those ideas into a reality is a long, arduous process which is largely thankless. You need to look inward and seriously ask yourself if you have the determination to work at something for months or even years before it picks up enough steam to run on its own.\n\nUnrealistic expectations are the death of a creation. Expect to start at the bottom of the ladder and slowly work your way up. There are no shortcuts.\n\nUnderstand that you will have to run a plotship, so you're going to do double duty as FM/GM. Can you handle this workload?\n\nYour faction/race should work to benefit the setting, to fit as a piece in the grander puzzle, not to act against it. What does your faction/race contribute to the community that fills a need? Your ideas are important, but remember that when you submit something for approval, it isn't only about you but how your creation serves the whole.\n\nMany factions/species fall by the wayside because they don't appeal to the player base at large. Usually, a faction/species is created by one person and this results in a narrowing of perspective.\n\nWhile you're making your creation, step back several times and ask yourself these questions: How is my creation going to get players? What interesting things can I highlight that make the casual observer stand back and go \"Wow. That's something I can really sink my teeth into.\"?\n\nThink of what you can do with your creation after they're approved. What exactly are they going to do? What roleplay stories can you tell?\n\nAs more and more species/factions are created, they tend to bleed together and there's a greater need to have your creation stand out. But if your species is too foreign, players will have difficulty relating to and identifying with them.\n\nTake comments from the NTSE community, admins and players. Pitch ideas. Find out what gets their interest and what is a little too far out there. Work within these boundaries as you craft your creation.\n\nThe Golden Rule of race creation is race approval is a privilege, not a right. Just because you spent a lot of time on writing your species, worked hard on it, and you want to change it so it's approvable that doesn't mean it will be approved. If a reviewer dubs your creation unsuitable for SARP and you cause a large amount of drama over it you may be prohibited from submitting new additions in the future. However, if you take it in stride and carefully listen to their advice, there's always hope your submission can be revised and resubmitted at a future date.\n\nStarting at a lower technology level is okay. If you start as an advanced species it may make it harder to explain the lack of encounters with your race so far in the IC timeline, as well as make the staff wary of potential power gaming.\n\nWe frown on so many species starting with heavily industrialized nations on very resource rich homeworlds, or those that have some miraculous new wonder fuel/substance totally unique to them that exponentially increases their power.\n\nThat means you shouldn't call yourselves a separate race if you're really just humans with special powers, minor cosmetic changes, or an extra organ or two. Staff usually really dislike this, though there is a small possibly to convince staff to forgo this if your species submission is unique and well-written enough. Still, be forewarned that this alone may be grounds for the denial of a submission; the setting already has more than enough pseudohuman species.\n\nIf you can't easily interchange the word \"alien\" with \"creature\" consider upping the strangeness.\n\nThis is a big one. This means avoid making your species stronger, faster, smarter, and longer-lived than humans with bonus powers to boot (such as telepathy, heightened senses, etc), while at the same time having absolutely no weaknesses, or negligible weaknesses that don't really bother them too much. Emphasis on the \"negligible weakness\" part; trying to pass of a weakness as being vulnerable to bullets, poison, or gamma radiation just won't cut it. Also consider that making the race too powerful may lead to potential power gaming issues on behalf of future players, so keep any racial abilities at a reasonable level.\n\nTelepathy should be avoided. In the past so many species were submitted with telepathy that it became very, very cliche in SARP. In addition, there is also the potential powergaming/metagaming in regards to potential players of telepathic races which have caused trouble in SARP's past. For this reason it is strongly recommended you avoid any sort of extrasensory perceptions along the lines of mind-reading.\n\nThe mysterious evil alien attackers and/or overlords and/or monsters has been done to death. Having an antagonist species rule over yours is fine, but make sure you give it depth to avoid the aforementioned cliche.\n\nTry not to make your race one that has a perfect corruption free government, and whose entire citizenship is always extremely virtuous to the point of dying for righteousness, and so on. Just about every race should have its flaws, scumbags, criminals, and dissidents. If your race doesn't have these types, make sure you also consider the negative impacts.\n\nFor example, a race without crime or corruption may be that way because they are religious zealots who exile nonbelievers and criminals from their cities. Another example might be a police state carries extremely heavy punishments for criminals, such as torture and execution.\n\nWhat is meant by this is having your race possess a unique martial art, swordfighting technique, or mastery over Ki that allows a single person to decimate an entire squad of infantry. Having unique fighting arts is fine; just be sure to keep the power levels reasonable given their technology level. Also keep in mind your race's society; a pacifistic free society shouldn't have very many citizens well-versed in the art of fighting.\n\nExamples of what to avoid: An ancient sword technique that allows your race's swordfighters to block bullets, or a traditional martial art that gives your fighters the ability to punch through battle armor.\n\nTry to avoid having any materials totally unique to this race or planet that totally compensates for their lack of technology. This is essentially attempting to exploit or avoid the technology limitations of starting races, and is generally frowned upon. It's also considered quite cliche to have a special resource that naturally occurs on your planet, but nowhere else in the entire galaxy.\n\nExamples of what to avoid: Ancient alien artifacts that give you a totally unique and copyrighted weapon that no one else has. A natural super-potent power source that allows your predominantly low-tech race to match the weapons technology of interstellar empires. An ore unique to your planet that allows knights with plate armor to withstand laser fire.\n\nNow that your faction/race is created, you need to work on getting players. One of the biggest things you can do is create something that binds the elements of your creation together. It could be a war, it could be a critical cultural event or something else entirely, but make it something that all players can get behind. If nothing else, it serves as a critical reference point to bring everyone back to.\n\nAll causes need leaders to put a face on them. For your faction or species, make someone who represents the cause and pushes it forward. If not one person, make several notable PC/NPCs who represent the 'essence' of the species/faction. And make them visible. Very visible. Leaders need to be seen.\n\nThe first few players who join your faction will make or break it. Goodwill, as well as negativity, is contagious. Work hard to make them happy.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to do this is to let them in on the process of managing the faction/species. Give them power, little by little at first. (This becomes important later on). Make them feel like they have a say in matters. Nobody likes being yanked on a leash.\n\nRun your plot. Show that you're active and dedicated enough to see things through.\n\nPlayers come up with wild ideas. Aethersperm, Admiral Davis's Fishsticks, national holidays celebrating gun exchange. These little touches add so much to a faction/species. Some will be a bit messy. Just run with them. Throw them against the wall and see what sticks. Your players will appreciate your flexibility. Give your faction character and a sense of humor.\n\nNow that your faction/species has wings of its own, it's time for the endgame. These are two of the hardest steps, but they are two of the most essential ones.\n\nIf and when you've reached a point where your creation no longer needs you tending to it so closely. It's time to respect what your creation has become and step into the role of adviser instead of leader. Advise, do not demand.\n\nTom: What I did with Nepleslia was form a group of trusted players who I treated as equals. These were players who were with me from the early days of Nepleslia and who I worked closely with. Because I had treated them so well in the past, let them in on the process, they respected my opinions when I brought them up. I only stepped in directly when there were disagreements and an 'official' ruling had to be made. And because a foundation of goodwill had been built over the years, everyone respected the decisions made. If you've made it to this point, you've done a great job.\n\nYou can't be by your creation's side forever. There comes a point when the community takes over and your faction becomes something greater than what you originally imagined. It'll move in directions you hadn't anticipated. The worst thing you can do is cling to your creation. It's hard to do, but be willing to let go and step away.\n\nPlace the faction/species in the hands of your trusted players with the understanding that they too, will have to do this same thing some day. That way, the faction/species will continue to grow years after you've left and become a self-sustaining force in the community.\n\nThis isn't saying that you can't come back. Just don't feel entitled. You know your community will welcome you back if you've done a good job.\n\nDesignating an assistant and/or backup FM who can run his faction should the FM become indisposed\n\nFaction Managers do not necessarily have the ability to approve articles (that falls to staff of New Technologies and Setting Elements). However, all articles must be approved by the appropriate faction manager before the NTSE staff can approve"

      "text": "Perhaps some monsters would be tagged as \"one-of-a-kind\", once they were placed, they would be removed from the list-- though there would be no guarantee that they will be placedGeoff the Medio wrote:\n\nWhat would be good to add now, IMO, is some benefit to players to having the monsters around. This could be similar to bonuses for killing barbarians in Civ games, but perhaps something more interesting could be arranged.\n\nIt might also be worth considering, if all of the space creatures should be monsters. Perhaps there could be some creatures that don`t attack the player, but instead do something positive when they move around. Like for example a creature that could temporarily speed up starlane travel in those areas that it has gone through recentlyIndeed, I think it is an important plus for replayability that the random stuff, monsters, species, & specials be unpredictable from game to game. But also since you can set the galaxy with a very small number of stars, there are certain to be at least sometimes random content that doesn't appear.\n\nI have been following the freeorion forums for a few years now, on and off, but I am highly interested in the space monster varieties, and their corresponding uniqueness.\n\nWould the importance of such a game aspect warrant a separate engine logic module, so that the ideas are not restricted to what can be done now, which, from the looks of it, is reasonably limited?\n\nI really liked Yakk's approach to the problem, and given a set of creatures, the map generator could randomly populate the galaxy with a unique set of critters.\n\nIdeally, it would be a level more interesting than the MOO2 random appearance of 2-3 creature types + monsters, and, given time, it should be possible to match the fauna growth to a normal empire growth of the player to hamper exponential growth of the empire later on in the game, especially in large galaxies with small number of players.\n\nWould you consider adding a wider range of abilities to the creatures, than traditional MOO1/2 set?\n\nFor example, extremely large creatures could feed on the planet's ecology, reducing gaia/terran planets down into tundras/swamps, and later on all the way to barren? Since it would take time for such a monster to grow, the player should have technology to terraform planets back to terran by the time such a monster would spawn.\n\nOverall, it would be interesting to see the space monsters as something other than a simple \"reach 6 MIRV nuke destroyers, get all planets\" type of obstacle for progress of the game, and more of a continuous resistance for your own expansion, which is matched by force, as the game progresses, effectively reducing the number of planets the player have to manage (since colonising new ones is nearly as hard as taking the other player's ones), and allowing for creation of flexible chokepoints on the map.\n\nThis could also add a whole unique set of research tech and auto-generated treasures, which rely on the space monsters, and their sizes.\n\nIn SVN we've got reproducing monsters, and scripting allows a lot of other arbitrary behaviors. The only significant thing we lack IMHO is the ability to make the monsters react to specific other ships or monsters.\n\nMonsters, IMHO give us a good chance to try development by iteration.\n\n1) improve monster scripting 2) playtest: find out experientially what works and what doesn't 3) go back to step 1\n\nMonsters are a simple enough segment of the game, that we don't really need a grand and integrated plan. And it saves a lot of work over discussing adopting a grand and complicated scheme like Yakk's, implementing code and script, and then discovering that it is overkill, or didn't work as hoped.\n\nFeel free to discuss ideas, or script your own monsters, but the most practical ideas will be about what the next step could be.\n\nThe only significant thing we lack IMHO is the ability to make the monsters react to specific other ships or monsters.\n\nThere is a Design condition in the SVN version that can test for particular ship designs (and thus specific types of ships or monsters). There are also conditions for part types or hull types or part classes.\n\nSo I was thinking about this while waiting for the doctor. I'm starting to understand how the effects work, but I'm still far from mastery.\n\nSo say we wanted to make tame space monsters, but not just let the player build them like ships once he had the plan/techOr maybe the eggs would hatch at a normal rate but the presence of a colony/outpost (and/or having a monster wrangling tech?)would make sure the resulting monster was on your side.\n\nGeoff the Medio wrote:\n\nThere is a Design condition in the SVN version that can test for particular ship designs (and thus specific types of ships or monsters).

This could lead to interesting events, up to the point of forcing players to declare peace to eradicate the threat, before continuing their assault. Requires quite a lot of logic to prevent the monster from simply rolling a single player, or not being a threat at all, other than destroying planets which could have been effectively colonised later in the game.\n\nAbility to spawn larger version of itself based on certain conditions :\n\nSuch as, eating a colony of a certain of higher population digesting sufficient number of space ships digesting a spaceship with a particular technology eating sufficient number of another type of monster staying in a certain habitat long enough (neutron stars/etc) Finding a correct type of planet with correct type of sun etc.\n\nNote :: all of these are advanced conditions to reduce likelihood of a supermonster spawning. They can also lead to other interesting effect, where a newly spawned monster, can be an advantageous trophy to capture/kill for a special research/bonus.

After that condition is met, the special could start randomly spawning monsters.\n\nOr, a tech or building could have an effectsgroup that creates monsters, and this would start happening as soon as the tech or building is researched or produced by an empire.\n\nQuote:\n\n1) there are planet type X in the system\n\nYou should be able to do this with something like\n\nCode:\n\nAnd [ System Contains Planet type = Terran ]\n\nQuote:\n\n2) there are imperial (non-monster) ships in the system\n\nCode:\n\nAnd [ System Contains And [ Ship OwnedBy AnyEmpire ] ]\n\nQuote:\n\n3) there are specific monster hulls in system.\n\nCode:\n\nAnd [ System Contains DesignHasHull name = \"SH_EXAMPLE\" ]\n\nThose are all untested, but should give you the right idea.\n\nQuote:\n\nUsually there is also a random probability.\n\nCode:\n\nRandom probability = 0.5\n\nQuote: Evaluating a condition on just the source is a lot faster than doing so on everything in the universe, so it's useful to have the activation condition for things like turning on or off an effect depending on whether the empire that owns a building has a particular tech.\n\nThere are some misuses of activation in the current content files. The imperial palace has an activation that tries to test how many of a particular building an empire has, but this won't work, as only the source building for the effectsgroup will be tested, so at most 1 such building will be found by that condition.\n\nQuote:I expect you'd get 2 bigger krill swarms. The destroy effect doesn't actually delete objects until all other effects have executed. \"Executing\" the destroy effect just marks an object as to be destroyed, and the actual deleting takes place afterwards.\n\nSo, you'll need to be a bit fancier with the effectsgroup for things to work as you want with two objects being destroyed and just one being created. The MaximumNumberOf conditions might work, as you can ask it to match just one object, and then you could have a stacking group label in the effectsgroup as well, so even if both krill swarms have a CreateShip effect, only one will actually be executed (as the second attempt would see the stacking group label has already been applied to the target object, so it would be skipped). I don't seem to have documented MaximumNumberOf, MinimumNumberOf, or ModeNumberOf though...\n\nEdit: It would probably work to just use the NumberOf condition, which is documented on the wiki.\n\nOr, instead of having a single effectsgroup that creates a new monster and destroys the old ones, you could have two effects groups: one would match a type of monsters when there are two of the monster in the same system, and would destroy the matched monsters. The other would test for systems that contain two of the monster, and would create a new monster in those systems, and would have a stacking group. This effectsgroup would be tested for every moster of the relevant type every turn, which might be a bit slow, but it would only act at most once per system per turn due to the stacking group, and would probably be easier to understand than using the SortedNumberOf condition. /Edit\n\nQuote:\n\nAlso: what does \"location=\" do in a ship hull?\n\nIt is used by the production system to determine where a ship with that hull can be produced. For example, it could require a particular building to be present on a planet for a ship to be built there.\n\nSo are the above untested snippets for the source or activation?Habitability of a planet of a given environment is dependent solely on the species inhabiting it. A species whose EP is Barren would be best friends with the gigantic goo-spewing monster in question (not that that's a bad thing).\n\neleazar wroteWhat I think you're looking for is something like:\n\nCode:\n\nactivation = ContainedBy Contains Planet type = Asteroids\n\nThis will test the source object to see if its in the same system as an Asteroid Belt. Or, you could do something like:\n\nCode:\n\nscope = And [ Source ContainedBy Contains Planet type = Asteroids ]\n\nwhich should do exactly the same thing, since after the scope has been narrowed to Source, it's basically just checking to see if the Source is also in a system with Asteroids"

BA only effects are BA only - no Priests for ally fun. No more smoking during Scouts. Mephiston with Mastery level 3, otherwise 1/2 for basic Libbyies/Dreads. Yes Chaplains work for shooting as well but only BA squads - still mighty fine option to use early and then jump forward as combat engages.\n\nDark Eldar - Incubi are at least S4 but only AP3. Flickerfields work on terrain. Webway portals get a slap - no charges out of them thank you. Clarified issues with allies.\n\nEldar - Only Mastery level 1 for Farseer, 0 for Warlocks. It isn't said explicity that Stones give lv2 though it's implied in Eldrad's FAQ (2+1 for stones). Either way, most psychic army? Not so psychic though RoWard still working. Remember, most Eldar powers are for ELDAR units.\n\nGrey Knights - Force weapons keep their special stats. Combat squads, techies, etc. updated to stay in line with others. Halberd back to not adding intiative bonuses if I has been reduced. No squad benefits for being 'squad psykers' - only Inquisitors/Libby can get other powers.\n\nSpace Wolves - Iron Priests same as Techmarines. Rune Weapons still a 4+ nullify. Lots of stuff for SW only in terms of Allies. Frost Blade & Axe different and Wolf Guards become 'characters' for leading squads. Lukas' pelt works in challenges. Wolf Standards do not allow morale to be re-rolled.\n\nTau - Blacksun = ignore night fight. Bonding knives = base Ld for regroup. Yay for Acute senses on Suits. Drones can deny objectives, even if off vehicles. Gun drones are now restricted to same fire restrictions as other guns on vehicles.\n\nTyranids - Mastery levels are 1 (2 for Swarmlord) plus 1 for each power taken (so generally 2-3 on the usuals).

When meltas become flamers and lascannons become HBs because of the mass movement to foot sloggers? There is going to be less AT weapons, and if you still want to swamp them with high AV then there might just be too much for them to handle. Large blast from 'Russ are still going to take chunks out! And 9 of them are hard to take out with 1-2 meltas and a lascannon or two.\n\n9 Leman Russ' are neither combat effective nor efficient, though. Given that it'll require squadrons they become, if anything, more vulnerable- given the increased chance of immobilisation and/or destruction, you'll probably lose them at a fair pace. After all, given some of the rules changes, it is theoretically possible to roll the \"Explodes!\" result on 2+. So that means you could lose one of your squadroned Leman Russ' on the roll of a 1 on the chart. Even assuming 'normal' circumstances, you could very likely lose your tank on the roll of a 1, and expect a 'natural' explodes result on 3 or 4 up. I doubt mass tank armies are going to fare quite as well as people seem to be thinking, especially since weapons capable of taking out tanks are far more prevalent- even if many will simply be going for the all new 'glanced to death.'"

      "text": "Author\nTopic: Anti-starship arachnids (Read 1135 times)\n\nIn the last game I played, I captured an Anti-starship arachnid fab and build the full cap, but couldn't actually get them to attack anything. They never seem to fire on anything ever. I've tried manually targeting starships, leaving them without orders and free-roaming defender mode, but all to no avail. When manually targeting with them, it doesn't make the sound when something is targeted, so maybe something is stopping them from working.\n\nNot sure if I'm missing something with these, it's been ages since I last used them. Anybody got any ideas?Is this literally only things that could come from a Starship Constructor? I.e. they wouldn't be able to attack Mk IV Bomber Starships or Core Starships as they don't come from the constructor? That could explain some of the problems then as it was quite late on and I was trying to use them to defend against fairly high-level exo-wavesYes, I think the attack is 100,000. This sounds like a really good idea, pretty much making them into mini antimatter starship. It shouldn't really unbalance anything, and would make more sense for them to be able to shoot at other big shipsUseful tip that, thanks! I didn't realise how useful the reference tab was until I tried that. I tried having a look at this in the reference tab and counted 56 ships with the scope filter set to 'No Filter' that the arachnids did damage to, which was every starship that I could think of (including non-constructor ones) and other big ships like the Spire/Neinzul ships, but I've still not been able to get them to attack any of these. There were only 9 ships targetable if the scope filter was set to 'Ships I Can Build'.\n\nSpirecraft and Golems were not included in the list though which I suppose is fair enough, as they're not really starships haven't gotten any in a while, so I can't say. Maybe at some point the AI developed Anti-Anti-Starship Arachnids...\n\nSpirecraft and Golems were not included in the list though which I suppose is fair enough, as they're not really starshipsSort of related to tooltip issues, they currently have 6x damage against close-combat and swarmer hull types - and the reference shows none of the ships they can damage having either of those types, so those should probably just get removedI approve. Just don't call them Bomber Fighters. That would be confusing.\n\nJust remember, if they are like Bomber starships they bring 65% of the firepower of a Mark I Bomber starship at much greater range, a resource cost that is less than a Mark II Missile Frigate, a build time of 16 seconds (more than 41 times faster than a Mark I Bomber starship), and at normal caps you can have I believe 49. That is like having almost 32 extra Mark I Bomber starships.\n\nHowever, unlike bombers you can only get them from a limited facility that can easily be destroyed. You find them mid to late game. I'm sure they can be adjusted if needed, but they were deemed ok when they were first made and that was back before all sorts of cool toys were added to the game."

Sure, if they like X, that's fine. But, there's a good chance that you can't base a whole army on X, and you probably will need some Y and Z to go with it.\n\nIt also occurs to me, that mypreviousguides all function like 3rd Ed. splatbooks and that you originally need Codex: Space Marines as well to get the most out of them. Which, isn't conducive to a lot of people who're asking me this question.\n\nTo that end, I've gone and built a list of units that 'work best' in any given particular Chapter. For this purpose, these are the units that you typically want to base your army around or have a lot (four or more, usually, or as many as you can get, slots willing), or, which units work best in conjunction with the rest of the units in that Codex.\n\nThe second point to the List, is to make What You Like == What Is Good. Which a lot of new players have a hard time doing.\n\nDisclaimer: Space Marines is Space Marines. While you can build a Codex Marine army with 30 Terminators, a lot of people are going to wonder why you don't do it with Dark Angels instead. This is not a 'competitive' guide and will not tell you how to build an Army List. That is far more specific and you may be more suited to the linked guides above.\n\nThis is all subject to Cheesegear's opinion, and subject to change.\nThey are not written in order of preference.\n\n1. Codex Marine Captains are the 'most' flexible of all Codecies, and, the special character Captains will literally change the way the rest of your army is played.\n2. You will need a Librarian at some point. While many powers are the same across Codecies, they will function better in their typed roles due to the rest of the Codex.\n3. In this case, 'Black Templars' refers to Crusader Squads, which are much the same as Assault Squads minus the Jump Packs with additional rules that make them better in Assault. Hence the inclusion.\n\nI now submit myself to the rage criticisms of the forum.\n\n__________________ Steam Name: Cheesegear\nLeague of Legends Name: Cheesegear\nYou can fight like a krogan or run like a leopard but you'll never be better than Commander Shepard."

They need little ambient light but most if not all missions in STO have some kind of ambient light in them. So Ferasans should be able to see much better than humans as long as there is little ambient light in a room or area they're in.Insane holographic lifeform FTW, Bonnie-Kins!\n\nYou misunderstand me, I was complaining because I like the idea of the flashlight, but they pulled it off quite poorly. The flashlight they gave you only worked (lighting wise) in certain areas of the compound and failed in most others. For instance, on one wall it worked fine; the way a normal light should, then move down 10 feet from that position and the light disappears and does not light up any of the wall for 30-40 feet.\n\nOther than that, it's an amazing episode. Gave me chills the first time around!\n\nIt is pathetic that you would need that flashlight. I understand why it's made like that but nevertheless, pathetic.

This price includes TWO unique hangars and a console.\n\nSo the Atrox with its 2000cp price tag? Only one special hangar, no console, no bridge, no special ability/unique feature. It is basically a 2000cp voquv, aka a free ship.\n\nNow one might argue that all fed hangars are currently unique to the Atrox, which is true \"for now\". As soon as another fed ship that has a hangar slot or two shows up all the Atrox has are the stalkers.\n\nI can understand not wanting to give the feds the \"best\" carrier. Though why not let one of the LtComms be a universal slot so it has a broader appeal? Why not give it more fluff for it's premium price tag like a special interior. Why not give it a unique frigate like its klink counterparts have? We still don't have fed flight deck doffs yet.... How about a special console just like EVERY other 2000cp ship has?\n\nRight now I have the ship, I have fun with the ship, but for the price there just should have been more to it.\n\nProbably because it is a Federation Carrier. Players have been complaining about the Feds having carriers since launch. Both for and against Fed Carriers. The cost and race could be Cryptic's attempt to appease both sides.

      "text": "Each ship has a seating chart. The type of ship you're using determines how many Bridge Officers of a certain type you can sit. Escorts have more tactical seats, Science ships have more science seats and Cruisers have more engineering seats.\n\nAs a working example, let's take the Prometheus class Escort, you have Commander tactical station, one Lieutenant Commander tactical station and one Ensign tactical station. You also have one Lieutenant engineering station and one Lieutenant science station. What each ranked station means is Bridge Officers will only be able to access abilities from each rank's ability group. (So if you put a Lieutenant Commander Science Bridge Officer in the available Lieutenant science station, he'll only be able to execute abilities as though he were a Lieutenant. This is there to reflect a specific ship's design and capabilities. The Prometheus is designed with firepower in mind, not scientific discovery.)\n\nBut really what the question is each Bridge Officer has his own abilities. Is there any advantage to having each one of those three tactical officers using a Photon Torpedo Spread? There is, but there's a diminishing return on it.\n\nBridge Officer Torpedo skills have long cooldowns, but shorter global cooldowns. So if you had one Tactical Bridge Officer with Photon Torpedo Spread, you may have to wait a minute to fire the Spread again (you can keep firing regular torpedoes quite often). If you have a second a Tactical Bridge Officer with Photon Torpedo Spread, when the first one activates his skill, the second Tactical Bridge Officer's Photon Torpedo Spread skill will go into a 20 second global cooldown. So your second officer's Photon Torpedo skill will be ready before the first Tactical Bridge Officer's Photon Torpedo Spread skill. So with two Bridge Officers with the same skill you can activate them twice as often – three times as often if you add a third Bridge Officer with the same skill. It may or may not be the most efficient use of your Bridge Officers, but that's up to you."

High gravity would give an advantage to energy weapons and cause the most problems for LRMs. Dense fog / dust gives energy weapons problems. Depending on interpretation, a high argon atmosphere might be a problem specific to particle/ionizing weapons like PPCs.\n\nWe may not see it at first but I do see various changes from planet to planet that give an additional advantage to some mechs/weapons and a disadvantage for others.\n\nMost inhabited planets would be within a close % of 1g simply because that is where humans are most comfortable. Effects would be negligable and compensated for by the mechs computers. Weather and other environmental effects would have more effectP.S. Does anyone have knowlege on gravity realization in CryENGINE®3?\n\nCryENGINE2 has nice gravity realization, so I'm sure that CryENGINE3 would have it with much more reason. Crysis - (Core) is the chapter that uses zero gravity with first person navigation, enemy confrontation and floating objects.\n\nFor the most part if this is implemented at all, I would recommend it sticking to affecting top speeds, acceleration/deceleration, and jump jet height and fall speed. That would give it realistically basic and fun effects, while not becoming too complicated and interfering with players that don't want to have to take a training course just to effectively compensatethis would be an interesting thing to see, the Atlas is rated at 100 Tons, so if it were operating in that environment, it would make sense to reduce it's mass to the rated weight for the chassis.Having to strip 20 tons from somewhere. After all ,machines are built to a specification and exceeding that is often a bad thing\n\nAtmospheric density would increase with gravity too, so there would be thicker atmospheres, imagine a duststorm on a high-g world thicker air and it would hold a lot more dust too i would imagine\n\nI would imagine it would not be such a big hindrance from a programming point of view, not necessarily more challenging than programming a mech's movement, for instance, in/under water, in a tornado, in a blizzard, and in a sandstorm depending on the forces to which the mech/pilot is exposed.\n\nFrankly, I would love to see different gravity scenarios on planets at some stage but also inside/outside space stations/ships (as described in some Battletech novels) ...\n\nWow you just gave me an idea for some interesting maps; what if there was a huge storm in the middle of a battle? could happen on any map? think of an atlas in a tornado !, may change the out come of any battle?\n\nHonestly, an Atlas 100 ton chassis can probably withstand 120 tons of actual weight just due to the fact that all the components and joints are overengineered to withstand a rediculous amount of impact, jarring, heat, falling down, etc... walking slowly in the rear guard, you can probably add anywhere between 10-20% additional equipment on any 'Mech chassis above the light class.\n\nJust an observation, I am NOT saying 'Mechs should be able to carry more than their rated weight."

Really annoying when the Remans you're fighting alongside have to act like Starfleet officers.\n\nWould it be possible to introduce some method of modifying the available powers and equipment of the NPC enemies that we're placing on our maps?\n\nI only ask because the average NPC anything is incredibly easy to burn through and the ability to modify their powers or even grant them use of the item sets would be a huge boost to our RP dynamic.\n\nWould this be possible or is it just completely out of the question (or is it already in and I totally missed it)?I understand that, which is why in my last post I suggested a point system to ensure that enemies don't become weaker than the standard ships that Cryptic already has in the game.\n\nThe only thing that I really want to do is make enemies stronger and have more control over their behavior to better fit the stories that I and everybody else make\n\nYeah, some generic ships that we could recostume would be a great idea, and also allow us to put something like a dreadnaught into a one player mission.\n\nYou could have three criteria, like it's agility, offense and defence, and pick the one that has the right balance for the NPC you want to have, and by doing this it'd be impossible to make super weak ones (although why anyone'd need something weaker than a pair of frigates is beyond me)."

I mean even the sceleton weights of an Atlas is calculated with 10T no matter the armor it carries. And the Nuclear Reactor weights 19 tonnes. (I mean emagine you are moveing on a nice Atombomb into battle, lol)\n\nmy 2 sents is. I like the unrealism. It as the style over substance factor which makes the hole thing cool.\nI like the 100 Tonnes a lot because it keeps things simple in my head.\n\nHeat sinks are a vulnerable spot, like the NBC filter vents on a Abrams tank (yes enemy rounds and rockets have knocked an Abrams out by hitting that spot), designed to vent waste engine heat. You can't cover it up completely and STILL vent waste heat. Elementary engineering. They don't have to be mounted externally and aren't, really, though some are definitely in the engine others are spaced around the mech. Also, waste heat is generated by the myomer muscles in a mech and theres a lot fo that to disperse.\n.\n@dauntlessK\n\nQuote\n\nAblative armor of thebattletech universe: Introduced in 2470 by the Terran Hegemony. It is generally destroyed or blown off when hit, but in the process of doing so, it absorbs enormous energies, protecting the unit it is mounted on. While powerful blows will still rock a vehicle, there will be little, if any, internal damage as long as armor plating still remains. Armor-piercing rounds do exist for certain weapons, but they require a higher technology level and cost more. As a result, destroying a mech requires either immense firepower, concentrated fire on a vulnerable location, or a lucky hit.\n\nStandard armor is composed of several layers providing various degrees of protection and support. The first layer is extremely strong steel, the result of crystal alignment and radiation treatment, which is also very brittle. The second layer is a ceramic, cubic boron nitride, which combined with a web of artificial diamond fibers acts as a backstop to the steel layer. These two layers rest atop a titanium alloy honeycomb structure which provides support, and a layer of self-sealing polymer sealant which allows for space and underwater operations\n\nSo, from the above you now realize the armor is designed to be ablative and manages not only to shed massive firepower from the mech leavin gt intact, it is easy to repair int he field. The concept you are looking for is diminishing returns. With lightweight ablative armor you have nimble mechs, without it you have agromechs that die under the first volley. Add massive primitive armor slabs... called Hardened Armor, and your mech loses a bit of its speed gaining toughness. Do that, its in the TT rules but if they implement it in this game i'll be surprised.\n\nQuote\n\nVassago Legion, on 13 June 2012 - 05:45 PM, said:\n\nI've always thought the 100 ton \"limit\" was absurd when the Germans had a tank, Maus, in WW2 that weighed 188 tons, and it only had one cannon. Tanks aren't solid either, Some of them have enough room for 5 or 6 people.\n\nAnd even then their Ferdinand tanks caught fire going up hills (took them a bit to fix that, rebuilding th etanks as Elephants). I can build a 190 ton solid mass of armor and give it wheels but that doesnt mean it'll work. When we catch up to 31st century engineering (which is mostly 24th/25th century engineering in their universe) we'll be able to build battlemechs like they do. When the game came out the 100 ton limit was there. There was no innovation or new creation of mechs on a regular basis and few facilities that coudl even construct an Atlas. It took a while to go above 100 tons, not that i'd advise building mechs larger/denser, just makes larger targets for cheap mechbuster aircraft.\n\n@dauntlessK\n\nQuote\n\nTell me what you'd do as a designer if there was a new armor that was twice as thin and could stop your bullet easier. You'd simply design a better projectile, whether that means bigger, faster, harder, etc. And then what? Eventually you'd have a weapon that could outdo that armor, so you can either improve the armor technology again or thicken it to the orignal thickness, or both.\n\nAcid and AP rounds, already in the TT game. Been there for years. Designed to counter armor. What next?\n\nThomas Hogarth, on 13 June 2012 - 06:15 PM, said:\n\nIt's been speculated by people that write for Catalyst that are smarter than I am that 'Mechs have similar densities to foam. That's right, by all rationale, 'Mechs should float quite easily and be blown over in a light wind.\n\nSome may assert that it's easier to simply add a zero to the end of the weights. I think this leaves us with non-sensical machine gun weights. Easier to just assume that it weighs more in some manner or another and move on.\n\nOf course the foam rubber M1 Abrams has an internal volume of roughly 70 cubic meters and a weight of 60+ tons has four crew, large internal spaces and is 8 meters long. An Atlas is barely 13 maybe 14 meters tall and pretty solid (discounting foamed metal internal strucure and motive forces of electrillally motivated myomer bundles), has internal spaces for one crew and ammo.\n\nHmmmm..... neither seem to be foam rubber. Or light for their given volume.\n\n100-tons walking on what surface area? Might not collapse but it might sink...\n\nAn Atlas doesn't have big flat feet because of its agressive mating season urges.\n\nJaguar Knight, on 18 June 2012 - 05:45 AM, said:\n\nThe 100 tons of the Atlas is not it's weight, but is the weight limit of the amount of weapons, ammo, heat sinks and armor it's endo-skeleton can carry. Therefor a 100 ton Atlas in fact could very well weigh in at 150 or more tons real harm in sharingDam Buster bouncing bomb for example is the product of LOGIC iteration, for example:\n\nwhy didn't they use normal bombs instead?\nA. bombs accuracy of the time was VERY imprecise relying on massed saturation to achieve any sort of hit, the exception being dive bombing but dive bombers cannot carry bombs that can do sufficient damage to the dam, and regular bombs will not do catastrophic damage on the dam structure from above without repeated hits.\n\nMassed formation assault on the dam would be about the only way to achieve any real success with conventional bomb but Britain was in NO SHAPE or condition to divert sufficient bombers that would be required for such task given they are hard pressed and need bombers to hit other targets of war in quantity and have limited resource for it.\n\nWhy not torpedoes which would be a natural choice of weapon?\nB. because the german laid out anti torpedo net PRECISELY to counter this (they are not dumb, they KNEW torpedo bombers would spell complete destruction of the dam if allowed)\n\nThe bomb was specifically designed as such to allow it to be aimed much more accurately at the broad section of a target on water surface on a level run (which is important because the large bombers of the era which is needed to carry the bomb cannot aim precisely like a dive bomber with dive bombing) and skip the underwater defenses like torpedo net as a bonus.\n\nThe bomb wasn't counter to logical thought process... it was in fact designed and chosen PRECISELY because of the logical thought process involved in the planning.\n\nSame with Normandy, an entire planning stretching for months before the operation covered it (and with counter intelligence and deception operation of which was one of the most massive in scope of the war) and it's choice was taken not against the logic but WITH logical thought process taking into account the condition of the forces involved, and the time frame planned for the invasion.\n\nSlight rant there, but there's no such thing as absence of logic when it comes to something as vital as war decision, for absence of one generally means defeat.....\n\nSlight rant there, but there's no such thing as absence of logic when it comes to something as vital as war decision, for absence of one generally means defeat.\n\nSorry to disagree but having some military experience I can tell you some decisions are made for political and not logical reasons, at least not from a military perspective.\n\nYour example of the logical reasoning behind the Bouncing Bomb, while impressive , fails to acknowledge that it was not universally accepted by the military nor politicians. For example pressure from Air Marshall Francis John Linnell via the chairman of Vickers, Sir Charles Worthington Craven, caused Wallis (the creator of the bomb) to resign from Vickers due to his belief that the work was taking away from the development of larger bombers. Sir Arthur Harris, head of bomber command also opposed the allocation of his bombers after discussion with Linnell for similar reasons. Wallis did an end run around them both to ensure that the Chief of Air Staff Air Marshall Charles Portal eventually heard (and approved) of the project. It was Portal who overrode them all - due mostly to the increased pressure from Winston Churchill to resolve the issue of German mass-production in that area that was hindering the war effort which was resulting in growing calls from the opposition that his continued leadership was hurting the war effort - and the project went ahead.\n\nSo in short, Wallis' real logic failed to impress those who were directly responsible for making it succeed at the time because their logic felt it was not worth pursuing. If it wasn't for the political pressure - Churchill wanting to keep his job basically - it may very well not have gone ahead hence my comments previously. I guess my point should be that logic is really subjective, much like this conversation, and as such doesn't truly exist in it's purest form\n\nAnd please, don't think not understanding the reasoning behind things is mostly a 'civilian' issue. It's a people issue, period.\n\nAs for mixing IRL thought processes if they are not robust enough, that's purely a matter of opinion so we'll agree to disagree. I think they are to my logic, you think they aren't to yours. Mine is based on a position that they 'can' have a scientific basis because I acknowledge the inevitable advancement of science to reach the level where sci-fi become sci-fact and give credit to those - like the game designers - who seek the bridge that gap. Then again I am a bit of a 'dreamer' and therefore not bound by the constraints of cold 'hard' logic as some. Maybe it's called having a little faith and optimism\n\nAnd can you honestly say that you understand the reasoning for the cocktail stick? I mean really... the cocktail stick?\n\nBTW - kinda derailing the thread here aren't we Gods, we need to get into Beta!"

Klingons desire death in battle it's one of the few ways to earn an honored place in Sto'Vo'Kor. Starfleet seeks to avoid it if at all possible. And without the plot armor that was always available to the main casts of the series (last minute beam-outs, ejections, etc..), the attrition rate of Starfleet Fighter Pilots would be unacceptable.\n\nConsidering the shields and firepower of mainline vessels, Fighters are rarely the best option. Sending Fighters against a BoP is like sending speedboats with crews armed with handguns against a modern Submarine with a Titanium Hull. The Speedboats won't do any damage, the Sub can destroy them all easily, or evade them entirely, either way, the speedboats aren't going to win. There's a reason why very few KDF Carrier Jockeys use Fighters, and a great many use BoPs.\n\nShipwise, parity matters very little. What matters is how the ships are used. I, for example, use a a Science Officer in a Nebula to hunt down and destroy Carriers. In spite of their pets, in spite of their hulls and shields, the U.S.S. Eisenhower tends to wipe the floor with them, especially if I have a good wingman in an Escort.\n\nAs far as playstyles go, that's not really an argument. Carriers are freely available if you get a Klingon to the cap, or for C-Points if you're impatient. You could roll Joined Trill and pretend to be a spy for the Federation if you like, there's nothing wrong with rolling a Klingon if you want to play a Carrier, hundreds of people have done just that.\n\nThis is the most reasonable I have ever been on the subject of a Federation Carrier. I don't want to bring out the big guns, but I will if you make me.\n\nT5 ships are all that really matters the way the game is atm, all previous each time you reach a new tier it makes the previous tier obsolete, I'd be OK with having fewer total ships but more top tier ships.\n\nWell, given that the Federation currently has both more total ships and T5 ships, this isn't really an issue anyway.\n\n[list][*].[/i]Considering that sticking by their principles and maintaining a ship design philosophy around exploration and diplomacy over military might has won them every war they've been in, it's not hard to believe that the Federation would do any differently now.\n\nAlso I don't want the devs to anger Roddenberry's ghost any more than they probably already have. allowed allowedPrecisely. The Federation is slowly waking up to this fact. Assuming the game lasts long enough, it'd be kind of interesting to see future Episodes tell a story of a Federation that starts to degrade into something more strongly resembling the Terran Empire.\n\nIt is more likely that starfleet engineer corps will look at the KDF carrier and produce a ship to deal with it. This would probably be armed with heavy shielding and armour and point defence phaser banks/ turrets.\n\nI doubt starfleet would enjoy sending pilots to their deaths so easily, however, fighters do tend to carry heavy, disposable, weaponry for their size. This would be a definate candidate for Starfleet to look into dealing with."

This is my favorite non-MMO of all time.\n\nHello guys.\nI suppose you are playing complex deathmatch.\nYou should start by buying the power generators on the mothersip, and the first magnet on the power station.\nFor the next 5-6 minutes power won't be a problem.\nNow, depending on the map, either fill up two resource asteroid fields, or assign a scavanger and a few collectors to a debris field/ asteroid belt, right after you filled up a conventional asteroid field.\n\nYour military until the next rank is going to be nonexistant, so short of population, you will have to make due with the population-free defender drones, which are awesome against early raiding parties. Spam these until your eco says \" STOP\".\nAfter building a defense control module on the mothership you can get a rapid sweeper which will help you defend against any sub-capital vessel.\n\nWhen you get 30 honor points, you can advance to the next rank by \"buying' it at your crew station.\nNow is the time to extend your population cap, you can make barracks on your crew sation after each rank increase.\nFrigates early on is a reasonable thing for starters, but also in higher levels.\nMissle frigates are pretty powerful, especially with upgrades. Very strong at taking out resource collectors as well.\n\nResearch techs to earn research points, and buy the newest research modules whenever they become available.\nTo further boost your economy, use the power station's RU power up. The more collectors in range, the larger your profits will be.\n\nYour basic goal would be to set up a monster economy, and get a shipyard, pumping juggernauts with your mothership, and other capitals with your shipyard.\n\nHunting down production ships with this strategy won't be hard, games normally wouldn't take long after you sent 5 juggernauts to their deaths.\n\nSome would say, having a raiding, always active army consisting of small fast craft is better.\nI disagree, even the early weaponry tears them apart.\nIt's all a question of positioning your ships.\nI hope this helps for now. _________________\n\nHi there!

How much should I prioritize research over, say, fleet size?\n2) I have difficulties building a big enough resource stream. Once I have the main asteroid patch at my MS saturated, how do I expand effectively? Send a carrier? Should I universally use Scavengers over Mobile Refineries?\n3) How do I deal with nebulæ? On the 6-player map that's lousy with them, I can't send any resource collectors into the belts in the nebula nearby, or they all explode (even with a Scavenger with a Radiation Shield). Do I need that to be fully researched before I can maintain resource operations inside nebulæ?\n4) Is there somewhere to get more maps? I only have a handful with that many starting positions, and I'd like some variety.\n\nI don't know whether this will help, but if you are playing Hiigaran one of my favorite tactics (late game) is a pair of souped up Vortex ships. I ran rings around the single player AI; my two ships accounted for 1 Battleship, 2 Battlecruisers and 2 Dreadnaughts.\n\nA Vortex with Drive Module and Medium Battle Asset gives the best balance imo —they rule the battlefield! _________________ I'll have a Neutron Blaster please...\n...No Neutron Blasters...\nIn that case I'll have a glove"

A nice way to make the system balanced would be to make it so you have to be atop the opponent to beam the mercs down, so it's a bit harder to get a live working ship, instead, you could shoot down the ship, then beam your guys down and fly the damaged ship (beam down some skutters first of course, cant have any hull holes.)\n\nMy plan was more to make it so tha the boarders were manueverable, and were a secondary. rather than change your ship, I was thinking of making it a wingman in order to keep balance. making the projectlil slow but manueverble with a long lifetime counter would be truer to the origional idea.\n\n--------------------\n\nFaust Military Industries needs your help.

Seeing it is mention that the CSC is said to be there. So how about a base as big as the battle arena so CSC's and battleships can dock and report on the stats of the war etc.. then bring the field of view of it's great size only to be seen in the long range screen.\n\nappariently your wish has been granted. the newest version has a CSC in st. K not sure which CSC but i doubt it's the antartica as I believe that is already used in a later plot line in the game.\n\nthis is only what I've been told though so I don't know if this is true as. as I've yet to get to st. K in the new version. been busy breaking it to find the bugs lol. I'll let you know later tonight when I get there (just about to jump to charon but that will have to wait until I get home lolItem Name: X blaster Item Description: extremely powerful weapon developed by the (some random corporation) Item Type: weapon Value: 300000 How to get it: get from high end station damage: number of hp on your armour(total)\n\nItem Name: Nanopod™ Item Description: A unique vintage gadget that was once used to play music files and videos now costs more than some rare gems themselves. Effects: None Item Type: Trade Goods Only Value: 2000(Ringers) 12000(commonwealth) 6000(black market) How to get it: Random Loot from high end ships/stations, or randomly destroyed ships that are scattered in maps... Or by killing scavenger ships(maybe)\n\nItem Name: Cloud Seeder Item Description: Was made by a tinker rivaling Hiro himself, though his name remains a mystery. One of his inventions was the Cloud Seeder, which when installed into the ship's engine would enable nebulae vaporization, turning nebulae clouds into fuel when the ship flies above it. Effects: Rather than deplete gas, it would refuel gas while you fly above nebulae clouds. Item Type: Item Upgrade(you know, those weird information chip thingys) Value: 15000 How to get it: From an enemy in planet with nebulae clouds. Slavers mostly. Destroyed transport ships. Korolov shipping questline(when you get to be the legendary pilot they have)\n\nItem Name: Private Settlement Item Description: A small settlement that you rightfully own. Inside is a kitchen, a living room, a bedroom, and a bathroom. Lightings and furnitures included. Spare keycard included. Ease of installation designed for full-time space travelers. Effects: Acts like an unused armor that you can drop anywhere. You can dock on it, and when you dock on it it acts like a cargo hold and resting place for your character(gas won't be consumed while you are here) and your crewmates(adds a command to 'Rest' when a settlement is in that galaxy). You can also loot it back if you want to change locations(but the settlement should have nothing inside, else it won't be repacked). While inside you can watch the news, take a bath, eat(only if there is food on the settlement's freezer), sleep(which would make your character randomly dream about stuff), or talk to your crewmates. This adds a more 'RPG' feel into the game.\n\nThe news would vary greatly, depending on what you do. Example you saved the korolov station from the charon pirates at the charon space system, the news would appear when you watched the television, or while it's under attack. Or when you win the arena, or when you cleared up a whole space system of all the enemy space stations.\n\nTalking to your crewmates would also give a little backstory in them(example would be to volkov telling a story about his missing wife, or just murmuring them).\n\nItem Type: Consumable. Can be used as long as it's not destroyed. Value: 150,000(commonwealth) 200,000(black market) 50,000(ringers) How to get it: You buy it from commonwealth, black market, or ringer stores. If not, you get it from them through a quest.\n\nIf possible there could also be a korolov settlement(bigger cargo hold plus can have an auton that would act as a trader, which would sell the items in your settlement's inventory when you leave items there for at least 40-60% of their selling cost) and military settlement(has defense system, can be equipped with weapons and armor, like an immobile space ship)\n\nItem Name: Commonwealth Glasscutter Item Description: An advanced weapon that even the military considers a threat themselves. The Commonwealth Grasscutter would pierce through any defense, any ship, but deals a very weak damage. Though being able to cut a ship in two makes up for that. The efficiency of the weapon is also very convenient, seeing as it only takes 30MW to power it up. Effects: A simple laser weapon that beams forward(means that it shoots in a straight line, not like the bullet type with spacings), passing through enemies and ignoring their shields. Has a weak damage but can sometimes instantly kill an enemy ship if the laser hits the ship fast enough in a slash-like attack. Item Type: Laser Weapon. Possibly Military. Value: I don't know how to price weapons. How to get it: Through Military stores, Infirmary prize, Black Market, Ringers.\n\nItem Name: Prey Item Description: Yet another invention from the unknown tinker that rivals Hiro himself. The Prey is a weapon that literally 'salvages' an enemy ship's part, stripping it off from the ship's body. Effects: The weapon acts as a missile launcher that charges itself with electron-charged particles, which when it comes into contact with any metallic material, would turn it's magnetivity to rapidly increase and decrease, setting off a minimal \"gravity bomb\" that, in turn, would strip off parts of the ship away from it, or destroy it in the process.\n\nThe missile launcher charges every 5 seconds, giving off a max of 50 missiles in it's arsenal. When a missile is shot, it appears like an Ares Lightning Cannon's ion attack. When it hits an enemy, there is a chance that a part of the enemy would be stripped off, leaving some sort of debris or cargo box behind him. If not, just flying bits of metal would appear around the enemy. The cargo box would be indestructable and cannot be picked up for a few seconds after it was 'salvaged'. the animation would be that the cargo box would be electrecuted.\n\nThe missile has no damage, but it would have if it suddenly removes every single part of the enemy's ship. It's possible, but the salvaged parts would still end up in three ways, \"in good condition, damaged, or destroyed\".\n\nItem Name: Advanced Solutions and Messages 3ncrypter (ASaM3) Item Description: Unlike the Quantum PC, ASaM3 is used mainly by hackers to alter datas and coding from memory cubes and the like, enabling them to have the power to read the contents of it. It was illegal when it was introduced to the public, but since everyone found it to be quite convenient in most cases, the ban of it's use evaporated.\n\nMeaning the memory cubes and quantum arrays would now have uses, but mostly would just be full of stories that have no connection to the game whatsoever. Maybe a questline can be added where you suddenly unveil a mystery from reading tons and tons of quantum arrays, maybe about aliens, or the Iocrym and stuff.\n\nYes, it can fail at reading what's inside the cube. Maybe a foreign language or random gibberish. Or maybe add a twist and put chinese/japanese text inside them.\n\nItem Type: Sort of like the Quantum PC(I forgot what it's called) Value: 12,500 How to get it: Anywhere. It's not illegal and is common.\n\nItem Name: Lambanog of the Oriental Pearl. Item Description: A rare type of alcoholic drink that's sort of a weaker type of vodka. Ringers loves these, not for the taste but because of the price. Effects: Nothing. Sellable loot. Item Type: Random loot. Value: depends. can be sold to ringers. How to get it: Ice Farms, high level pirate ships.\n\nItem Name: Himagsik. Item Description: A rare weapon rom made by the anarchists scattered all throughout the space. The quality of the effect of the rom varies differently, and it's use is illegal anywhere in space. Effects: Gives random enhancements to weapons(Efficiency/damage/speed/etc.) and the percentage of buffs that it might give can go up to 110%(in damage only) Efficiency can go up to 60%. It can also malfunction and destroy your weapon, or do the opposites, rather than buff your weapon, it might nerf it. Item Type: Weapon upgrade(rom) Value: 1000-3000 How to get it: Has a chance that it would be given to you by a space station that you will save. Black market. Illegal trade ships. Random ships in space, Anarchist camps, etc.\n\nItem Name: Kadi-Liman Item Description: A weapon made by a once prominent asian race from earth. The weapon turns any damaged material into cable wires, which when used links the ship onto an enemy's power source, stealing all of it's remaining energy, effectively shutting off it's power supply. It's production has long ended, but at recent more and more of them have resurfaced throughout space.\n\nEffects: Turns any damaged materials into useable cable wires(the quantity depends on how much weight the item has) which is used as ammunition by the Kadi-Liman. When an enemy gets 'hooked' by the wires, it shuts it's main power, and when you dock into the ship, enemies can either surrender to you, or kill you, or you could attack the ship little by little first until they surrender. When they surrender, they would give you more than what the ship has, and all of the items they will give would be undamaged.\n\nExample, you can get items such as the reactor, the ship's main weapon, all of it's armor, etc, without any damage at all. Along with drugs, slave coffins, military badges, gems, etc.\n\nAnd also, when they surrender, a commonwealth ship would arrive, and would thank you for making them surrender 'and' leaving the spaceship undamaged.\n\nIt could lead out as a military mission if ever. Where after obtaining Kadi-Liman, you can be assigned to salvage more 'undamaged' ships to study it's mechanical composition, for military purposes unknown to you of course. And if ever, you can change your ship into one of the ships that you can salvage, meaning this weapon 'would' be the best weapon if you get bored of your current ship design."

For one, it wouldn't really fit the game's image very well at all. add to that Shadow Revolution's shiny, high tech theme, and this is really just an idea for a plausible Liberation front unit.\nImagine you're part of the old world order, and you want to fight back against the OoN. They keep backing you against the wall, and you're running out of functioning units, but hey, this is America and you've got one of these:     (skip to about 56 seconds in)   (holy crap!)\nYou get the idea.\nThey're big, armored, and built to carry really heavy stuff. Impromptu weapons platform?\nThe pros would be extreme cheapness: they're already built, just weld something dangerous to the roof and armor over the wheelwells/driver's seat. instant disposable tank. Some of them are so monster truck they could probably crush your average tank of today.\nThe cons are obvious. they're not designed for battle. Controlling them would feel clumsy at best. The weapon of a desperate tank commander or someone with lots of guts/insanity.\nI don't think it would be for PvP at all, but it would make a really interesting PvE mission in story mode. A last ditch attempt to take back a OoN controlled weapons depot using only non-conventional vehicles and gear.\n\nThey would make really eye-popping decoys, wouldn't they?\nI don't know if unconditional suicide is an appropriate theme to model a unit around like it was in dune 2 or the Homeworld expansion, but you could put an awful lot of explosives into the back of one of those babies, too.\n\nMaybe they can rig up some sort of mechanism to hold the gas pedal down and steer forward. It wouldn't be perfect, so when you used the superpower, the vehicles will go forward for the most part, but would also start to veer off a bit. Some may even flip over early, or crash into other videos and explode prematurely\n\nThe army and airforce is actually testing new hardware to adapt civilian vehicles into combat vehicles currently. A prop plane for instance can replace a jet with a much smaller pricetag, and can arm many of the same weapons, has shorter runways, easier to work on etc.\n\nAnother example is apperently a humvee costs close to 150 grand, but a suburban with a add on armor kit is projected to cost 1/3rd that."

      "text": "I've programatically changed Tbullets according to the speed of the particular bullet. Essentially, I've set a maximum OOS damage of 17% of the IS damage, while also maintaining a minimum OOS damage of 10% of the IS damage.\n\nFrom there I map the available weapons to that range, according to their bullet speed. Outlying bullets (anything faster than an XRM PAC bullet -> 1400 m/s, or slower than an XRM PSP bullet -> 480 m/s) were ignored for this mapping and instead directly assigned to the maximum and minimum values (i.e. PACs, IREs, etc do 17% of their IS damage OOS, while PSP, Mining Drills, etc do 10% of their IS damage OOS). For the remaining bullets there is a linear map of speed to OOS damage percentage (for every 1 m/s faster the bullet moves, the OOS damage is increased by a certain percentage, starting at 10% and maxing at 17%).\n\nThis should be applied as a false patch _AFTER_ XRM. Let me be clear, just as with my assymetric warfare XRM plugin (  ), I don't really intend to support this--keeping up with Paul is simply not sustainable given my RL obligations. this is merely for my own uses and I've made it public in case Paul finds it useful or so that others can build on it if they so chose.\n\nI've run a few tests, though testing has been by no means exhaustive. To me, OOS combat feels about right now, but I'm sure there are some cases that still need work. I've also only done my tests actually observing fights in the map--timings change when not actually looking and so these values may not yet be optimal. Still, I'm pretty happy with it, so far...3 Scimitars still lose to a pirate Katana, but it's actually a very close, and protracted battle where shield recharge counts, but doesnt dominate and the Katana ends at 75% hull, instead of never dropping below 95% shields. A 4th scimi and the Katana loses.\n\nThe resultant weapon OOS/IS ratios are as such:\n\nThe first item is the Bullet_ID\nSecond item is the Bullet speed (in engine units)\nthird item is the OOS/IS damage ratio (IRE, PAC, etc vary a little from 17% due to rounding)I found that the really slow projectiles needed a much larger change in percentage than the faster projectiles. Looking at your list, your PPC and PSP are very similar. That will make Terran capitals much more powerful. There needs to be a bigger percentage difference between those two. Currently in the XRM i have PPC at 10% and PSP at 7.5%. Ive currently got the PPC at 20% and PSP at 15% although i think these values are a little too high.\n\nPPC is honestly not much faster than the PSP--it's only only 20 m/s, or 4%, faster than the PSP.\n\nCompare an FPD to an EMPC, where the difference is closer to a 42% (630 vs 900) speed difference, or an EMPC vs a HEPT with a 22% bullet speed difference (900 vs1100) but the OOS/IS damage ratios in XRM for these weapons are constant at 10%. Why is a 4% difference enough to call PSPs unbalanced, but a 42% difference overlooked?\n\nIf PPC/PSP are unbalanced, I would suggest that it's not in their hit percentages. The real issue is that the Terran ships are simply better than their Argon counterparts, though they're much more restrictive in loadouts and generally more expensive, and so _should_ win. The proper balance point for a generalist vs a by-design-top-tier is numbers, not artificial gimping.\n\nIf you're worried about the Argon losing, Increase the size of their defensive jobsTC Plots, for now anyway, isn't going to work with XRM, unless you want to open the cat/dat up and pull out the conversations.xml (at least) and see what it does that way. I have been through it today, and it doesn't look (at first blush) like it would be too much fun to try and make it workSo I just ran that test using my TBullets above.\n\nI spawned both ships with the cheat menu, owned by me initially, 30km from each other. I hand outfitted them both with max tunings, shields, and the most powerful weapon available in each bank and set their turrets to attack enemies. I then changed ownership of the titan to Race 1 (which is hostile to me and non one else thanks to phanon corp) and ordered the Osaka to attack it. As soon as either one fired the first shot (the Titan, incidentally) I started a stopwatch:\n\nSo, you're right, there are issues in OOS, but I think you've mis-identified them. It's not that the Osaka is doing too much damage (it actually takes longer to kill the Titan OOS than it does IS), rather it's that the Titan is doing too little. This seems to be some evidence that the base OOS damage values are still too low and shield recharge is dominating--keeping the Titan from breaking the Osaka's shields.\n\nNow, of course this could be used to support your position that the PSP should do relatively less damage to the PPC (since thats just the inverse of what I'm suggesting, which is having the PPC do more damage), which I'm fine with. However, it also demonstrates that both should have their damage increased even further from even the boost I gave them above.\n\nWith the evidence at hand, in the form of Alkeena's tests, and Paul's statements of current damage model...\n\nI'm inclined to agree with Alkeena, at least in part.\n\nObserving the exchange, I would suggest increasing the overall damage values, while retaining the mild \"nerf\", as it were, to PSPs to compensate for the manner in which OOS is calculated. It seems to be very realistic, that with the OOS damage values set too low, it is itself influencing the outcome unduly as a result of shield regeneration.\n\nAs for the \"length\" of OOS battles, aside from affecting the ability of the player to arrive and attempt to influence the outcome, I do not see the point of dragging out OOS battles. If the player is concerned about participating in a particular potential battle, then he should be there... If he's not... Then... It's just the simple logistics that he's too far away to get there in time. I don't see what relevance the \"length\" of the battle persay has on the accuracy of the results. If it's a 30 sec battle IS, it ideally should only last 30 sec OOS, as long as the end result is relatively accurate.\n\nRealistically, a perfect solution to this issue will never be found, due to the manner in which OOS is calculated and the variable nature of ship load outs. If ships were hard set with certain weapons, a viable formula could be reasonably achieved. As it is, no matter what settings you choose, there will always be combinations/flukes that \"win\" when they shouldn't. You can only ever hope for the philosophy driving most of X decisions, namely, \"it's good enough... most the time\"\n\n-edit\n\nOn an unrelated note:\n\nI noticed that the Morrigu, which is now a light carrier design capable of docking 15 ships:\n\n#1 Indicates in the description it only carries one fighter\n#2 Does not appear to spawn with any fighters.\n\nIn general the OOS damage values need to be increased. My own testing of 50% was only as long as I was able, and that was only a few hours. I'll probably reduce that number later, but so far, battles seem a bit more 'realistic' for when I'm IS and actually watching"

      "text": "think null would be more fun if the isk/resource gathering were mostly passive and players just needed to protect the isk generators from other players. Mining for instance, would more interesting if it was done by an anchorable mining structure. Make the mining structure drop a high value mining core, make the mining facilities show up on the map and you have a small gang objective. Instead of people zoning out to the sound of mining lasers, you form a defense fleet. If raiders overwhelm the defenders, it becomes a race to get the mining structures torn down before the attacking fleet gets to them.\n\nThe problem with small gang objectives is that they're ridiculously easy to steamroll with a handful of supers or a large gang.\n\nSo, people can complete them with small gangs or with supers and blobs.\n\nThats no reason to avoid placing them in EVE, just a reason to not have them be the sole challenge and to have them setup in such a way that multiple small gangs are favoured rather than the singular ball of death full of supercaps\n\nThe problem with small gang objectives is that they're ridiculously easy to steamroll with a handful of supers or a large gang.\n\nThe problem with \"small gang objectives\" is that they mean that the large sov holders now have a real incentive to hotdrop/blob/faggotry those small gangs other than just \"bored & lulz\", because every small gang will be a threat. The idea that they'll suddenly stop being hot-dropping faggot blobbers because now they actually have something at stake is almost surreally unrealistic.\n\nI've been supporting things like small (100 m3) anchorable ISK printing machines for ages. Each one has, say, an hour-long cycle, is anchored at a planet and shows up on system overview. If the cycle completes, you get some amount of money (if certain space is meant to be valuable, then base it on truesec) that's equivalent to maybe 30 minutes of ratting. The modules themselves are relatively cheap (~couple of cycles) and only one can be anchored per planet and only one per solar system per person. So a solar system with 10 planets could have 10 modules owned by 10 different players in it.\n\nIf a hostile arrives, they can offline it with a 5 minute timer, which you can cancel at any time if you're within 5km of it. If the thing goes offline, the cycle doesn't complete and you get nothing and the enemy gang can pop the module trivially (like, 50 rounds for a cane). What I'd hope would happen is that people roam around a constellation reactivating their modules periodically. When a hostile gang arrives, they would deactivate all the modules and wait for the defenders' response. A massive fleet wouldn't really be helpful, because it'd still take just as long, and 5 minutes gives enough time for a pre-formed defense gang to scout out the location and make a decision about whether to engage. If no fight is forthcoming, you've denied individual enemy pilots a significant chunk of income.\n\nObviously, there's modifications that could be made - eg. if warping to every planet is tedious for a gang, you could instead centralize them and cap how many pilots can use the ISK Printing Hub simultaneously and charge every player ISK up front to use it. Cancelling still takes 5 minutes, but cancels the cycles of everyone using that hub at the same time. The hub could also give the gang that successfully deactivates it all the players' cycle activation ISK (a fraction of what the cycle would have produced, maybe 5mil per active cycle).\n\nI'm sure there's some way to abuse this, but it seems like it would give more motivation to actually stay in PvP ships and form constellation-wide defense gangs that work together than just POSing up in your carebearing ship, because defending isn't worth the risk of losing your PvE ship.\n\nAlthough the more passive income and isk generators part sounds interestingIf you kill enough of them they stop fighting - Gen. Curtis Lemay\nFear the KKM\n\nYeah, I'm not sure what you do about the various barges. One thought I had for the Rorqual was to give it a pretty obscene bonus to the mining towers, but only while it's on-grid and in siege mode. Maybe strengthen its tank and repping abilities so that it can perform a bit better as a defensive emplacement. Then every now and then the mining towers can poop out a can for the Rorqual to tractor in and compressAnd there is a mission where you had to haul a cargo-hold full of 'planet-side currency' for a ransom or something. That money wasn't even worth using as toiletpaper for us capsuleers.\n\nOne quick way to making Sov more desirable would be to limit placing posses to systems you have sov in (not including lowsec or npc 0.0). Much of sov 0.0 only works if sov is something you want to have, and want to have more of.\n\nThis is a... really bad idea.\n\nStaging POS for an assault?\nStealth POS for whatever nefarious operations you can think of?\n\nStaging POS for an assault?\nStealth POS for whatever nefarious operations you can think of?\n\nBoo.\n\nSov holders already get an email announcing when any other entity anchors a POS in their space, but apparently that's not enough of an advantage, as expecting them to actually read warning mails is pretty unreasonable.\n\nBecause God knows, if there's one thing small gang PvPers ache to do, it's to sit around watching timers. Why that's the kind of gameplay that's made FW the runaway success it is!\n\nActually, having participated in FW, those plex timers can be pretty awesome.\n\nThe proble with FW is not that plexes require time to complete. That's fine. The problem is that to \"win a system\", you have to run 30 randomly-spawned plexes, which is best done in a PvE-fit ship in a way so that the enemy hopefully doesn't even notice.\n\nWhen we had actual fights about plexes (liberation of Siseide and Lantorn winter 2009, say), the timer stuff worked excellently to provide good fights with objectives.\n\nIn the end, it's just the same as shooting structures: There's a time limit until one side wins, and the other side need to stop them before that happens. With structures, the time depends entirely on the attackers dps, while with plexes, the time is fixed regardless of fleet size.\n\nWhile time-based stuff can be done completely wrong as well, don't write it off as generally bad :-)\n\nUnderstandably. Both FW and sov timers get some essential things wrong there (in addition to \"too many timers\").\n\nThe basic mechanic of \"getting a fight\" has roughly the stages challenge, scramble, engagement. Basically, the attackers march in on the battlefield and say \"I challenge you to a fight!\" (attack a structure, sit next to a capture point). The defenders then have \"some time\" to scramble together a defense fleet. Once they have one, there hopefully will be an engagement. If they do not engage, they lose \"something\".\n\nYou can balance the fleet sizes that will engage with the amount that is at stake and the time you give for scrambling.\n\nThe amount that is at stake primarily encourages attacking fleet sizes. E.g. \"this thing will gain us the whole system\" will encourage attackers to bring a huge fleet. Less grand objectives will attract smaller fleets (that's the reason why you rarely see 1k blobs hunt ratters - the potential gain is not exciting enough to attract so many people and make the cat herding worthwhile). On the other hand, it has to hurt the defender a bit, or he will just wait it out (one of the main FW problems).\n\nThe amount of time you give for scrambling is the main factor for the defense fleet. Defenders have the home advantage of (usually) being able to field bigger fleets, but they need time to form the fleet as the attack happened at a time not of their choosing. This is something FW did very right - if I see a minor plex going up in local, I know I have under 10 minutes to get together a frig/destroyer fleet to throw them out. Which gives an incentive to go in there with whatever you got after 5 minutes and hope it's enough. Giving longer will just increase the defender's blob size (a sov timer of 2-3 days is a very long \"scramble time\", hence the huge fleets).\n\nFW gets this wrong because the goals you can achieve are limited to bragging rights, and because the \"marching in and say 'I challenge you to a fight!'\" 90% of the time happens without the defender knowing about it, which removes the whole point of it.\n\nStructure shooting gets this wrong because it gets the scramble time wrong. Smaller fleets need longer to accomplish the goal, meaning the defender has more time to scramble a big fleet - a small fleet attacking should give less time to scramble, not more. It also encourages huge fleets because they get the objective done faster.\n\nSo if you want small-scale fights, you need to first identify something that's not earth-shattering to the defender, but still annoying; then pick a time you want to allow the defenders to react on; and then go with that. Ideas I've heard in the past are things such as \"stealing the contents of the current moon miner silo\", \"downgrading the industry index to reduce ratting efficiency\", even station services if they'd not require so much damage to take down, etc.\n\nJust as a silly example, with numbers requiring more thought and adjustment: Moon miners and silos become structures independent of POSes, but also invincible. When you \"hack\" one with a codebreaker, a timer of 20 minutes starts, after which you can open the silo and take the contents with you. A roaming fleet comes to a system and starts doing this. Now the defenders have 20 minutes to set up a fleet - no 60 minutes of \"x up x up\" in the Supercoalition Intel Channel, they need a fleet, fast. They might even be able to get a smaller fleet in first to distract the attackers so the bigger fleet can slowly form in the background, or whatever other tactics they can come up with.\n\nI think this would provide a lot more incentive to start small-scale fights.\n\nFake edit: *looks up* holy wall of text, that turned out longer than I thought it would ...\n\nTimers work pretty well in Battlefield style games where you sit near a flag for a bit and it switches sides. I like the idea of initiating a \"switch side\" timer where you need to be there at the start to push butan, and you need to come back to receive bacon, but you don't have to be there in the middle. The attackers can tag a few and then go do something else (roam, piss on miners, log off and masturbate) while the timer runs for, say, half an hour. That gives the defenders time to form up a few gangs to protect the flags, and the attackers can pick one, hit it, kill the defenders or die trying, and then receive bacon (or not if they're dead).\n\nLetting them tag multiple timers at once and not stick around helps with the issue of defenders just jumping all over the attacker with a horde (gotta spread out or teh bacons will be takens from one of the undefended sites), and also doesn't involve sitting around twiddling your dick and waiting for a long ass timer. Those are both good for gameplay.\n\nOnce a gang receives bacons from a flag, the flag goes into a 24hr cooldown, but flags that don't dump bacon can be hit again. Flags would be tied to stuff in the system -- maybe the indices, maybe giving a slight bonus to ratting income or some shit. Something with an effect that people care about, but nothing hugely important so that it's not mad lame. Only a couple per system, only in systems held by an 0.0 entity. Bacon could be anything -- some random loot, maybe some isk, even just LP with the pirate faction that hangs out in the area. Doesn't really matter so long as there's not a huge amount of it, and it's not totally fucking irritating to move. Figure the bacon isn't sufficient to reward more than 20 or so people -- a fleet doing it would get like 1isk each, but a small gang would do ok.\n\nSo, enough to encourage pvp by money grubbers in fast ships, but not enough to be worth doing with a blob.\n\nAnother rando idea. Maybe CCP could add in the ability to open an LP store (with the same kind of gear for every alliance) in player owned 0.0 stations. Doing specific stuff would earn you LP with the holding alliance. Takes up an office slot, costs money on the regular, in return your players can buy loot. Players can't hand out the LP, but players who do good things for the alliance (defending the bacon pumping flags, certain pve activities, working to raise the index) would get you some LP.\n\nNeat way for CCP to use the inner jew-whore of all Eve players to reward team effort in alliances. Doubt it would work well, it's just a mind shit. Problem with Eve is that anything an enemy would do that you could reward a player for undoing, the player could exploit by doing it and then fixing it. So if you reward them for killing reds or repairing a pos, players will set up sock puppet corps to kill for farming the LP or shoot their own pos to rep it. It is our way.\n\nThird idea is allowing corps/alliances to set a cash bounty (paid from corp/alliance wallet subsection set up for it) on reds/wts. Since it's player money it'd be policed better, and it'd offer an interesting tool for some corps. Doubt many would use it, but I can see where it'd be fun on occasion.\n\nNeat way for CCP to use the inner jew-whore of all Eve players to reward team effort in alliancesthere is the shares system, but that's kinda a joke. i tried to use it to collect money from alts, then give shares to my main to 'easily' move isk around between all my accounts, but long story short that doesn't work.\n\nSov needs pay days that don't filter through someYeah, but WoW has clearly marked foes. Eve doesn'tThat's why bacon dispensing pvp flags seemed like a good idea. They'd be harder to game, they'd involve something the enemy wants to defend, and they don't require hours of waiting or mindlessly shooting an inert structure. Just push butan, get fight, receive bacon.\n\nThat and the mining pos thing I was blabbing about before (basically a pos that sits on an asteroid belt but is small and kind of lame) would add more targets for people in small groups to shoot at and start fightsBut what you gain from killing a ship would naturally be less than it cost to make the ship.\n\nIf you kill enough of them they stop fighting - Gen. Curtis Lemay\nFear the KKM\n\nYou'd get a faked KM that looks legit, insurance on the T1, maybe corp reimburse and definitely whatever the kill bacon is.\n\nThat's why it seems pretty problematic to tie rewards directly to ships -- other than rewards created by the dead player him or her self, like gear or ransom or something -- as opposed to activities that result in pvp.\n\nSo transfer works, but creation of new loot don't because it can be gamed.\n\n\"Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.\"\n\nJoin Date\n\n2007 Jan\n\nPosts\n\n108\n\nR/P\n\n0.10185185185185\n\nRep Power\n\n7\n\nCCP will NEVER allow passive income on a wide scale for the Eve Community. I'm honestly surprised they did PI. CCP wants people in game and capable of being ganked. Anything you suggest that would detract from such goal is pointless waste of typing. They want people in their game not logging in once a week to push a button. I suspect they're itching for a reason to nerf tech and make Incursions the primary means of Alliance level income because it's an active form of wealth acquisition.\n\nHonestly, what would be nice is some way that you could put your shit out there to be ganked and earn passive income while you're in a defense fleet instead of mindlessly clicking on red crosses for hours.\n\nHonestly, what would be nice is some way that you could put your shit out there to be ganked and earn passive income while you're in a defense fleet instead of mindlessly clicking on red crosses for hoursIncursion 1.6 Client Update #1\nClient Update #1 for Incursion 1.6 To be deployed on May 31, 2011\nThis client update fixes a number of issues introduced with EVE Online: Incursion 1.6.

      "text": "One of the big perks of being a Rogue Trade is that you are allowed to interact and deal with the Xeno. But, how is that handled on the other side of your trade route? Buying alien wares is all good and dandy, but whom are you selling them to? Most xeno technology seems forbidden and/or blasphemous so the authorities would take a dim view on you selling that stuff to imperial citizens. Of course, raw materials are no problem, but what other xeno wares can be sold legally? Do you have any guidelines?\n\nI was thinking about this exact subject. I think Xenos wares are fine for selling as long as the arent being imported into the imperium but smuggling items in or selling them to cold traders is a definate way of getting more prfoit than making legal trasactions outside the borders of the imperium.\n\nI think the Kasabasilica mission in Footfall (and port wander, too if I'm thinking correctly) tries their level best to buy up all things Xenos. their competitors do the same. so a Rogue Trader can hit footfall with a load of Xenos artifacts, sell it to one of the organizations that deals in that stuff and walk away clean. no muss, no fuss and doesn't have to worry about the details of what happens next.\n\nalso - most humans won't know if something is Xenos make. ignorance is bliss, remember? as long as something isn't obviously creepy, weird or psychic odds are most humans won't know anything about Xenos gear or items. it'll be different tho, which is a whole other issue. but if you sell it properly you might convince someone they aren't buying xenos items, its really just some very very strange archeotechhmm.\n\nwell, at a guess I'd say that high ranking members of imperial society could legally purchase Xenos gear (so long as it wasn't TOO offensive and/or blatantly obvious). Generals of the Imperial guard, various and sundry nobility, trading cartels looking to seem more impressive/fearsome. Members of the adeptus mechanicus looking to rip apart Xenos gear to learn it's secrets and/or figure out how to destroy it's makers easier. the Imperial Inquisition might want to legally aquire Xenos tech for all sorts of reasons that don't bear thinking about. Then of course there's illegal cultists who might arrange to legal purchase Xenos items for their nefarious purposes - after all, why steal it when you can just BUY it? set up a shell corporation, buy your various required items legally…and then disappear foreverFind the right (wrong?) members of the Inquisition who are radical enough to believe that the weapons of the enemies of mankind should be used against their creators, or Heretek Adeptus Mechanicus who seek to study their technology to see how it could be made complaint with STC patternsI believe that the point is to trade xenotech with those willing to buy it outside the Imperium to aquire favours, objects and the like that ARE legal and highly sought after by the Imperium or somebody in it. Obviously, selling to Ordo Xenos or a Magos Xenologis would be perfectly legal (although I envy your contacts if Ordo Xenos buy stuff from you). You could trade that tech with a mercenary group as payment for their help in purging an ancient human city, where you get the dibs on all the cool stuff, or you trade an eldar tech for a document detailing the location of something or other.\n\nThen, of course, there are the illegal markets, but that is not the subject of this thread.\n\nI would imagine that there'd be a legal blockage in the fact that while selling to the Inquisitoon and Magos Xenologis is legal, just being in possession of it within Imperial space is not. I would imagine you'd still have to smuggle the goods to a forge world in order to \"legally\" sell it. Well, either that or arrange for the Magos to come personally pick it up outside Imperial space, which I doubt the Magos would consider that unless it is very valuable.\n\nfrom my understanding; so long as the authority don't find Xenotech in your cargo hold, you're good to goExcept that is the in-universe explanation for 40K. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim and dark future, there is only war. Rogue Traders are meant to make contact with Xenos races, assess them as a threat to the Imperium (possibly through posthumous examination of the Rogue Trader's shattered hulk of a vessel), and then categorize whether or not they need to be wiped out immediately, or just sort of ignored and dealt with when the Navy has a moment.\n\nNow there are a lot of radical Inquisitors, bored nobles and AdMech who will happily buy things from you, but they're not going to blatantly advertise that's what they're doing. The only real place where you can find a market where selling these things doesn't get you executed on site would be a place like the Koronus Expanse which is not technically Imperial Space. Even then though, you might face some pointed questions when you come back if you're viewed as having gone native.\n\nThe place where xenos technology is openly traded, analyzed and discussed is the Tau Empire. There are hints that there's a portal to the Eastern Fringe somewhere in the Koronus Expanse, so if you find that you could probably set up a market over there as well.\n\nYou wouldnt have to got hat far at all. The Kronus expanse is like the wild west, it is wilderness space the imperium can't enforce it so they allow private intrests to develop it and assess it thus rogue traders. Since your not in the imperium xenos technology is not proscribed and you dont have to worry about being prosecuted at all.\n\nThis is why rogue traders are seen as dangerous by the rest of imperial society, while their brining the light of the emperor into the darkness they come into contact with dangerous and blasphemous things. This is accepteable because as their warrant states they act as the voice of the emperor byond his realm and they can do what ever they see fit while their out there.\n\nThis is also why rogue trader wars are technicly legal as well. Their petty squables are ignored by the imperium because it doesn't have the resources to enforce the areas of space the rogue traders operate in.\n\nLegal trading of xenos good can defniately take place just so longa as you dotn bring it to any imperial controlled planet so damaris is a no go. But footfall or the breaking docks are fine. In fact higher lelvels of imperial society proabbly like things this ay sincce it encourages development without any cost to the imperium itself. By keeping illegal goods proscribed from imperial space it protects citizens from corruption while simulatneously forcing rogue traders out into undeveloped regions.\n\nIf you have access to it, I recommend reading the cold trade section of Hostile Acquisitions. It addresses warrants that allow for trading with xenos.\n\nApparently it is legal for a RT who's warrant specifically states it, to sell xenos artifacts within the boarders of the imperium. It just that the trade is so profitable that those traders who's warrant does not allow them to to risk sanction.\n\nHOWEVER, the inquisition will keep a close eye on any traders importing xenos artifacts, regardless of their warrant and will intervene if they deem the artifacts to be too heretical."

      "text": "Absurdly Events\n\nMandrall\n\nI just had my metaverse game and everything went OK until does \"Events\" came..\n\nOne of my worst scenario just came to me. Pirates with absurdly firepower and defence spawned in the galaxy! I tried to fight them out but it was too much for me and also for the other nations too. It was just early in the game when you only got low weapon technologies. But does pirates had at most 30 damage for one fleet and also 20 in defense. While me and the other nations had a fleet with most 15 damage for one fleet. No one could fight them off. So they ran rampage in galaxy like they owned everything. And to add it on, does so called \"Jagged Knife\" came in, I only had 3 planets, though they took my research planet, so I only have 2 planets left, Altaria and Wisp. I only made about 160 turns before does nasty pirates came and destroyed all of my and the other nations fleets. Now the scenario has turned into a stalemate and it feels a bit hopeless to continue. Now I just make ships from my planets and never get a chance to get up from the ground when does pirates attacks my ships in orbit. Should this events occur so early in the game or?\n\nDon't get me wrong...I enjoy most of the 'mega-events' but there are a few that unbalance or downright ruin a game. I had a similar \"Mega-Pirates\" event once, and they were even nastier than the ones you describe. Lost every single ship I had. I just reload a previous save if pirates appear that are considerably more teched-up than me.It should be noted there's a couple of different flavors of the Precursor Artifact event, only one of which is a mega event - you can recognize it by the fact that it gets a short cinematic (ship flying over a desert) while the \"normal\" versions just have an image. The normal event, IIRC, adds 1 point to a random stat every turn and isn't a big deal. The mega event adds more (I forgot the details), but it still isn't as game-breaking as the Mega Pirates, because it only affects civilizations in last place.\n\nYeah some mega events are quiet fair but I have never stumbled upon this kind of mega pirates event before when you get outclassed by weapon and defence techs. And in just 160 turns. Do you guys think it is a bug or? I mean there are no chance right now for any civilizations to build up a fleet and encounter does darn pirates at the moment. Because every nations has about 0 attack ships (yay)!Its not a balls breaker but it can be a challenge to overcome it once it happensIf I recall that post correctly, weren't those just everyday run-of-the-mill pirates? The Mega Pirates will reliably kill every ship on the map.\n\nEdit: Speaking of those pirates, it's my belief that the tech level of normal pirates is equal to that of the most advanced race. Was there an AI in that game significantly ahead of you?Yeah, it seems that you have to be very patiant to over come such situation. To tech up to the weapons that equals to the pirates weapons and have large scale building perfected. I mean it takes alot of turns before you manage to get does techs with only 2 planets. But I will try.\n\nSpeaking of those pirates, it's my belief that the tech level of normal pirates is equal to that of the most advanced race. Was there an AI in that game significantly ahead of you\n\nThe Drath I believe, they got practical beams III (does with 3 damage) and large scale building perfected. So they could counter does pirates if they so choose to build large hull ships with alot of guns on.\n\nNo...they were definitely in the Mega-Pirate class. Playing as the Terrans, at the time, I was the galaxy's tech leader. Now maybe it was some sort of in-game glitch, but they just destroyed all my fleets within range plus all of my starbases, moved to my borders' edge, and simply stayed there...not doing anything else or attacking any other race.\n\nBut there was just one fleet, right? In that case, believe it or not, they were the normal pirates - the Mega Pirates show up with hundreds of fleets. The guys you ran into were apparently just some really powerful pirates.\n\nMy personal favorite and least favorite mega events, with favorite events not necessarily being \"fun\" as much as balanced and disruptive (like mega events should be):\n\nLeast favorites:\n\nThe Mega Pirates, for two reasons. Besides the obvious \"really annoying reset button\" aspect, the fact is that a player who knows how to exploit the pirates can turn this event into a giant \"I Win\" moment. The AI can't really adjust to the pirates and will never clear them out on its own, meaning that you can either finish off the pirates and emerge as the only civilization with a fleet, or just hunker down and go for the tech win.\n\nThe \"Depression\" event that gives a global hit to morale. Unlike other state-changing events like the \"Tourism Boom\" or \"Graft and Corruption\" events, this one is all downside - and it never seems to end. Just really annoying.\n\n(Dis)honorable mention goes to the \"Subspace Tears\" event that creates a permanent speed limit of 5. It's not entirely terrible (for one thing, it makes fighters much more valid as an option) but on the giant maps I like, it's just an incredible pain to deal with. This is one of those events I wish would scale.\n\nFavorites:\n\nThe Peacekeepers - unlike the pirates and their reset button function, the Peacekeepers actually don't destroy every ship in the galaxy. The event doesn't work like the text says (I don't know if this is a bug, or whether the event was changed and the text is an artifact of an earlier version) but it still is one of the best mega events at making a major change to the galaxy that doesn't completely unbalance things. I've only had them appear once, but it was a very interesting turn of events.\n\nThe galactic plague/disease - now that the AI has been fixed to actually research the cure, the events are another good example of a mega event that shakes things up in a fair way (even if they are a little unrealistic). The disease in particular can have interesting results - on one occasion, it hurt the Drengin's morale so badly that seven of their planets actually revolted to form a new civilization - something I'd never seen before.\n\nHonorable mention goes to the Dread Lords. They're very hit and miss - sometimes they get wiped out before doing anything, sometimes they become a minor nuisance before getting wiped out, and sometimes they actually turn into a real threat (once even becoming a menace on the level of the easier campaign missions, though not quite up to \"Apocalypse\" levels). Again, an interesting mega event - not always fun to deal with, but certainly does its job of making a major change to gameplay on the times they do come in strong.\n\nYou know, the game devs could have really made the \"Space Tears\" a really cool thing. I've seen topics that put part of the galciv history in games like Starflight and Star Control, both of which I played considerably.\n\nThe cool thing I was referring to was the worm-hole feature in Starflight that allowed you to \"jump\" from one area of the galaxy to another. You could even map them out and plan several 'jumps' to get where you were going. It certainly would take the sting out of the \"Limit 5\" event, but I think movement rates are rather unrealistic, anyways....\n\nWell, I let the \"so-and-so has uncovered an ancient artifact that grants them nearly unlimited power\" event stand in my last two games to see what would happen. I know it's only two examples, but I saw enough to convince me it unbalances the game. Not so much for a well prepared player, but for every other faction around the recipient of this bonus. Both times the civ getting the boost, wiped out its' neighbors in short order, going from mid to lower in the rankings, to number two (behind me) and netting the top spot in several of the categories.\n\nSorry.....just the effect I thought it would have. So it's back to banning it from future games.\n\nHere's an actual screenshot of what the \"precursor artifact\" mega event can do if left unchecked:\n\nAt the time this was taken (1-2 game years ago), this was ranked as one of the top ten research planets in the galaxy, and it could churn out a very good frigate every two turns as well. I think this was about 3 years after the Yor got the event, and the effects were simply incredible. Combined with a blitzkrieg offense against the Iconians and Lentzlandians, they're going from a typical \"failed colonization evil race\" to a legitimately major power. Not to mention that the bonus to their economy helped them survive a recent recession that has utterly crippled at least two of the major players. If the Yor weren't my ally, I would be seriously worried."

      "text": "So would you suggest that their damage go down some? Their fire rate go down some (aka. their reload time go up some)? Their range go down some? Their health go down some? Or their speed go down some (to reduce how well they can kite)? Or some combination of the above?\n\nAlthough keeping things together is very useful, sometimes you need that speed. Maybe you can instead group move only some of your faster ships (like speed 40ish and up?) together after the bombards. That way, there still is a blob that is harder to pick off, but not one quite so agonizingly slow (18 speed won't always cut it). Artillery ships, by their nature, are excellent on defense. And units that are great on defense will sometimes need a bit a micro to take care of them, because you don't have much of an advantage when you first pop in otherwise.\n\nAnd, as I stated before, you can abuse bombards in a similar way when using them for defense on your planets (except for the more than ship cap part, of course)\n\nThough, come to think of it, the AI seems to get above ship caps of low ship cap units very quickly. Are you sure the scaling of ship caps and reinforcement multipliers is working right? Sure, the AI gets bombards at a much slower rate than they get, say, fighters, but it still doesn't seem slow enough for their low ship cap. (of course, that could just me being annoyed, and the system is actually working just fine)\n\nIf you group move all your units together its like you make a fortress (without the range). They have tons of health and firepower but move slow. Bombards in ancient times were fortress killers.\n\nI don't see how you can't group move your faster units, bombers and fighters for example, and have them go out and kill the bombards. Your group move is being slowed by your own artillary units. If you send your fast units directly to the bombards, you will start killing them before the second shot. And remember, they come at 1/4 (?) of the caps of triangle ships. So they need to kill four times as many units to equalize on caps. That means a minimal of four shots, 2 minutes. That is enough to decide most battles on way or another.\n\nMain issue with chasing bombards is that you are waking up whatever toys are next to them with their guard post. I will try to chase them with fighters/bombers only and chameleons I have for bonus. Armor boosters I have as bonus don't really fare to well even in a fleet blob and their speed is not exactly stellar.\n\nFew times I tried to chase them with bombers.. I ended up without bombers.\n\nSame kind of reason why you likely won't ever see a Dwarf Fortress 2 -- why would you? Dwarf Fortress itself has never stopped growing, etc.\n\nThere already is a Dwarf Fortress 2, in a way at least. The Dwarf Fortress that everyone talks about is officially labeled, Slaves to Armok: God of Blood, Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress. Meaning that is officially Volume 2 in it series.\n\nSuper nitpick: No, the current Dwarf Fortress is the first Dwarf Fortress, while it is the second \"Slaves to Armok\" game. So to be quite frank, the series is called \"Slaves to Armok\" and hence \"Dwarf Fortress\" is \"Slaves to Armok 2\". Confusing? Yeah....stupid? Yeah. Dwarfy? Hell yeah!\n\nLogged\n\nClick here to get started with Mantis for Suggestions and Bug Reports.\n\nNot really. Either just swarm the system with high cap ships to effect target saturation, or use infinite engine health ships, OR use ships with enough range to not need a lot of moving. Or just drive a hive golem in and let the wasps take care of everything\n\nTrue. I had been thinking \"neuter planet on path to something I want, without spending AIP\", and running reinforcements through would be a pain thanks to the spider. But with human warp gates that's less of an issue, too.Nope, most guard posts do not have Antimatter bomb immunity. They have radar dampening instead.\n\nNow most forcefields and a very few select guard posts have antimatter bomb immunity.\n\nBut yea, I would support giving transports antimatter bomb immunity, for similar reasons that fortresses have a .005 multiplier on them. Or possibly make bombards have a .05 (or something) multiplier on Scout hulls, which would also fix this annoyance.\n\nI don't see the need to fiddle around with bombards. I have both fought against and played with them and I think they're good as they are now. Yes, they are annoying in AI hands but there are plenty of ways to deal with that. And they're lethal in player hands. Playing with them in my current 7/7 game. I have a full cap of mk I - Mk IV which means exactly 40 bombards (low caps) and they obliterate anything. 60 incoming maws? who cares, they'll be dead long before they reach me, long before they can even start chewing on me. When going on an attack, move the rest of your fleet in first, bombards about a second after so they won't waste shots on enemy ships near the wormhole. The enemy will then most likely order it's ships to abandon their guard posts and attack. A LOT of them die before they get even near my ships. Very useful. bombards don't really need a nerf (maybe a very small one) and they certainly don't need a buff.\n\nBasically, space planes have a radar dampening range less than their weapon range, allowing them to hit stuff without stuff being able to hit back. This allows them to win some really silly match-ups against stationary targets.\n\nEDIT: Actually, this is a decently nice ability for space planes in human hands, but a real pain (and not the fun kind of pain) to deal with when they are in AI hands"

It seems broken to me that high level players can farm items in the low level fleet actions.\n\nSince fleet actions are just a retooling of public quests from Warhammer Online, Cryptic should take a lesson and make higher level players earn fewer contribution points.\n\nIt would make sense to put a level cap on them, but Cryptic isn't exactly known as the MIT of MMO developers. They put out products that are \"OK\" and nothing more. This is an example why. I'm sure they'll fix it \"eventually\", but then again, this game was only supposed to have a shelf life of ~15 months.

      "text": "I wish to write a piece of fan fiction for my english class. I'm looking for some help bouncing around ideas for:\nCharacters, plot flesh, a standardized setting, and what fans would like to see.\n\nHere's what I've figured I'd do for the setting:\n1) Ships are expensive\n2) The Bounty Hunter's Guild has agents in every major settlement (30,000+), but only a few elite teams have craft. The average BH gets where he's going using commercial ships and apprehends in person using small arms.\n3) Space conflicts are rare, but very serious affairs.\n4) The Sirius Sector is a widely varying place - Border systems are exceedingly seedy (pirates are NOT glorious)\n5) The established navies protect large interests, perform customs, patrol borders, and safeguard major trade lanes.\n6) The really dirty security work falls to professional mercenary groups such as the LSF (who have access to capitol ships). They are the ones that go flying into nebulae to hunt down pirates after some action tees off whatever local gov. there is enough to order a strike.\n7) Liberty and Bretonia are tight-nit.\nKusari likes to be neutral and profit.\n9) Rhineland is more aggressive with its borders and doesn't have mercy for pirates like the Hessians.\n10) Lucrative small scale space faring civilian ventures are smuggling, running supplies to deep space outposts, exploration (chancy like a gold rush), and galactic tours.\n11) Mining is only done by those huge semistation ships. (Large scale = profit)\n12) Capitol ships are larger. Liberty battleship=frigate Gunship=Patrol Boat\n13) Torpedoes, massed assaults, and nukes kill capitol ships. (B5 style)\n14) Most conflicts between nations involve a terraformable planet or two, MOX clouds, mining field rights, and the like.\n15) Kusari speak Japanese, Rhinelanders speak German, Libertarians and Bretonians speak English, and a few border locations have Spanish established.\n\nFor the plot:\n1) There are two protagonists who begin on opposite sides of the law. Shades of gray will bring them closer as far as legality goes. The two will come from the same lower-middle class.\n2) To be clear: They never become buddies, maybe assocciates but rarely would their aims coincide.\n3) One is on the merc and bounty hunting side of the law.\n4) The other is on the freedom fighter/raider side.\n5) Both kick arse but go about it differently.\n6) One is more brutish with properly applied force (not stupid) and the other uses more cunning (both are equally cunning), uses people in a likable way, and strikes sparingly but lethally.\n7) One of the premises is that the readers end up rooting for one or the other and in the end only one wins.\n\nI have weird plot twist for you. Have you ever read book Mutiny on the H.M.S. Bounty? If you havent, it's about a captain [William Bligh. or christian fletcher.\nsome say that Bligh was too harsh a captain, and so chrisian leads a bloody mutiny, dumping Bligh with the loyal crewmembers adrift in the ocean. So the question becomes, was Bligh do harsh? or was christian to rebbelious, sorta makes you wonder. so, what if, in a final battle, [this is only like an expamle!\nthe two characters are locked in a knife cross. then, it ends!!!!! now, i no u probs wont do that, since i hate reading those type of books, its not that close with the Bounty, but just one of those thinkin books. i wil be happy to help u with what i can. of course i can only help so much before my great mind makes it cheating, lol, jk. its just a suggestion, but dont make it nothing but battle scenes and stuff, [well, chances are i shouldnt be talking, lol but make sure to have dialouge, character develpment, and some sort of struggle. i like ur basic idea tho, one prob with it. the thing with writing based from a Video game, is that its a limited audience, uull have to include some history, sorta like why were in sirius, that sorta thing. and most importantly\n\nThis is an english paper/year long asignment that I will be taking to class, have read around, recieve comments and criticism and the whole shabang-a-bang.\nIt's gonna take a long while but I want to write something distincly Freelancer that can be easily read by those who have not played the game.\nI also wish to avoid lots of heavy influences from other scifi sources (i.e. Star Wars, Firefly, Aliens, The Last Legion, Star Trek...).\n\nThe \"!\" thing is fine, the texts all extent PAGES to the right.

Believe in Manifest Destiny, and have economic interests in many parts of Sirius. Liberty is probably one of the more advanced and probably the most powerful force in Sirius. Things like homelsess seem to be against the law. Liberty's government is headed by the President. There's also a senate and judicial branches.\n\nBretonia- Descendants of the sleeper ship \"Bretonia\". Bretonia is a highly industrialzed region (many planets are overpopulated and badly polluted, reminscent of the Industrial Revolution). The economic conditions are good, and even the \"poorest\" are considered middle-class. The government is probably a Constitutional Monarchy. Much of Bretonia's economy is based in a variety of areas, mainly manufacturing and mining.\n\nKusari- Descendants of the sleeper ship \"Kusari\". Kusari is also advanced in their own way, but are not as lucky as the rest of the houses, as many of their colonies are either mainly water or massive gas giants. Kusari's government is somewhat similar to that of a Feudal Era Japan. Kusari makes a living off trade, weapon development, and gas mining.\n\nRheinland- Descendants of the sleeper ship \"Rheinland\". The sector of Rheinland is heavily industrialized, with much of the economy in mining, manufacturing, and weaponry. Most of their operations take place with in the Walker Cloud. Their army is hailed as one of the strongest, but the region has often gone through harsh economic trouble. A long and disaterous 80-year war with the Gas Miners' Guild resulted in a loss for Rheinland, disgracing them badly (The remains of their fleet can still be seen in Sigma-13). There is a thriving Black Market, and a vast underground society. The government has also been unstable. After the most recent war (Rheinland started it as a result of Nomad manipulation), they've lost most of their military strength, leaving only one battleship in their fleet, the Westfalen. The economy is fractured as well, and at one point in their history, they sold the sleeper ship Rheinland to Liberty to help pay debts.\n\nThe Hispania- The lost sleeper ship. When launching from its launch site, it was hit in the engines, leaving it to straggle behind the other four sleeper ships. It arrived much later than the rest, and things got worse when an explosion rocked the ship's engines. The exact cause is unknown- Some blame a Coalition sabateur, others blaming an Alliance member trying to get more land, and some even blaming their own brothers for trying to get more for themselves. Eventually, two groups arised- One group took ships and manage to go to another sector, and landed in Planet Crete in Omicron Gamma, and became the Corsairs. The others piloted the crippled Hispania until it could go no further, and used the escape pods to go the nearby planet, and became the Outcasts.\n\nOutcasts- After landing on Malta in Omicron Alpha, the Outcasts were able to land on what seemed to be a hospitable planet. They later learned that the planet was rich in a plant that produced a drug called Cardamine. They found that they've become addicted to the planet, needing to be in proximity to it to survive (This was found when Outcasts who went scouting shortly died afterward). Cardamine was everywhere- in the air, in the water, and in their food. All Outcasts usually wear breathers to live outside their planet's atmosphere and carry small amounts of Cardamine to satisfy their needs, but they've gained some traits as well, mainly a much longer life cycle, though the birth rate is really low as a result of the genetic manipulation from Cardamine. The Outcasts make their living off smuggling Cardamine, hoping to make a large earning once getting everyone addicted to it. Governed by a council of men known as the Elders.\n\nCorsairs- Landed on the dry and arid planet of Crete, and resorted to cannibalism to survive the first few years. Overtime, the population became stable, but life was still hard. One day, the Corsairs were able to capture the Rheinland science ship, the Schiller. Eventually, once the gained space travel, they resorted to piracy to get the things they needed- Food, water, technologies, and other things. Piracy was the only way they could survive. As another method of population control, Corsairs are required to go into the radioactive nebula north of the planet and retreive an artifact from the burial site unshielded, and dodging the mysterious presence there. Corsairs also make a trade off the Artifact trade, as their regions are littered with them. Corsairs, like the Outcasts, are very skilled pilots and fighters. They are ruled over by a council of Elders."

Chances are, you're going to be targeted as soon as you tractor someone, so they can get away. If they have Subspace Jumper, and an Escort, you'll be in their forward firing arc immediately.\n\nRegarding TBs TB3 is 17 sec duration. TB cooldown starts after TB initiated. Meaning 3 seconds before you can apply a 2nd TB. So, yes you can be effective w/TBs. I'd throw a PSW in there to serve as an interrupt.\n\nAlso, I had a torp/tbr build awhile back for the B'rel which I made an effort to never decloak. I was exposed when tbr was active or a fire a torp, but still had cloak defense and movement and damage bonuses. You could try something similar since now you can stack PH and HE etc. You wouldn't need shield buffs either freeing up some Boff slots.\n\nI am also putting together a tractor BOP. In PVE it works wonders, my team loves me every time. I have not been able to try it in PVP yet though, still a level or two to go. Anyways, it will probably be great against cruisers and sci ships, but escorts will just omega pattern out of your firing arc. So what I do is try to make it that much better against cruisers.\n\nIf your toon is a sci, max out sensors too, put a bunch of consoles into sensors so that you can put a huge dent in their damage resistance. Use disrupters to attack that goal as well, since the goal is to do a bunch of damage in a small space of time, disrupters are great anyways because you should be attempting to not let tac team or emergency power to shields/reverse shield polarity stop you from putting them into hull healing emergency mode."

Its not fair to those who have purchased it only for the product to degrade over time.\n\nAnd as I suggested before, perhaps a more up to date version of the interior would also be nice to offer in the C-store. Perhaps a redress of the TOS Connie into the movie Connie, exactly same layout and all but with more up to date hallways, panels, consoles and furniture...\n\nIt's not going to happen. They won't release anything like a fix because they're too busy putting more garbage on the store.\n\nThe TOS interior is probably the best one of all of them, and it's a mess. I called them on these things when they released the thing:\n\nThe main bridge is lop-sided. Check the consoles to port, then to starboard. You'll notice they're at different heights.\n\nThe ceiling is wrong. The Helm is HUGE and too high. Watch Balance of Terror. You'll see Kirk walk past in front of it, and it's about waist high. Here, it's head high.\n\nOf course, I mentioned the BO assignments. My Doctor is always at the science station, engineer at the helm and my tactical officer is often not there at all.\n\nThe turbolift usually sends visitors plummeting through space instead of taking them to other decks.\n\nThe Crew deck is very nice, except for the TNG tricorders constantly squealing everywhere you go.\n\nThe lounge is now inhabited by crew from the wrong century, as you mentioned, as is the Conference Room.\n\nThe corridor should extend past sick bay, with a door into the lab at the far end (presently, you have to pass through sick bay to get to the lab).\n\nThe tables in Sick Bay are the wrong height. When seated, they are about head high.\n\nEngineering Deck is also nice enough, but again there's the constant squealing of TNG tricorders.\n\nMost damningly, there is a TNG engineer with a TNG tricorder IN engineering that never, ever turns it off or stops using it. It RUINS this room entirely.\n\nThe Engineering room is not the correct room. Ok, it's the first season engineering room. The more familiar one is the one from the Ultimate Computer, with the engineering office, and the dilithium chamber in the middle of the room.\n\nThe Engineering Lab is nice, except for the tricorders (again) and the TNG crew.\n\nThe Transporter room is the wrong shape, and does not have the monitor station behind and to the left of the console.\n\nAdditionally, the transporter platform is rotated too far clockwise, so you can't actually see all the pads from the console.\n\nThe back wall of the room is empty, when there should be a design there (not sure if it's a window or what).\n\nThat's just off the top of my head. It's things like this that make me question the competence of the developers. This is not rocket science. All the information you could possibly want is readily available anywhere on the internet. You can download BLUEPRINTS for heaven's sake. That they couldn't get something like this right suggests they don't care, or they're incompetent. I'm not sure which is worse.\n\nOnce, I was simply called Mojo. Now, I'm forced into a new name, but don't be fooled, I'm the original STO Mojo!\n\nI've been wanting those changes for ages, always bugged me that my engineer was on the conn where my tactical guy should be! Instead of having a Yeoman Console why not have a static Yeoman NPC contact, tall thin blonde like from the shows?\n\nIs there anything that determines BOFF seating? I have two commander sci boffs but ones a medical and the other science... my sci boff is sitting down on a chair the other side of the bridge and the CMO is looking down the sensor scanner.... :/"

      "text": "start by saying I'm not entirely sure what the alternative is, just to get it out of the way. I also apologize for the length of the thread and if you rather skip to the end and mock my insanity feel free.\n\nBut one thing that has bugged me since the release of the game is that the BOFF science abilities are largely either foreign to Star Trek lore or abilities that should belong to other department.\n\nWhat I mean by this is abilities, that to the best of my knowledge are not actually apart of any of the Star Trek television series or movie. To my eye 10 Science BOFF abilities are simply taking creative license they are as follows:\n\nPolarize Hull: This was an ability used before the advent of deflector shields, during the era of Enterprise and the NX class.\n\nTransfer Shield Strength: This should really just be emergency power to shields and is an engineering ability. Additionally it adds a damage resistance which isn't to cannon.\n\nCharged Particle Burst: Disables cloaking device, which I don't recall being done. Something like a tachyon detection grid, which I believe is a console ability already exists for making cloak detection easier, but again don't recall an ability to disable a cloaking device.\n\nEnergy Siphon: Sending out a probe to drain an enemies power levels. I seem to recall an episode of TNG using a feedback pulse for this reason but not sending out a probe.\n\nPhotonic Officer: To me is an ability separate from having an actual photonic officer like the Doctor from Voyager and since there were never real cool downs wouldn't be a needed ability. I suppose as a way to add some realism, you could change the name of the ability to mention 'bio-neural gel packs' which featured on Voyager as a way to speed up operations or cool downs in game terms.\n\nScramble Sensors: Again I never recall there being a probe capable of causing an enemy to fire on one of it's allies. Jam Sensors seems familiar as a way to confuse the enemy from attacking the player.\n\nTyken's Rift: Featured in an episode of TNG, but it was a natural phenomenon not one created by a ship.\n\nGravity Well:Like the Tyken's Rift is a naturally occurring phenomenon and not something a ship could generate on it's own. There is a singular mention of an artificial gravity well, being located in the engine core of a Romulan Warbird, but not something projected into space.\n\nPhotonic Shockwave: This can be done by detonating a photon torpedo with an energy beam. This could be visually represented rather than what is currently done, which is just a blast projecting from the ship, and could potentially have a more tactical advantage. But it seems it would also be more of a tactical ability.\n\nViral Matrix: Again this is not an ability, launching a probe to shut down an enemies systems, that I recall being used. The probe from ST IV 'The Voyage Home' shut down power systems and you could potentially use that as the basis for this ability, if it were explained.\n\nThere are one or two engineering and tactical abilities that seem out of place but for the most part those skills are true to Star Trek cannon. Again I don't see a easy resolution to this. Most of what were science abilities were in the range of scanning the area for enemies, communications, programming probes for various uses. The role for science officer was more in gathering information, analyzing and interpreting that information for the captain. I think you'd have to try and play up the advanced technologies aspect of a science vessel and figure out a way to create abilities that play up that advantage.\n\nThe science officer would have far more practical and useful benefits in a actual star ship than they do during the heat of the battle. I also understand needing to have a healer/wizard option as a standard for MMOs but it seems to be the least Trekie option in this game when really it should probably be the most featured along with engineering.\n\nI don't know anyone else's thoughts on that, my main character is science which is why I was thinking about it. I suppose my gripe really is that the abilities given to science officers are generally not based in the Star Trek lore, or would be the responsibility of another department. It feels like science is included just because there needed to be a third option, which is odd given that probably the second most known Star Trek character, Spock is a Science officer.\n\nAgain I don't really have a solution, just griping mostly. Thoughts? What kinds of science abilities, based in Star Trek lore would you want to be included and how might they be incorporated within the game in a balanced way?\n\nCharged Particle Burst could be explained as releasing a bunch of charged particles in all directions, and if those particles were to hit an object (such as a cloaked ship) the ship that launched and tracked the particles would detect the collision and therefore know an object was located at that point.\n\nWe also have a sort of canon example of Gravity Well in the form of Spock's Red Matter probe, used to deal with a supernova.\n\nFor Scramble Sensors, since ships rarely if ever have an actual visual mode of detection (the viewscreens were still based on scanners), they must rely on IFF transponders and scan images of ships. If someone managed to confuse those transponders and scanners, it could result in targets \"switching sides.\" I realize this is a weak defense for the ability, it's the only thing that really comes to mind.\n\nI haven't looked closely at Energy Siphon's visuals for a while, but I thought it was a beam fired from the deflector, not a probe?\n\nFrom Memory Alpha regarding Hull Polarization: \"In the 24th century, starships still occasionally polarized their hull plating, though not typically as a defensive countermeasure. One example was disrupting an enemy's tractor beam by rotating the frequency of the hull plating's electromagnetic field. Ships also sometimes polarized their hull plating to help mask their sensory signature, which worked by interfering with the enemy's sensors. (DS9: \"In Purgatory's Shadow\"; VOY: \"Equinox, Part II\")\"\n\nFor Viral Matrix, transmitting a virus to another ship in order to mess with their computer systems seems like a pretty good plan, given that they rely entirely on those systems for pretty much everything. It's not so much the basic concept as a delivery method and reuse. How would you get something to the ship to deliver the virus? Direct transmissions wouldn't likely work, I'm sure that form of electronic warfare would have been dealt with very early with this sort of technology level. And you can't usually use the same virus twice, same as in current day computers, since anti-virus software gets updated to deal with new threats all the time. Again, from Memory Alpha: \"In 2154, the warp matrix of the Enterprise was compromised by a subroutine planted by a group of Klingon Augments. The subroutine also compromised the starship's command protocols. (ENT: \"Affliction\", \"Divergence\")\n\nPrior to his open defection to the Maquis in 2372, Michael Eddington planted cascade viruses in Deep Space 9 and the USS Defiant's computers. This allowed him to disable the Defiant at a critical time. Fortunately, Odo was able to find and delete the one in the station's computers before it could be activated. (DS9: \"For the Uniform\")\"\n\nAs for the others, no quick defense comes to mind, but we already know STO had to play loose with canon for the sake of gameplay, and if science was left with only the above then they wouldn't have enough abilities to go around. Tyken's Rift, at least, comes from canon as a natural occurance, and could be explained away by the advancement of technology leading up to STO.\n\nInteresting points, but I think the link between the game and TV/movie is intermittently strong and weak at the same time.\n\nSome abilities listed may never have been seen or done on the show ... but for game purposes were incorporated by order of what career seems most appropiate. Launching probes seems like a \"science\" thing versus a combat (re: tactical) role. Creating rifts, gavity wells, or phonotic doohickey likewise would require a level of technical expertise not congruent to \"engineers\", per se."

This will allow a player to co-ordinate a squad's firepower and power usage on them more effectively, as well as leaving them defenseless while they wait for the slight delay in their weapons fire rate.\n\nA player equipped with weapons that keep up a constant stream of fire will easily suppress and damage Bataraian Commanders.\n\nOn harder difficulty levels they can cause very high amounts of damage; making suppressing them an unrealistic option, particularly if they are being supported by other troops. In this scenario, picking off the weaker opponents while utilizing powers on the Commanders is an effective strategy.\n\nIn close quarters combat they are capable of causing higher amounts of damage which can be problematic if they still have shields.

      "text": "TEC is overpowered\n\ncseavoy1\n\nGetting sick of playing against TEC. Spamming novalith cannon so I have to build starbases in every system, then coming in with a few cheap ogrov cruisers to destroy a fully upgraded starbase in 30 seconds. I can't even get a fleet from a neighboring system to make one jump before the starbase is trash. Seems all the fun and strategy from entrenchment is gone now. It should be about fleets with complements of different supporting ships battling it out, not superweapons double-shotting my capitol so no amount of upgrades can save it. Not one cheap type of ship for one faction being able to take out the most powerful starbases in the game by sitting out of range and hurling dozens of missiles. Either make them fire slower, or decrease their range to give the base a fighting chance. The only defense is fleets or squadrons, but it takes a ton of squadrons to take them out fast enough. No other faction has such a great anti starbase weapon. I'm not usually one for nerfs, but all AI settings being equal, Vasaari and Advent are cake compared to TEC. The playstyle in rebellion just isn;t as fun, as much as I like titans, the AIs use of the novalith and the overwhelming attack of the ogrov make the playstyle less strategic and fun, and more tedious and frustrating.\n\nWell yes, if you are turtling against the AI, the TEC is the hardest faction to play against. Try expanding faster and being more aggressive, if the AI brings out Novaliths on anything less than unfair you probably had plenty of opportunity to get into a game winning positionWasn't really trying to troll, just frustrated. I had a fully equipped advent starbase, full armor/shield upgrade, 5 fighters/5 bombers, 1 meteor control, etc. Had 2 repair bays by it, 1 hangar for an extra 2 bombers, 1 fighter. My fleet left the system, was not gone 5 minutes before 10 ogrovs showed up. Managed to take out 3 of them before the starbase was destroyed. They had accompanying flak frigates. My fleet was one jump away and could not make it in time. This type of situation happens often, the ogrovs just do too much damage too quickly from too far away. They're cheap enough that they're basically disposable, so even if you get your revenge on them, its not much of a consolation.\n\nWhen the TEC is on the other side of a huge 98 planet system and there are other factions in between, I can't take them out quick. At least if I play vasaari, I can use kostura cannon to open a phase lane and take out the novalith, but they just rebuild them quick. I have to spend so many resources putting in a starbase in every system with planet control that its hard to raise a big fleet to travel across the system. The fact that they build 4 and constantly snipe your planets every few minutes just makes the game less fun. I don't turtle, I'm always a rapid expansionist who fortifies chokepoints, but chokepoints don't matter against the novalith, and fortifications matter little against the ogrovs. Doesn't matter if I can beat their fleet in a fight, I hardly ever see any large fleet from them anymore. Just saying, with novaliths, increase the cooldown time so they're only used for more special occasions, not as a primary strategy. With ogrovs, either decrease rate of fire or damage, or decrease their range. That would make the game a bit more fun.\n\nOh look another one of these threads. Will people PLEASE stop calling things that are not overpowered overpowered and asking for nerfs? At this rate people'll be frustrated that they can't conquer an entire AI empire with one frigate by release...\n\nQuoting Mecha-Lenin, reply 11Im Advent and as far as i know (kinda new to the game) i cant do shit to defend against it or return the favor.\n\nGet the enduring devotion (or equivalent) upgrade on your starbase. It prevents the planet from being lost from bombardment, which basically means everything but culture overthrows and the level 6 Coronata titan ability. When you get the warning that a TEC player is building a super weapon stop what you're doing and build a few starbase constructors for your main worlds, typically terrans, deserts and maybe ice. Asteroids and dwarf planets can be easily recolonized, give most of their income as resources which the novalith doesn't stop, and don't have many other upgrades to lose. Only shield them if you can afford it.\n\nUsually the AI isn't smart enough to realize your most important planets are protected so it will waste many shots trying to get them so you're lower tier planets are probably fine. They also tend to waste a few shots on the pirate base that can give you more time. If you've been doing well up to that point and have at least your share of the map plus a little more colonized I've found I can usually counter novaliths in time. But if you expanded slowly by turtling or for whatever reason, yeah it can be hard to have a large enough economy to absorb the blows. But in that case you'd probably have a hard time winning anyways, and would only do so by the incompetence of the AI in other respects.\n\nAnd yes, the Advent super weapon kind of sucks. It spreads your culture and gives all your ships in the planet it hits a damage bonus, so its great as a fleet support weapon (especially against Vasari or for the Advent loyalists), but by itself it rarely does much besides lowering enemy allegiance a little bit.I think a better thread title would have been \"TEC is BORING\"...one of the biggest issues with sins since its exception is the lack of variety...you have the classic LRF/Bomber spam, the carrier cap spam, the kostura/novalith spam...some things are \"balanced\" in that they can be countered or compare to other factions' equivalents but they aren't exactly interesting...\n\nThere's also a whole host of abilities, techs, upgrades, and the like which are just generally useless or not economic...\n\nSo in short, I'd say that the issue you bring up is to some degree an issue...the issue is just variety, not balance...The problem is his expansion rate and taking control of choke points while scouting things he can't see. I always send 1 scout to flanks with first level lingering presence . Then again thats just me.. I'm always aware what my cousin is doing on the front-lines.\n\nAlso use Shield Bowel on the hanger defense to shield your star-base and structures and have 1 frigate factory to build guardians to repulse orgovs because otherwise i think your just trolling mate"

      "text": "Hrmm.. I think the second one - or was it the 3rd(?)- was around 2000 or so?\n\nIt's kinda like an FPS.. kinda. I suppose it'd be closer to how World of Tanks is, actually. I suppose WOT may have taken some of it's inspiration from the old MWs.\n\nIt was really cool that you could mix & match the outfitting on your mechs, even though some pieces were imbalanced such as the biggest Autocannon also having the capability to knock an enemy's mech down if they were hit (despite a low rate of fire and lower ammo amount). You could also have jump jets on the (mostly) smaller ones which is a pretty cool way of giving them extra agility. The whole setting for Battletech is pretty cool what with the endless galactic wars and all the interesting sci-fi hardware (and the methods of travel and delivery I found particularly interesting, obviously taking some cues from Heinlen's Starship Troopers).\n\nI never played the last one, even though I had eyed it for some time. I heard that they trimmed back the customization or something, so was fenced until I forgot about it. Good thing there's a freebie version now, even though I was never able to get the download/installer mess to begin when I've tried.\n\nFirst of all MECHWARRIOR is BATTLETECH the minatures in a computer game, the minatures game has been around since the early 80s if not earlier. They are one and the same if you have ever seen battletech being played at the local games shop. So it has a huge amount of background lore and generally follows the same rules of the board game allowing you to customise weapons and heat sinks, armour etc on a chassis to make a mech. This equals massive customisation possabilities and massive balance due to weight and heat dissipation balance.\n\nI would characterize mechwarrior as a simulator because you are sitting in a cockpit in first person and the whole keyboard is mapped to all manner of complexity. It may not be as complex as a full realism flight simulator. But it has enough complexity to turn some casual players off. If you played Xwing or Tie Fighter that is about the complexity of a mechwarriors cockpit in mechwarrior games I have played.\n\nA mech is basically war machine with advantages over a tank. It is the ultimate heavy armoured mobile tank brigade of the future.\n\nMech's of 100 tonnes are classed as heavy. Twice the weight of a modern tank and still mobile as they do not need bridges and can spread weight a lot better over feet while keeping up speeds of up to 100km p/h or more.\n\nAllegedly (because is sci-fi) they have worked their way around smashing the pilot to bits with the shock from the mech walking by inventing some sort of cushon system that absorbs all of the shock.\n\nIn addition to this a mech carries a lot more weaponry and can go a lot more places than a tank could go and absorbs a lot more punishment. Perfect for rushing around doing all kinds of missions.\n\nOne obvious disadvantage is a Mechs high profile. However Mechs can kneel and lay down depending on the model.\n\nUnlike Japanese Mecha (giant robots) these mechwarrior mechs are not acrobatic and cannot do extreme manoevers. Compared to japanese mechs european mechwarriors move like dinosoars rather than monkeys. Mechwarrior mechs however move like balerinas compared to tanks.\n\nThe pilots or mechwarriors are an elite of society, however there are also many mercenary and planetary militias.\n\nMercenary groups often get the raw end of political deals of course or can get rich and powerfull fueled by war between waring factions.\n\nMechwarrior factories are rare as the tech is lost. Mechs are therefore valuable assets. Dropships will transport them to planets and they can drop in to take control without requiring the access a tank would need to good terrain.\n\nThere is a good deal of myth and lore I could tell you about like comstar, mechwarrior protectors of the interplanetary communications arrays and their best kit and the clans, returning warriors from a long ago exodus of the original mechwarrior creators tribes. They still have all of the lost tech and more making their mechs seem super compared to the tech they left behind tech, they have decided they want to take their old empires back.\n\nP.S. I played ultrabots as well back in the day. It is like a very light version of mechwarrior with less character.\n\nThis intro was sweeter than chocolate when I first saw it played an intro to mechwarrior2. Now it looks very dated.\n\nA somewhat newer mechwarrior game. I wish they would just make a 2hr version of this movie!\n\nI am a great fan of the Battletech miniature wargame. I have lots of books and quite a collection of mini's, but I don't really feel excited about the MWO game.\n\nI did enjoy the other MW games, though, but this one, without any narrative, just feels like a shallow iteration of the battletech universe and pretty much Doom or Unreal with Mechs.\n\nYou touched upon the huge lore and background for the universe. That is exactly what has kept me interested for such a long time. Novels, tech documents and what have you. They all make the world so much more believable.\n\nMWO does not really tap into that huge universe very well so far.\n\nI feel MWO is catered toward the younger FPS crowd (dont get me wrong; younger and FPS crowd no not neccessarily go hand in hand all the time), perhaps to get more people familiar with the BT universe.\n\nEventhough Catalyst officially supports the title, for me it needs to become much more than just an arena style Mech vs Mech game to get me interested.\n\nThat said, if they do get around to the persistent world features they promised are in the works for post-release, I might be more interested.\n\nI hope they let everyone choose a side, in any 3025 territory cap campaign they add. Just like the old (dead) 3025 online.\n\nIIRC I was playing Steiner at the time. Tons of fun, the fighting between factions. It was surprisingly fairly balanced in the beta, aside from the expected higher population for Davion. But Davion always seemed to get more attention from the lore in the first place so it was no surprise and they really didn't make much extra progress in world-capping anyway, considering their population advantage.\n\nNow I'm gettin' misty thinking about it. Hoping they follow through on a world-capping campaign mapIf you build an idiot-proof computer, someone will make a better idiot.\n\nTrue, although MechCommander wasn't very much Battletech-like in terms of gameplay / rules. It was just an RTS game with Mechs IMHO. A fun one, don't get me wrong, but nowhere near an incarnation of a digital BT.\n\nThe only digital version of Battletech at this time is MegaMek. It follows and enforces the rules pretty well, but the AI is laughable (although being improved upon). Now this wasn't developped as a solitaire app, but a multiplayer one so its only commendable that they are in fact working on an AI at all hadn't heard of that. It sounds much more like something I would enjoy than MWO. Lore/story/atmosphere is what I'm looking for.\n\nIt seems (from the screenies only) though that there is no 'heat' system in the game. A pretty significant gameplay aspect of the BT game. But that's just from scouring the screenshots, which are few and far apart by all means. So I could be very well completely wrong.\n\nStill it does seem like a very enjoyable game. Certainly something to keep an eye on!\n\nThere will be an AI, they said you'll generally play your first few battles against it most likely, and I suppose it'll be there for roflstomping later, but (don't quote me on this) I think the rewards are reduced for AI battles.\n\nThe card aspect is something like Magic (Never actually played it, just going by reputation). You get a free starter set and then you can either play and earn money to pay for the varying levels of new sets, or you can pay actual cash to buy them. Nobody is too sure exactly what the cards will consist of yet. I think base chassis, weapons, tech items, maybe pilot abilities or tactics or something. They do the same rare/exceptional/common tiering that all of those types of games do.\n\nYou play online, and can have as many games going as you have lances for. That leads to the only bad thing I've heard so far, and that's that it's limited to lance on lance currently, but they do plan to expand that at some point...the ever elusive \"After launch\".\n\nBut, the single BEST thing, is that you're starting in the 3025 era. Back when tech was balanced and the clans were still over 2 decades away.\n\nWhich seems to be just as it sounds, a Solaris simulator where you can pop in to watch other people battle, or fight yourself. Honestly, though, I haven't seen anything in the way of updating or news anywhere on this one, so I'm not holding my breath. Both are from MekTek though, so I'm not giving up hope."

It's not very well known and it's a bit soft-SF but it has some of the best and most realistic descriptions of space tactics I know of e.g.\n\nWhat kind of evasive manoeuvres ships should do to avoid getting hit whilst staying close enough to offer each other covering fire but not too close so as to take each other out if they are hit (as they use antimatter for propulsion ships go out with a bang when critically struck)\n\nHow to fight over light hours of space\n\nHow to use gravity wells and planets to your advantage\n\nTechniques for managing the crew under high-g\n\nOn top of that there it covers how to lead a resistance in a very centralised (all comms monitored, everyone on a biometric database) and totalitarian regime.\n\nEDIT: Now that I think of it DEF does have a somewhat convincing use for a fighter-type craft. Basically when they are fighting over long distances (light minutes-hours) they send out small one man ships called pinnaces along with a swarm of missiles. The job of the pinnace pilot is to give last minute tactical orders to the missiles depending on the situation at the time.That's a meaningless question unless you provide a detailed description of the characteristics and capabilities of the proposed AI.\n\na good way to force action sequences or whatever is to make up magical- er I mean fictional chemicals or elements that have some oddly specific behaviors. For example, in the anime series Legend of the Galactic Heroes, there was some funky gas stuff that exploded very violently if lasers or guns were shot through it. Sort of like the laser vs. shields thing in the Dune universe. This forced armies to duke it out in fancy armor, crossbows and giant battleaxes. The rest of the show was about giant space battles where the ships lined up like 18th century European line infantry and space politics.\n\nBut they got to add in some really cool face to face melee combat scenes because of some magical gas that they made up.\n\na good way to force action sequences or whatever is to make up magical- er I mean fictional chemicals or elements that have some oddly specific behaviors.\n\nThat's the cool thing about speculative fiction. You propose some sort of technobabble and explore the societal and practical ramifications. For instance, if this gas explodes violently then can it not also be harvested as a powerful fuel? Simply store it in gas canisters and spray little bits at a time into a laser lit engine. Or store it at very high concentration and then light a laser inside the canister as a bomb.\n\nYes I watched Legend of Galactic Heroes, i dont know if they used the Zephyr (I think) for propulsion purposes as well.\n(Otherwise I disliked that series, Yang always knew what the enemy is planning, they launch a small attack, Send there our whole navy! Yeah why not, next time, they launch a very big attack, and of course it is only a decoy...)\n\nBasically, in deep space, where arent civilans and neutral parties, AIs cant do much wrong...\nIn case of orbital patrol, human decision is needed, and i doubt that remote control is always enough, there can be spys for example, that can hack the system to create an international scandal or something like that.\nAlso you have more options to rescue pilots.\n\nI had the idea, that aliens can deploy self-replicating nanobots to Earth, to infect computers, turn our own robots and infrastructure against us...\nThey want everything to be ready, by the time they arrive.\n\nHowever, if their plan A fails, they can launch a relativistic torpedo against Earth...\nHowever, if their plan A fails, they can launch a relativistic torpedo against Earth...Without magic technobabble like a forcefield not really. The most you could do is fill your system with highly sophisticated gravity sensors to sense the RKV as it comes. You might not have much time at all because if it is travelling at 0.9c (which btw is roughly the velocity an object needs to reach for its kinetic energy to reach half its rest mass) and you detect it at one light day out this means it is only two light hours away. If you do have time you could try to divert its path with powerful lasers or try to through mass in the way to deflect it but I doubt you could really do any of that.\n\nCharles Stross dealt with this issue in his novel Iron Sunrise. In it various factions have STL-deterrents hidden in their Oort cloud operating under a dead-man switch. If they don't receive a signal every X hours they launch towards a target planet (trying to find a tiny ship, possibly stealthed from across a system would be next to impossible). This largely stopped factions invading each other for fear of severe retaliation years later.\n\nIf a RKV hits a one kilogram mass before the planet, what would happen to it?\nThe energy of the collision could turn it into a dissolving plasma cloud or dont?\n\nAt around 0.87c the kinetic energy of an object exceeds half it's rest mass. So a one kilogram RKV travelling at 0.87c relative to the planet will have the kinetic energy of e=0.5*c2 = 4.5 petajoules = ~10 megatonnes of TNT (~600 Hiroshima bombs). At that speed it would get through the atmosphere in less than a millisecond and cause massive devastation to the area it hit (akin to a nuclear explosion plus an earthquake). Some quick googling tells me that the meteorite that killed the dinosaurs released ~0.5 Yottajoules of energy which would be the equivalent of a 5 kilotonne RKV travelling at 0.87 which works out to be roughly the mass of 50m x 10m x 10m of ice.\n\nThis is something that a lot of SF authors forget in their haste to write about relativistic ships the size of super-carriers and cities. The very ships you have littered in your setting as though they were sprinkles on a cake could all be converted to weapons thousands of times more powerful than the meteorite that caused the K-T mass extinction! (this is also known as Jon's law or the Kzinti lesson)\n\nI can see, but if you try to put a brick in the way of the RKV well before it hits the planet?\nWould that mean, that only the brick disintegrates in the collision, or the RKV also?\n\nWhatever you put in front of an object travelling that fast would just be disintegrated, like a wet tissue paper thrown in front of an artillery shell. It may slow the RKV down a negligible amount but what you really hope or is to divert its course ever so slightly so that it misses its target. More likely though is that it may cause the RKV to break up but even if it did it wouldn't change the amount of energy that is about to hit: whether it hits the planet in 1 piece or 1 million pieces the same horrendous amount of energy is about to be released.\n\nmy problem with relativistic weapons is how the heck do you aim them properlythis may be a misunderstanding on my part, but wouldn't it take a looot of energy to change the course of something moving extremely fast?"

      "text": "Did Guilliman force his brothers to adopt the Codex? And did he write it alone?\n\nThe fact that the Chapters are supposed to be independent makes it a bit hard for me to follow. You have a guide on how to run a chapter (written by a Primarch no less), but no practical means of enforcement. It's just up to each Chapter how seriously they want to take it. What was the point then, other than to annoy Dorn?\n\nYou have to consider at what time and in what circumstances it was written.\n\nIt was right after the Horus Heresy, after the Space Marine Legions had been traumatized and dishonoured by half of them turning against them. After such an event, they had to be dealing with doubts and despair; preventing a repetition of such an event had to be pretty much the highest priority point on their agenda. The Codex was, to a large part, written to redesign the Legions into something where the Heresy couldn't repeat itself. Hence Guilliman didn't have to force them into compliance - for the most part, in their shame and desperation, they accepted the Codex quite willingly - partially, probably, as a sort of penance for having allowed the Heresy to occur. And by the time that state was over, the Codex had already ingrained itself into the Space Marine identity.\n\nOr that's my interpretation of all of that, anyway.\n\nQuestion of my own. I recently started reading Fulgrim for another time, and while doing so noticed that, on the cover, there is a depiction of a Dreadnought. I also recall that there was at least one Dreadnought featured towards the end of Galaxy in Flames.\n\nNow, this seriously irritates me, because I'd have thought Dreadnoughts were something that came up only after the Heresy. Every codex containing Dreadnoughts keeps emphasizing how Space Marines are pretty much only interred in Dreadnoughts under the most dire circumstances, so there appears to be a serious reluctance to subject warriors to this fate. It makes sense though - after all, ever since the Heresy, Space Marines are in rather short supply for all the chapters, so preserving them in this fashion may, at times, just be necessary. The Legions though, before the Heresy and the civil war it entailed? They didn't have such a massive shortage on men - why would they have to make use of such an option?\n\n(Also, if Dreadnoughts were always used, how come none of the Dreadnoughts from before the Heresy have survived? Bjorn the Fell-Handed is explicitly stated to be the oldest one of them all, and he didn't become a Dreadnought until long after the Heresy - one would think that if Dreadnoughts were actually commonly used even back then, at least some would have survived by sheer coincidence.)"

      "text": "Basically, FRD (Free-Roaming Defender) has recently been changed, causing it to act differently than it has for most of AI War's existence. FRD used to be a cross-planet command that you could use, which would cause your units to travel from planet to planet, destroying every enemy unit in their path, before moving on.\n\nFRD has recently changed to never activate until the units given the order reach their final destination planet. This means that they will ignore enemy units on their path between systems. One major unfortunate drawback about this new behavior is that a player can no longer make automated cross-planet patrols with Redirector Posts.\n\nFor me at least, this was a wonderful feature, and was a huge part of how I played the game. I certainly like the way the new FRD works, but in some cases the old FRD is really important as well.\n\nI suggest we implement both FRD modes back into the game, and assign them to different hotkeys:\n1.Cross-Planet FRD (like the old one) that would force your units to destroy all the units on each planet before moving on.\n2.Local/Focused FRD (like the current one) that only \"activates\" once the units reach their destination.\n\nI would also really appreciate if the \"colored outline\" of the ships were different for each command, so the player(s) could tell the difference."

      "text": "reminds me of a post I once read on these forums that STO felt more like going to a Star Trek convention than being in the Star Trek world. I have to agree with that sentiment.\n\nThat's just the perfect way of describing it And that's what get's me so angry about it as well *sigh*Yes it takes away a lot of \"seriousness\" and immersion, which is very sad when you think about the potential this game has.\nJust as every \"funny\" ship name or character name. Thats why i thought that an Star Trek MMO just doesn't work, since i first heard of STO in 2009 or '08.\nI seriously hope that STO will never become canon. Just go to ESD and STO feels like a Star Trek theme park.\nOn the other hand, when i look at most of cryptics designs i always think that some of their designer may have thought that STO is set in some kind of mirror universe.\nI just hate those plastic uniforms and even more those combat armors/kits. (not to mention almost all of cryptics ship designs, but thats another topic.)\n\nIn my opinion the designers of STO did a completely wrong approach when designing things for this game. Instead of just making what they think of what is \"cool\", they should have tried to continue the TV series and Movies desings/stories more serious.\n\nThe \"danger\" i see in a Star Trek MMO is that many things this game introduces or misinterprets are going to be adopted by many players and official canon. (a Galaxy Class without any significant firepower for example, or this rediculus stone/paper/scissor ship balance system.)\n\nI'm with you right there, STO actually feels more like \"mirror universe online\" with all those fancy weapons and warships, battlecarriers and so on whereas the bulk of the iconic ships are toned down and are really not up to what they should.\n\nLike I posted in a different thread, STO should have taken the risk and set the game in the 25th century, period. Nothing from the other periods except ships and equipment which makes sense to still show up and then tell a unique story, continue Star trek instead of just bing that huge \"fanwankery\" it is. Then it wouldn't all be about what costume to sell nextI never got why they had to add armor/Kit visuals at all....\nHolographic or energy fields on weapons (phaser wheapons) and Kits... and why do Compression phaser pistols have to look completely different to stun and wide beam pistols (the cobra phasers)?\n\nSometimes i have to think they never actually have seen a Star Trek episode.\n\nIt's small things like that, that make me really angry about cryptic designers, they seem just not to care about Trek. They should have made their own Sci Fi universe instead, if they hate Star Trek so much.First:\nMy question was, how did the devs come up with the idea to create combat armor and those kits in the first place. I have never ever seen in any episode or movie anything like it and they do surely not look like they belong to previous design lines or fit to other Starfleet equipment. (especially some high tier Kits don't look like starfleet equipment at all.)\n\nSecond:\nIf the devs seem to absolutely need to implement something like this, why can't we deactivate them at all, client wise?\n(not just ours, but all of them)\n\nThird:\nAsking a question doesn't imply that i begrudge anyone about anything, i was just curious, if that is still allowed.\nI surely do not want to begrudge other peoples \"fun\".\nAbout \"fun\", what about my \"fun\"? Why do i have to see those hideous combat armors and kits which do apparently have nothing to do with star trek design at all?\nI do not want to argue with anyone about that, i just want to say that the designers did care very little (or not at all) about previous trek design."

      "text": "Vulnerable:breakdown implies more 'unreliable' than 'high maintenance' to me, but I'm happy enough to go with it - they're using cutting edge tech, which still has little 'niggles' in it. Works for me.\n\nTalking of duties, there seem to be two kinds. Let's call them 'home' and 'away'. For the purposes of the campaign, 'home' is the ship, while 'away' is 'while the force is warring on the ground'. For example, law enforcement and border patrols only make sense at home. Raiding and scouting only make sense when away.\n\nGiven that duties come about during downtime, how likely is it that 'away' duties will come up? And the rules suggest you need to pick 3 and stick to them. Wouldn't it make more sense to freely choose dependant on circumstances, so you aren't stuck attempting to enforce law on a jungle populated solely with orks.\n\nI'm fine with continuing the discussion on Battle Commander. I do appreciate my version is fairly minimalist.\n\nFinally, why would you ever choose a bolt pistol over a plasma pistol? My experience as a gunlugger tells me that AP is *hugely* powerful. I feel the plasma pistol should have something like 'cooldown' (reload), or 'overheats' (1 harm AP on miss when using it) to make a boltpistol usefulSure. The disadvantage I was suggesting was more along the lines of 'pricey', where it cost 2-hold from duty to replace lost people/materiel rather than 1, since they're difficult to replace, but I'm happy enough with breakdown.\n\nAs for choices, well, I think ideas might change as we bounce ideas off each other. But my thoughts for now:\n\nGender: Male (I picture him as looking similar to Admiral Adama from (new) Battlestar Galactica) Name: Silon Venris (Oh come on, after deciding they looked like Adama, on seeing the name 'Silon', how could I not?) Scarred body, tired face (yes, I swapped the adjectives around. Okay?), judging eyes, worn uniform.\n\nCool+1, hard-1, sharp+1, status+2, twisted -1\n\nBasically, I'm picturing someone who was once the terror of the battlefield, and now age, arthritis, old wounds and other sundry medical problems have worn them down, so they are held together with medicines, willpower and force of habit.\n\nCommand Now, as you've probably guessed, I've spent quite a lot of time thinking about this, but I have finally decided: I am chief of security. The ship is about more than just ferrying my personal army from war to war. Therefore, a small, elite force makes a lot more sense than a massive army. But, I have a question: does power armour inhibit stealth, or is the increased bulk and weight offset by inbuilt stealth technology?\n\nOkay, so this is all open to change. Particularly, SoylentWhite's post came up as I was finishing this - I was expecting a bigger military force aboard when I picked Military Power as something the ship traded in. But there's no reason we can't trade in force despite the small army! Assault troops are a premium resource, I guess.\n\nAlso, a small question arises - we have the Security Commander with his assault platoon. Ship's Master gives me a militia of my own, and a security force too. How are we going to work that? The security force is easy, that's my private bodyguard - theoretically the elite, but... :) However, the militia seems odd in this context, any ideas?\n\nHere's my draft character:\n\nLady-Captain the Honourable Penelope Carver Mistress of the Glorious Bringer of His Light\n\nI'm thinking a young woman, raised as a decadent noble with lots of money and no responsibility far from the ship. On Father's death, turns out to inherit (against the expectations of the rest of his scheming family, but the prime contenders killed each other off) and has taken command.\n\nGear: Power Sabre\n\nDomain: the Glorious Bringer of His Light trades in Military Power, Transportation and Secrets. 4-harm, huge, 2-armour Ship is huge, and well-armed. It is also Ravenous. Specials: ancient, enigmatic, posh.\n\nMost Trusted Officer: Felix van Ermien, ship's pilot Most Valuable Officer: Gerard Oleanth, purser of the ship's treasury Most Worrying Officer: Can I put SoylentWhite's character here? :) Biggest Threat to the domain? The other claimants to my father's estate, who feel they should inherit over his daughter. arriving.\n\nAs this impacts on your ship and character, feel free to veto/amend this, but thought I'd suggest it. arriving.\n\nAs this impacts on your ship and character, feel free to veto/amend this, but thought I'd suggest it.\n\nLooks good to me!\n\nQuoteI would think that having a squad of guards personally loyal to the captain would be appropriate in setting, and not a big insult, though I can certainly see how it would rub the Security Chief the wrong way. Also, of course, given Father's mysterious death, Lady Penelope will try not to rely too much on even the trustworthy old guard - even though you took a hit in the Incident, I won't be able to completely trust the security team that let Father die.\n\nI'd expect rivalry and friction to result, of course :) part of the fun!\n\nQuote1) Mother I hadn't considered. I will think about her, but my first instinct is to have her back home on the planet Lady Penelope grew up, anxiously waiting for word. 2) I think that the good claimants fought over the inheritance, and are dead or indisposed. I am a lesser child, but distantly loved by Father, and is technically the rightful heir (after Father's siblings and older children got themselves killed). Wait - better! I'#m not a legitimate child, so there is some dispute as to the status of my claim even though the old Lord-Captain acknowledged her as his daughter and heir. How does that sound? 3) Because I'm a child by a lover who lived on a planet the ship came past every once in a while. The Lord-Captain loved Mother dearly, and spent a lot of time with her when he was on-planet. And very much enjoyed his infrequent visits with me, too. But Mother was too important on her world to leave, and Father had his other lovers and wife to keep him happy while he was away. I was never seen as a real part of his dynasty, except (according to his surprising will) by him.\n\nThere's a good argument that the squad of guards loyal to the captain is the primary duty of the Security Chief.\n\nThat will be made. Repeatedly. ;)\n\nIf you're going to be an illegitimate daughter, you *have* to have your father's actual wife be alive and still on board the ship. There are no excuses (beyond doing the probably sensible thing and offing her as soon as you get on board). ;)\n\nEdit: I should point out that when I suggested killing the widow of a recently-deceased, well-loved captain during the time you are trying to consolidate power as being a *sensible* idea, that was sarcasm. Realised it possibly wasn't clearI am thinking a corpulent, pale and unpleasant Navigator called Nostronox or something. A nasty little man who has a thing for getting into peoples heads to feel their feelings, as he doesn't really feel much himself. Some sort of trauma in his past made him all dead inside, and now unable to feel himself he preys on others emotions when possible.\n\nA psyker who can mess with peoples heads is useful to have around, and if he hadn't been useful and protected by the guild I'm sure he wouldn't have been tolerated onboard for very long.\n\nPerhaps the Captain (or the commander) actually managed to scare him once, and now he follows them around as much as possible, doing as they command or request, just hoping that he may cause another emotional outbreak.\n\nWhaddaya think? Doable? Fits with the others? (Well, \"fit in\" is not the word. Compatible with the game?)"

If they died by the same statistics as the current marines, it'd make terminator armor a big joke. So it'd probably only work as another standalone game using similar mechanics, not really as a compatible expansion.\n\nPersonally, I'd like to see more going on in the blip piles. When I first got the game, it was a bit of a bummer that the only difference between blips was what symbols they moved on. I'd love to see a few GS hybrids, or other Tyranid nasties in the piles, with some \"comes into play\" abilities or simple active powers. Nothing terribly complicated, but just a little different to spice it up.\n\nEven if you just kept it genestealers, there could be a few blip cards intended to play up that they are indeed just \"blips on a scanner\" until you can confirm them visually. So you could have a card that's not a stealer, but just a sensor anomaly, and is discarded upon being drawn. Then, to compensate for that, you'd have cards that when they come into play either make you spawn another genestealer at their location, or cause you to put another couple blips in the smallest blip pile, etc. Of course, this would further ramp up the random elements of a game that is already largely dominated by luck, but I think it might be fun and kinda cool.\n\nThere are tons of new options to increase the depth of this already awsome game. I am sure FFG will do a good job for the future.\n\nYeah, I second that. Additionally, a team white is a missing color. I would like to see a paladin or white-knight look.\n\nChaos marines or a chaos marine boss would be really sweet. New event deck that can create new terrains that come with the expansion deck (i.e. \"Hidden Room\").\n\nLastly, plague zombies would be awesome, all having a special ability that if a space marine is slain by a particular swarm attack, then spawn a special Zombie Space Marine with the swarm, making it more tough and lethal.\n\n\"Some said the thunder called the lurking fear out of its habitation, while others said the thunder was its voice.\"\n\nYou know, this might be slightly off topic, but I wouldn't mind seeing a Space Marine card game in the same vein Battleground: Fantasy Warfare series of cards.

The problem is, people see their ship as their private property, and not assigned to them. You don't own the ship, SF owns both of you..hehehe."

It's not there in the editor, so we typically use chat clients like pidgin. There used to be a few foundry channels in sto, but none of them got used, when having pidgin and foundry minimzed meant that you can always follow the chat regardless of what part of the foundry you are in."

It could be useful for example if you have a staged rocket and have the plan all set up for the stack to get into orbit and for the eject burn. But after you separate into an upper capsule you can grab the plan that is already set up from that stack.\n\nTo do it you click back to 1st stage the BCK (back) once more. You will see inherit from and either new or a ship name. You can click the ++ button to toggle through the possible choices. Only the ship in the same stage (location) as you are possible to be used for the inherit. Example if a ship has a plan and is still on Earth and you are in orbit, then you can't choose to inherit from that ship. But if it is launched into orbit then it becomes a candidate for the inherit."

      "text": "There are two Tech 2 Engineering Stations in the game, the Cybran T2 Engineering Station, nicknamed The Hive and the UEF T2 Engineering Station, nicknamed The Kennel. While both are different in use, they both serve to \"Get work done\", as they both have very fast build speeds when compared to traditional engineers, especially after upgraded. When fully upgraded, The Hive is cheaper and has a faster build rate, but the Kennel's engineers (Rovers) can roam around, outside of their buildings' assist radius, making it a far more versatile building. The Rover's ability to roam around and reclaim or capture land units without fear of reprisal is considered an exploit by some.\n\nUnlike The Kennel, The Hive doesn't have any mobile mechanics that can be destroyed, resulting in having to waste your economy and time to rebuild them. The Hive also has two upgrades, as opposed to The Kennel, which has only one. On the other hand, The Kennel drone rebuild time and resources are quite low. Furthermore, if needed, The Kennel drones can work outside of their automatic operational range, albeit this can only be done manually. The Kennel drones can also perform other tasks while the original Kennel is upgrading, while The Hive cannot.\n\nOne disadvantage of the kennel is the fact that its drones fly and enemy asfs will target them. When the drones are under shields the asfs will attack the shields and take them out very quickly. This can leave vital structures open to attack from bombers or gunships. Players will usualy send a cloud of asfs first and then patrol them around the base to distract aa while bommbers do the damage on sniped or large scale air attacks, so these drones can actually help your enemy by giving them a way to take down the shields."

      "text": "Wednesday, February 10, 2010\n\nI first saw this chart of relative ship prices in EVE linked over at Common Sense Gamer. The purpose of the chart is to show how much effort it takes (either in time, in-game currency, or real dollars) to acquire the different ships in EVE.\n\nBy and large, the response to the chart has been largely shock that the biggest ship (a Titan) costs $7600 real life dollars and that the ship can be destroyed. What's not mentioned much is the purpose of this ship and how it takes a large Corporation, and more often an Alliance of Corporations to build it. And then, once built, they rarely engage in combat themselves and are used to transport the fleet.\n\nShock Value\nThe more I play EVE, the more I realize that the people who play EVE like the shock value of talking about how expensive things can be blown up. And it's just that – shock value. The reality is much more mundane.\n\nEVE works because ships and structures are destroyed. In 0.0 space (PvP land), every inch of space is owned by a Corp or Alliance. These are GROUPS of hundreds or thousands of players, working together to put up structures to claim that territory and police it with their ships.\n\nLosing or gaining territory means things need to blow up. This feeds the economy, which in turn, is most profitable for the economic players willing to play in 0.0 space where they most valuable things are located.\n\nLosing a ship, or even a Player Owned Structure, IS the game. It's not just a consequence, but the actual purpose of playing. A catastrophic moment of losing something so significant that it takes quite a bit of time to recover are VERY rare. The game is DESIGNED around losing ships and structures.\n\nThe most severe losses happen at an Alliance or Corp level. An individual player would never lose a Titan, the Alliance or Corp would lose it. Likewise, losing the Player Owned Structures (POS) in 0.0 is a loss by the GROUP – not a loss by the individuals. As such, the loss is a shared burden and one that, as a group, you will recover.\n\nOn an individual level, the smart player doesn't risk what he can't afford to lose. And if he DOES lose it, there is an insurance contract on every ship that mitigates the severity of the loss. In some cases, that might not mean a loss of anything more than your time to buy and fit a new ship.\n\nRMT in the form of PLEX\nTobold's take on the chart is really more of a comment about the Real Dollar cost of these items. In EVE, you can purchase what is called a PLEX license with real currency (US Dollars) that provides you 30 days of game time. This PLEX license is something that can be sold in the game to another player for in-game currency (ISK). A single PLEX game card costs around $15 and sells for 280 million ISK.\n\nAs I wrote last week, one thing that has bothered me is that EVE doesn't reward players who PLAY the game. You could, in theory, skill up and get all the in-game currency (ISK) you want while logging very few game hours. That's very counter to what we have come to accept as 'fair' for receiving rewards in an MMO.\n\nOn the other hand, I disagree with him that CCP has a bad implementation of RMT. The one smart thing that CCP did is make PLEX part of the existing market economy. I think that's the difference for most people.\n\nMaking PLEX part of the economy means that:\n\nit is susceptible to market forces (280M ISK being market price, it could go up or down)\n\nprovides 'gametime' to ISK sellers, not real life cash\n\nit doesn't create net new ISK that inflates the economy\n\nlots of people selling PLEX for ISK drives the price of PLEX down\n\nThis means that it doesn't really 'take away' from the economic game, it enhances it. In short, I have to think that 'winning' the Economic game in this setting would mean BUYING the PLEX and not paying real money for game time. Or put another way, laughing at the people who 'paid your subscription' for something you earned so easily.\n\nI think that's why it gets such wide spread acceptance among EVE players. A new player is OK with it because they can choose to jump start themselves into better ships/skills right away. An old-time power player is OK with it because a) they have skills the new guy will take years to get and b) they are the ones buying the game time with ISK.\n\nThat's distinctly different than the usual RMT model where only the developer and the RMT buyer benefits from the transaction. For the record, I'm still against RMT but as far as this particular implementation goes, I think there are far worse models.\n\nHow CCP makes money on PLEX\nThe really clever thing about PLEX is that it encourages people to buy game-time in advance of when they need it. From the perspective of CCP, there is no free game time. Either you are paying for it, or someone else is paying it for you.\n\nThe difference is that someone might use in-game ISK to buy several months of PLEX game cards and sell them off to people who might hoard these cards. It's very likely that lots of players have several months worth of PLEX in inventory. They are also only sold in (2) packs, so even the person selling the PLEX might still have one remaining in inventory.\n\nThe result is that there are many more months of game time floating around than actually being used each month. In many ways, it's like selling year long subscriptions to people who wouldn't normally buy a year-long subscription.\n\n4 comments:\n\nAre you sure you didn't leave out the rather important word \"million\" between 280 and ISK?\n\nHow long does it take a new player to earn his first 280 million ISK? As far as I could gather from various blogs, quite some time. I distinctly remember some blog entry where somebody was proudly talking about having reached his first 100 million ISK. For me, the knowledge that I could have gotten to exactly the same point for a few dollars diminishes the achievement. It's a bit like climbing a rock to find the summit full of people who got there by taking a lift.\n\n\"How long does it take a new player to earn his first 280 million ISK? As far as I could gather from various blogs, quite some time.\"\n\nWith (very) basic trade skills, back in September 2007 I started station trading to Jita, never having done it before.\n\n7 days later 15M starting capital had become 153 million of assets. My notes have 350 million after another 7 days. I wasn't making an efficient job of it, so these figures are unlikely to be remotely impressive. Jita is now a much more intense market than it was back then, so no doubt things would be different.\n\n15 million is a non-trivial quantity of ISK for a young pilot - I estimate it's 9 impossibly solid days of mining with a moderately skilled Tech 1 mining cruiser, for example.\n\nSo, not sure, maybe another two weeks to bootstrap up from close to zero, via the market, provided the player was gifted with a great deal of enthusiasm?\n\nI don't feel diminished by others having taken a short-cut. If I'm feeling particularly patronising, I might feel a little sad for them, since they've not the chance to experience the fun of doing it the \"proper\" way."

Large fleet battles lag us ourt as much as the people who don't have top off the line computers cause the lag is..... omg dare i say it.... server side\n\nYou know when you go into such battles or highly populated systems that lag will be bad. the risk you take, the risk you choose. And besides lag or no lag, if you're primary you're dead anyway.\n\nIts common sense like don't park your expensive flashy car in a bad neighbour hood you don't take your costly ship to a system where it will be exposed to unnecessary risk, CCP can't reimburse carelessness\n\nOriginally by:ToxicFireIts common sense like don't park your expensive flashy car in a bad neighbour hood you don't take your costly ship to a system where it will be exposed to unnecessary risk, CCP can't reimburse carelessness\n\nlag is one thing, desync is another but you get the same response. game mechanics require you bring many ships to take out a pos. there is no other way without spending 8-10 hours, especially if there is a cyno jammer. the real fun is in the same battle a few will get reimbursed, most will not. it's like there is a quota.\n\nCCP should have realised by now via the community and threads such as this that their \"super\" server cannot handle the style of combat they are trying to impliment, it is impossible to have meaningfull battles without lag occuring. If they want people to fight in huge gangs against POS or Outposts or more importantly each other and encourage this in the way they develop the game hardware should be there to support this and it isnt, that is the fault of CCP alone. Its like running software on a computer below the basic requirements for gameplay, yes it is normally possible but it hardly works smoothly.\n\nMy response on this to the topic starter is find another game. If more people did that, CCP would start feeling the pain in the wallet, where it really matters. I know the thread starters pain, I used to run missions out of \"The Citadel\", mostly Saila. CCP should be providing a lag-free gaming enviroment, but they do not, and they will not EVER do this because they are not feeling the pain of loosing customers. I will tell you this, the DEV's and GM's of this game care nothing about your problems and only about your making your monthly payments to CCP. I can say this without ever being screwed over by them, but I know plently of people that have yet they still continue to play the game.\n\nIt is a known fact that CCP's customer service is one of the worst in the world, end of story...\n\nLook at it this way. You knew that by going to a heavily populated system you will be exposing yourself to lag which may cause the loss of your ship and you being unable to respond to aggression. So being fully aware of that you still took your ship into a laggy system. Why? I think that in the first place it isn't CCP but you who should care more for your ships and accept the consequences of what you do with them. The game isn't perfect and yes currently a lot of people in same system cause lag. Either play around it and quit whining or quit the game (and give me all your stuff :P)."

A Tactical Captain in a Cruiser can do very well with beams, since he can pack (and power) so many of them. An Engineer in a Science ship can be a huge asset to a team, as Science boffs get all the best Shield heals and Engineers get the Hull heals.\n\nA Science Captain in an Escort might be a stretch, but I'm sure somebody now is going to reply that they had great success with this combination.\n\nOh yeah. I'm a Tac in a cruiser and my beam weapons are powerful. Plus, I can survive a long time thanks to a high hull on a cruiser, which gives me really solid defense while my high powered offensive weapons tear into other ships.\n\n__________________\n\n--------------------\n\"Laser effects, mirrored balls; John Williams must be rolling around in his grave!\" - Homer SimpsonThere is a small but growing body of \"Diplomatic\" missions, but yes, it's mostly a combat game, and when you escort things it usually means something's going to come try to destroy or steal them.

In that case (remember that decoy launchers can only reroll a glancing blow immobolised result) an immobolised result is a dead hammerhead. Rerolling the dice can never get a worse result, only the same dead hammerhead if you get a 5 or 6 on the reroll, while there is a 67% chance you will get something where the hammerhead isn't dead. For 5 pts the extra survivability the decoy launcher gives is well worth it.\n\nFor those reasons most Tau players put decoy launchers on all vehicles.\n\nI would also make your Shas'O like this: Fusion Blaster + Plasma Rifle + Missile Pod + Hardwired Multi-tracker. We have lots of fun wargear, but step away from the armoury. Put down the hard wired target lock and no one gets hurt.\n\nWith your two team leaders: I'd put them into the \"Shock and Awe\" config: One has the TL missile pod + Plasma Rifle, the other has the TL plasma + Missile Pod. Keep them together and use them as a \"team\".That made me happy <3 Also, technically, more people get hurt, but they're not you, which is a good thing.\n\nI'd definately go with MechTau's config. It's a huge points sink, but it's also good at killing anything. Period. Light armor at range, marines up close, tanks up close. Put him behind your unit of drones or deep strike him and you've got yourself a killer there.\n\nMechTau, I don't think he's going Mechanized. With that list, I think that hybrid like you've got might be better. Keep the drones and use them as cover and fire support for your commander. If you find this more static list ineffective, maybe consider switching to mechanized.\n\nAt 1500 points, you're not likely to see a lot of really heavy armor unless you're fighting necrons or some really hard-core powergamer of a marine, so 2 railguns and a fusion should suffice.\n\nHybrid Mechanizes the FW's.

Maybe too much but after moaning for some time about how easy out-trading the AI is, it wouldn't be fair to complain when Stardock fix it. We'll see how the balance is. Thus far, it's giving a testing game.\n\nAlso be good to see how the patch affects crashes to desktop. They haven't been unbearable with DA so far but still a lot more frequent than with DL.\n\nMaybe this is a good place to suggest a stickied bug thread for DA? The current thread ends in 2006 and it would be neater to open a separate one for DA. I've one or two that I don't see mentioned in the patch notes and the GalCiv official forums are such a pain to use that I'd rather use Apolyton (and Brad does drop by I believe).\n\nIf a man speaks in a forest and there is no woman to hear him... is he still wrong?\n\nI've noticed that tech trading has been nerfed, too. There are some techs that the AI simple will not trade or sell: extreme enviro, weapons, defense. Others they'll simply tell you to get lost or will accept only if you give them a ridiculous amount of tech in return, e.g. 20 turns of tech for a tech I can research in 4 turns. This is even true for my Yor (the only game I've played from the start with 1.50x) that have +20 diplo, lots of diplo tech, diplo translator, and an 'incredible' diplo rating for that faction AND the faction likes me. This effectively eliminated tech trading.\n\nI've also noticed the AI is very hesitant in accepting Eco and Research treaties, even with good diplo and favorable ratings (friendly or warm). I know these were downgraded in the patch, and it is interesting to see that the AI turns down a portion of my much larger eco and research in return for theirs.\n\nWhat is perplexing is that the AI seems to be trading techs at a furious rate, so this limitation doesn't apply to them. For instance, in my Yor game a tiny empire (Krynn, 3 planets) managed to get all the extreme colonization techs at about the same time as the other AIs. Also, the groups of AIs seem to progress at a suspiciously similar rate (phasers, manufacturing) as do the minor races. This suggests they are trading techs. The only way to know for sure is to track their research in the diplo screen and then compare to what they actually have – which is a lot of work. There may be other ways to check that aren't so painful.\n\nA few more games are needed to see how this is working. It could be my Isolationist Yor have a diplo penalty. But if this is true then the implication is that the Super Diplomat ability is severely diminished and that diplo techs which may be effectively worthless.\n\nAnother thought is that this may effectively be an AI cheat if they can engage in Group Research while excluding the human player. If this is true then I'm simply going to turn off tech trading.\n\nActually, the new defense is both good and bad. Early it is outstanding since level 1 weapons simply bounce. Put one or two level 1 or 2 armor/shields/ECM and your ships will do very well indeed. This is especially true since most early ships have fewer weapons, and since the defense 'regenerates' between rounds.\n\nThe AI largely ignores armor, so your fleets for a very modest investment can do much better than the AI ships.\n\nIn late middle and mid game the game changes. If you have a large fleet then some armor is good since the shots will be dispersed and the armor will have a better chance of regenerating. Once weapons get to level 2 or certainly 3 they start penetrating, so at this time better defense tech is needed.\n\nFor instance, my Yor cruisers (level 1 and 2 defense, level 2 offense; att 12, def 2 to 4) waded through innumerable early Drath, Terran and Arcean fleets of small ships (att 8, no defense). Some of them got some of the highest experience I've seen – apx 190. The game changed when my Altaran and especially Arceans enemies started getting cruisers (med hulls) with beam attacks of 18+. I had to up my defense to at least 8-12 to make a difference, and they still penetrated to paste me now and then. But, all things equal, my fleets (with a modest tech edge) lost 1 ship (cruisers) to the enemy's 5 (cruisers with some small fighters), and this was likely due to the fact the AI had no defense. In essence, more of their damage bounced while mine always did damage. As I mentioned above, the AI fires on most or all ships, so the dispersed firepower among a number of targets means armor can do some significant good if you 1) have decent armor and 2) have a number of ships to absorb the barrage. The Yor had more space for defense, though, due to their miniaturization edge (making my ships all the more expensive – want more, cost more).\n\nSo I'm neutral on the defense. I'm not sure it is bad; it's merely different.\n\nOriginally posted by tetley\nI'm not overly fond of the patch. It fixed a few minor things, but it broke a couple of major things like tech trading (might as well turn it off now) and defense.\n\nWhat level are you playing on? Previously it was broken to the point of turning it off on anything from Painful on down - it was just too easy to get every tech from the AI. Now I can turn it on and use it sparingly; before it was just an exploit.\n\nBut I agree that there needs to be some happy medium.\n\n\"Stuie has the right idea\" - Japher\n\"I trust Stuie and all involved.\" - SlowwHand\n\"Stuie is right....\" - Guynemer\n\nI was playing on Suicidal before the patch, now I'm on Crippling and seeing how that goes (I finished one game and I mopped up fairly easily).\n\nTech trading is all but gone since the patch. I have no problem with that for now--I've never played with tech trading off before. Now I get to play with Planetary Invasion stealing and espionage.\n\nDefense is overpowered and just plain broken since the patch. Defenses for the wrong weapon type are actually stronger than the right defense. That becomes more painfully obvious when you play Accelerated Start.\n\nLooks like there are a number of items I'll have to track:\n* Tech trades by AI - my observation is that the AI still seems to trade, others say no.\n* How Defense really functions (as in tedley's observation of armor not working as specified)\n\nupdate to patch out 7th March\n\nThe patch was version 1.50X.66\n\nA few hours ago I found 1.50X.68 on Stardock. Can't find any info on what it changes (there's a post on the official forums by someone bemoaning that he's tried everywhere he can think of but can't find any info).\n\nAnyway, one thing it has changed is the AI's tech trading. Just started a game (Huge, all common, Painful, Terrans) and the AI is trading more like the original DA than the patch. Indeed, it may very well be the prepatch trading system, though it is too early to tell yet in the game.\n\nI met the Yor first and they were willing to trade me Planetary Improvements for either of:\n\n-- 580bc or so\n-- New Propulsion Techniques & Xeno Research\n\nCan't remember the next AI race but managed to trade something with them too. I hope this is part of Stardock's balancing since I do want to see tech trading be less of an exploit. However, it may be the lengthy and sometimes heated discussion (mostly critical of the patch changes) on the official forums have persuaded Stardock to go back to where they started from in the first instance.\n\nIf a man speaks in a forest and there is no woman to hear him... is he still wrong?"

And such a defense would suffer major advantages and drawbacksA gravity based defense has a number of advantages and disadvantages that are pretty unique. First of all, the energy draw is enormous. Very disproportionate with offensive systems. Unless you have a stupid amount of tech that translates to Honorverse space magic, it isn't cost effective to use it against anything your other countermeasures can deal with. But you can't chip them to death like you see with most shielding systems various properties use. You either have enough power to get through, or you wait for them them to run out of juice.\n\nIf your ship is made out of normal matter, then unless it is the size of the Death Star, you can't stop a 2 terrawatt Xray laser with a 20 meter diameter mirror at 1 light second. It will cut through your ship like it is made out of paper. Your best defense is extreme range, speed, and acceleration. Stay in a position where light speed lag makes targeting impossible and use high speed missiles to engage the enemy at range. If you have to get within a light second to finish the enemy off, do it only after you run out of missiles.\n\nAs for gravity deflection, all the other guy has to do is aim at an angle that will cause the deflected beam to hit your ship. The only true defense is not getting hit in the first place.\n\nGravity deflection really is just shields by another name since that's precisely how Brakiri Gravitic Shielding works in Babylon 5. Hell, Trek shields are graviton-based.\n\nMy best suggestion is to simply accept that without magic energy shields space-going warships will have to rely on speed and ECM for survival and not try to tank hits from various weapons at all. Make your warships obscenely fast, hilariously over-gunned, ridiculously sensor-studded, and hideously intelligent. Space-going bolos without the armor.Gravity deflection really is just shields by another name since that's precisely how Brakiri Gravitic Shielding works in Babylon 5. Hell, Trek shields are graviton-based.\n\nunless you embrace all that that kind of gravity manipulation entails.... which is a lot.

I've seen it done thoroughly once, and that setting can knock the socks off anyone short of the culture (or people using ridiculous magic).\n\nAlso how much energy would a Demarchist railgun impart into its target, since the railgun is 1000 miles long and fires \"tank sized rounds\"?\n\nWith 70%c exit velocity, lowballing the density of metallic hydrogen to .6g/cm^3, and extrapolating from an Abrams; about 360 gigatons, IIRC.\n\nIf your civilisation has good nanoscale mass manufacturing, building a planetary phased array will probably be just as easy as building starships. With a 10,000km baseline, it's easy to detect incoming threats and put out enough light to be a reliable point-defense. Probably more effective than deca-km size asteroids traditional energy shields. (along with using some other tech like cloaking, high mobility, thermal superconductors, etc to try and deal with energy weapons traditional energy shields. (along with using some other tech like cloaking, high mobility, thermal superconductors, etc to try and deal with energy weapons)\n\nBasically, although they also use beams\\projectiles\\missiles for PD as well. Main advantage in-universe is that gravitics are a hyperspace effect that propagates at FTL and can reach the target far faster than any other method available, although it has the downside of being easily disruptable. (gravitics being an in-universe misnomer/layman's term for configurable volumetric force fields, since whenever people hear that they think of generic energy shields rather than an area where everything inside a certain volume has a force exerted on it in a specific direction, and 'gravitics' gives a good intuitive feel for what their effects are despite having nothing at all to do with actual gravity. It fits the technology better than tractor beam or repulsor in my opinion at least. )You could get power from it that way, but really not that much. It would be simpler to use the NaK to heat water and have the steam spin turbines if you are going to try to get power this way (which is one of the current uses for for the stuff) and you'd probably get more power back. The main purpose of it though should be as a coolant that distributes heat over a large area of the ship that can be readily dissapated... any power you get out of it is a side benefit."

They totally kept Severance from building an outpost right under their noses during a protracted campaign against them. Totally. Those neutral freighters passing through the SF gatecamps couldn't possibly have been carrying the materials for said outpost.\n\nCompare Providence, one of the most densely packed regions of 0.0, with proper NBSI space. I was with a gang roaming through -A- space the other night and we EASILY went 10+ jumps without seeing a single. freaking. red.\n\nI'm totally happy to be an NRDS resident of Providence. At least we have people to chat with in local - and plenty of reds to shoot at because they always come roaming in Providence because their NBSI space is so bloody boring and devoid of targets.\n\nDrawback: come to providence as a red, you're going to get blobbed. :( Sadly we currently lack proper small gang skirmishes.\n\nThe way I see it, is that NBSI is just an easy position to take, if it isn't a friend kill it. Simple, not difficult to understand, do you even need to enforce it?\n\nNRDS on the other hand, is a tad more complex, needs some sort of enforcement policy, and repercussions. My question is, actually, how many Sov holding Alliances put forth an effort of NRDS? My hats off to CVA and 'any' others who have an NRDS policy, your taking a more complex and difficult approach to the game."

It is kinda not fair that the AI can hit me, but I can't hit them.... :rage: :rage: :cranky:\n\nI can beat the toasters at skirmish, at it requires is to give yourself some extra ru's, once you have maxed your squadrons of vipers its actually not that hard. Even then though, you have to support them with a firestar or the 40 squadrons of raiders will simply wipe them out.\n\nAnyways, two more problems I found, the Galactica's main front batteries -never- hit anything. The railguns are fine, but the slow big frontal guns can't hit beans. They've made their way to a basestar's spikes a couple times, but they pass right through instead of pulverizing =<.\n\nAnd Scar isn't FTL capable, not really big though because right now its not possible to get him without hacking deathmatch settings, however it makes him impossible to use (Can't lure vipers away from Galactica because Flak kills him in one shot, and can't avoid the flak with FTL.)\n\nYea I think that balancing is almost perfect. Destroying the basestars and acompanying raiders isn't hard. I ususally don't even lose half my fighters. It's all about tactics.\n\nTry ambushing the raiders: attack them with apollo and starbuck, and pull the raiders back to galactica, parnassus and the rest of your fighters. Then, give the fighters an attack to command as the raiders pass between galactica and parnassus. this gives the effect of the raiders being in an incredible crossfire which they won't survive.\n\nTo kill the baseships, just have your parnassus on f4 setting doing waypoints infront of galactica. Have galactica use salvo mode (also using waypoints), behind parnassus. If any nukes come, parnasus will eliminate them, allowing you to use your heavy batteries on galactica to pound the cylons.\n\nWe are talking about a bug/fix release where we address crashing problems and a few other issues that were pointed out here and on our boards. I am sure you'll see that pretty soon, there are some things we added to give the mod a better feel play wise, better balancing and making some things more canon to the series.\n\nit should become a normal weapon after you research it, but it needs some tweaking.\n\nTechops, now you want to creat a shortcut to homeworld2.exe\nthen right click the short cut and select properties\nIn the target box youll see the file path to your Homeworld2.exe that path will be in quotes (\"\")\nAfter the last quote make ONE space and type -bigoverride\nMake sure there are 2 'R's and then hit ok\nyou have made the short cut to play the mod, you must use that short cut to play the mod.\n\nyes i did that but it still brings me right into the HW2 without any moddifacations just a normal game when i tried to play it.\nbut i have the files in the right place and i have the right placement of the override\n\nI don't know if I like the idea of a .big file release because I like being able to tell people how to fix things themselves and am looking to show people how easy it is to start hacking on the mod. We need more modders!\n\nWe had over 700 downloads in the first two days and only a handful of people reported not being able to figure out how to unrar the Data.rar, create a shortcut from the existing Homeworld2.exe, and spell -overrideBigFile correctly. Personally at this state of the mods development I would much rather see the existing developers spend time adding content and functionality than try to create a bullet proof installer.\n\nHowever, being a firm believer that folks should work on what they want to I wouldn't get in the way of anyone working on a .big file and installer.\n\nI do agree with yafn, id like to see people put stuff into the mod, and if its what we are looking for we will use it. that is one reason, we will make the data.rar available, we may make a .big file but remember if you do that and you have a bug yor stuck with it till next release for the most part.\n\nWell in the box to the right you can usually change all that. Like unit caps, starting ressources etc.\n\nLOL. No, I can do that. I'm referring to posters talking about making it higher than the 10000 RU's cap, allowing you to (for the Cylons) research the Raider development, then the Ressurection Tech, then build Scar. I think that costs about 12000 or thereabouts, which is why I want to know what file they edited to raise it up.\n\nok this may seem crazy, but is there anyway to divide stats between two ships, for instance if apollo were to have a wingman and he were slighty rubbish compared to apollo, its just having apollo and starbuck by themselves seems a little nuts in my opinion\n\nalso will the raptors be able to capture or board and destroy ships later on"

      "text": "Playing X3 games for quiet a while now, I feel that the gap between heavy fighter and corvette is too large.\nOnce you earn enough money and transfer from a fighter into a corvette the game loses some of its charms since corvettes are slow, heavy and not very maneuverable...\n\nSo... what's in the middle between M6 and M3+?\n\nM8! but, that has no guns and is used to quickly take out enemy capitals and stations. That's it.\n\nSo I coppied M8 ships and gave them guns, made them quicker and more maneuverable than corvettes, and better shielded than M3+\nThe idea is that 4xM3+ = 2xM6 gunship = 1xM6 Corvette\nGunships can carry the same weaponry as m3+ but are better shielded and have more laser energy.\n\nHere is a download link so you can try the idea.\n\ndownload rar Version 1\n\nThe ships need to be scripted into game using cheats, they are not sold at any shipyard.\nThey are M6 and called as their M8 counterparts with Raider addon.\nThis mod is just a modified Tships file that goes into addon/types dir.\n\nIt won't work with any other mod that changes ships file!\nBut it's not a real mod, just an idea, and it can be easly applied to any mod.\n\nI'm wondering what the community thinks about this idea, and if this screws up something else in the game that i hadn't though of?\nIf someone is intrested in remodelling the ships I'd be very interested in thisthey're not inhumanly shielded. (although i could tone down the shielding on some of them) just a bit better than m3+\ninstead of \"gunship\" it could be called \"super heavy fighter\".\nthey don't carry heavy weapons or heavy missiles and their firepower is about 10-15% better than m3+ of that race.\n\nas i said before, 2 m3+ vs m6g should be a balanced fight. (npc vs npc ofcourse)\n\nmissile corvette is a good idea. same weapons as M7, but less shields and less launch tubes. cheaper and less powerful. will think about it.\n\nKilljaeden wrote:In the mod they have 3 weapons - so against 1:1 vs M6 they are seriously undergunned.\n\nQuote:\n\nm3+ is a serious threat to m6 if the player is piloting the fighter... otherwise i just don't see it happening.\n\nHead-on the M3+ might vaporish, but if that is not the case, or the M3+ evaded the wall of bullets the M6 has difficulties to catch the M3+ because the turning rate sucks -> all the frontweaponry is basically useless. That's why M6+ fare way better against NPC's compared to M6 (stats aside).\n\ni'm looking at xrm tships right now, and it seems sentinel m6 are gunships. AF weapons etc, but a lot of shielding.\n\nmaybe i'm just overdoing it...\n\nThey tend to only have small main arrays though. In particular the Centaur Sentinel only has a lousy 4 cannons in front.\nPersonally i think the M6 craft should be divided into two categories:\n\nAssault Corvettes that are fast and agile with a big main array and a 2-3 light point defense turrets. Like WW2 torpedo boats they dash in and unleash their main array on bigger ships.\n\nEscort Corvettes that are more heavily shielded with a large amounts of AF turrets. Perhaps with a front turret in place of a main array.\n\ni'd like to balance vanilla firstFair enough, though i assume you removed the M8 missiles from them?\n\nyes. original m8s are still ingame, but i copied them and turned them into m6 ships. they have corvette weaponry, minus heavy guns, and less shields.\n\nHonestly I'd go with 2x shielding than M3, decent speed boost, 360x360 turret coverage, and reduced turning rates. Also, still not much bigger than an M3, and far smaller than an M6. Something small enough and fast enough to elude M7s totally, but at the same time not packing the full firepower and risk of an M6. Just something that's meant to be a hit-and-run heavier fighter. For some reason when I hear gunship I think the LaaT from Star Wars Epi II on Geonosis. apart from being amazing looking, it could pack a punch where needed"

      "text": "This is broken into 3 sections. 101 covers the most basic elements of sailing. 201 covers the differences between scout ships and warships. 301 has extra data tables on ships.\n\nWIND\nSailing ships need to think about the wind. Sailing against (towards) the wind is bad. Sailing with the wind directly behind you is usually not the best angle because your sails can't fill up with wind.\n\nIf you enable the Wind Indicator in Preferences/Interface, there's a circle around your ship that's divided into Green, Yellow and Red sections. Green sections have the best speed, Yellow are okay and Red is the no-go zone. Don't sail into the red unless you're in a very agile ship. It's often faster to turn the long way (away from the wind) than it is to turn through the wind.\n\nSpeed and Acceleration\nWhile the max speed stat is important, it doesn't determine whether a ship feels fast. When you're choosing between ships, look at the acceleration values to see if they're fast. An acceleration of 1.5 or lower tends to be slow. 3 and above is very quick.\n\nShips with high acceleration can turn more and make more mistakes in combat. A ship with 15 speed and 3 acceleration is \"faster\" overall than a ship with 17 speed and 1 acceleration, because the first ship can fully utilize its speed.\n\nTHE MAIN GOAL is to have different playstyles for scouts and warships to give the game more variety. Playing scouts and warships the same way will result in sub-optimal performance. This is especially evident in a warship, as scouts are used to introduce you to the game.\n\nOverview\n\nHere's an overview of what you need to know about ships in order to squeeze the most out of them in combat.\n\nScouts\n*Suffer minimal movement penalties. As a result, they are capable of extended maneuvers.\n*Fast acceleration\n*Easy to play\n*Difficult to master. Must take full advantage of maneuverability to beat similar ranked and skilled warships.\n*Able to catch and board ships, but lower crew.\n*Able to escape most fights\n\nWarships\n*Suffer heavy movement penalties. Not capable of extended maneuvers.\n*Slow acceleration.\n*Hard to play\n*Not as hard to master once you learn how to play\n*Maintaining speed is essential. Warships need to plan their maneuvers out carefully and ahead of time. When warships maintain speed, they are almost as maneuverable as scouts.\n*Higher crew than other ships. This helps them against crew effects and on defensive boarding.\n*In the worst case scenario, the warship is equivalent to the firepower of a scout. At higher levels they get more firepower.\n*Warships are the hardest ships to sink. They have more armor, structure and damage reduction. Gun loss is related to % armor and structure, which means they suffer slower gun loss.\n\nMerchants\n*Lower crew, more vulnerable to boarding.\n*Generally lower armor, structure and damage output.\n*The Ketch and Indiamen ships are combat-capable merchants. This includes the Oliphant. They handle similar to warships.\n\nWhat you see, what you don't\nThe character UI does not have enough room to list the dozens of stats that determine the performance of a ship. You see:\nMax speed\nAccel - how fast you gain speed\nDeceleration - how fast you lose speed\nBest Point - the wind angle at which you get the most speed (this is a mirrored point on a 180 degree half circle)\nTurning (Slow) - max turn rate at 4 knots, degrees/second\nTurning (Fast) - max turn rate at max speed, degrees/second\nTurning Accel - how quickly you reach your max turn rate\nTurning Decel - the minimum deceleration suffered when turning\n\nYou don't see:\nThere are a dozen values for speed\nThere are more acceleration and deceleration values\nThere are different speed %s for each wind angle\nThere are a dozen values for turning\n\nA lot of the maneuverability for ships comes from those hidden values. Some of these valuse have too subtle of a difference to display in a way that makes sense. Showing the ~50 values that make up a ship's maneuverability would make ship selection very difficult.\n\nSlow turn rate and deceleration are especially important. To determine how fast we turn, we apply your turning acceleration when you start turning. We look at your speed... if you are between 0 and 4, we lerp from \"Stopped\" to \"Slow\" turn rates. If you are between 4 and max speed, we lerp from \"Slow\" to \"Fast\" turn rates. The slow turn rate is your base, and you always want to keep your ship above 4 speed to keep that turn rate. Turn rates are show in degrees per second.\n\nDeceleration values determine how much speed you lose whenever you do anything with your ship. Warships have higher deceleration, which makes them lose more speed. That's why it's important to maneuver cautiously on a warship. The more you turn, the more your decelerate. It slows down a lot after you've been turning a bit, but it levels out after awhile. It's important to compare a ship's deceleration to its acceleration, because those values play against each other.\n\nThe Sleek ships in particular have upgrades to a lot of the stats we don't show.\n\nUsing the Wind\nHere is a typical Scout Wind Diagram and a Warship Wind Diagram. Note these vary from ship to ship, and within each class of ship. However, most warships have a sail rig that keeps them close to that performance with a best point at 135. This is typical in Frigates. The scout ship diagram represents ships like Cutters (best point 90), but the Cerberus is closer to the warship diagram.\n\nWarships handle better going with the wind.\nScouts handle better against the wind.\nSailing with the wind directly behind you (running) is rarely an optimal wind angle.\n\nSince warships accelerate slower, losing the wind is much more painful. Sailing into the wind will cost you more time. Warships are often better off taking a long turn to maintain speed instead of going into the wind. Additionally, warships need to be careful about protecting their vulnerable masts when fighting fast ships.\n\nScout ships can afford to take more risky maneuvers into the wind because they recover speed fast.\n\nOn the wind indicator, all green sections are not the same. Green is typically any speed greater than 85%.\n\nTacking\nSailing directly into the wind is bad. That is why you should tack. Tacking is changing your sailing position back and forth and sailing towards the wind, but not directly into the win. This creates a zig-zag movement pattern, which is faster than a straight line into the wind.\n\nThe Close Haul wind angle is the most important to understand. You sail much, much faster if you move into a Close Haul instead of Luffing/Upwind.\n\nManaging Sails\nScout acceleration allows them to make frequent changes in their sails. You can lower sails for a shot, then increase them right afterwards. You can adjust your speed, come to a stop and try to turn around and go another direction.\n\nWarships need to monitor their speed closely. You want to keep your average speed around 50% of max or higher. Battle sails are not as important for warships, because your speed will usually be low enough that you'll be getting the full target tracking bonus. However, it is important to change to battle sails if you expect dismantling shot because it will help protect your sails.\n\nHow to Turn\nYou need speed to turn. That is a simple fact in our game. If you try to turn and accelerate at the same time, you will get a slow turn and you will not accelerate. It is much better to accelerate and then turn. You will get the speed you need for future maneuvers, and it will make your turn complete faster. I cannot stress how important it is to gain speed before turning for the slow ships, unless you want to turn in place.\n\nScouts are forgiving when it comes to turning, but warships will punish every mistake. This is why warships are hard to sail, but once you learn the basics they are easier to master. Scout ships are hard to master because you can sail poorly and still be successful, therefore they don't force you to learn.\n\nData tables! This shows the % of its maximum speed that a ship can attain at each wind angle, and what angle it transitions from luffing to close haul. Knowing the differences between ships and wind angles is critical in high-end PvP.\n\nUpdated the table on 7/21/09 with values from M17. Includes the Poseidon, Alymer, and the 5 new Refits.\n\nI agree this was absolutely amazing to read. I didn't understand a word of it. Since there was no instruction manual with the download is there any resource other than the game screen key map to help new players with trying to fight using these horrible boats? Mine sank yesterday trying to do the very first quest and I don't know if I should be sad right now or happy that I manged to kill it. The experience was a bit like trying to park the mercury in the mall parking lot at Christmastime with 4 screaming nieces and nephews waiting to eject from the side ports.\n\nIn the end of your post you mention \"battle sails\". What does that mean?\n(please don't say read the manual, because as was mentioned the download version doesn't have one... which is sad, usually its included in download versions as a PDF)"

      "text": "the dagger in destiney different from the one in seed? im pretty sure they upgraded the dagger between the two wars. and the dagger had the ability to use striker packs but i think its more like the full armor system similar to what the NT-1 had or the valks in macross than it is the packs that the strike uses\n\nIt'll probably be like the UC mod where Anavel Gato's Gelgoog and the GP-02 couldn't be out at the same time. It'll probably go along the lines of: Getting MS development for EAF will unlock refit ships. I don't think that upgrading a unit will allow it to lose use of some of its weapons, or replace existing weapons.\n\nUpgrading it by subsystems can only add new stuff to the ship, but a research upgrade of a ship can replace a weapon with another, and thus also entirely deactivate it by replacing it with a dummy weapon. There's probably also an easier way of doing this, but that's just off the top of my head.\n\nI think the meteors will be a seperate unit that can't be built when The Freedom/Strike Freedom Justice/Infinite Justice are already built. Or it might be made as a research upgrade/buildable subsystem. Sort of Like the Duel Assault Shroud.\n\nEdit: It'll probably go about 50-100 less than the probe, otherwise it'd zip around the battlefield, pass its targets too fast, and otherwise end the battle too quickly. Making playing against the Hard AI impossible without of spam of Laurasia's.\n\nin complex mod they made 2 ships that can dock with others and arnt carriers of any kind. the crew and research ships so they're probably going to do something so the METEOR can dock with the freedom/justice and just boosts speed and firepower it didnt really do anything to armor. but how would it work since they are docked with the eternal if not the freedom/justice so that part would be iffy since it cant be a standalone unit at least i dont think it can\n\nmaybe have it so the METEORS come with the eternal as turrets since they are used that way in the show?\n\nThat's good to hear, thanks for the update Sunnycat.\n@Darkdust43- well since the eternal isn't in yet. But I think it won't even be attached to the Eternal at all. It didn't use the meteors that much, just kind of had them. Unless its made to where the METEOR is seperately built, but can't do anything unattached. Then being attached to either the Eternal or the Freedom/Justice allows it to attack.\n\nI will say once, HiMAt is not a weapon system of sorts, it's a speed and maneuverability boost and allows the freedom to move about in the earth's atmosphere without the use of sublifter, aka the ones that aegis used when in earth's atmosphere\n\nthe cannons on the wing are different matter altogether\n\nand I reckon METEOR will only provide speed and weapon boost, but decreases maneuverability, and will have difficulty hitting targets up close\n\n------------------\n\nanyways, about the blog, they want us to look there instead of keep asking them about progress, as they have gone rather tired of replying the same thing, so if Superawesome man will be kind enough to translate every update, we wont need to bother the devs and wasting their time that can be utilised on the mod itself, which they are severely lacking because of real-life work\n\nI don't think it'll have too much trouble with up-close targets, I mean it does outspeed them, and the missiles will still be tracking them. Besides, I don't think many Gundams without at least the PS armor upgrade are going to get a second chance to attack.\n\n@Amstel- it increases the mass, but you're thinking of weight. It's in space so that won't effect it. Even then, the thrusters of the METEOR allow it to utterly outrun just about anything. They do have beam sabers for close combat but this is homeworld 2 we're talking about. Maneuverability will decrease because of it's speed though. Since it will be making very wide turns.\n\nGrind, mass has a major effect in space, actually far more important then weight, because think of it this way.\nLets say you have a ship that weighs 1kg, and its engine gives it 1kg of thrust. it'll accelerate at a certain speed. If you double it's mass to 2kg however, you'll gut its acceleration in half. Same goes for maneuverability, with the METEOR it would take more thrust to speed up and slow down because it has more mass and thus more inertia. Also it would have a more difficult time turning due to rotational inertia. But then again, the METEOR has at least 2 large thrusters pointed backwards so it would be able to accelerate forwards faster, probably not maneuver faster though.\n\nI think meteors would attach to the eternal like how assault frigates did to capships, they just need to reduce the distance\n\nand what I meant up close is, there's no saber for METEOR in this mod, so it relies on missles and the frontal guns, so if anyone gets up close, the METEOr have to deal with large turns and the inability to hit backward targets, without going through said turns\n\nYeah, while the METEOR has no defenses against close range attacks, the mobile suits docked with it do. So if the Freedom is still enabled to use its weapons while docked with the METEOR, it should be fine. As for not being able to attack anything behind it, maybe it'll be lucky enough to go against a fast opponent. So when it turns, the enemy will go past it mid-turn, allowing the METEOR to get it in weapon sight/fire its missiles as it passes.\n\nwell the freedom did use its own beam sabers when docked with the meteor. and in the show didnt some of the suits fire over their shoulder? or was that one of the other series they are starting to blend together. gouf from 8th ms team > than gouf in destiny\n\nYes, but that was in the show. The only one that so far even close to being able to attack anything behind it is the shoulder-cannon on the assault shroud.\nGouf from the original > Gouf from 08th MS team > Gouf from destiny.\n\nthe taser thing and that gatling cannon on its shield though the finger launchers were replaced with a normal hand i want to say there was another gun somewhere on it but im not sure so the custom is actually superior. i miss the gelgoog though it just looked so cool and the kampfer. that thing had so many thrusters the freedom wouldnt even compare in manueverability. downside the kampfer would be pointless in atmosphere\n\noh wait. kira can shoot a mobile suits head shiro just goes ape **** and beats the gouf with an arm from his gundam\n\nshiro does beat those zakus with a friggin shoulder launched missle and i think it was anti tank before he got the EZ8. what other pilot in the metaseries does that?\n\nThe taser you speak of was a different variation of the heat rod I think. It was a Gouf Custom. The gatling gun was also newly added, but I think it still had the finger-vulcans.\nhaving a Gouf custom in Seed Destiny would've been badass, so long as it wasnt a nameless grunt using it.\n\nThe Gouf custom had a normal left hand, instead it has a 3 barreled gun mounted on the wrist, it had a shield, and though it would probably have been able to be equipped to the standard Gouf, it had a gatling gun mounted on the shield. For the right hand it has the sword (forget its name, the axes were called heat hawks)and the taser i was talking about. But its nothing like a heat rod, the heatrod electrocuted and burned, it was wide and short, the Custom's wep was a thin long ropelike cable that was strong enough to hold the MS in the air, could be used to grapple and its shock was more powerful then the heatrod's\n\nit also had a longer range because the cable was thinner and thus more could be stored. that gouf though is so much cooler than the destiny one. and why did they bring the doms into destiny? i never liked the doms\n\nWell if they had the Zaku and Gouf, why not the Dom. Seriously, if the Dom's had beam weaponry in UC, it'd be over for the Feddies. I liked the Heat Rod more, just seems more iconic.\n\nWell, if the DOM Trooper does show up in the mod, I hope its not an overpowered early-game unit like the Black Tri-Stars in the UC Mod. I know they were aces, but man even my later upgraded RX-78's took awhile to take em down. I mean the DOM Troopers had phase shields, and a beam/bazooka cannon.\n\nwhich raises another question: Will you be able to research who commands a ship? Like say, you built a ship that was known for having multiple commanders, I.E the Girty Lue. If Neo is researched it gets an increase to attack power. If Ian Lee is chosen it gets an increase to speed. Stuff like that.\n\nwell wouldnt that somewhat apply to mobile suits? not all of course but both kira and mwu piloted the strike and in a sense so did cagali. and cagali and neo piloted to gold one (i know its name but i can never spell it) there are a few others out there such as some of the murasames. and the bacue and waltfelds upgrade of it\n\nI guess they can do that for suits that have been piloted by two people. I.E: Kira/Mwu piloting the strike as darkdust said. Or Shinn/Lunamaria piloting the Impulse. Or instead of research, make it a buildable subsystem, that way you can \"change pilots\" whenever you want!\n\nyeah, although i'm not sure of the pricing/build time. Maybe 500 Ru's and 30seconds to switch pilots?\nOH! I got one for the akatsuki:\nCagalli: Projects a command field to nearby Orb Units boosting attack power, speed, and defense.\nMwu: is able to use dragoons more effectively and gets an increase to attack power, speed, and defense. Also able to use the defense field more effectively.\n\nGrind, k now if it might be possible that when you \"switch pilots\" using the build subsystem or w/e, it could make it fly to the nearest ship and dock so it would be like it has to land to switch pilots?\nAlso say for the strike you could have Kira and Mu. When Kira is in it he had the normal stats by he has the ability to go seed mode (probably use the shield so that it can run out after a little bit) that boosts all the stats but the armor drastically for a short time. Then for Mu he could have this normally better attack and defence (and maybe his defence field skill acts as a defence field)\n\nhow bout a shuttle going around for pilot pick up? as in pilots who ejected if thats even possible for them to eject ive never seen an ejection system other than a core fighter of some type. the only mobile suits ive ever seen that might have one are the freedom, justice, and the gundams from 8th ms team more because of where the hatch for the cockpit is how its more on top and going up instead of straight out\n\nThat could be kinda cool with the relevant mobile suits spawning a core fighter or similar on destruction that's set to automatically return to the mothership, which would decrease the build time towards getting that suit back.\n\nThat way you'd have to focus on taking the pilot out too to keep him out of battle longer.\n\nthere are non controllable ships in the complex mod like the crew cells so the shuttle thing is possible doesnt have to be built or maybe build a \"hospital\" ship (repairs nearby ships/mobile suits) but it sends out shuttles to pick up pilots. is the core splendor going to be buildable as a seperate unit like in the UC mod? and with the impulse are they going to have the flyer come out that has the different packs? not the leg or chest one since those wont be needed as much"

(In window behind Rogue-for-Higher civilians frantically run for cover yelling things like \"save us!\" and \"where is the Royal Security Force!\" as Trade Federation bombers mercilessly bomb them)\n\nThat means that it is possible to lay waste to the landing craft on normal mode! If it takes, say, four hits to down a fighter, and on one hit it takes one, four hits is equvilent to one hit. Four times nine equals thirty-six. So thats the lowest it would take (if the damage was equal to that of a droid fighter. But if it was equal to that of...say...a tank, then it would take an awful lot more shots. I'll try working it out.\n\nMommabird destroyed! In my first attempt, I simply flew into the early right-hand canyon and hit the brakes on the mommabird's tail. What seemed like a hundred shots later, she blew. But, I thought Gavyn said something else other than \"For Naboo\" in my game. I'll go back and see what it was.\n\nSpeaking of exclamations, have you guys ever heard \"For the Queen!\" in the queen's gambit?"

      "text": "nice post, 100% from me, i mentioned in anotehr post as an aside that following these simple (and yet somehow at the same time impossibly difficult rules) that the so called imbalance at t1 (which i am currently fly my miranda) would disappear to a greater extent\n\nThe T1 / T2 imbalance you mentioned is accurate when you take T1 ships loaded out with T1 stuff and skills against T2 ships loaded out with T2 stuff and skills. The same imbalance exists at T3 BTW, with T3 stuff and skills against T4 stuff and skills. No amount of teamwork will correct such wide technological and ability differences.\n\nI read the original post and like you, agree it is simple, but in reality, is extremely difficult to implement. The reason for that is it takes prior coordination and practice.\n\nThe Feds he referred to in the early life of this game likely played PvP together over and over again. The same group worked out what to do and who was to do it and used it very effectively.\n\nEvery time I do PvP today, it is with a group of strangers I've never seen before. None know how to coordinate / cooperate with the other, no one knows how to use the strengths of one ship versus another, no one covers the other's tail and nobody reacts to a Klingon ambush the same way.\n\nKlingons have it way easier. All they have to do is come together or spread out a little, come in close, pick a target or two, decloak and blast away.\n\nYes it is simple, but making it happen isn't quite as simple as the OP suggested.\n\nWell call them Fedbears for a reason. When they are faced w/ KDF, all they do is Fedbear stare!!\nAs to why you got the infraction... you hurt the poor fedbears feelings...\n\noh the legendary fedbear stare. Once a thing of myth, legend has it that a few fedbears grew tired of getting harvested for experience and decided to fight back. The fedbear stare now comes in a variety of forms, most common is the DPS stare - which takes both mastery and competance to use properly. Used properly it can incinerate the opponent within seconds leaving only a smoking pile of ashes.\n\nand to those that don't get it, that was a reference to the fact that there are escort pilots that can actually do that.\n\nLet me guess, it addressed the moronic tendency of certain people to rush in without waiting for the rest of the battle group to catch up? And then they complain about a lack of backup?\n\nActually that sounds more like par for the course. it always seems that one faction in any MMO has their stuff together, groups up and works like a team to obliterate the other side every time while the people on the other side yell, scream, and harass their team mates for not healing, crowd-controling, or assisting in the kill. It's always gonna be that way regardless of the game you play.\n\nIn the case of STO, that's always gonna be the majority of Federation players since you have to make it to level 6 before you can play the other faction. you just gatta find a group of people that can play like a team and stick with em. I found a real good team a couple nights ago and we just did PvP after PvP, raking in the badges. Working as a team is ALWAYS better than going at it solo.\n\nAnother thing, stop looking at the numbers and complaining about not being number 1. You're part of a TEAM and there is no I in TEAM. either your team wins or your team looses. if you team is constantly winning, why complain about not being number on in damage dealt or in killing blows? (and yes I've seen that said many times already in this game)\n\nI would only say that your advice is really meant for cruisers and sci ships.\nEscorts should be all about damage otherwise they are wasting their main strength.\nI have been in lots of good fed ball teams and the klinks dont have a chance if the players in the fed ball know what their job is.\n\nSci ships should be looking for cloaked klinks on the edges of the ball. Cruisers should be defining where the fed ball goes and should be the center of the ball because escorts can fly circles around cruisers. Escorts can either circle close to the cruisers always ready to start attacking with everything as soon as a klink appears or one can fly out in front attempting to pull klinks from cloak and when they appear do a fast dash back to the group hopefully pulling the klinks into the killing fields.\n\nCruisers should lock phasers then start healing and extending shields to protect the escorts becuase its the escorts that can drop a ship in 5 seconds. The Sci ships should be doing crowd control, damage and maybe laying mines to give early warning from flank attacks."

Do some exploration missions for badges (Hromi for Lt Com), get a pair of dual heavy cannon up front, a decent phaser bank and a phaser trt on the rear. Get an EPS relay for engineering and some plasma or cannon tac consoles. Destroy +2 cruisers in one pass working alpha pattern/cannon rapid fire/tactical crew/tach beam while taking bugger all dmg.\n\nConstantly push your CD's, tac team and rapid fire have 30 second cd's iirc so there's no big deal burning them. Evasive manouvers, emergency power to shields, brace for impact etc etc. Push as much power to weapons as possible and keep your shields stabilised. 100 to shields = waste of time, you cannot outlast most targets, but you can out damage them.\n\nnote: this advice tends to go out the window for pvp where players just burn all their defense CD's on your burst, you really need to catch the napping for this to work... ; )Except we also have replicators. So it's not impossible that with enough recovery time, the armor could be repaired just like shields regenerate after a while.\n\nExcept we also have replicators. So it's not impossible that with enough recovery time, the armor could be repaired just like shields regenerate after a while.\n\nOkay for the sake of realism (I know its a game) but:\n\nArmor is on the outside of the hull, so It would not be able to be repaired without either a spacedock facitilty, or some peep hanging on the outside on the hull. And I don;t care what anyone says, the red shirts or your average knuckle dragger are not that dumb to be hanging on the ship's exterior during a battle."

      "text": "Main menu\n\nSearch form\n\nTitle\n\nThe Ministry of Love, formed early this year, is Goonswarm's highsec arm. Originally designed to assassinate individuals, fight wardecs and sow general havoc throughout Empire, the group has become one of EVE's premiere freighter ganking outfits. As of this writing, Miniluv has reached 200 freighters destroyed since August and just caught an ex-IRC Charon that EVE-Kill values at nearly 44 billion.\n\nSuffice it to say, they're busy. Powers, second-in-command of Miniluv, held an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session on Reddit just this last week. Here are some of the more interesting questions and answers that resulted:\n\nQ: What is the usual size and fleet composition of your freighter-ganking force?\n\nA: DPS really depends on how many people respond to pings, and how many people are multiboxing. People come out of the woodwork for huge stuff. I'd say DPS is usually at least 12-16 people on an average gank. It can be done with 6 extremely well-skilled gunnery characters and the correct freighter hull target.\n\nQ: What ships do you primarily fly/find most cost effective?\n\nA: The Talos is amazing for damage. You can theoretically do 6-7 ship ganks, which are about 150 mil per ship fit and used to be the same cost as the freighter hull you were ganking. Unfortunately, we made those prices go up by murdering them repeatedly. A T2 Neutron Brutix isn't bad either, but it's no Talos. You could also do it with T2 Neutron Dominixes (w/ Garde II's).\n\nQ: How long does it take for you to get sec status back up? And how many ganks does that afford you?\n\nA: Sec hits are a percentage relative to what your sec status currently is. It really depends. We've streamlined the sec status bumps via coordinated sec safaris. Usually .25 every 3-5 minutes depending on the safari fleet. That actual amount is relative to -2.5-0. It is a sliding scale. We are excited about the concept CCP floated at Fanfest with regards to tags for sec. Then we can use our freighter money to streamline our sec status and never leave empire.\n\nQ: How many ganks do you usually get after one of your safaris before you usually go back and do another safari?\n\nA: Well, generally speaking, we're good until about -4. Then it becomes really inconvenient. The lower your sec gets, the faster ship you should fly, because of the faction cops reaction times. We are set up so we don't have to rely on the same guys day in, day out. I've never really thought to count how many ganks, since technically you can do it as a -10 if you time it all correctly. Its pretty difficult though. All of this depends on the sec rating of the system and where you started from as far as sec status goes.\n\nQ: How do you grind up your sec status?\n\nA: 4-5 tornados and a bunch of slashers with target painters. We warp into anomalies, alpha a battleship rat after it has been painted, and warp to the next system.\n\nQ: Do you recommend Catalysts for people without t2 large guns yet?\n\nA: Catalysts are fantastic. That is how we get our guys trained to T2 Talos. T2 Cat -> T2 Brutix -> T2 Talos. The train is worth it if you plan on ganking or just doing loads of dps.\n\nQ: How can you stand doing this for weeks? But i guess you're used to the nullsec boredom so meh.\n\nA: It seems boring from a DPS/scanner/bumper perspective, but I deal with all of the other administrative stuff and supply logistics as well. I also cook up other fun projects / campaigns for this stuff. There is a huge thrill from freighter ganks. It's like a scratch-off lottery ticket. You know what you could win, you just don't know what you will win. Our guys do this because they make money every gank and they get free ships to gank with. They don't have to rat, mission, or otherwise carebear for income.\n\nWe're constantly trying to one up our last kill. Our first month goal? Surpass Burn Jita destruction. We beat it by 115 billion isk, in 30 days. We're on track to beat Burn Jita by 90%. We have destroyed 1.6 trillion total in 2 months. That's ridiculously insane. That's 19+ officer fit Erebus' worth of isk destroyed. Let that sink in a little.\n\nQ: Have you ever been surprised by something that happened on a gank?\n\nA: There's this double logoff exploit that some people are using to end up at their destination gate after they've been aggressed and bumped after jumping in. They magically avoid one of the emergency warps and end up skipping to the second ewarp destination. So when they login, they are back at the destination gate. I talked with some of the Freight Club guys about it and they've petitioned it. We haven't bothered because if the guy is at his keyboard trying to live, then he's entitled to a fair shake.\n\nI was surprised that we were able to gank a freighter through 4 sets of neutral large armor logi trying to keep him alive.\n\nQ: Have you ever had a high-value freighter escape? (whether not enough DPS on the field, or it having an alt to web it into warp before you can lock, etc)\n\nA: Yes, we lose out on JFs from time to time due to webbers. They align faster and require a lot more DPS. One time a Black Legion Rhea cynoed out of Uedama before we got all our DPS on field.\n\nWe had some guy with a couple billion ISK in the hold escape in 7% structure after doing a double-log-offski that managed to skip one of the two emergency warps for him and he wound up at his destination gate. He also had three or four logi on him. I think there were one or two others that we flubbed, as well.\n\nBut that's been about it. Anything super valuable has always died.\n\nQ: How does a double logoffski work?\n\nA: It's hard to explain, really. The basic concept is: you initiate warp, you logoff, wait 30-60 seconds for ewarp, log back in, log out again. Wait a minute or two, log back in, and you should be in ewarp to the destination gate, in jump range, at 0. It shouldn't work, but it does. For all intents and purposes, it is an escape exploit, but we don't really get too bitter about it - after all, we're pirates. Kudos if you understand game mechanics well enough to pull it off/make it work. Due to it being an exploit/broken logoff mechanic, it doesn't always work. Half of the time, the system does things correctly and doesn't let you skip over to the destination gate.\n\nQ: Why does that stop you from being able to gank them? Don't they still need to align out?\n\nThat's the lovely thing about a double log-off-ski. It doesn't matter if we have 6 guys bumping or 0, they end up somehow emergency warping through bumps, despite all the mechanics saying they shouldn't be able to enter warp. This is why I call it an exploit/abuse of mechanics. There is a difference between using mechanics to your advantage, exploiting glitches or known broken mechanics, and abusing those little things that are broken.\n\nQ: How do you handle the loot logistics? A freighter load of stuff is not easy to move around so how do you do the Wreck>station transport? A bunch of Orcas?\n\nA: We have our ways. I can tell you one thing though, we don't use GSF freighters or Orcas, that's for damn sure. I usually Blue Frog it up. I give them detailed instructions on not carrying multiple loads because they are max collateral. The value of the things that drop accumulates quite a bit. We aren't in a huge hurry to sell things. Blue Frog ferries it out at their convenience and everything is canned and double wrapped.\n\nWe also have a Blue Frog delivery schedule for our supply chain.\n\nQ: I was actually considering applying to Red Frog Freight. Besides not autopiloting (never do anyway) and not carrying over 1 bil in goods (not allowed by RFF contracts), are there any other tips you would have to avoid freighter ganks?\n\nA: Limiting yourself to 1bil in goods is probably the dumbest suggestion I keep seeing everywhere. I routinely carry 10-20bil in my freighter. I just know how to avoid presenting a target. If you are smart, going through Uedama is no big deal. I do it at least 2-3 times a week when Blue Frog has a giant backlog. You should learn a bit more about freight cans and courier contracts.\n\nAlways, always avoid autopiloting.\n\nQ: Do you guys use a 3rd party tool/website to estimate freighter values?\n\nIt works for haulers if you are Tornado ganking as well. We started off by only hitting things that showed up as over 7bil with that tool.\n\nQ: Is the gank group open to CFC blues or just GSF?\n\nA: It is open to members of the CFC. Just pm powers on jabber, or look up Miniluv on the GSF wiki.\n\nQ [Hans Jagerblitzen]: Is Crimewatch 2 going to put you out of business? Do you think CCP is dumbing the game down for carebears?\n\nA: I do not think CCP is dumbing down the game for carebears. I look at it as them presenting us with more of a challenge. It will be slightly riskier, but we've already planned how to skip away like ninjas after ganks. We may need a safe POS in Uedama for our pods, though. I have to look at the GCC rules again to make sure we can't dock for a minute. I have to say, making the looter FFA is pretty inconvenient. Someone could make the argument that it is making highsec safer, but I don't concern myself with that.\n\nThat being said, the new bounty system will more than make up for this, and allow me to go back to Miniluv's original bounty hunting glory.\n\nQ: Is the payout method something along the lines of take market value subtract ship/fitting costs and divide remainder by number of pilots in the gank?\n\nA: We used to value the payout based on what dropped, but it didn't reward the people who were on bad luck drops. So we just switched it to a flat payout all around. Space communism. Everyone gets paid the same, every gank is the same in our eyes.\n\nQ: Have your profits increased since the change to faction warfare? Also, are you more active in the hours and days following a T5 as opposed to a normal day?\n\nA: Yes, we are. We know all of the head people in the FW groups. We have Fweddit and Late Night Alliance directors in Miniluv. They let us know when a cashout is about to happen, and it becomes an 'all hands on dick' affair. We check in and rotate scanners on the money routes and when something big comes by, we kill it. We have to work extra hard to fit enough ships for these events. This past Saturday, we killed 14 freighters and 1 JF. That's an all-time best for us.\n\nQ: Any other advice for a fledgling suicide ganker?\n\nA: Be patient, stay out of Uedama, (pick another high traffic .5), don't harass us in our pipe. We won't be disruptive to your ganks unless you escalate with us. Train T2 Blasters and good gunnery support. Hardwirings are your friend. Use offgrid safes. Be patient, eventually you will be rich. There are two \"exploitable\"/\"gankable\" demographics in this game:\n\n1.) The ignorant. These people don't check evekill. They don't understand how courier contracts work. They don't know the best way to ship things.\n\n2.) The lazy/dumb. These people just don't give a shit, or are too impatient to do things the correct way. They autopilot. They just dump everything in their freighter. With FW cashouts, these guys are looking to beat the rush to dump things on the market.\n\nLook for more coverage of the freighter ganking epidemic, and Miniluv in particular, soon!\n\nAlikchi\n\nI play the video game \"EVE Online\" with an emphasis on suicide ganking and the metagame. I'm interested in history, politics and culture. Follow me on Twitter for my retweets of other peoples' jokes at @alikchialeika."

It gets you more cash, and less heat. Many countries aren't to keen on massacre and the pirates that do such things usually come to a bad end.\n\nIt's really a risk either way, they pirates end up killing to crew anyway, or fire fight breaks out and many of the crew are killed in the process.That's not a bad idea, it keeps the fighting off the ships and the merc ships can stay back out of territory waters thus prevent diplomatic snafu's.\n\nThe only problem I can see is hiring such companies that have access to gunships will be expensive, possibly more expensive then many companies can afford to do on a long term basis.\n\nmikekerr3\n\n11-22-2009, 08:19 PM\n\nWith piracy on the rise should we be arming ships or the crews of merchant ships?\n\nWhat say you?\n\nOn the high seas they would have to have Navy people manning the weapons just like during the World Wars, It could also be problematic toenter some ports with what would then be considered a warship.\n\nThe problem of where to get the people to man those weapons would have to be solved also.\n\nmikekerr3\n\n11-22-2009, 08:27 PM\n\nGranted pirates in general prefer to take a boat with as little resistance as possible.

In a fight there are implict rules that both combatants generally abide by, like not kicking someone when they are down or trying to pluck out their eyes. I think there are also implict rules here.

Problem with that is it seems typical pirate tactics is to get in close, get in quickly and strike before anyone knows whats going on. At that point the pirates might be to close to the ship to risk opening up on them.\n\nFurthermore they would need a platform to land on. Having them on the ship itself could be problematic when crossing into sovereign waters, having them on another ship would add to the expense.\n\nThe Cool Thatguy\n\n11-23-2009, 05:49 PM\n\nI think the best solution would be to randomly deploy military forces on commercial ships.

And also naval intelligence would need to infiltrate/watch the various pirate gangs.\n\nThat's if you want to make a serious dent in piracy. Make a big enough one that you can eventually go home, you also need to address the root causes (poverty, exploitation etc).\n\nIt's a big job if we want to do it properly.

The pirates are using fishing boats as bases to launch attacks with small fast boats that are useless for commercial fishing purposes.\n\nThe problem of warning off the ones that have not opened fire can be handle the same way that it has been handled for centuries a shot across the bow of the approaching vessel.\n\nI don't think the proposed machine gun is the appropriate weapon though, an ATGM of some kind would be far more effective. Unless the operator is drunk missing a target like a speedboat would be nearly impossible unless you chose to do so, and a hit would end the fight instantly.\n\nVakanai\n\n11-24-2009, 01:23 PM\n\nWith piracy on the rise should we be arming ships or the crews of merchant ships?\n\nWhat say you?\n\nI would have to say, yes.\nMerchants and ship workers deserve the right to protect and defend themselves.\nAnd sometimes, with pirates, just handing over what they ask for isn't going to always increase chances of survival.\n\nBut then were back to the argument of arming the ship itself, in which case, as MGS pointed out, I think it ceases to be a merchant ship under international law, and becomes a military vessel.

      "text": "Its not really off topic. Many of us were predicting the re-emergence of bundle boats to the top of the PVP ladder. The only thing that was holding them back before was the potential for losing the bundle dura to roving packs of light ships. This made it less practical to red zone bundle boats and so the vanilla's had a bigger niche. The new rules make the red zone safer. Yes, \"a safer red zone\" is an oxy-moron but its what we have now. So its now more practical to proliferate bundle boats.\n\nBundle boats never left the top of the PvP ladder. They became a little less common for a while after P&P when the ships got rebalanced, but came back pretty quick because they had become cheaper. I remember a lot of gankpacks made up 4+ bundleHercs and/or Vengies.\n\nThe way most players avoided ganks was through manipulating other OS mechanics to their benefit, like tagging NPCs and using invisible/invulnerability timers. Basically, a lot of this game has been players finding \"creative\" means to skirt the rules and game the mechanics in order to deal with parts of the game that were poorly designed or implemented. Rather than fix things, FLS largely used to pat people on the head for using things in ways wholly contrary to their intended function, and then add more unbalanced content and broken mechanics instead of addressing existing problems. I think this was an easier answer for some of the early dev teams than fixing things, and I think on some level they liked the \"sandbox\" feel of letting people play with the mechanics.\n\nBut the result wasn't fun in the long term - it was more like an untreated cancer that progressively metastasized and sickened the game. New players had to not only learn a complicated PvP system in an open-world PvP environment that made them valid targets for high-level players even at the lowest levels, but they also had to learn a long series of work-arounds in order to be able to play the game with a basic level of competence. And as the work-arounds and notions of best gear, best classes, acceptable targets, etc. all solidified within the playerbase, a lot of the fringe players who had been trying to do their own thing, RP, whatever, in a sandbox style, found themselves left out, and a lot of them left. It was sort of like moving to a small town as a kid who enjoys sports, only to discover there's only one game played in town, it's basketball played 4v4 according to a modified set of rules and scoring, played for money in an old gym with uneven floors, bent rims, dead spots in the backboard, and half the lights burnt out. Huge home court advantage, and a lot of incentive for a newcomer to just take their ball and go home.\n\nNow I see the dev team trying to really fix the problems players have been having for years, and make the game run tight, according to an intended ruleset, with mechanics that don't require GM policing, and it's good stuff... but it's unfamiliar territory to everyone who had memorized all the sweet spots of those old backboards in that dark gym, and all the places where a warped floorboard would kick a loose ball free from some unsuspecting nub.\n\nGreat Post!\nI was absent for like 7-8 months and found out that the game has changed 2x times more than the previous 2 years.\nI like the Bucc changes,Ft and Priv changes, OS changes,Avcom changes.\n\nP.S To the guy that wrote about FT and Buccs bein way better in battle .. thats just a joke.\nFT is like the easiest class to beat in 1v1 and the Bucc Crew is a big LOL.Or maybe its just me."

      "text": "Messages - Joseph Hewitt\n\nI considered something like this before, but didn't do anything with the idea. Conversations could be built on the fly. When a regular conversation is entered, the game puts together a list of all the things the NPC might have to say- this could include permanent features of the NPC (such as a shopkeeper's shop), plot-related stuff (such as a mission offer), stuff related to other plots (if a mission requires you to round up three other pilots, this option would appear for any pilots you meet), stuff related to local events (such as asking info about the mecha bandits), or even general knowledge stuff (who are the Silver Knights?).\n\nOnce all the options are there, the game can select a greeting from the list of possible greetings that'll lead to each of the available paths. This will require having some kind of descriptive context for each of the \"destinations\", but that can be worked out. Returning to the \"base state\" will be handled just like the greeting, except that the message will be \"Is there anything else you want to ask?\" or whatnot.\n\nNot all nodes need be enterable from the base state- maybe, every state will generate its own destinations, not just the first one.\n\nIf an NPC initiates conversation, the code for that could start the conversation at a specific point rather than doing a greeting. This would be important for such things as combat challenges.\n\nMaybe some nodes could be marked as optional: In a given combat challenge, there's an optional surrender node where the NPC runs away, but this will only get added to the conversation if it somehow makes sense.\n\nThe big issue I see in implementing this in Python is that there's a huge number of functions that need to be embedded in the structure. You could do this by making \"exchange\" a class and the functions its methods, but then almost every instance would need to be a new subclass. Which is not a problem per se, of course, but I'm wondering how to structure things so that the code for a conversation is relatively easy to write and comprehend.\n\nI've taken a look through Ren'Py, and what they've done is to add a scripting layer on top of Python which handles the messy bits. Their situation isn't exactly the same as GearHead's, though- the \"conversations\" there are actually the execution flow of the program, and they don't need to be serialized since there's no random element to their structure.\n\nI've started writing a conversation module for use in the random story generation test program.\n\nPlots The GearHead world is dynamic- things change, new events and missions come up all the time. These events are handled with Plots. A Plot is basically a collection of scripts and locations that get added to the world temporarily, then when they're finished get taken away again. Just as the gear is the basis for all physical objects, the plot is the basis for all narrative content. Typically a plot represents a single beat in a larger story. Plots have the following characteristics:\n\nA plot can request elements, which are things from the game world which are needed to carry out the plot. Characters. A character may be involved in only one plotline at a time. Scenes. Factions. Items. A plot can request child plots. A child will either be part of the same plotline, or the beginning of a new plotline. The tree formed is called a Story; see below for more details. A plot may create new characters or items, or may optionally have these things created automatically if an element search fails. Upon initialization, a plot may move any of its elements within the game world. When the plot terminates the element will be moved back to its original home. A plot has a scope, which may be global (encompassing the entire adventure) or local (encompassing a single city and its subscenes, or even a single scene) Within the plot's scope, the plot can have scripts for all of the normal triggers (team movement, time steps, entering or leaving a scene, etc). A plot can define personas for any character it has as an element. A plot can define temporary scenes. When the plot terminates, these scenes are also deleted and any contents are returned to their original scenes. A plot can have both subplots A plot can be active or inactive. Only one plot of a given plotline can be active at once.\n\nStory A story is a tree of interconnected plotlines. When created, the root plot is activated and is thereafter responsible for activating its children. Only one plot of a given plotline can be active at once, so if a plot activates a child which is within the same plotline it will be deactivated itself. A plot which is deactivated gets removed from the game. Any active child plots it has are moved to root. Any inactive child plots it has are eliminated. Temporary scenes and other resources it has are cleaned up.\n\nHere is an example of a simple mecha combat mission:\n\nThere are two plotlines. The mission offer is activated first; this plot has a mission-giving NPC as an element. If the PC talks to the NPC, and accepts the mission, the combat subplot is activated. Once the combat is completed (either through a win, loss, or timeout) the Mission Offer plot will activate either the Victory or Loss subplots, as appropriate. As these are part of the same (red) plotline, the Mission Offer plot will then be eliminated.\n\nIf the mission-giving NPC dies the red plotline may be terminated immediately. If this happens before Combat is activated, then that plotline just gets disposed of. If it happens after Combat is activated, the PC will still be able to go and fight the combat, but there will be no-one to give a reward afterward.\n\nFrom what you describe in your earlier post, all the things that are relevant to context are already available from the Gear object itself, so I don't think it makes sense for Gears to have string attributes encoding this same information. But you may be right that it makes sense to have a special way to specify requests.\n\nYou're right; looking over my post, I think I explained that part poorly. In Pascal GH, context requests are stored as strings, while gear contexts are generated from the gear's characteristics as they're needed. There's no need to store them as strings within a gear, and in fact that would be a very bad thing since a gear's context can change very often depending on its state.\n\nQuote\n\nThat said, my inclination would be to keep the context stuff as simple as possible until the simple scheme gets too cumbersome. Hard to get simpler than if statements, and it's not hard to write if statements that can handle weighted preferences.\n\nI'd be inclined to say, let's put together a random-plot builder and ultra-simple Adventure-style game that lets players walk through it. GearHead, after all, is that plus a giant-robot-fighting system that you have to get through to get to the next plot nodes. So if whatever scheme works in this simple context, it's probably fine.\n\nOK.\n\nQuote\n\nDoes it maybe make sense to develop such a thing on github, so that folks here can test out our own ideas against the game skeleton?\n\nThat's a great idea. I built a similar program when prototyping the GH2 plot system, but made the mistake of not making it interactive- the first plots all looked fine as stories but were far too linear/rigid when played as a game.\n\nI've been playing around with a plot tester myself. My idea was that there'd be just a text console and a menu- or, a menu in the text console. No need to make a fancy UI. The game contains a simple world made up of three types: scenes (which act as containers for everything else), characters, and props (which model everything else).\n\nUsing the menu you can either move to a connected scene or interact with any character or prop in the same scene. Characters and props are pretty much the same thing, aside from having different contexts- you select their menu entry and they do something.\n\nI will try to do a complete writeup of the plot system this afternoon, but basically: Plots are temporary additions to an adventure. Plots may request \"elements\"- characters, props, or scenes which are searched for and then associated with this plot. A character or prop associated with a plot will have its normal behavior redefined by the plot. Plots may spawn additional plots, resulting in plot branching.\n\nPersonally I think that context matching is such a common and important thing in GH that it's okay to have a special system to describe it, despite the learning curve. Of course writing the criteria as Python code is more powerful\n\nOne problem with doing context matching as an \"if ...and...and...and\" statement is that the context matcher should return a weighted value rather than a simple yes or no. I know this doesn't make the \"if...\" form impossible, but if we decide later to change the weighting scheme it does mean that everything needs to be individually altered.\n\nI'm not sure how somethings like alignment and faction would be apropriate for eg. scene gears. Maybe 'creatures' or 'entities' would be an appropriate sub-category under which these things fall?\n\nCities typically belong to a government faction, and buildings can belong to factions as well- bases, factories, and so forth.\n\nQuote\n\nOoh shiny. What is a development event? Something like a barrier before the next \"phase\" of a plot?\n\nIt's one of the special plots that involves a lancemate- for instance, the one where a junior LM asks the PC for advice, or the one where the LM finds a mission for the PC, or the one where a villainous LM's past enemies show up to enact revenge.\n\nGenerally these plots will advance the LM's personal story (as modeled by attitude, motivation, and personality traits) and provide the LM with a new talent or skill. They only occur once every 15 to 20 renown bumps, in order to more evenly distribute the events in time/among lancemates.\n\nQuote\n\nQuick thought: Perhaps this can be generalized into a real-valued weight score? Along with must and must-not haves: good to have → +1, bad to have → -1. Some plots trigger at certain renown levels, right? Handling renown as part of the weight score could make them more or less likely to trigger at higher renown. (thinking of it though, perhaps that's better done with a bell-curve-like probability match + a single renown value for the plot that represents both the point of highest probability of getting loaded and the average reward scaler to limit renown-explosion)\n\nThe context match score in GH2 is calculated multiplicatively- IIRC, every match doubles the weight.\n\nA plot request includes a renown rating. There are five context tags corresponding to five renown levels: Green, Regular, Veteran, Elite, and Ace. These can be factored into the plot requirements like other context tags- a rat killing mission might require Green level, for instance, while a major assault might only occur at Veteran or above.\n\nCurrently the renown level for plots is based on the PC's renown, while the renown rating for quests is set when the adventure is generated. One example of this is in the mecha arenas, where different NPCs only show up at specific renown levels. Tama, for instance, is always either a Green or a Regular pilot. Vanda, on the other hand, will always be either Elite or Ace.\n\nEdit- I just realized I left out one very important thing from the context documentation: it's possible to include an \"or-list\", a list of items for which one thing must be true. For instance, a plot might request renown level Green or Regular.\n\nI don't remember who did the sprite, but you're right it doesn't match the monster. If you could make a lovecraftian monstrosity sprite that'd be great; otherwise, I guess the monster itself could be altered to fit the sprite.\n\nSecond: define the custom methods inside the plot subclass (as static methods). Let the plot's initiation code create the Computer and fill its trigger function variables with references to those static methods of the plot class. In serial format, the Computer instance contains the typename/unique identifier of the plot class that contains the custom functions, each function's name, and the action that triggers each of those functions. It wouldn't matter if there is more than one instance of a plot running, since the special functions are static methods, and state information are all contained in the specific instances of plot and Computer.\n\nI think this is the better solution- after all, we want to make it easier for people to add content, and splitting things up between files would be a pain (not to mention a maintenance nightmare).\n\nAre there any UI extensions for PyGame? That might be a good thing to look for, especially if it also included text entry boxes and other knick-knacks. Then again, maybe the game could be written with a widget toolkit like GTK or whatever the one that comes with Python by default is called. It's not like we're using high-end graphics here.\n\n...\n\nI typed up the context system at the GearHead Prime design doc. Here's a copy of that:\n\nContext Every gear has a list of attributes which may be relevant for content selection; these attributes are the gear's context. These tags include the following information:\n\nThe existence or nonexistence of the gear in question. The gear's faction, or lack thereof. Also, whether the gear belongs to the same faction as the PC or not. The gear's alignment with regards to the PC: enemy, ally, or neutral. The type of the gear: scene, character, monster, item, faction... For NPCs, there are additional attributes: The job type of the NPC: Adventurer, Academic, Corporate, etc. The NPC's attitude and motivation. The NPC's personality traits: Extraverted or Intraverted, Cheerful or Grim, Aggressive or Passive. The NPC's governing virtue: Justice, Peace, Fellowship, Duty, or Glory. The NPC's personal relationship with the PC: friend, lancemate, or nemesis. Whether the NPC is a Major or Minor NPC. Whether the NPC is Ready to be featured in a plot. Whether the NPC is currently a member of the PC's lance. Whether a lancemate NPC is ready for a development event. For Factions, there are additional attributes: The faction's type: Corporate, Military, Criminal, etc... The faction's governing virtues. For Scenes, there are additional attributes: The scene's type: City, Building, Dungeon, etc... The scene's environment: Mountains, Forest, Wasteland, Deep Space, etc... The scene's terrain: Space, Ground, or Underwater. The scene's world: Earth, L5, L4, Luna, Mars...\n\nTo generate content, it will usually be necessary to examine the context of several gears at once. For instance, to generate a new subplot we need to examine the context of the city where the plot will take place, the PC's faction, any characters or factions involved in the parent plot... to keep everything straight each context attribute should be connected to an identifier telling which gear it belongs to. In classic GH this was handled by making the identifiers single chars and the attributes five char strings, separated by a colon. So the context \"P:L5LAW P:POLIC P:PCFAC P:ALLY_ P:++ E:REDMA E:CRIME E:++ E:ENEMY\" would tell us about the PC's faction (P) and the enemy faction (E). In new GH, it doesn't really matter how this is implemented as long as the functionality remains. It would probably be best to make the identifiers more readable.\n\nContext Search Often we will need to check the context to make sure it matches some condition we've set. For instance, a certain plot might only load while the player is on Earth, or if the enemy faction is Criminal. When we have a list of options to choose from, not all of them are given equal weight. The more context tags that match the more likely a plot is to be chosen. This is because a context search with a lot of tags is much more specific than one with few tags, and so the situation is likely to come up less often. There are three options for each attribute in the context search:\n\nMust Have: This tag must exist in the target context, or the search fails. Must Not Have: This tag must not exist in the target context, or the search fails. Good to Have: If this tag exists in the target context, the likelihood of selecting this content is increased. If this tag doesn't exist there is no effect.\n\nFor instance, a plot which requires \"S:EARTH ~S:FEDER -S:IPSHIL\" could only occur on Earth (Must Have), is more likely to happen within the Federation (Good to Have), but will never happen in Ipshil (Must Not Have).\n\nImagine that a plot requires a door which doesn't open when used- instead it starts a conversation with the NPC behind the door, but then after talking the NPC unlocks the door and it functions normally from that point on. Or suppose it has a combination or puzzle lock. Or suppose a NPC has sent the PC to open a stuck door, and the PC can try a number of different tactics- use repair on it, beat it down, etc. These things would be very hard to generalize. Even worse, consider a computer terminal- in GH1 and GH2 just about every computer terminal has its own unique behavior, and this behavior only makes sense in the context of the plot/scene/whatever that spawned it.\n\nI'll post a more thorough description of the context tags tomorrow. I'm not sure that anything I post tonight would make sense.\n\nSilly nitpick: ooh, one module indented with tabs, and one with spaces. Equality for all? Personally I root for the tab indent side. I hope it wins.\n\nOops, I thought I had them both converted to spaces now... I'll fix that.\n\nQuote\n\nSome logic revolves around Gear.max_HP being positive, negative or zero. ... The gears.py code could be simplified a little by replacing a few for-loops with more 'pythonic' alternatives.\n\nYou're right. I was pretty much running on automatic there, translating from Pascal to Python. That shouldn't be hard to change.\n\nQuote\n\n(as much as I'm a curses fan) Wait, whut? So this is not for GH Prime? Cause weren't we going to abandon the idea of a text mode interface for GH Prime? I actually put some tileset code in my github to do (among others) something vaguely similiar to ToME's \"ASCII\" implementation.\n\nIt's just for trying stuff out now at the beginning, not for the final game.\n\nQuote\n\nWasn't it a bit of a problem last time the interface of GH SDL version (which I think most users use) got constrained because of the way the curses code is written?\n\nNot that I remember... the main issue with the ASCII interface was elevation levels, if I remember correctly.\n\nQuote\n\nWell, when it comes to an engine written in something like Python, significantly blurring the lines between scripting and the engine is a very viable way to do it.\n\nYes. I just want to know exactly what shape this is going to take. Let me get into some specific examples...\n\n- There should be a list of content. When new content (a plot) is to be added to the game world, an appropriate choice is selected and matched to the adventure. My first thought was to make each plot a subclass of the basic plot type and then instantiate it to add it to the world. Problem #1: Plot insertion often fails, if the plot can't allocate the resources (characters, scenes) it needs. Instantiation doesn't normally fail. Problem #2: Plots can contain their own content, such as the proverbial customized door. If this content gets defined as a class (inheriting from some other class) then it can't be properly contained by the plot class or else it won't be properly serializable. I guess this isn't that great a problem, but it is kind of ugly.\n\n- A common task of the story generator is to search for things based on context. In GH:Pascal, the context is a string containing lots of descriptions. Each description is of the form [gear identifier]:[context tag], where \"gear identifier\" somehow identifies the thing this context belongs to and \"context tag\" tells us something about it. For instance, \"@:ADVEN\" would tell the story generator that the part currently being examined is an adventurer. Instead of using strings for context lists, in Python it would make sense to use a set. However, how to construct the individual context descriptions? They could be strings, as in GH:Pascal, but this seems inelegant and it is definitely prone to errors.\n\nI put together the start of a Gears module in Python, and Peridot went ahead and improved/expanded it. I've also translated the GH menus to Python with Curses; this must be the fourth or fifth language rpgmenus has been translated into (AMOS, PCQ Pascal, some kind of Amiga BASIC, FreePascal... I think there have been others). Both files have been attached. Let me know what you think.\n\nThe thing I'm worried about, though, is scripting. The two things that REALLY worry me are 1) I don't yet know how it's going to work, and 2) I don't know if adding content is going to be any easier than with GHLua.\n\nSo, my next Python project will be to create a random plot/scripting system. Before I have a game for it. Because that makes perfect sense.\n\nI'll be sticking to the GearHead specifications (which means that I first have to fully define those specifications), so with any luck it should be easy to just drop these modules into the game with little modification.\n\nThe test program will have three types of objects: scenes, characters, and props. Using the menu system you will be able to navigate through the scenes and interact with the characters/props, just like the world's most primitive visual novel (without visuals). After the world is generated additional Plots can be loaded; these alter the behavior of scenes, characters, and props currently in the world, or may add additional ones to the world.\n\nI've locked registration following a spam explosion. If anybody wants to register before this gets fixed, send an email to me- you can find my address at the GearHeadRPG page as well as AtaraxiaTheatre."

      "text": "As a fan of 4x space games, I am obviously excited to hear more about what Legends of Pegasus has to offer. With some other 4x titles also releasing this summer, I would like to get some clarification on a few of Legends of Pegasus' features that I have seen listed here in the forums and within the gameplay videos (including the longer gameplay videos on gametrailers).\n\nUnique tech trees are mentioned in several of the gameplay videos. Can you elaborate on how \"unique\" these techs will be? What I would like to know is if they will offer changes that significantly alter or enhance that race's playstyle? With only 3 races in play, I am hoping that each race will play significantly differently and that their available techs will reflect that. How many unique techs will each race have? I am aware already that the races will be able to make some wildcard tech choices to add techs they wouldn't normally have access to.\n\nHow many weapon types will be in the game? For example, ballistic, missile, torpedo, laser, tractor beam, emp, plasma, biological, etc. Are certain weapons limited to certain races?\n\nGiven the fact that Legends of Pegasus will include 3 playable races (and 12 \"Factions\" if you count the different origin choices at creation, ex. Science Human) and 4 neutral groups, how many AI players can I include in the galaxy? Will AI Humans go to war with other AI Humans as well as X'or? Will diplomacy involve more than just the head of each race (3 sides)?\n\nI see that orbital structures can be places around the planet. Can orbital weapons be used to defend planets/systems without necessitating retaining a large fleet at all your systems for defense?\n\nWill there be space pirates, monsters, or other threats to deal with in the sandbox mode?\n\nWill there be unique minerals/artifacts/resources on certain planets/systems?\n\nI think Legends of Pegasus thus far sounds like it could be my 4x game of 2012, but I think a lot of people still don't know much about it unfortunately.\n\nAnother question. How adaptable with the AI be? Will they be able to shift their strategy if the player has countered their current one, or will they continue trying to pound their square peg (i.e. poor ship design for instance) against the round hole?\n\nSo sorry for not answering your post earlier. So here are the answers to the best of my knowledge:\n\nTechnology: Each race has a unique tech tree. Of course some technologiesare the same for each race such as a colonizing module for example. But there will be enough differences for a unique playstyle. Examples: Humans tend to use particle weapons, their tech tree does not feature as much laser/beam weapons as that of the X'or.\n\nIn addition to the main tech tree of each race, you can choose bonus tech trees at the star of each match. These give you a special technology branch in your tech tree that you can research in the course of the game. For example, the humans do not have EMP weapons in their main tech tree. But if you choose the ion bonus tech tree, you can develop these weapons as a human. There are not only weapon bonuses. The tyrant doctrine bonus tech tree for example gives your race researchable technologies that you can use to push down hard on your colonies so you can force them to keep producing even when the morale is low.\n\nAs a benchmark, the game in it's current state has around 2000 researchable technologies. We had more, but we wanted the technologies to have impact and not only stand for themselves. So we reduced the number a little bit.\n\nWeapons: I may forget some weapon types but I know that we have beam weapons, lasers, particle weapons, EMP, missles/rockets/torpedoes, tractor beams. I dont think we have biological weapons. But there will be hangar bays for fighters, interceptors and bombers. And there will also be special weapons (the tractor beam being one of them). Given the right technolog you can also target four different sub-systems on each enemy ship, for example destroying the engines.\n\nFactions: Each game can be played with up to eight players, be it real players or AI in various difficulty levels. Yes humans can go to war with humans same as against the X'or or Arthrox. Each faction stands alone at the beginning. You can also have diplomatic relationship with each of them. In addition, each faction can also have diplomatic relationships with each of the guilds. They are not real factions and do not count into the eight player limit. They are just randomly roaming the universe.\n\nOrbital defenses: Each race has orbital defense structures as well as deep space military bases that you can freely place in each system. The shipyard produces a special freighter that you can then move to the location where you want the station to be build. With a special command, the freighter then \"unpacks\" and builds up the station within some turns. Same procedure for some other deep space structures like sensors.\n\nRandom events: Yes, we are planning random events for the sandbox mode. But I cannot yet say if these work out or which ones these will be.\n\nSpecials on planets: Most of the planets will have certain special charactaristics. There may be ancient ruins on a planet that you can research with a special building. Or there may be native tribe there. But most of the resources are harvested in asteroid fields, not on the planets themselves. The colonies produce credits (for the human race) as a basic resource and of course up the manpower of your faction, resulting in more officers (for the human race) which you need to man ships.\n\nAI: We are still testing this. I dont want to promise too much here. Let me test this a little longer and then ask me again. :-)"

      "text": "Has Subsystem Targeting like the Vo'quv. Only one of the three that can equip Bug pets if you've got a Bug. Kar'Fi has the PSG console. Dread Bug has the DCI console and can use the Heavy Bug's DCP console (which means the 2pc bonus if both are used).\n\nWhile it's not as simple as just a \"count\" of abilities, it obviously stands out how the Dread Bug compares to the other two in regard to Sci abilities. EN plus possible LT vs. CMDR LT/CMDR EN. You'd be looking at either comparing a CMDR slot to an EN or LT slot. Yeah, Sci is not the Dread Bug's thing. That's also reflected in having 2 fewer Sci consoles than either the Vo'quv or Kar'Fi.\n\nIt picks up that CMDR level ability over both of them (and that Tac'ness is reflected in the 4/3 weapons as well as the +2/+1 Tac consoles). Compared to the Vo'quv, it also has the additional LT Tac slot.\n\nLike the Tac angle, the Dread Bug has +1 Eng console compared to the Vo'quv and +2 Eng consoles compared to the Kar'Fi. The option exists to use that LT Uni as another Eng slot over the Vo'quv, while even at base it has the LCDR level ability over the Kar'Fi (with the option of using that LT Uni still).\n\nYou can't think of the Dread Bug like you would the Vo'quv or the Kar'Fi.

CPB, ES, FBP, PO, TBR, SS. and TR are all limited to \"1\" if you were to take them.\n\nMeanwhile, looking at the CMDR Tac - you're not looking at any abilities you couldn't take - just \"2\" and \"3\" of abilities you could. You gain access to APO2/3, and \"3\" for APB, APD, CRF, CSV, and DPB.\n\nCompared to the Kar'Fi, the LCDR Eng slot gives you access to AB1 and EWP1 (as well as \"2\" and \"3\" for various other abilities).\n\nYep, it's basically a somewhat tanky \"Escort\" BOFF layout...on a ship with a turn of 6. Which is why, imho, there have been the comments about it being a PvE boat and a PvP failboat. Without the Sci goodies, that extra hull's not going to mean much as somebody chews through that extra hull in the blink of an eye. PvE on the other hand, I can see it being fun.\n\nHeck, I'd still fly it in PvP if I ever picked it up - but I do flaky things like that. Sometimes it works - sometimes it doesn't. Heh, think about how much hull you could still have when hitting GDF at 50% or lower...it's already fun to do that in a Vo'qvu - can picture that with the two additional Tac consoles as well as an APO3 instead of an APO1, etc, etc, etcTo be fair, couldn't there be some happy middleground? Why do things have to be OP or UP? It's like we're all Goldilocks looking for the third option...\n\nTo be fair, couldn't there be some happy middleground? Why do things have to be OP or UP? It's like we're all Goldilocks looking for the third option...\n\nI think the ships are great and will be fine. But spend more than 2 minutes on this forum and people will find a way to cry about anything, hence my post of the contradiction that exist. The only time I really care about any of this stuff is when cryptic actually listens to all the crybabies that are nothing but an overwhelming loud minority.\n\nTo be fair, couldn't there be some happy middleground? Why do things have to be OP or UP? It's like we're all Goldilocks looking for the third option...\n\nOne man's OP is another man's UP, is another man's 'middle-ground'.\n\nIf you mention any one thing in this game we can do or use, you'll probably get all 3 answers. One person will say it's overpowered for reason X, another will say it's underpowered for reason Y, and another will say it's fine as is for reason Z, maybe also including reasons X and Y.\n\nExample:\n\nRMC\n\nReason X: It's overpowered because it allows you to repair ALL subsystems and give a large boost for no other cost.\n\nReason Y: It's not really that powerful, considering that the power can still be drained, and you can be re-disabled.\n\nReason Z: It's fine as is, because it provides a good boost to power and repairs systems, but also has such a long cooldown, you have to use it strategically. Also, if you get disabled again, have another power ready to fix it, don't overly rely on it.\n\nA simple example, but still, it's there. Mention anything, and pretty much it'll always be split into 3.\n\nThe real problem lies in actually figuring out what the item/ship/etc actually is: OP, UP, or middle-ground."

Blaster is the best gun, good fire rate and easy to control. THE MORTAR GUN SUCKS!\n\nOriginally posted by thejeditraitor what's the best way to kill destroyer droids? they're hard to beat.\n\nBrute force, smack em with rockets. 1 takes down the shield another scraps him. The other reasonable way to deal with them is a good body shot while they first setup or are on the roll. They have horrible turn rates though so you could flank them like GlobalStrike said\n\nThat being said there are certain places which you can hold indefinitely with a single destroyer droidPress G to change your secondary weapon to Recon Droid. Right click to do your secondary attack and you willl then be in control of the recon droid. Fly it to where you want to do the orbital strike. Right click, You will hear beeping. A few seconds later, laser bolts will come out of the sky to the spot your droid was. If you want, you can switch back to your character (by scrolling the mouse wheel) right after you right click so you can actually watch the bombardment.\n\nStarfighters especially. Do *not* use the mouse except to pitch up or down or to fine-tune your aim. If you need to turn, use the W and D keys because they provide a much tighter turning arc than the mouse. In addition, there's no point in blazing around the map at full throttle. Starfighters always move forward unless you close throttle (S key) and put it into a hover, so using full throttle (W key) will usually just launch you off the map. Open it up only when you need to make a quick escape.\n\nPersonally, I find first-person/in cockpit view the easiest way to pilot vehicles and starships, except the Snowspeeder when you need to keep an eye on your tow cable.\n\nNearly all of the rocket launchers can 'lock on' to large targets like vehicles and spacecraft. Hold your crosshair over the target until a pair of red lines appear. If you don't, your shots will probably miss.\n\nIf you see a hovering \"gun\" hologram, you can use a pilot's fusion cutter to build a turret there. Fusion cutters can also repair busted droids, turrets, startships, and vehicles.\n\nnow, can anyone tell me the difference between concussion, EMP, and standard grenades? Especially on characters that have two types? Why do I care? They all seem to do damage and don't have any special status effects.\n\nand the clone jettrooper is very good at taking out groups of droids, but its ammo is very limited so keep your eyes out for ammo powerups dropped by fallen friends/foes (the black boxes w/a red highlight)\n\nIf you are sniping.... remember the AI is stupid.\nIf the AI you are trying to hit is far away and moving, dont worry too much about hitting him coz if you get close he will stop.\nThen just headshot away, and watch those kills rack up.\n\nStormtroopers (and others similar) will roll after the first shot... and then stand still. Generally different troops act slightly differently, but you learn quick enough and can pick them off.\n\nIf you are going on as a grunt, the Z key is your friend.\nZoom in, strafe and aim for the head. About 6 shots at most should finish them off.\n\nIf the crosshair is blue, then you are probably out of range, as soon as it goes red blast away. Usually they kinda of stop, or roll and stop, after thats its candy from a baby.\n\nA lot of people on-line are using auto-aim, which is a really bad idea. You can identify these people easily by watching their laser blasts - When a target stays across their line of sight, their shots will temporarily track the new target.\n\nIt is almost impossible to get good head shots when auto-aim is on. Attack these people mercilessly.\n\nOriginally posted by treemonster not actually a bug or an exploit. maybe not very honourable or balanced but...\n\nIt doesn't seem like an exploit to me. I mean why should one weapons system overheat a totally seperate system?\n\nIf you had a second person in it you'd be firing double firepower at the same time anyway (rather than alternating fire, which you could do as well if you wanted to).\n\nIn \" real life\" it would just be like a soldier dodging from one set of controls to another (easy to do in an AT-ST, harder to do in an AT-TE).\n\nAs to how to switch, on the PC just roll the mouse wheel up or down to switch positions.\n\nDroidekas are very easy to kill, just nail them while they are rolling or with shields down (vehicle guns or rockets work great) or just nail them with explosives or vehicle guns and one shot will take out their shields, second one blows them to bits. I suppose they would be hard to kill if you were just a lone infantry man with a blaster, but still. The only other place I engage them as in choke points (where multiples can be annoying). Just drop a grenade or two in front of them and run for cover. One for shield, one after the shield is down.\n\nto take out droidekas i get cover behind something so i can just see a bit of the sheild but it cant see me then when the shield goes down KA-BLOWWIE i blow it up, oh yeah and when a bot takes your starship if you jump and press enter if it has just taken off ypu steal it ( i think this also works in splitscreen with the other player but i may be wrong"

This is mostly Astro Trains and Munitions Boosters in the base game, but other specialized ships in The Zenith Remnant also use dark matter attacks.\n\nThe most common use for them is against Astro Trains -- on the higher difficulties, Astro Trains will come right into your planets, and they will make short work of most turrets or heavy defenses that you would typically use to barricade a wormhole. This can make proper wormhole defense impossible unless you destroy some Astro Train Stations to reroute the trains -- or unless you unlock and then build some Counter-Dark-Matter Turrets to protect your other turrets.\n\nNote: These were previously called Counter-Negative-Energy Turrets (and the attacks were called Negative Energy attacks), but this was confusing terminology, so it was changed."

If you put your starting knowledge into one or the other (I usually go bombers), then that should clear it off for you, but at a pretty high cost. Be prepared to send multiple waves against the superfortress, most likely, and also have other ships on hand to protect your bombers from anything else the AI might send to take them out (since the superfortress itself isn't much good against those bombers).\n\nAlso, you can use a strategy of misdirectng the superfortress around, if you have to, while you destroy the rest of the planet. If you can survive long enough (leading the SF on a wild goose chase if possible), detroying the guard posts and then the command station of the planet will leave that superfortress without the support of any of the other AI ships, thus making it vastly easier to just whittle down with a bunch of bombers, which are hardly hurt by it at all.\n\nDepending on the strength of the rest of the forces at the planet, taking out a superfortress early in the game is definitely possible, but it's costly and tricky. I usually just try to go around those worlds unless there is something worth capturing on them (as is the case in your situation, unfortunately).\n\nCutting down the supply on a super fortress world seems a good idea to neutralize it, but it can be tricky if that world is surrounded by 3 or more worlds. Teleport Stations, Raptors and some other units are pretty good in that purpose."

      "text": "Dieing\" of WH-Space\n\nOkay, here's the situation:\n\nOne of our alliance corps have set up a POS in a WH-space. One of their members claims to know that WH spaces start \"dieing\", when POSes are set up in it, meaning the rate of sig-spawning decreases over time. He can't provide any evidence off the internet, he only bases his theory on his observation. He persists on his opinion, that before they set up their POS they had \"at least 20 sigs anytime\", while now they're \"lucky when we get 5 sigs a day\".\n\nRe: \"Dieing\" of WH-Space\n\nIIRC the harder a system is farmed in general the fewer sigs respawn in a WH. The POS is just an assisting factor and people who have a POS in system would rationally spend more time in that WH farming the sigs.\n\nRe: \"Dieing\" of WH-Space\n\nBeen said before, saw some discussions on that topic on eve-o (I think) a year ago. Unless things changed recently, it's not true.\nThen again, most people tend to not look at their own system wrt farming W-space, but are interested in (and depend on) their static destination for farming.\n\nRe: \"Dieing\" of WH-Space\n\nIt works the same as anomalies.\nIf you go to a deserted system you will often find a lot of signature, and i mean a lot, however you're not likely to find them in highly traveled systems.\nWhen you farm a WH you start doing the signatures on the system and said signatures start spawning in less populated WH's.\nIn short, setting up a POS on a system doesnt decrease the appearance of signatures, you being there and farming everyday does.\nDO what you're supposed to do: Jump to adjacent systems and do the signatures there\n\nRe: \"Dieing\" of WH-Space\n\nInitiating (or landing, there isn't any good way to test a difference) warp to a signature does indeed force that signature into existence. From that point, it will begin its normal set of completion triggers, such as site completed (via killing a certain npc/object), warping out (certain DED sites do this), or time expired. POS has no impact whatsoever on the sites you find in a system, but your presence will. By completing sites, they will go and respawn elsewhere. Over time, sites will naturally accumulate in systems that nobody goes to, as opposed to where everybody is constantly scanning. Non-activated sites last considerably longer that activated sites, so an empty system will build up a reservoir of them.\n\nAt any rate, you chose the wormhole for its statics, not the sites there on your move-in day. Think of those as a homecoming present, not the reason to set up the pos.\n\nRe: \"Dieing\" of WH-Space\n\nAs has already been said, POS in system has no effect on spawn rate for new sigs.\n\nAnother option to the \"farm your static!\" stuff that has already been mentioned is just living in a c6. Due to the high activity rate there and relatively few number of C6 systems, the local spawn rate there is quite good. We usually have been 3 and 5 anoms actively being worked each day, with occasional spikes up to 9 or 10 when particularly lucky."

      "text": "I've read over the bit on the Webway in The Soul Reaver and then, loving what I saw there, I even picked up the Dark Eldar Codex. However, the bits on the Webway left me wondering about a few things.2) Are there natural points of access to the Webway, or are they all constructs?\n\n3) Is it possible to mount a Webway portal in a starship? Would this be a reasonable xenos component?\n\n4) Is it reasonable to have something like a Wraithgate (a man-portable Webway portal that can be used to move individuals and even small vehicles), and what would be the Availability?\n\n5) Can the Webway be accessed from the Warp? Would a Gellar Field interfere with using a Wraithgate (assuming that the Wraithgate was aboard the ship with the field up)?The Webway is typically depicted as having an atmosphere - Eldar forces of all kinds often deploy from the Webway on foot directly onto a planetary surface.\n\nHappyDaze said:\n\n2) Are there natural points of access to the Webway, or are they all constructs?\n\nThe Webway itself is an artificial creation, an evolution of the Warp Gate Network of the Old Ones. The points of access are thus all artificial, though that doesn't necessarily require an obvious physical gateway.\n\nHowever, webway tunnels can become damaged by psychic pressure, and part of the network was ruined during the Fall of the Eldar, resulting in sections exposed to the Warp, which are typically sealed off as soon as it is detected, by the Harlequins who guard the Webway.\n\nHappyDaze said:\n\n3) Is it possible to mount a Webway portal in a starship? Would this be a reasonable xenos component?\n\nAs your next question notes, Webway gates come in a variety of sizes. I imagine that many Eldar vessels employ webway gates as a means of deploying troops to and from a planetary surface, evacuating in case of emergency, and other situations. All Eldar Craftworlds contain a multitude of webway gates, ranging from massive ones able to transport starships, to those large enough only to convey individual travellers on foot.\n\nHappyDaze said:\n\n4) Is it reasonable to have something like a Wraithgate (a man-portable Webway portal that can be used to move individuals and even small vehicles), and what would be the Availability?\n\nI'd say Unique at best, as such items would be extremely difficult to find in the best of situations. I know of only one vehicle within the background that contains a Webway Gate - the Eldar Storm Serpent, a Super-Heavy Gravtank. I'd avoid trying to install them on any other vehicles.\n\nHappyDaze said: webway is a form of permanent gellar field within the warp. I doubt if a normal gellar field would effect it at all. Imperial gellar fields are like a tent compared to the reinforced bunker of a webway Cornwallis said:\n\nI've always been interested in the webway as well but my information is limited to… this thread and \"its a network of fast travel faster than warp jumps…\n\ncan someone give me a quick summary of what they are, look like etcetera? sounds like inverted tunnel reality as of this thread, but again I'm very ill informed.\n\nI try to think of it as a form of controlled wormhole, but with multiple entrances and exits, sprawling throughout the immaterium, generally not caring at all which way that reality chooses to twist. The Webway allows you to travel through the condensed space of the immaterium without risk, but with the caveat that the locations are fixed to gateways.\n\n\"It's never too late to panic.\" ~ Popular Valhallan folk saying\n\nSince so many seem to have trouble understanding Technology, Machine SpiritsMechanicus: Link.There is a point in \"Lure of the Expanse\" where the players can navigate their ship through a webway portal. Directly speaking this does not adversely affect themIt doesn't obey the natural laws of reality, because it isn't part of reality.\n\nA Gellar Field is a simple concept in its own right - a pocket of reality to ward a vessel from the corrosive un-substance of the Warp. The Webway is more than less than that - it is safe, in its own right, from the toxic influence of the raw Immaterium, yet it is also beyond the physical reality that most beings call home, and contains its own dangers and hazards to the unwary because of its extradimensional nature. The Eldar have long known many of the mysteries of the Webway, enough to be wary of its perils and watchful for them enough to navigate around them, but few know the Webway as the Harlequins of the Laughing God do, and they are loathe to speak even a fraction of its secrets.\n\nIn short… it's an extradimensional labyrinth realm, eternally shifting. The petty nuisances of the material universe need not apply.\n\nFgdsfg said:\n\nThe Webway isn't purely a travel medium, though - the Eldar have had settlements within the Webway for tens of thousands of years at least, most of which have long since been fused with the Dark City of Commorragh and now sit beneath the light of stolen suns. Further, the smaller passages and gateways are actually far more common than the ones large enough to accomodate starships. Enough of the Webway is habitable to unprotected life that creatures actually inhabit it.\n\nThe heart of the Webway concept is closer to myth than science fiction. It is a place, but not one within physical reality. It is the paths that Eldritch beings use to step between the stars, their passage unseen and unnoticed by man. It is a gloaming place, bathed in perpetual half-light, home to tricksters, sages and bloodthirsty monsters alike. It is one of the wonders of the galaxy, the result of science so advanced that lesser creatures call it magic, and sorcery so complex that it may as well be the work of gods, so incomprehensible is its scale and the splendour of its construction.\n\nOn a related note, I like to keep more than a little mystery with the Eldar - they're ancient, cruel and inscrutable beings of alien intellect and an inhuman capacity for extremes of emotion, whose science seems as witchcraft to the men of the Imperium, and whose magic is subtle and potent in equal measure. As Phil Kelly and Jes Goodwin mentioned in their designer notes for the Dark Eldar revamp, the Dark Eldar are the nasty, nightmarish side of fairy stories… the impossible, spectral beings who appear in the night and spirit away friends and family members, who thirst for terror and sup upon agony. I like the concept, and I really feel that the Eldar as a whole benefit from being a little more \"capricious fae beings\" and a little less \"pointy-eared aliens\". They move in silence and secrecy between worlds along glittering paths that only they can walk, arrive unheralded and depart as suddenly, weave spells of misdirection and misfortune and their motives are seldom known to any but themselvesThey move in silence and secrecy between worlds along glittering paths that only they can walk, arrive unheralded and depart as suddenly, weave spells of misdirection and misfortune and their motives are seldom known to any but themselves.\n\nIME, that kind of thing tends to fall apart when they are placed into the role of PCs.\n\nOn an unrelated note: Yes, there must be some kind of atmosphere in the webway. The Dark Eldar Codex mentions several nasty beasties entering the webway through a splintered portal and spreading to other worlds.\n\nIME, that kind of thing tends to fall apart when they are placed into the role of PCs.\n\nIsn't that what PC's are best at though?\n\nThe players come up with a 'plan' and hilarity ensuesGreat concepts to know. I hadn't the foggiest idea on what the Webway was. Don't know to much about the Eldar myself, other than they are old, created the all seeing eye by accident, and don't appear to like procreating allot"

At launch, there will be limited visual changes to the Mechs for many of the stated reasons in this thread. We do have a visual solution in place for the hardpoints, but it's going to be a race to the finish, and it may slip into open beta. Like MWLL we each variant has a custom look.\n\nSo, new question:\nCan you go in to more detail on mercenaries? Will there be a player cap on Mercenary Units? Will the unit be able to have more than one contract at a time? Will there be any ability to \"upgrade\" the Merc HQ?\n\nWhat will the basic, first to be implemented game mode be for the start of the beta? Is it really going to be a team destruction plus base capture like in World of Tanks? If so, what specific game play elements do you see this introducing, or removing, and why is this desirable?\n\nThis is a two part question, will there be a training\\sandbox server for a)testing loadouts, b)practicing with units, c) doing War Games with said units. The second part is that in the training part, can we practice all of the different game modes, and perform actions expected of us in said game modes (ala perform a practice combat drop)?\n\nMy wife doesn't like FPS games, but she does like playing Real Time Stragety, how viable will she be guideing me, and our team while not having to totally engage in combat, sure there'll be some, but being a command unit, will she be able to watch from the hills, and shoot missles when needed, either through non line of sight, or something along those lines.\n\nAfter reading a multitude of topics I realize that is not yet clear the following themes (for which I'd like to give a clear answer to all future interested ) :\n\n1) will we be able to play in the near future with Periphery Realms or Deep Periphery ???As moderator I noticed some interest in this possible game choice.It would make the game very \"varied\".\n\n2) many future mechwarriors are interested in using mechs which unfortunately are part of the list \"unseen\".Will we have some chance to see them in the near future in the game???At least for the most famous as the Rifleman, Warhammer, Marauder,Longbow, Archer and many other  .\n\nwe were first promised two questions but then only one was answered and theres SO MANY people asking GOOD question,I want more answers,if someone actualy tried to answer all good questions here it wouldnt take more than hour at max"

I remember it saying (probably the manual) that while the Hiigarans had managed to reduce the space required for the ion cannon, it still took an entire frigate chassis to hold it.\n\nWell, the developers decided that an anti-frigate/desty platform was needed, so they put the code together with the graphics so that all the \"0's\" and \"1's\" worked properly so that the Ion Plat worked w/out a frigate chassis.\n\nThen the writers failed in their technobabble mumbojumbo to get rid of the contradiction, or at least to properly explain it away.\n\nHere's what the Prima guide says about the Ion Gun Platform,\n\n\"A more advanced version of the Gun Platform, the Ion Beam Platform unleashes four high-energy ion beams at any Frigate or Capital Ship within range. Once deployed, it cannot be moved again.\"\n\nThe Prima guide does not say that the Ion Beam mechanism required a minimum of a frigate chassis, though I recall that from the original HW manual.\n\nHowever, the guide that comes with the game does mention that after a century, . . . the size of the ion cannon has been reduced, it still takes a frigate chassis to house the enormous array. . . \"\n\nPerhaps there is new technology to make the platform Ion Cannon smaller but less powerful (which I believe the stats show), And in the rush to get the game out the door, the Technobabble Mumbo Jumbo specialists at Relic forgot to address the platform Ion issue. . .\n\nbtw, I think it's because they're 4 really small and weak (compared to other Ion cannons) Ion Cannons, and that's how they fit on. But how would that explain the Hiigaran BC? Hm, maybe they have the main array underneath, and it shoots up and out the turret?\n\nI think that after 100 years they could've found a way to reduce the size, while sacraficing firepower. Compared to the ion frigate and BC, the ion plat's beams are not very strong. They could just be a cross between the pulsar and a full ion beam tooI find it rather unconstructive for forum posters to try to rewrite the HW2 manual. I believe that should be left up to the development team.\n\nPerhaps it's just that the wording that I find unconstructive. Instead of asking how something works or why this or that was included/excluded, one should properly ask how the decision to include/exclude this or that affected game play.\n\nWe are not the fiction writers for this game, and IMO, we don't have any business spouting off explanations like we're authorities on HW2 ships and science. Statements like \"The heat sinks on the platforms are modified to allow the extreme heat of an ion cannon to be dissipated.\" are complete and utter Bullsh!t when it comes from someone on these boards. Explanations like that are for the develpement team, and if they don't address it, we can't make it up.\n\nFor other threads, threads that ask why this or that won't work in HW2 or why this or that was included/excluded; questions like, \"Why doesn't the MS have supercapital ship build capability?\", \"Why are the MS guns just lousy pea shooters?\" or \"How does HS work?\" the aswers do not lie in explanations about the technology of the races or real world physics. The answers are not to be found in the imagined \"structure\" of the MS, or any kind of discussion as if the MS were real and the game had to obey real world physics and such.\n\nThe answers to questions like those lie in decisions made by the development team, and how they imagined that HW2 game play should be carried out and how their fiction writers address them in the official game documentation. The answers regarding why some ship does or does not do this or that, or how HW2 hyperspace works are not based upon the technological limitations of the Higarrans. . . they are based upon decisions regarding game play made by the develpement team. After the game play is set, then the fiction writers can make up a technobabble mumbojumbo explanation regarding how it works.\n\nThis thread seems to be pointing out a discrepancy in the documentation, and I can play along with that. It seems to me that the initial post on this thread actually asked the question in a somewhat construtive way, and doesn't step over the line of trying to bring real world explanations or made up HW2 fiction into the game. However, it opens the door to people on these forums to make up explanations - which is a realm for the development team, IMO.\n\nI agree that is is a flaw in the game documenation. But we'll have to live with that flaw, becuase I seriously doubt we'll get any kind of revision to the official documenation.\n\nBTW, while I find HW fiction to be less than great prose, that is an area where a person can elaborate on the hows and whys. But, it's a world in another forum on these and other boards. You won't find me posting in them criticising an author's elaborations for the purpose of game related fiction. That's a whole different ballgame.\n\nactually, what's all these talk about binary coding and stuff? computer programs aren't programmed by 0s and 1s, they're programmed by a set of coded instructions......\n\nBut it all compiles into \"0's\" and \"1's\" in the end, doesn't it?\n\nOriginally Posted by Progenitor\n\nand if the developers don't address the open issues in the game, its up to the community to address it, so we have a right to make up our own reasonings for those open issues...\n\nI certainly disagree. Who gave us the authority to re-write the HW2 manual?\n\nIt's clear to me that we have no such authority, and we'll have to live with certain deficiencies in the plot and in the technobabble mumbo jumbo.\n\nIt's fine to point out clear discrapancies, like the Ion Plat vs. Ion frigate issue.\nBut it's not for us to try to explain it away. Such explanations can always be rebutted and argued. If the explanation comes from Relic, or a member of the development team, then, to me, that would be gospel.\n\nI might modify my position a bit - We could suggest possible explanations, with the caveate that everything we offer with regard to explanations are unofficial and not to be considered a true explanation. I would think that such wording should be posted with each suggestion.\n\nSuch as my reasoning that the platforms are underpowered compared to the frigates - thus they can be on a platform, not a frigate chassis. And the BC Ion Turrets could be explained away by having the mechanism for the Ion Cannon in the belly of the BC and some sort of \"beam conduction\" explain how the beam is shot through a rotating turret. That would cetainly take into account some of the BC's vast size. But those are speculative and not to be taken as truth.\n\nWe do have the right to make things clearer for ourselves and others, if it is written or not. I for one don't understand where the hell you got the idea we or somebody else would want to re-write the manual. Cause we're not doing that by far.\n\nIt's a plot hole. leat it be one. there really isn't much point in arguing about it. I could also say that the ion plats are based on cata MBF iion pulse things. That's another possibility. Albeit a worse one than a plot hole.\n\nIgnoring all that more recent crap, talking about plot holes isn't really serious issue to be addressed as far as I'm concerned. It's a game, not a movie. It would be nice if there weren't so many but it's not like the plot of HW2 would be a particularly stellar one even if it didn't have holes. I just think it's fun to nitpick sometimes. Well, I guess it's technically stellar but I meant \"good.\"\n\nRemember, it's a game, not a history textbook. It doesn't really matter if one, or two, or three little things are out of place. But, don't plot holes and mistakes make this world more fun? We feel proud for noticing a mistake and like pointing it out. Then we get to pick on the producers and think of all the ways to fill it up!\n\nWell Ill say something to the original topic of the ion cannons not this binary crap so 0 to that.\n\nIn cataclysm (argh run i mentioned cataclysm) the multibeamers used coiled ionbeam arrays to fire more weaker beams. Now with that techmology you would think they could have improved that onto the frigate chasis and maybe have two turreted ion beams??\nI assume the coild fire mechanism would be used on the BC to fire it through the turret.\nAnd i thought that the higgy Destroyer was gonna have two ions on the front, meanies with their torpedoes\n\nI guess one thing that I liked about Cataclysm was that the game had some real wildcards. The obvious ones are the Siege Cannon and the Infection Beam. Both were tough weapons to get with certain risks, and for opposing players, both were counter-able. But if you were going to just go for a big fleet and do nothing else, you'd find all the ships in the world could be either torn apart by one cannon explosion, or stolen from you by a well timed infection.\n\nFurthermore, the crystals could be used for mucho RUs or as deadly bombs that could ruin a fleet if not dealt with in a sensible and adroit manner. To me, nebulae hardly make up for that, and in HW2, if you build up your fleet, there is no way for an out resourced and out-produced opponant to win - it's just a matter of time.\n\nI'm not saying that things from Cataclysm should be in HW2. Far from it. But I would like to have seen twist in HW2 multiplayer where an outproduced player can use clever tactics to turn the tide of battle and win the game. Currently, I simply don't see that this possible like 98% of the time.\n\nFinally, for both HW1 and Cata, with multiple production lines in each build capable ships, it allowed a player to counter a offensive effectively and relatively quickly, while at the same time working toward their own offensive action.\n\nI wonder if HW2 could have benefitted from multiple production lines by allowing a player to get bombers out to counter the BC they see coming out of the shipyard across the map?\n\nThe final point is paraphrased from one of my clanmates that, unfortunately, does not play HW2. You see, he liked micromanagement. Not FS, or any other micromanagement exploits, but things like setting up a supported corvwall, or clever use of frigate support and other things like that. While I recognize that there are some micromanagement aspects to HW2, I don't know that we can say that it is truly micromanagement intensive.\n\nWhy do I type this? I guess it's just to expound upon my thoughts on what makes HW2 not quite as gripping in multiplayer as HW1 or Cata was.\n\nperhaps some weapons systems at the VERY vulnerable pasrt of the BC...the part between the front Arbiter cannons and the ion turret...\nmaybe some torpedo launchers would be nice? or flsk cannons up and down the hull...\n\nOT and long, clarification of Assembler\n\nOriginally Posted by NemesisChiken\n\nNo, it all compiles down to the CPU instruction set (assembler), it's only STORED in \"0's\" and \"1's\"\n\nBAWK !!\n\nNo, it doesn't.\n\nThe CPU instruction set is simply strings of 1 or 0 (two states of voltage, present or not), each bit corresponding to switching some part of the die on or off.\nI have a little experience here, as at uni we made a simulated 8bit computer with 512bytes of memory and five registers of which one was wired to some input mechanism. There was no control unit (which is among other things instruction storage) so they all had to be entered manually (otherwise known as microcoding). From memory, there was something like 20-30 switches that activated various features, like a cross-bus gate, shifter, adder, registers, comparator, memory, inverter etc. We used unlimited size instructions as a CISC machine does.\n8 bit values were entered into the input register and manipulated using the switches.\n16-32bit numbers could be used too, thanks to the memory, as there was enough registers to do this.\n\nA typical sequence would be to enter the value, open the input register (registers always output, but must switched on to input) to capture it, clear the input. Open the first or second xbus gate to send it down to the ALU (imagine 2 parallel vertical data busses, data always going straight down. If a xbus gate was on, it would allow data to come onto the bus from the left from one of the five registers. Each register had it's own xbus gate on either bus. The top of bus1 was a constant 00000001 input, and 0 on bus2).\nThen the latch of the corresponding bus was opened and the value stored (a latch is a register directly on the bus that captures data and presents it to the ALU), and the corresponding ALU input was opened (there was two, one for each bus so that you could add). We then want to multiply it by 2, so we do a left shift (which in binary is equivalent and had a specific function code in the ALU switch settings), moving all bits to the left, and adding a '0' bit to the right end. Then it goes to the single ALU output which is switched on, and back up to the registers which were arranged vertically to the left of the main bus. It was then accepted into any available register and the ALU output was switched off. Next instruction please.\n\nBasically Assembler isn't the CPU instruction set, it is an english-like version of microcode with a 1:1 correspondance to the microcode instructions, meaning for every instruction the CPU supports, there is one Assembler instruction.\nThis makes it easy and fast to compile, but most importantly, it makes a much better programming environment than microcoding. Higher level languages like C++ and Java take this further, allowing simple (EG: Math.Random()) phrase to represent hundreds or thousands of Assembler/Microcode instructions.\n\nThat's why I put OT in the title But seriously folks, them frigates are great.....\n\nMy opinion is that the ion frigates should have some small cannons as well (reduce ion cannon machinery=room for more stuff....) or limited anti-fighter turrets of some sort, or it should be a turreted beam, or something more than the HW1 model.\nThe torpedo frigate and flak frigate are about right, although I beleive that there should still be an Assault frigate for the Hiigarans.\nDestroyers should have ion beams or anti-fighter torpedoes.\n\nMaybe the Vagyr should have a light tactical carrier that carries 5-8 wings, has 2 anti-fighter beams or flak turrets and 2 medium mass drivers, is fast and cheap, fairly sturdy, no building capability, so relies on a real carrier for replenishment. It fits with a more offensive style of warfare.\nIt sounds great to me, but it would really work well with a fuel limitation on fighters (like a more capable support frigate). It would be awesome for resource defense. They could be what warps in in some SP missions instead of fully fledged carriers that are doomed to die, warping out again for reinforcements.\nAnd then they should probably have a standard Taiidani style forward firing Ion frigate, seeing as Taiidani elements are apparently now Vagyr.\n\nthe ion frigate should have a flak cannon turret somewhere on its hull, the flak frigate should have a weapon system that is good against capital ships (delayed burst cannons?) and the torpedo frigate should have some hull defense guns, or even a plasma bomb launcher turret...Assault frigate should have like 4 kinetic cannons, and maybe 2 plasma bombs(homeworld variant) or even one with pulsars and torpedoes...\n\nthe vaygr light carrier sounds like a beefed up version of a support frigate...\n\nI like the idea of the Vaygr assault carrier. As for mounting all those guns on all ships frigate size +, that would not be good. I would simply suggest adding point defense lasers like the bc has. That should give all bigger ships better defense.\n\n*insert a large chunk of sarcasm here* I think that we should make one ship, that does a jagabillion damage, and is twice as powerful as a bc, and has every damn weapon possible on it and if it explodes, eveyone dies, etc. etc. etc. *end the large chunk of evily good sarcasm* Haha, newbs said this once too."

      "text": "MODERATORS\n\nI finally got the Crystal B. I never really tried to get weapons, they fell in my lap. I was so busy boarding with my 3 Crystal guys while a Rockman piloted and an Engi covered repairs, that I never needed them except for Zoltan/automated ships, but I usually just jumped away from those.\n\nI managed to just barely survive the rebel flagship, but it was on easy. I Teleported two Crystals in to each weapon, killed the crew and broke the weapon. Then I had them come back, heal up. Then all 3 straight into the shield room and start piling on. This created enough hell that my drone and single hull laser could put some hurt on (the drone always put its first shot right on my guys though ಠ_ಠ\n\nThe FTL wiki suggests putting them in the med bay, and that's what I tried at first. I ended up doing something dumb though and got trapped with a bunch of crew in there with them while lockdown was on. I had to throw a heal bomb on them, and then when i next struck at the shields, that was the last crew member. the AI became active and started repairing everything.\n\nIn the end I just spammed lasers on the weapons while my crystals routinely dropped wrenches in the shields' cyclotron and my drone took care of the rest. They went down with the ship as the drone gave an unexpected double burst for the last health bar.\n\nI feel like my strategy was unwieldy, and in level 2, the time it takes to teleport to the shields system, kill the guy, kick the shields, then teleport back is unsafe due to all of the drones flying around.\n\nAlways leave the dude in the burst laser compartment alive. He wont break level 3 shields, and he cant repair the rest of the ship. Destroy the other weapons if you need.\n\nSend all boarders into the medbay in phase 1 after the weapons are down, with the Crystal people, lock the room down ASAP. You need that medbay down. Once thats done, its easy to murder the rest of the crew. They lose their doors in phase 2, which makes boarding easier. On phase two, take out the weapons, leaving the laser guy again. Then parade around the ship taking out drones, shields, engines etc. Dont destroy oxygen because then the AI triggers.\n\nPretty much all of this. I played two games tonight, both with the Crystal B, both wins (normal). If you play this ship right it is a piece of cake. Having four boarders makes it even easier, but you can get away with three (or two if the rest of your ship is setup well).\n\nI learned about the oxygen on the flagship the hard way. I was so focused on just destroying every system for XP I wasn't paying attention to what I was destroying. Almost lost my boarders when they suddenly started suffocating, then the laser room guy died and the AI took over. I did make it to phase 3, but then I couldn't even get through the zoltan shield because the AI dodge is amazing. Having the pilot room empty is a HUGE advantage when there's no AI.\n\nYeah good point. I wasn't really thinking about it, I just wanted to max out my boarders for some reason, probably because my maxed boarders died from a stupid mistake in sector 7. It was kind of fun going from room to room breaking stuff."

I really dont have anything myself except being small, no countermeasures and likely nothing heavier than light AA armaments.\n\nThey are pirate launc and piratemothership in the DBs. At least one ANW scenario specifies as victory condition for the pirate side the small amount of 1% damage on civilian vessels as representatite of the capture of the civilian vessel by the pirates.\n\nIt's not that hard to do in ANW. There is a certain amount of abstractness involved since it's really hard to visualize anything around the horn of Africa to be a 'safe zone'. Usually convoys only travel with one escort so a massed attack would generate some results. Co-ordinating such an attack would be something else. Either way, it may be better to attack in an area less likely to expect it."

An equal solution would be to make it self-destruct after the ship's target is destroyed.

Why not make a missile that is a ship...\n\nHeres my (untested) theory on what you could do:\n\nIf you open a .miss file, you'll find that you can change both the controller type and the build type for a missile. So, essentialy, if you change the controll type to \"ship\" and make it buildable and have the missile use the same .hod file as a ship does, you essentialy have a contolable, one use ship/controlable missile/raming frigate.\n\nRanger\n\n24th Oct 03, 7:26 PM\n\nRetroboy: that's exactly what I had in mind. :)\n\nthesamonthemoon: Hmm, sounds interesting. I'll test it some time soon and see what happens. However, I don't think it'll work because then you'd have to give it a weapon, otherwise it won't be able to target and therefore ram something. If you give it a weapon, then it won't attempt to ram, since it'll try to fire instead. Oh well, I'll see what happens.\n\nthesamonthemoon\n\n24th Oct 03, 7:44 PM\n\nGive it a .wepn file... but dont actualy use the weapon on any ships. That way it's essentialy a buildable missile. Also you could make a weapon \"hit\" affect. For an example of this see vgr_concusionmissilelauncher.wepn, vgr_smallmissileburst.wepn, and vgr_smallmissile.wf (weapon effects file in data/scripts/weaponfire/). That way you can make it create an explosion on impact.\n\nI'll test this out too.

Call it the Super Ion Frigate. This ship's weapon is much more powerful than the standard ion frigate, but conversely is also much more unstable, and thus has a chance of self-destructing and damaging/destroying the frigate as a result. Is such a design possible as of yet?\n\nBakuras\n\n26th Oct 03, 1:22 AM\n\nIf we can figure out how to get ships to self-destruct after an attack, then, yes, we can. It's as simple as having LUA run a random number through a function as a parameter. Say, on a 1 out of 10 chance, boom :)\n\nGentlemen, I think the answer to this question lies in finding out how to call up the scuttle script. There might be a way to call up a scuttle within the weapon file.\n\nIWAssassin\n\n26th Oct 03, 4:56 AM\n\nDoes the missile need to self-destruct?\n\nI dont know exactly what you're trying to do but assuming you want a missile that actually HITS the target, why not simply give it a weapon with a range of 1, a sphereburst with radius 20 [still small enough] and enough damage to destroy the missile in the process?\n\nSo missile X flies to target, and shoots wepn_bigboom. Bigboom is a sphereburst which not only damages the target ship, but due to friendly fire obliterates the missile.\n\nOf course if you want the missile to fire smaller missiles or an Ion Cannon, thats something else entirely.\n\nRanger\n\n26th Oct 03, 11:42 PM\n\n@IWAssassin: The problem is that a sphereburst effect doesn't damage any friendly ships. I tested this by making the radius 10000, with a damage of 100000. None of my nearby friendly ships got damaged in the least when this blast went off. So, that's a no-go.\n\nBakuras has the right idea, but we don't know how to do that, yet, it seems.\n\nBakuras\n\n26th Oct 03, 11:52 PM\n\nWe can as soon as we figure out how to activate the scuttle command via LUA. I tried the ship files, but no luck. Think it might be somewhere in the scripts folder, but I haven't come up with anything after some pretty extensive searching and a lot of LUA dumping :(\n\nRanger\n\n27th Oct 03, 9:32 AM\n\nOh well.

UNTIL THEY STARTED WINNING AND THEN THEY WEREN'T UNDERDOGS ANYMORE DURR.\n\nYo haters, Teak is right this time. Deal with itThe 'underdog' is usually whomever is getting the living shit beaten out of them. Numbers? Technically xdeath has more but SOLAR gets more in fleet - which brings you to inevitable conclusions about activity levels. Allies? Again, xdeath has more but SOLAR's are far far better (and one bomber fleet by WN and one by Goons don't count). Isk? I'm pretty certain both alliances are really fucking loaded. Supers? Death has more but doesn't put many in fleet, now yes Pl and NCdot are here but that doesn't seem to be stop SOLAR either (didn't you see those dead Nyx this morning?)\n\nSo yes, on paper xdeath has the advantages stacked in his favor but it's become painfully obvious that xdeath is simply that. A paper tiger. And SOLAR is most clearly not.

Solar was painted as the underdog due to xdeath's isk fountain/pile, supers, and numbers they could bring to a fight guess you haven't seen the salary of handegg players, and why every single university in the US has a handegg teamerm no, the underdog is generally the one people would expect to lose from the outset.\n\nSo you'd rather base your definition off the way things are supposed to be, not off reality? While I would disagree with that, you still have to reckon with the fact that by your definition xdeath are still the underdogs. I guarantee you if you'd asked Murzilka two months ago who would win in a war between xdeath and SOLAR he'd say xdeath would get a whooping.\n\nedit: New NFL record set by Brady @ Co with five touchdowns in the first half\n\nalso mad props to the 49ers\n\nThere's nothing worse than having a good idea for a post not being good enough to pull it off :negative:\n\nI guess you haven't seen the salary of handegg players, and why every single university in the US has a handegg team.Thats an old contract, last year, he got that much just as a signing bonus, the 'hand egg' payment rules are probably just as weird to you as the breaks they take, the salaries are staged over time in odd ways because the Teams are forced to function under an artificial cap on the salary, each team can only 'spend' so much on players per year.\n\nSo they structure the contracts to pay out silly sums over the course of a contract, and Manning is a bad example, due to team loyalties. He'll literally sign for nothing compared to his counterparts so the team can afford to keep him on board (even though they're going to trade him to avoid paying him a 28 million dollar singing bonus this year).\n\nSoccer salaries are more akin to how baseball is ran over here, and watching the movie Moneyball, even if you don't really like baseball, can give you some insight into how close they come (they have/had no cap).\n\nstadium in my piddly ass city maxes out at 84,000 and was filled to max in 2005. Get fuckedalso from reading wikipedia i understand NFL had a salary cap of $120 million per team 2011, which is obviously something only poor countries would do.\n\nThe hard Salary Cap is for the most part the reason the NFL is the only highly competitive professional sports league in the world. It's the reason soccer nor any other sport can supplant football in America, and its what make's the NFL the best pro league in the world. Nothing is more compelling than when a team can be 2-14 in 2009, and then be 10-6 2 years later and in the playoffs. The salary cap is what makes a game between 2 random teams(that aren't top 4 in the league) watchable and interesting, even if you aren't interested in them. Nothing is more boring, and more damaging to the sport, than having the same 3 or 4 teams dominate the league every single year just because they happened to be owned by richer people than the other teams. Man City's short rise to the top is a prime example of why the EPL sucks.\n\nP.S: playoffs, for you Europeans, is a thing in sports where the top teams from the regular season, get placed into a tournament to decideP.S: playoffs, for you Europeans, is a thing in sports where the top teams from the regular season, get placed into a tournament to decide'm sorry, I was unaware the Champion's league was a consistent professional league, with the same teams in it every year, like a normal pro league, rather than just a cup (I like the idea of Champion'sChampions league is not the same team each year,\n\nits the top 1-4 or less from the different national leagues depending on the Uefa ranks UK got like 4 teams, denmark 1 if they lucky 2\n\nThough you cant rly compare it to the playoffs of NFL or like, there simply to big a different in how the teams can afford shit as there are no rules about salary's and the like in EU,\n\nThe underdog is not the person that is losing but rather the person who the professionals assume will lose when ther is a fight. I think most people would have seen all the factors and assumed XiX would have won.\n\nSolar really suprised me though, and i think the PL/NCdot vs Stainwagon/Gypsie is a really good matchup. Too bad its just a proxy fight have genuinely no idea what you're on about but you seem to not really know anything about football, a sport I don't watch anymore or care about so whatever I guess.\n\nShut the fuck up eurofags before we come spread some freedom on your ass.\n\nHold me back Manny, if I have to correct one more European faggot on why soccer fucking sucks then I'm going to grab my spear tipped American Flag, and javelin the fuck out of the first weird looking pussy I see with an accent."

Most in the Inner Sphere were under the presumption that the unit was named \"Wolf's Dragoons\", which made logical sense since their leader was aptly named Jamie Wolf. However in the Blood of Kerensky Trilogy, I do believe Iron Horse is correct in identifying that it was Phelan Kell who made the connection. They weren't Wolf's Dragoons, they were Wolf Dragoons, and were therefore paying homage to their Clan origins.\n\nHaven't read that trilogy in a decade...so facts are a little blurry. However this Inner Sphere News cast is accurate, since at this time no one was aware of the Clans and therefore the Dragoons connection to them.\n\nWhile the name isn't really canon (it was never cited that it was the original name; indeed the unit's official name has always been Wolf's Dragoons), it was Phelan's thought after Natasha Kerensky revealed herself in full Wolf Clan regalia, \"They are not Wolf's Dragoons. They are the Wolf Dragoons.\"\n\nThat's okay. Phelan was really good at making leaps of logic based on symbolism.\n\nSince then it has become a sort of an in-joke. And like all jokes that you have to explain, the humor gets lost.\n\nIn any case, it's my fault for citing it in this time context, so please accept my apologies for the confusion."

Anyway, Im going to create some history,campagins etc so leave a comment on how it should go.\n\n_________________ The Captain spun around, but alas, the Hive tyrant was already there, and its Bonesword had begun the unstoppable descent towards him...\n\nNecrons.. simply cuz there are hardly any accounts of the two groups fighting other than in the BA/Necron codex where they allied together (DAAAAMMMM YOOOOU MATT WARD!!! *waves fist violently* )_________________ Just a single day - one more single day Inside this cage and I'll fade away I've lost my way I've lost my light I've lost the stars inside my night_________________ Realize every dark cloud is a smoke screen meant to blind us from the truth, and the truth is whether we see them or not - the sun and moon are still there and always there is light.\n\nThe green colour could be some form of biological / symbiotic mechanism / mutation in an effort to absorb the energy that sustains the necron machine.\n\nNow, I know nothing about the necron lore, but if they hive-fleet was able to consume this raw form of energy it might confer a certain glow as symbiotic parasites use the energy to form organic matter which is then consumed by the hive.... Similar to how leaf cutter ants take plant tissue (which they can not eat directly) and grow a fungus on them that they can ingest.\n\nThe necrons are a threat that are in the way and need to be dealt with by the hive fleet. Necessity dictates that the tyranids need to adapt to fuel the hive fleet for the next wave of galactic conquest.that they do but it has been noted that Tyranids normally avoid conflict with necrons\n\nQuote:\n\nWhat do the necrons use for a power source?\n\nthey use a highly advanced form of particle energy, gauss weapons have the ability to strip away molecules of a target in a matter of seconds hence why nids normally avoid conflict because they wouldnt be able to replace the mass expended, if it was a world where there were other target prey then yes they would end up in conflict, but the gauss weapon itself strips away all mass on a sub atomic level... consuming it would be incredibly dangerous, that and there's an entry in the necron codex about a character who gave some orks a small group of doomsday arcs... the orks ruptured the fuel cells and the entire planet collapsed (i think)\n\n_________________ Just a single day - one more single day Inside this cage and I'll fade away I've lost my way I've lost my light I've lost the stars inside my night\n\nI voted Tau, but the more I think about it, the more I agree with the majority that Necrons will make a good foe for your Hive Fleet. Tyranids typically avoid Necrons, and it'd be cool to see a Hive Fleet that actively hunts them down.\n\nyes i think, i don't know anymore (darn you matt ward *shakes fist*), mind you its partly cuz nids know they won't get much bio mass out of the fights.. there's a small tomb world in the macragge sub sector which behemoth avoided\n\nunless Tyranid evolved some way to absorb biomass on a sub atomic level that is\n\n_________________ Just a single day - one more single day Inside this cage and I'll fade away I've lost my way I've lost my light I've lost the stars inside my night\n\nthey use a highly advanced form of particle energy, gauss weapons have the ability to strip away molecules of a target in a matter of seconds\n\nHigh energy particles, eh? Like Photons and photosynthesis?! My point is that raw forms of energy are used by organisms to convert inert chemical matter into covalently bonded organic structures.\n\nLets say that on an jungle like tomb world a small hive fleet attacked and, in the process of stripping the vegetative life from the planet, the tyranid force encountered an indigenous form of life that was somehow able to absorb this raw gauss energy. This small scarab like creature would glow as the gauss energy was slowly released and absorbed by pockets of ultra dense chitin. Drawing basic elements from the rocks and dead litter of the scorched bedrock, these scarabs were able to replicate quickly and pose a real parasitic threat to the sleeping necrons.\n\nThe genetic makeup of this organism would be absorbed, bond with the hive fleet, and became actively inserted into the rippers of the great swarm.\n\nUnknown to the great psychic entity driving hive fleet pluto, this new organic process increased the metabolism of the modified organisms of the hive fleet. The ability to feed off of gauss energy stops becoming a simple alternate form of biomass to be absorbed - it becomes a necessity. The hive fleet is forced to feed on this power or become consumed by its own ravenous hunger for energy.\n\nIn order to survive, Pluto must search out the tomb worlds and consume them.\n\nThe rest of the hive fleets, seeing the pluto force as contaminated by the intoxicating need for this raw energy, will avoid the fleet entirely lest they too become infected."

      "text": "ship self-destruct after firing?\n\nI know that people talked about this previously in regard to making one-use ships to be used as missiles, but at the time I don't think anyone came up with a solution.\n\nSo, the question is, is it possible to make a ship self-destruct after it fires one time? An equal solution would be to make it self-destruct after the ship's target is destroyed. Or, can you make a ship take damage at the same time that it damages the enemy?\n\nThe other thing is to make sure it's auto-set to Passive so it will only fire at a target you specifically pick.\n\nI could see this being a really interesting way to implement \"living bomb\" ships - in other words, projectiles with huge warheads that are fired directly from the MotherShip. If you don't take it out by the time it gets within a certain range of the enemy, it converts to an untargetable missile. This could wreak HAVOC with resourcing operations.\n\nWhy make a ship that is a missile? Why not make a missile that is a ship...\n\nHeres my (untested) theory on what you could do:\n\nIf you open a .miss file, you'll find that you can change both the controller type and the build type for a missile. So, essentialy, if you change the controll type to \"ship\" and make it buildable and have the missile use the same .hod file as a ship does, you essentialy have a contolable, one use ship/controlable missile/raming frigate.\n\nthesamonthemoon: Hmm, sounds interesting. I'll test it some time soon and see what happens. However, I don't think it'll work because then you'd have to give it a weapon, otherwise it won't be able to target and therefore ram something. If you give it a weapon, then it won't attempt to ram, since it'll try to fire instead. Oh well, I'll see what happens.\n\nGive it a .wepn file... but dont actualy use the weapon on any ships. That way it's essentialy a buildable missile. Also you could make a weapon \"hit\" affect. For an example of this see vgr_concusionmissilelauncher.wepn, vgr_smallmissileburst.wepn, and vgr_smallmissile.wf (weapon effects file in data/scripts/weaponfire/). That way you can make it create an explosion on impact.\n\nthesamoon: it doesn't work, i tried it that way... they still aren't selectable, if you get it working let us know though.. you could have it's range on the weapon set to 1 - 5 or something and have the animation set to 'death' might work.\n\ni am not sure if it can be done, but you know how someone made a probe would would reduce the health and speed of local ships? Why dont have that sort of thing on your missle, only it would be activated durring its 'attack', to reduce ONLY the missles HP to 0%, that might do what you need.\n\nHere's anotherr thought: is there a way to give a ship a probability of self-destructing after attack?\n\nSay you have a generic super-weapon ship. Call it the Super Ion Frigate. This ship's weapon is much more powerful than the standard ion frigate, but conversely is also much more unstable, and thus has a chance of self-destructing and damaging/destroying the frigate as a result. Is such a design possible as of yet?\n\nIf we can figure out how to get ships to self-destruct after an attack, then, yes, we can. It's as simple as having LUA run a random number through a function as a parameter. Say, on a 1 out of 10 chance, boom\n\nGentlemen, I think the answer to this question lies in finding out how to call up the scuttle script. There might be a way to call up a scuttle within the weapon file.\n\nI dont know exactly what you're trying to do but assuming you want a missile that actually HITS the target, why not simply give it a weapon with a range of 1, a sphereburst with radius 20 [still small enough] and enough damage to destroy the missile in the process?\n\nSo missile X flies to target, and shoots wepn_bigboom. Bigboom is a sphereburst which not only damages the target ship, but due to friendly fire obliterates the missile.\n\nOf course if you want the missile to fire smaller missiles or an Ion Cannon, thats something else entirely.\n\n@IWAssassin: The problem is that a sphereburst effect doesn't damage any friendly ships. I tested this by making the radius 10000, with a damage of 100000. None of my nearby friendly ships got damaged in the least when this blast went off. So, that's a no-go.\n\nBakuras has the right idea, but we don't know how to do that, yet, it seems.\n\nWe can as soon as we figure out how to activate the scuttle command via LUA. I tried the ship files, but no luck. Think it might be somewhere in the scripts folder, but I haven't come up with anything after some pretty extensive searching and a lot of LUA dumping"

I'll probably find something better later)\n\n///EDIT: new cockpit///\n\n///EDIT2: the 'child' ship///\n\n///EDIT: young guardian///\n\n///EDIT: guardian (not yet fully implemented)///\n\nIt's a living ship, for use by the player.\nThe idea is that it's a ship that will grow in power as the player does, gaining new weapons and abilities. The ship's normal loadout isn't anything terribly fancy, and in fact looks a bit inferior in some areas to the stock playerships at first glance.\nPropose current starting loadout;\n-max 2 installable weapons [Looks like the freighter here]\n-max 4 installable devices total* [Falls short of everyone here]\n-starting cargo space 50 tons(?) [about on par with the sapphire]\n-max cargo space 120 tons(?) [only beats out the wolfen by a little bit]\n-speed .27c [a nice speed advantage, perfect for chasing down other fast gunships, only area where it soundly beats the others]\n-max armor mass 7 tons per seg [only ahead of the sapphire, and not by much]\n-25MW starting reactor [not too shabby here either...]\n\n* - not including pre-installed devices\n\nSo in conclusion, it looks like a rather sub-par ship on the surface, as that lack of device space REALLY hurts, and the speed and starting reactor simply aren't that big of a deal in the long run. The armor limit also looks uncomfortably tight…\n\nBut wait… What is this?\n\nYour armor… is healing? How can that be? You don't have patcher arms or a patch spider…\nSuddenly you realize that there is a whole lot more to this ship than meets the eye.\n\nThis is the living ship, a ship that is capable of not only self-repair over time, but also a number of other feats, such as growing new weapons, UI modules, learning and more!\nThis ship can: (Current idea list)\n- repair its armor over time [this ability increases with level]\n- grow new weapons (cannot be installed/uninstalled- they take 0 slots and are virtual. They can be internally disabled to prevent them from taking up space when cycling through weapons) [a new weapon is granted at certain milestone levels]\n- learn to target or display nearby friends and enemies, among other stuff [once again, granted with levels]\n- grow a little ship that can be upgraded as well (basically like a wingman) [this is granted at level 10, which is the highest realistically attainable level] – (a literal mothership)\n- improve its organic equipment by 'feeding' it items (different items have different levels of effect; ie, feeding armor to armor is optimal, but feeding it raw ores will yield a small improvement, though feeding it map roms will do nothing.)\n\nThe natural weapons of this ship can be made more powerful by feeding them various things, ranging from longzhu's, enhancers, fuel, even consumables!\n\nArmor can be installed like on any normal ship, though it can be healed by the ship; at first, this rate of healing is rather slow, but by feeding armor and fuel (or other items for less effect) to the organ that controls this ability, the rate of healing will be increased.\n\nYour cargo hold will grow over time up to its maximum; its growth is proportional to the growth of other parts of the ship. You can also spend one of your valuable device slots on a cargo hold, but there are other things that your slots would be better spent on.\n\nYour drive's thrust can also be grown over time; here though, the growth can be stimulated through feeding it fuel.\n\n~~~ Learning ~~~\n\nThe ship can learn to display more UI information over time, starting out with a UI like a normal ship [probably with new graphics though], but eventually gaining the ability to display things such as enhanced visual, targeting abilities, health of other ships and the like.\n\nSome skills learned are directly combat related; the ship can learn to tweak your shields to be slightly more effective against a certain weapon types for a short duration of time. It can learn to fire all the weapons on the ship (alpha-strike!) (though it exhausts the ship very quickly and consumes A LOT of power).\nThe list here is still under construction...\n\n~~~More stuff~~~\n\n~~~ Adventure Extension ~~~\n\nThank's to Betel, I got inspired to look into making an adventure extension...\n\nOnce it attains that level, give it psionic abilities for the referential lulzI actually do intend to make more variants of the wyvera ships (primarily for TX2 and the Adv Ext, though they will be released in a playership pack for vanilla as well), though this one is the foundation upon which I'm creating all the script"

I was wondering if anyone could explain a little bit on how to work it, or if someone has a link about it i would appreciate it.\n\nWell, more importantly, what is it about the combat system that throws you off. For the most part, the game is similar to something say like, Gears of War. Take cover and fire. IfIfVery well put. Just like any RPG certain skill sets and certain abilities complement each other more. Depending on what class you play as, everything will be different. And as you get further into the game, things become much more explanatory. Just remember: Everything has a weakness.

      "text": "Thursday, August 30, 2012\n\nLucky Thirteen?\n\nAn end to \"market spiking\" by reverting LP store prices to pre-inferno levels across all factions, and instead scaling the actual payouts based on the current tier of Warzone Control.\n\nThis is an interesting concept, as it would encourage more consistent WZ control, as opposed to spikes. What would make it further interesting if maintaining control was based more on activity VS LP dumping. Right now, although you need a minimum number of systems, you simply need to dump LP into I-HUBs to raise your level –what if the Warzone Control tiers were based on contestation levels instead, and encouraged plexing and warzone activity as opposed to LP dumps at all?\n\nAlso, it means that payouts earned by either side would be essentially worth the same amount –the winners would just have the opportunity to make more of it.\n\nAdjusting the aforementioned payout multipliers so that the losing faction still has a minimum viable income.\n\nPerhaps I'll be considered coldhearted for this, but I'm against catering to losers in any way. This is EVE, not Hello Kitty Online, and when someone starts talking about giving losers an income I get nervous that the EVE I've known and loved for five years is slowly getting lost somehow.\n\nIf you want more fun fighting, then FW needs to be split open and exposed to the rest of EVE. Major Factions winning and losing need to have more impact on the general public, as opposed to a close system that people can conveniently ignore. Even people within the militia can ignore it by moving outside the warzone and taking a completely hands off approach to sovereignty.\n\nSoftening the blow of losing is most certainly not going to motivate people to try to win. It's just going to make people even more comfortable in ignoring the sovereignty and warzone control aspects of FW.\n\nI want FW to have all the brutality and darkness of EVE, and not turn into some sort of weak caricature of what once was.\n\nNPC content overhaul inside the complexes.\n\nI hope that in looking at the specific changes to plexing, CCP and the CSM will take a hard look on the realities and consequences behind some of these fixes, and won't just change things to appease people's ideological sensibilities as opposed to creating more engaging gameplay for the rest of the population.\n\nI'm firmly against any mechanic that forces the killing of rats either explicitly or overtly for sovereignty. I realize that my own reasons might be ideological –in that I believe it's game breaking to force content in that way within a sandbox environment –I also believe that doing so will not create more engaging gameplay.\n\nSpeed tanking is a legitimate strategy. And, I believe that the problem lies not in the difficulty of the plexes but in the risk.\n\nSome people equate these two things, and I think it's a mistake to do so. Increasing the risk –making it easier for your enemy to find you, catch you, etc is far different then making the plex harder by somehow changing the NPC responses.\n\nMaking the plexes riskier will increase engaging pvp gameplay, whereas making plexes harder will simply discourage people (particularly pvpers) from plexing altogether.\n\nSlight reboot to the complex \"flavors\" - we need a complex that is Tech 1 frigates and rookie ships only, (no pirate ships or dessies). We also need to increase the spawn rate of unrestricted compounds slightly, to shake up the variety in fleet types.\n\nPrior to Inferno, probably 99.9% of pvp happened outside of plexes. When Inferno was first implemented this changed, with the bulk of pvp happening inside plexes. However, I've quickly seen this changing in the last month or two –with more and more pvp happening on regular gates and stations.\n\nThe bottom line is people are bored. You fight with a thrasher in a miner, or a rupture/SFI in a medium, etc. Plex fighting has gotten stale and predictable.\n\nHans seems to want to fix this by introducing more plex sizes, but I think the underlying problem is the contrived size restrictions of the plexes themselves.\n\nPlex sizing and restrictions is a part of FW people passionately hold onto, thinking that it somehow prevents blobs, or keeps FW from becoming like nullsec. However, there is nothing to really support these fears. As I stated earlier, prior to Inferno we fought in a variety of small gang situations all the time outside of plexes. Quite honestly, some of those spontaneous and mixed small gang fights were more fun than the typical minor plex thrasher standoffs you see nowadays.\n\nAt the risk of being crucified, I think they should remove the restrictions (gates) altogether and just make all plexes generic. Let FW pilots truly fight each other with any ship of the game –let them choose. I want to see randomly mixed gangs, with a variety of roles that we used to see before Inferno, and that we see now outside of plexes.\n\nMore visibility for when complexes are entered and taken – having systems on the mini-map flash to indicate a currently occupied complex.\n\nI had a long conversation about this with both Hans, Rina (CEO of Fweddit) and Pinky Feldman. Interestingly, I think I have to agree with some of the concerns Pinky raised about how this would somewhat make things 'easier' perhaps in not such a good way.\n\nIntel gathering is not a right, or a privilege. It's a part of the strategy of pvp in EVE in general. This is why intel channels have been created, and why players argue over proper methods for sharing intel. This is why someone with poor intel is at a disadvantage.\n\nOpening this up, opens a huge can of worms, in my opinion, and removes some of the sandboxy, player 'owned' content within the game.\n\nWe currently already have contestation levels, and can see when a system's level goes up or down. Do we need further handholding by explicitly informing people of their enemy's actions within the warzone?\n\nComplex capture timers that can be seen system-wide.\n\nVisibility of plexes being run down on a system level seems better than putting it on a warzone level. Visibility within the system will increase the risk to the plexes (a good thing) and still force passerby's to create their own system of sharing this information with friendlies.\n\nSo to wrap up the last two points, plex visibility should remain on a system level, whereas contestation levels and upgrade information should remain on the warzone level.\n\nInstituting a rollback of the capture timer when a complex is unoccupied in order to discourage bouncing around to evade PvP.\n\nYes, however how about instead of a hard rollback, just making all timers slowly go back to the 'middle' when the plex is unoccupied?\n\nWe want to encourage pvp, so if someone is forced out of a plex that has 1 minute left on it, they will be encouraged to come back asap to chase the hostile out. Whereas, if the plex simply does a hard, fast rollback, this somewhat discourages them to come back, and will greatly encourage people to simple find an alternative plex elsewhere, since they have to start over anyway.\n\nThis will also prevent defensive 'blitzing' whereby people will chase out small numbers of plexers in plexes by blobbing them and essentially 'resetting' all the plexes. This doesn't seem like a strategy that should be encouraged either.\n\nAn end to LP payouts when systems are taken vulnerable.\n\nWell, duh.\n\nSystem contested percentage \"buffers\" need to be nuked severely. A *small* contested percentage buffer is needed..\n\nYes, the buffers that make it unreasonable for a defending militia to feasibly defend their system is ridiculous.\n\nHowever, I disagree that some buffer should exist. In the past, some good fights were had when a defending militia tried to plex a system while the hostiles were attempting to take down the I-HUB –for in that plex, the defenders could remove the vulnerability and force the attackers to start over.\n\nThis should be a valid strategy, and I-HUB bashes shouldn't come down to who has the most stuff on field. No buffer means that both sides have to be strategic and can't just brute force it.\n\nLP and hostile spawns for defensive plexing.\n\nIn conjunction with making plexes generic and gateless, this could be interesting. This would essentially make all plexes across the board something generic that both militias can fight over, as opposed to 'farming offensive plexes' vs. avoiding defensive plexes.\n\nAlso, it will remove the mentality of giving up systems for farming purposes and will revitalize people fighting over space because they want to won it.\n\nBatch purchasing in the LP stores. (Or if not technically feasible, the introduction of wholesale offers and multi-run BPC's.)\n\nYes. Bus so long as their aren't exclusive upgrades beneficial only to FW members (somehow) the motivation to own systems for upgrading purposes will not exist. Therefore the motivation to take space for upgrading purposes will not exist.\n\nWhy take over a hostile system, when you can simply reap the benefits of your hostiles upgrading it with your neutral alts?\n\nThe accessibility bar should be low –and the risk from getting caught by other players should be high. Removing the gates, and significantly decreasing the distance between the warpin and the button could significantly increase the risk. ;)\n\nOverall, it looks like Hans is working on a lot of the important stuff, though I have my concerns about some of his approach.\n\nAlso, I sometimes get the sense that we're trying to fix the important stuff while we still can –which makes me wonder if CCP is planning to put FW on the backburner again after the Winter Expansion? There is so much in FW that hasn't been touched. Should we have the mentality of 'settling' for the stuff that is desperately needed and not dreaming about or pointing out other possibilities?\n\nWhat about live events and dynamic 'war' material? NPC battles on gates and stations –or some sort of movement with the overall storyline?\n\nWe have 'sovereignty' instead of 'occupancy' now, but except for station lockout what does this mean? There's so much more that could be done in terms of ownership –what about making the Faction War stations dynamic so that the Sovereign Faction's NPC corporation owns it? What if taking any system with a FW station means more agents and perks? We still have a sense that some systems are 'Amarr' and some are 'Minmatar' no matter who owns it…\n\nWhat about an overhaul to FW missions? This has been long due. With the new sovereignty system, the entire philosophy behind missions is broken. (IE: the concept of traveling deep into hostile territory…etc.) What about giving more variety in missions instead of making players kill either a structure or a gaggle of industrial ships?\n\nWhat about truly making PVP give the best payouts vs missioning and other PVE? In the original Inferno dev blog this was talked about as being intended, and it's horribly broken. Is CCP simply giving up on it because of exploitation concerns? Can't they come up with something?\n\nWhat about the thing that everyone asked for in the years leading up to Inferno that still hasn't been implemented in Faction War? Meaning. We still don't matter. We still pvp for the heck of it, and who wins or loses has no bearing on anything except to line our pockets.\n\nWhen will they start looking at making the Great War between the four primary Factions of EVE matter to the rest of the community, in a bigger way then just providing everyone with another ISK grinding machine?\n\n10 comments:\n\nThe slow rollback is what I was referring to - I don't want an instant reset, just timers to tick back to \"the middle\" at their normal speed, so that progress isn't maintained without a pilot being present.\n\nSusan, you want more risk from plexing, without more difficulty (from the rats), and yet you're pushing against one of the most obvious and most BELIEVABLE ways in which we can make plexing more risky -- the simple expediency of a faction rat informing their faction they're under attack.\n\nI'm out in the middle of nowhere and I one shot a faction rat, my rep with that faction goes down.\n\nBut if there's a plex being captures and there are FORTY faction rats inside, they don't send up an SOS? Doesn't make any bloody sense.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the entire warzone knows I am in a plex running the button, as long as I stand zero chance of getting caught by virtue of being able to warp away freely when someone appears inside, well out of point range even with boosters and faction gear. Plexes are the hardest place in the warzone to catch someone, which makes no sense at all. Letting everyone know I'm there makes it more annoying for me, but it doesn't really add any risk.\n\nthat might work, but I'd just bump up my d-scan range more and get heading out of the scram range earlier, directly away from the beacon. It'd still be hard as hell to catch me.\n\nI think the only way to give plexes more risk is to move the button in closer to where you drop out of warp. So, say a minor plex's button is about 25k from the entrance, someone orbiting at max range (10km for a minor) would come to approximately 15k of the gate periodically, and be a max of about 35km away. It would be a lot easier to get a point on someone, assuming they're not being diligent with d-scan.\n\nJust spitballing here, but maybe have it give a 20% bonus to all agents LP offers for the side that's doing good, and a 20% increase for the side that's doing bad (on a scale, so that if the warzone is deadlocked it sits at about normal for both sides).\n\nThat way people that are running high sec missions in the losing side's empire would have some motivation to join up with the losing side to get their lp stores back to normal. And the people on the winning side that are only there for the money would have an incentive to move back to highsec, thus (hopefully) balancing things out.\n\nI think removing gate to Plexes and removing size restrictions would be a huge pitty. I've recently re-joined FW after 3 years in 0.0 and I find absolutelly refreshing seeing different sized gangs for different plexes.\n\nYes you see a predominance of Thrashers and SFI's but that is simply because in comparison to 0.0 militia is somewhat poorly organised especially when it comes to countering tactics. I think that we are already seeing some interesting counter-tactics from guys like Agony that exploits Thrasher/SFI's inherent disadvantages.\n\nIf you look at 0.0 gangs you will see at least as much if not more uniformity with fleet compositions than in FW (Drake gangs and Abbadons only).\n\nA roleplaying solution that would make a lot more people care about faction warfare.\n\nIf a faction is losing, they need to raise money! They do this by raising taxes. They literally add a war tax onto all station trading done in their stations. This money is then used to upgrade the ships guarding their buttons.\n\nBigger step perhaps, but on top of your war-tax: Have all characters either declare a citizenship or no citizenship (for nullsecers). Noncitizens are taxed higher than citizens by station trading, mfg jobs, etc. Changing citizenship is possible, but costly/time-consuming (perhaps tied to faction standing).\n\nIf you are citizen=Caldari then you get incentivized to see Caldari FW win. You want to see improvements in Caldari space, etc.\n\nIf you hate all highsec, great, go non-citizen for all and get incentivized to build a more viable economic system out in null"

      "text": "my take is that in the Kingdom Hearts model, highly customizable BOffs are your \"Donald\" and \"Goofy.\"\n\nWhereas guest star BOffs would be more like your \"Simba\" and \"Ariel.\" And even then, I'd look at adding some customization.\n\nFor example: Joshua Riker would have preset face and body sliders but would get a full range of off duty uniforms, like what KDF Marauding BOs are supposed to get. Miral Paris would get any Starfleet uniform you have unlocked. The face, body, and name are locked. Maybe make them orange quality \"legendary\" BOs. Maybe six traits including one that lets you launch a dialogue with them and one that influences a key mission involving them. (So, for example, when you play the \"Badlands\" mission with Joshua Riker, the cage portions all auto-complete.\n\nI'd look at retrofitting some BOs into this system like the Khitomer Accord Borg. (Maybe allow Borg BOs to be used in Borg STFs?)\n\nR.I.P.

Depending on how the conversation goes, it might still be moved.\n\nWould someone like to champion the concept of a \"Guest Star\" for Dev missions and explain why this is a good idea?\n\nI understand that some people don't like the idea of being forced to take along a BO they didn't set up themselves. Would someone like to explain why the benefit outweighs this downside?\n\nI would also point out that adding such a feature to the Foundry would require that the Foundry add a BO creator UI, so that the BO can be given appropriate skills and equipment in addition to being costumed. I really like the idea, but it's definitely non-trivial. Right now Foundry authors can't select equipment for NPC's, which would also be a good thing. But all of that gear would have to be made available somehow, unless you decide that they automatically get a set of faction-standard gear"

But, any who... Being able to have the PHQ earily on as well as being able to build another one after the first one is destroyed or needs to be destoryed (a.k.a my adopted sector will be kicking me out soon due to to many ships whinding up in my possesion for free).\n\nBeing able to salvage those dealict ships and stations for loot that we so often see in some sectors.\n\nHaving pirates actually pick up cargo from ships destroyed and then leaving area to go back to their base.\n\nHaving cutom avatar looks which may or may not have a slight impact on the universe.\n\nThings I would like to see:\n- New UI ( more futuristic, user friendly )\n- Better micromanagement\n- Some nice graphical income reports ( possibly even income per hour/day...)\n- Better supply solutions\n- Storage system on your stations ( so you can put missiles, shields, weapons for safekeeping/ fleet supply demands.)\n- Fleet supply system ( for instance you put 250k credits on a station for fleet supply for the fleet that belongs to that station, and you only get a message do you want to add another 250k after the original money is gone... rather than wasting your own time doing that stuff.)\n- Money making you life easier ( e.g. you pay 10% more to get the stuff deliver to you by the selling company and thus saving you some time)\n- Various uses for money ( e.g. you can use % of your income to pay of pirates not to attack you... to attack you rival ... to go to the supply system) for fighter defense but not enough power to run them, make bombers and TM class have an even 100 meg in power instead of the 34 or so they have now, hows that supposed to run hepts? for fighter defense but not enough power to run them, make bombers and TM class have an even 100 meg in power instead of the 34 or so they have now, hows that supposed to run hepts?\n\nYou're not supposed to use hept's. You're supposed to use IRE's.\n\nAlso. Every ship should be able to carry marines too. HEy. Even if you could not use them. We should be able to shuttle them over.\n\nOoh, so much to list. I'll split it into sections.\nAlso, a lot of these already mentioned.\nAnd even if only the means to mod these (i.e. tie-in points, engine, etc.) is done, I'd be more than happy.\nLastly, don't shoot me for naming things from Freelancer. It got the dog-fight and combat down well, so why not learn from it? (Yes, I know it mucked up all capital ships, and had a stale economy, and loads of other stuff, but I say take the good and leave the bad).\n\n1. Complete overhaul of missiles - Weaponslots\n--Reason: Missiles should not just be a choice of cargospace vs. damage. (A bit more like Freelancer)\n--Aspect: Think/Fight\n--Explanation: Like in real life, missiles should take up weapon slots on smaller fighters. Thus a choice between anti-fighter and anti-'large'. I would not make all weapon slots missile-launcher/torpedo compatible though. (I.E. so that you can still have a difference between fighters and bombers).\nFor smaller missiles this could be a missile launcher pod, carrying multiple missiles, and for larger missiles (Ex. torpedoes) it is a one-shot deal until you can land and rearm.\nLarger frigates or capital ships (Real life frigate ships) can have launcher arrays that can auto-reload.\n\n2. Complete overhaul of missile defences\n--Reason: Normal weapons should not act as missile defense\n--Aspect: Think/Fight\n--Explanation: I'd rather see missiles countered by specialized equipment. Counter-measure deployers (chance for smart missile to target countermeasure), missile jammers (smart missile tracking stops, like dumbfire missiles), missile hackers (i.e. redirects smart missile to new enemy target), anti-missile point defense (actually targets and destroyes missiles, but near useless against ships), etc. Maybe even some way-out stuff like EMP blast, disables ship but gives last-ditch attempt to stop missile swarm.\nThat way there is also an advantage to using a dumbfire missile.\n\n3. Anti-Capital missiles for nearly all fighter classes:\n--Reason: Fighters should be able to scuttle large ships when in groups, and specifcally outfitted for that purpose.\n--Aspect: Think/Fight\n--Explanation: The WW2 Bismarck battleship had over 44 AA guns and yet got torpedo-ed by aircraft. As above, not all fighters (Ex. scouts) can carry the largest missiles, or many of them, but all fighters should be able to pose a threat to capital ships when in groups and properly armed.\n\n4. Less extreme differences between classes (types).\n--Reason: Weaker ships become near utterly obsolete once player has enough money.\n--Aspect: Fight\n--Explanation: I support roles for ships, as in scouts, bombers, fighters, strong-and-slow vs. weak-and-agile. But an M5 has no chance in hell against a M3, unless the M3 has no equipment. I'd rather have scout class ships be the only ones capable of fitting the highest tech scanners, bombers the best torpedoes, fighters the best weapons, etc. One thing that must be tuned is the huge shield gaps between classes.\n\n5. Tone shields down, tone hulls up\n--Reason: Ships currently go boom 1 second after shields poof.\n--Aspect: Fight\n--Explanation: Hulls should be able to take a real beating, possibly even more than shields. I mean, hull costs money to repair, can only be repaired while landed, and you can lose equipment while your hull gets pounded (though currently this rarely happens as you just blow up).\nShields should be weaker, but recharge faster, with an added dead-time when drained completely. (See Freelancer). Downed shields should be serious, not instantly fatal.\n\n6. Equipment damage\n--Reason: Currently there but plays no real role other than occasional annoyance\n--Aspect: Fight\n--Explanation: When taking hull damage, equipment should take damage as well. Equipment should not get destroyed (have to find and buy new one) but get disabled until repaired (cost of repairs vs. performance impact until repaired). Similar to, but less controllable than, capital ship module damage.\n\n7. Weapon damage classes/types\n--Reason: Current weapon choices semi bland\n--Aspect: Think/Fight\n--Explanation: Currently it is a matter of sticking the most damaging weapons on your ship that won't eat the reactor, and maybe make sure you have some anti-fighter capabilities. I'd like to see more diversity. More autocannon (physical slug) weapons that penetrate shields. Weapons that do more damage to one type of shield/hull, and less to another. Etc. X3:TC did ALOT better in this regard, but some more freedom here would be awesome.\n\n8. Shield and hull types\n--Reason: No thinking involved with picking shields at the moment\n--Aspect: Think/Fight\n--Explanation: As above, more diversity. Shields that have lower maximum capacities, but recharge quicker. Shields that have shorter dead-time. Shields that near-nullify one weapon type but are vulnerable to all others. Etc. Hulls that are stronger, but more expensive to repair. Hulls that are weaker, but slowly repair themselves. Etc.\n\n==Gameplay - Economy==\n\n1. Make secondary resources boost production\n--Reason: Secondary resources is currently a means to make AI eat useless junk to stimulate economy.\n--Aspect: Trade/Build/Think\n--Explanation: All stations (now modules) should demand secondary resources of some kind. These should not be required for production, but should boost production if provided. For instance, food should be a secondary resource, as you are paying the workers (see next point) so giving them free food makes them happier and boost production. Also, currently they eat insane amounts of the stuff.\nThis gives the player more choice. Do I supply the factory with only its primary requirements? Or do I go through the extra effort to boost its production? (I.e. more factories vs. better factories.)\n\n2. Running costs and salaries\n--Reason: You currently can't really lose money\n--Aspect: Think/Trade\n--Explanation: Currently, other than stuffing their faces, I don't pay the hordes of workers I never see on my factories. If I fail dismally to provide one of my factories with resources, it sits there (not earning anything, yes) but costing me not even a penny until I can fix it. If the factory had running costs it would go bankrupt (and then be scrapped perhaps?) if I did nothing.\nI do not advocate massive running costs (to the point where the slightest loss of production is disasterous) but a very poorly placed factory, or massive supply line disruptions (curse you pirates!), should be serious.\n\n3. No hardcoded production and storage numbers for stations (modules)\n--Reason: It's unflexible, and limits more interesting economies\n--Aspect: Think/Build\n--Explanation: I'd like to see some factories that perhaps eat more raw resources per product produced, but produce much faster (10 energy cells per beef patty, as opposed to 8, but it takes only 1 minute, instead of 1:30). This mean more possible variety in factory types as well.\nBy all means the balancing (the values you assign to these) can be done according to a fixed formulae, but don't hardcode the formulae into the game. If the game comes out with a perfectly-blanaced-everything-produces-20%-more-than-it-consumes-value-wise that's fine, but please let me tweak it per factory type.\n\n4. Multiple products, including Secondary Products\n--Reason: Currently not possible\n--Aspect: Think/Trade\n--Explanation: Allow a module (not multiple modules together, each making its own) to produce multiple products. Allow products for the module to be specified as primary or secondary. Primary simply means that there must be storage for the product before production can begin. Secondary means it will be stored is there is space, but if there isn't, then we simply destroy/vent the excess.\nThis will allow for interesting things such as factories that produce 'Depleted E-Cells' as secondary products. Solar power plants can then use (recharge) these instead of crystals to produce E-cells. (Also see next point). And other factories that produce 'Toxic Waste' as a primary product, that unless you can haul it away, stops production. (Correct action is to ship it to recycling/disposal plants, but you can illegally dump it in space. Just watch out for police and environmentalists... SAVE THE SPACE FLIES!)\n\n5. Factories should have more complex resources requirements (AND/OR checks)\n--Reason: Flexibility in economy\n--Aspect: Think\n--Explanation: I'd love to see factories be able to substitute one resource for another. For example, as above, using depleted E-cells instead of crystal. Along with adjustable production numbers (point 3) you can make it simply be a partial substitute (still need some crystal) or total (green economy). Other awesome combinations also possible, such as having two ore and two silicon types (low grade and high grade for each). You can use low grade, but require more per product for it.\n\n6. Planetary Docks (Planets eats/makes products at bad trade rates) (This is more a visual thing than a gameplay change)\n--Reason: An economy needs consumers and I personally don't like the magical vanishing act at the moment\n--Aspect: Trade\n--Explanation: I'd simply make stations (low orbit around planets, ships to and from planet population) that consume a lot of products (massive amounts, as much as super-massive stations can produce), but pay very low rates for it. They also produce some goods, but charge very high prices for it.\nAdditionally, I would make these prices vary very little, so that they are always bad deals, but you can always dump your stuff there, if you have no other choice.\n\n1. More factions (closer to Freelancer)\n--Reason: X3:TC aimed for this. Just flesh it out more.\n--Aspect: Think\n--Explanation: Not much to say here.\n\n2. More guilds, more active guilds\n--Reason: Guilds don't really exist at the moment, mostly introduced by mods\n--Aspect: Trade/Fight/Build\n--Explanation: All guilds should have a HQ, and should always offer multiple missions related to them. Trade guild, buy-and-sell, transport. Bounty hunter's guild, search and destroy. Miner's guild, scan asteroid fields, mine X. Etc.\nRandom missions should still be available round and about, but you should be guaranteed of a specific mission type at the guild HQ.\nI'd also like to see the player being able to hire a guild for a specific mission. Trade guild, bring me X amount of Y product, at max price + fee (as the mission for you, just you dish it out). Assassin's guild, kill ship or station X for fee. Etc.\n\n3. Avoid \"Everyone loves me!\" possibilities.\n--Reason: Being a pure trader is fine, but having not even the pirate attack you is boring\n--Aspect: Think/Fight\n--Explanation: The improved races mod(s) clearly showcases why this is awesome.\n\n4. Perpetual Conflict\n--Reason: Some people just don't get along\n--Aspect: Fight\n--Explanation: There should be factions that always hate one another. Ties in to above two points.\n\n5. Political Fringe Benefits\n--Reason: Expand on the 'We will sell you this when we like you this much' concept\n--Aspect: Trade/Fight (possibly .../Build/Think)\n--Explanation: More benefits (ultimate rewards) to being perfect friends. Higher selling prices, lower buying prices at planetary docks/trade docks. Faction will actively protect you (not just help out if they are around, but actually send response fighters to help you). Shares manufacturing/management infrastructure (higher production at factories/type of factory). Etc.\nMotivates the player with more than just 'I want to buy/sell X with you'. I would make the ultimate rewards of fighting factions (military) be active protection. Of corporations, improved prices/production. Of pirates, increased raids against your foes. Of police, no longer scans you for illegal cargo (trust you... the fools).\nYou should lose fringe benefits when your relationship drops.\n\n6. Scaling Animosity\n--Reason: Harder endgame\n--Aspect: Trade/Fight/Build/Think\n--Explanation: Usually once you have credits flowing in at a good pace, things become bland rather quickly. [Oh, so the Paranid hate me? Well say hello to my ten battleships.] I suggest that the greater the player grows, the more specifically other corporations and powers targets him/her. Especially those that hate the player. I mean, full scale raids that target unprotected factories, fake raids to pull away defenders and then real raids to take down factories, pirates specifically targeting your traders, other corporations underpricing your goods, secret political deals to put trade embargoes against you.\nThings to mix it up, essentially.\n\n==Engine and Modding==\nThis section repeats much of what is already listed, just with added technical detail.\n\n1. Price range modifiers for station types\n--Reason: Some special stations (like planetary docks above, or current trade/equipment/etc. docks) need their price ranges to be fixed, or different from normal supply/demand\n--Aspect: Modding\n--Explanation: For modders to define more flexible stations (a trade dock that has slightly varying prices).\n--Technical Detail: Station Class should have '.MinPriceMultiplier', '.MaxPriceMultiplier', '.AveragePriceMultiplier' for both resources and products. I would not do it per product/resource, but hey, maybe useful?\n\n2. Shield/Weapon/Hull types, damage modifiers, recharge/repair rates, dead-time, maximum capacity, weapon damage, weapon mount type\n--Reason: To create some (NOTE: SOME) rock/paper/scissors relations and other way-out combinations\n--Aspect: Modding\n--Explanation: Allows more diversity with weapons/shields/hulls. Allows modders to create more content and expand game life (<- Yeah, blatant marketing there)\n--Technical Detail: New tables (in files) that define Shield types, Weapon Types, Hull types.\nI'd dissociate weapon types to what a ship can mount. I'd rather give weapons a new attribute '.MountType', that defines on what type of slot this weapon can be mounted. Ships then define what '.MountType' they can handle in their separate hardpoints. (Exactly like X3:TC works now, just a syntax change really, which would allow more weapon types)\nI'd give similar '.MountType' to shields and hulls, so that you can define\nNew tables (in files) that define for each weapon type, a multiplier to damage against each shield and hull type. I'd include missiles in having weapon types.\nI wouldn't make the rock/paper/scissors relations too extreme, except for way-out cases. I'd keep damage multiplier range for different types within 0.7 to 1.4 range.\nI'd also use the multipliers to bring into effect the shield and hull damage, so you don't specify separate shield and hull damage for a weapon, just multipliers. If hull damage should be very low, and shield high (ion weapon), just give hull damage multipliers of 0.02, and shield of 2.0, or some such.\nAlso, I'd specify penetration percentage (0.0 to 1.0) for shields to weapon types that specify how much of that weapon's damage will bypass the shield. (That way it is easy to specify new shield ignoring weapons).\nShield Class should have '.Type' (To do the shield type multiplier of damage upon impacts), '.RechargeRate' (How quickly it recharges), '.DeadTime' (How long it stays down when complete drained), '.InstantRechargeAfterDeadTime' (What percentage of the maximum it instantly recharges to after recovering from dead time), '.MountType' (For mounting similar to weapons, allowing only certain ships to mount certain shields, which would not only limit maximum shield strength as now, but also shield types), other current attributes such as '.maximum'\nHull (Armor) Class should have '.Type' (To do the hull type multiplier of damage upon impacts), '.RepairRate' (How quickly it repairs itself, typically 0 for hulls), '.RepairCostMultiplier' (The cost of repairing this hull is multiplied by this), '.MountType' (For mounting similar to weapons, allowing cheaper fighter armor and more expensive capital ship armor, and such), '.EquipmentDamageRate' (How easily equipment can get damaged, as multiple of normal)\nNOTE: The hull mentioned here would not specify the amount of hitpoints a ship has (the ship type does that) it would specify the armor plating added (i.e. damage multipliers used). I'd specify one hull (armor) type as unarmored (that simply has a 1.0 multiplier to all damages, 0.5 multiplier to repaircost, and 0 repairrate, and make all new ships start out with that).\n\n3. No difference between missiles and lasers\n--Reason: For missile overhaul and more diversity\n--Aspect: Modding\n--Explanation: As described way above, I'd replace missiles with launchers. In fact, there should be no difference between any weapons (lasers or missiles). A missile launcher is simply a weapon with an ammo requirement, that launches a projectile that may be capable of tracking. In fact, if you properly define a 'Projectile' class, there should be no difference whatsoever. In fact, X3:TC already does this for lasers, it just handles missiles separately for legacy reasons (I assume).\nA torpedo launcher would be dirt cheap, as it is literally a clamp. It is the torpedo that is the expensive part.\nIn fact, I'd keep all missile launchers very cheap, as the cost is in the ammo you buy for them.\n--Technical Detail: Projectile class. The stuff spawned by a weapon when it fires. A projectile has stats such as '.Type' (WeaponType), '.Damage' (Actual weapon doesn't have this), '.Speed', '.RateOfTurn' (Can it turn? Like a missile? And what stops me from defining some energy weapon that guides it projectiles with a magnetic field or somesuch?), etc.\nSo a dumbfire missile is no different from a PPC projectile, and smart missiles simply have a Rate Of Turn greater than 0.\nIn code you could define child classes for DumbProjectiles/Lasers (no RateOfTurn) and SmartProjectiles/Missiles (RateOfTurn), as only smartprojectiles need to be processed for course adjustments. But I'd keep the method for spawning them (by mounted weapons) the same.\nA projectile can simply have a flag to indicate it is a missile of not (I.E. can be affected by missile countermeasures/defenses).\n\n4. Station modules, resources and products\n--Reason: For mentioned economy changes, ease of modding\n--Aspect: Modding\n--Explanation: What is needed should be apparent from the ==Gameplay - Economy== sections\n--Technical Detail: Examples\n\n{to fascilitate secondary resources boosting production, allow multiple batches to be specified, and a production line for each batch. So that one batch, if busy, can prevent another.\nThen simply let the station check through the batches, 1 to X, executing as many as possible.}\nConsider the solar power plant, deciding to use either crystals or depleted e-cells (do-able in one batch), and can have its production boosted by using an 'overcharge conduit'.\nModule.ProductionBatch[1].ResourcesNeeded = ([Depleted E cells:5000] AND [Crystal:10] AND [Conduit:1]) OR ([Crystal:50] AND [Conduit:1])\nModule.ProductionBatch[1].ProductsCreated = [E cells:14000]\nModule.ProductionBatch[1].TimePerBatch = 40 (in seconds)\nModule.ProductionBatch[1].ProductionLineOccupied = 1 (just a number, but once a line is occupied, another batch that also wants to use the line cannot start until that line is free)\n\nModule.ProductionBatch[2].ResourcesNeeded = ([Depleted E cells:5000] AND [Crystal:10]) OR [Crystal:50]\nModule.ProductionBatch[2].ProductsCreated = [E cells:7000]\nModule.ProductionBatch[2].TimePerBatch = 60 (in seconds)\nModule.ProductionBatch[2].ProductionLineOccupied = 1 (Also line one, so if the solar power plant had a conduit and sufficient resources, it would have already started batch 1 on line 1, so batch 2 cannot start on line 1, so is not executed.)\n{As long as enough of the secondary resource is provided, the solar power plant module will always execute the higher boosted production batch, eating the secondary resources}\n{No special handling for boosting production from secondary resources is needed, just proper handling of the normal production queues"

ME and Halo are two different Verse all together. Unless you are going to have the Forerunners be Prometheans but even then, Flood and Reapers are opposites of each other. See where I am going here, it would be a cluster just to figure out how things would work. Even though in Infinity Rises, it was more plausible with the Infinity being a Generational ship that reached the fringes of that other galaxyi thought about that and was thinking the forerunners vanished 100,000 years ago reseeding life in the universe after the flood starved out destorying that cycle for the reapers and the prothens would've been the eldest of the races that was reseeded only for the reapers to return 50,000 years later after being alerted to the Mass Relays being used once agian restarting their cycle but also laying new relays to expand their influance hoping to find the cause of the disruption in their cycles and the flood could've been made by the same race as the reapers but in a biological sence and only creating the reapers to orginally try and destory the flood before the reaper collective A.I's went rampent from facing off against a gravemind starting their cycles\n\nIt could work then how would you explain the different races? Not humans but the other onesbig galaxy and the forerunners had the most advanced known FTL other then the Class 0 tech {Most advanced tech that can ever be made and bordline godhood} of the Precursers they easily could've traveled tot he many systems collecting samples and DNa profiles for all races of certen size for food and then theres the whole reapers stuff so yea after 50,000 years everything happened how it happened in the ME universe but without the UNSC/covenant finding the mass relays due to a lack of them in their part of the galaxy\n\nBut doesn't the Covenant cover a large amount of the galaxy? What I am talking about is the whole Covenant and Council thing. The only way I can see this is if the Covenant is a darker version of the Counsel and altered the races?? you do know in my idea the covenant made the Reclaimers {Not the ME humans} members and co-leaders of the covenant with the prophets due to their ties to the foreunners and being the only ones to truely unlock forerunner tech and after 2,000 years there would be a large genentic differance between the Reclaimers and humans of the system alliance and with the ME humans of the alliance not knowing their past other then their recorded history of their dark ages and the metals of the old humans {Reclaimers} having rusted or in case of any space debris fallen back to earth there would be no traces my idea is that the covenant with the rapid and unkown changes in their planets rendering 99% of the planets inhabitable retreated to the arks and using the lesser ark to make non-weapon halos for the covenant races to live on while the Covenant version of the UNSC The CMC {Covenant Military Command} would be sending the greater ark and a large fleet of ships to defend it {Smallest ships are 3KM long} back into the galaxy and accendentally dropping out of slipspace withing the serpent nebula {Imagine the cidital species faces seeing the giant Greater Ark arriving with a fleet of 3,000 ships the smallest being their dreadnaught size and going all the way up to the giant 50KM long fortress call keyships {Only 1 in the fleet acting as the flagship} then intiating first contact with the citidel races"

      "text": "I pick Z polarizers again, thinking they'd be fun and strong unit. Homeworld spawns next to a Mark IV planet... I think I can probably take it out extremely quickly. So start preparing. Then I get curious. I wonder, just how much damage does a Z Polarizer do? It says \"attack * armour rating\". Ok, so vs a mark IV bomber, it should be 7000 * 96... I check the reference thing in stats... That's weird, Mark IV bombers BEAT them. Something ain't right. So I send one to an enemy planet, pause right as it arrives, and start checking the damage values. Turns out the \"armour rating\" is rather arbitrary. My findings.\n\nThis is the second game it's happened. It's very frustrating. I feel there's nothing I could do. If anyone has any suggestions, please share.\n\nBasically I'm playing Realistic Hubs 80 planets against 2 Diff 8s, one Rand Harder, one Rand Moderate. Playing with these settings, means I often get large waves that completely wipe out my wormhole defenses, so I'm often left with none. This means units that can ignore force-fields slip past. These then take out at least one harvester which I can do nothing to stop. In both games they managed to take out 2-3 harvs, and well, they just rushed me, and the amount of ships they attacked with combined with my crippled economy (no harvs) meant death.\n\nFirst game was against a Shadow Master (moderate one) and Spec ops. This meant infiltrators and lots of units coming into my system. By the time I realised what was happening, I was down 5-6 harvesters and I was dying, with no economy to stop it. This is simply because the infils bypass the exo-shields, ruining my economy in a fraction of the time the other units would. This happened around the 40 minute mark.\n\nThe second game was similar. I kept getting hit by large waves, lots of parasites and stuff that fighters counter. I didn't have tech for fighters 2 (silly me), but in the end I don't think it'd have helped. At the crunch, around the 1h20m mark (just killed an extra planet... so many waves), I got hit by a \"168 unit cross planet attack\" that turned out to be 1,200+ ships (bug?). A few of them were eye bots and vamps. About 2 minutes into the attack, I had absolutely no harvesters. They were all dead. All the attacking units were stuff like parasites and raiders - nothing that can kill exo-shields quickly - with a few ignore shield units, which were maybe %1 of the force. Due to my simple lack of economy I lost any chance of surviving. I had no resources to produce fighters with to counter the massive amount of raiders and cruisers. My slim chance got obliterated to nothing.\n\nI think exo-shields should block all units personally. Up the ongoing cost by 50% (or even double it), it'd be worth it.\n\nAlso, I wasn't sure to put this in the Suggestion forum or not, so move it if you wish.\n\nPS: The second game, AI were mad bomber and unknown. Never found out, gave up when I had nothing to fight with and a 1000 ships pelting at my home station.\n\nOk, this is basically a \"I just got owned so lets post a nerf thread\" post. I still think it's valid tho.\n\nBasically infiltrators ignore force-fields, AND they do kickass damage against em. I decided to go ingame and check. 8000 per hit against force fields (and turrets) for Mark I. Their base damage is 40. That's a 200x multiplier.\n\nHeh, infiltrators are better at killing force-fields and defense then bombers are.\n\nWhy is their ability to kill force-fields a problem? Because then your home station (or w/e else is under it) becomes vulnerable to anything else on the planet, such as bombers, and recently nerfed starships.\n\nThe game itself is a pre-release you can get access to for $15. The current ver is going to go free later, with a better ver for payed customers. Price also goes up to $20 at that time.\n\nIt's pretty fun. Very hard to make a Kilo ship (best class parts in the game), which is what's keeping me playing atm. I'd recommend you hold out until the future version comes to buy it, or if you're feeling adventurous (or are just have tons of money), go ahead and buy it. :]\n\nYep, starting a thread about cutlasses, when used in the hands of a human player. My question is this:\n\nAre they useful?\n\nI find they aren't. They aren't good at anything. They kill themselves trying to kill turrets because turrets have too much hp. There's so many other units that can kill home stations and warp gates better then them. They're too slow to be useful against military units. They can get past shields, but this is rarely useful, and not worth an entire unit. Other units can do it to, and better (eye bots, infiltrators).\n\nI think cutlasses simply need a damage buff, mostly to offset how much damage they take when attacking, and also because just about every other unit in the game can outrun them.\n\nEdit: Yes, I am aware they are very powerful in the hands of the AI. In the hands of a player though, they are a terrible unit.\n\nI thought it'd be best to start a thread about the new changes to power in general (plants using up res constantly, and increased power costs), since obviously these are going to affect more then one patch.\n\nSo, things I've noticed so far.\n\n- Engis are actually worth something now, at a hefty 4000 power. I no longer just spam them because I can. This is the same with stuff like docks, power gens, and pretty much everything in general. - I actually built a mobile repair station. I already have 12 tugs. With only 2 engis (yes, I only have TWO), I need something else to repair my fleet, so a MBR does it. - Starships are going take a long time to build now, due to the above mentioned lack of engis. - Instead of having my dock on a constant loop, and being out of resources because I'm spamming to reach caps, I'm now picking exact amounts of units to build.\n\nSo far I think I'm loving the changes.\n\nPS. Another side effect is that's it's best to not build extra docks, but extra engis, so you have at least 2 engis per dock (or starship dock), as far as speed and power go.\n\nOk, 2 saves there. First one (shorter name) is 1 minute before a cross-planet attack is supposed to come. Second one is 8 minutes later (I think, maybe longer) and still no attack (although I did make a nice spy network ). I think they sent like 30 ships and gave up or something. Anyway, there's like 1500 Mark III ships sitting on one of their planets right next to mine, doing nothing. The \"Threat\" level also says 1500, but they still haven't attacked.\n\nKinda sad when I set up 1000 fleet ship defense with 600 mines and 5 Force fields and they never come.\n\nThis is a thread about how awesome the AI is. Lets share stories about it here."

The could be several cluster map types even with the number of clusters (Clusters (2), Clusters (4),...)\n\nEach cluster is a small simple map in itself. connections between clusters are rare and it may even be the case that you have to travel through another cluster to reach the third one.\n\nThis map forces decision making about capturing the entire home cluster and create a few chokepoints on the planets that connect to another cluster or to hop around the map taking mostly the important connection planets so every cluster is accessible.\n\nDone.\nI didn't try to count stars (there's 33) or follow any kind of cluster connection rules, just tried to get the basics down, including some of the \"odd\" connections sometimes seen in standard map styles.\n\nThe \"lone\" star on the left was intentional. While the clusters are primarily connected via one system to one system along a large (galactic) distance, the occasional double-connection or double-jump is desirable.\n\n\"More clusters\" does become an issue at some point where planets start getting crowded together (had this issue on X once, where two \"dead end\" planets from different...clusters were almost on top of each other).\n\nJust because you tend to prioritize space between clusters over space between planets (so whatever algorithm you're using to connect planets doesn't try to merge two clusters).\n\nYeah that's badically what I meant in a picture. The connections between the clusters don't have to be the same. They are either randomised few, X, as shown in the picture or there are different cluster mapstyles to choose from that will have different cluster connections."

      "text": "From your skill choices, I see you are more interested in space than ground, so I will focus on that. There is a chart explaining what each skill point does located here  It outlines how much of a bonus each skill gets and it can be invaluable in deciding skill point placement. There are quite a few skills in this game where it really isn't worth the extra 3 \"red zone\" points.\n\nNow, in the ingame message you sent me, you mentioned that you have read my post here: \nFor a damage dealing assault cruiser, I would run that gear layout. However, that build is for a star cruiser, you don't have a third science console slot. Due to this you would place an extra Tactical - Plasma Infuser Mk XI instead of an extra Science - Emitter Array Mk XI.\n\nThe truth about cruisers is they really don't have many engineering bridge officer options capable of dealing damage. Boarding Party and Directed Energy Modulation (with beams) are both fairly weak abilities. Aceton beam is a good debuff, but the cooldown is too long. Eject warp plasma and emergency power to weapons are really a beam cruiser's only engineering based tactical options. The build I am suggesting focuses on burning your target with damage over time to compensate for the ship's lack of tactical options. However, if you were to use the ambassador class, then you are opened up a quite a few science tactical options. Out of the abilities, you could pick up tractor beam repulsors II, gravity well I, or tykens rift I. All of which would help with dealing damage to a degree. The difference between the ambassador and the assault cruiser is the reversal of lt. Commander engineering and lt. science. You gain a lt. commander science slot, yet you lose a lt. engineering slot. (No Auxiliary to SIF II in exchange for an extra damage dealing ability)\n\nThe build I describe above is a standard 6 Beam with 2 Torpedos/Mines build. It works fairly well, but the build doesn't fit everyone's playstyle. Some players instead choose to use 3x Single Cannons fore with 1x Torpedo and 3x turret with 1x Torpedo (or extra turret) in the aft section. This works as a slightly high damage build, but it is difficult to pull off with an assault cruiser due to the turn rate."

Is there a way to make the Atrox perform better than or at least on-par with the Dreadnought?\n\nWell, right now I run my JHDC with two wings of Elite Scorpion Fighters, three DHCs and a DBB up front (for the subsystem targeting), with two turrets and the kinetic cutting beam in back. It certainly does it's job in STFs. (note, I don't PvP and likely never will)\n\nWay back when I flew my Atrox, I ran 6 beam arrays, but that was before reputation, so I ran one wing of Adv Peregrines and one wing of Adv Stalkers. I was extremely tanky, able to survive things I really shouldn't have.\n\nThe JHDC is definitely the better carrier. You can't make the Atrox competitive.\n\nThe JHDC has more than 10% more hull and the shield modifier is only 0.05 lower. It has another forward weapon, more console slots (9 v 10), a better turn rating (5 v 6), and better total power bonuses (+10 weps and +10 aux v +5 shields and +10 aux).\n\nI guess what I'd say is this: what you do get from the Atrox is two Lt Cmdr bridge officer slots as opposed to Lt Cmdr., Lt., and Ens. But I can't see how it's worth it in the slightest.\n\nPlus, that JHDC Lt. is universal... no.\n\nThe Atrox isn't competitive. At all. Nor is it supposed to be, really.\n\nThe Dread is an attack carrier designed to lay down suppression(a similar role to the Bortas, really, but with fighters).\n\nThe Atrox is a support carrier designed to lockdown hostiles while keeping friendlies alive.\n\nThey both have their uses, but much of the game is a dps race.\n\nThis is really the problem. They have different roles, but if in the game tanks and healers are not needed (except 1 or 2 cases), the atrox has no way to get really useful. It's a very beautiful ship, and it's a shame that the atrox, among with many other ships aren't really needed. When no elite STF nor other end-game content could be done with a full escort team, then the cruisers, sci, and other defensive oriented ships would be running again in mass, but it's not expected that cryptic make something like that to recover the true essence of Star Trek."

I noticed that neural processors can get you mkxii gear?is that just for stuff like the Omega set etc.?\n\np.s.\nI've never seen an antiproton weapon drop as loot anywhere.

I'm OK with that, because I always felt like the [borg] modifier was a bit of a cop out?sure, we're getting purple quality, but they only count as that against one enemy...which means against anything else they're pretty much blue quality since only 2 of the 3 modifiers apply.\n\nPlasma is mostly weak in PvP, where many people are still running the STF set shields, which have a 20% Plasma damage reduction. It's only slightly weaker in PvE due to the fact that its bonus is damage over time instead of a short, sharp burst of damage like disruptor breach or AP crits can deliver (meaning that it's not as good at immediately KOing an opponent but more for wearing it down over time). However, Romulan Plasma weapons have both the enviable [Acc]x2 modifier freely available as well as providing the Disruptor Breach proc along with the Plasma Fire proc, making them better than normal Plasma weapons.\n\n\"Plasma sucks, because someone told me so, okay?\" Tired, old news. Plasma has been buffed twice that I can remember for sure. The proc works just as well as any other, though differently. I use adv plasma fleet cannons on my F-TER and it's my most powerful in terms of direct damage minus the tricks of my recon Vesta. Adv fleet AP cannons work fine as well. The moral of this story is to simply pick what you like and use the hell out of it until you develop skill with it, which really makes the difference. And before you start believing what folks tell you, consider the source.\n\nToo many people will hawk one energy type over another simply to justify what THEY use.\n\n\"Plasma sucks, because someone told me so, okay?\" Tired, old news.

I've fixed the problem now so please check your build.\n\nI just clicked on a few of them and they all loaded fine. Try it again, maybe it was a temporary glitch with the host. If it still doesn't work, let me know if any messages pop up or anything else that you see.\n\nI'm curious if it is possible to have a ship and player layout added. I would love to see all my ships stats with gear etc to see how it works out.\n\nSomeone else requested something similar. It would be a lot of work to add that, but it is possible. If I do add something like that, the equipment wouldn't be the actual equipment in game, instead it would be a simple representation of it.\n\nFor example, instead of listing Phaser Dual Heavy Cannons [Dmg][CritH] Mk XII (totally just made that up) I would have 3 drop down menus. One for damage type (phaser, disruptor, etc.), one for weapon type (cannon, beam, etc.) and one for Mk. Maybe even one for rarity. So for each weapon slot you could just all of them to show which weapons you have. The same would go for shields, engines, etc.\n\nThe only items I might actually add are specialty items or items that belong to a set such as Maco, Jem'Hadar, etc.\n\nThe reason I would have to do it this way is because there are just too many items in the game for me to list.\n\nI've found medaled builds for tac captains in cruisers that I'd like to try; however, many have engineering BOFFs that have EPTS3.\n\nI know I can't train BOFFs in that skill since I'm a tac captain, and I can't seem to find *any* BOFFs on the exchange that posses that skill.\n\nAre there any engineering captains that could re-train one of my BOFFs?

Taking down a Colossos every 3.3 (at 15 range to it's 9!) seconds with units that take less supply (4 supply to Colosus 6) is very powerful.\n\n@Doomreaver: To be fair, any air unit with any kind of attack will pwn colossi; even a MS core can bring them down unharmed. Plus, void rays with prismatic alignment are much, much more efficient at taking down colossi (AND tempests).\n\n@Daikataro: MORE efficient? Nope. Tempests do a LOT of damage to Colossi now.... 95, at full upgrade, at 15 range so you don't have to risk losing them, for the same supply as Void Rays. Tempests are the way to go; it is why they were given that attack (for that and for Brood Lord sniping).\n\n@noct: Maybe in LOTV the Reaver will have some single player play, but I doubt they'll put it in this game for multiplayer. I'd love to see it too, but they'd have to tone its damage down a lot anyway, so it wouldn't be like the Reaver we know and love (125 upgraded damage with Sc2's clumped units.... GG)\n\n@defeatable: I'd say this is the 'missle-carrier' class, as its role and place on the tech tree is fairly simililar to those of the Thor and Ultralisk, IMO: massive unit that's good against small guys (though the Ultra is a bit higher, I will admit, and Thors can attack air. Colossi got the short end of the stick.) The tanks would be: Siege Tank, Immortal, and proooobably Roach.\n\n@Thunderwing: I actually believe colossus is much better. In the heat of battle, Ultralisks might be stuck behind your roaches, Thors, even worse, behind Marines, doesn't exactly do massive amounts of splash damage. Colossus can walk over cliffs, to save it, can walk over your army, meaning it just walks to the back, and with the Thermal Lance Upgrade, it gets some massive range. So IMO, these units have their pros and cons.\n\nyou know how people say that it would be Very easy to knock over a colossi well knowing the Protoss, they probably made something that keeps them stabilized and makes them impossible to tip over because in the Brood War the zerg could have just gotten a dozen ultralisks and knocked over like tons of the colossi.\n\n@ThePraetor: No they do get knocked over. Next time look closer and every time a colossi dies it burns up, falls over and explodes into bits of scorched metals. Beside ultralisks do \"knock over\" colossi. :D\n\nColossi: A wonderful concept let down by insane fragility and prohibitive cost.\n\nI mean, really? Everything in the game can hit them, and they don't get any measure of AA? If you aren't running a half dozen stalkers for every Colossi you build, you're screwed, and if you have that many Stalkers, just run Stalkers.\n\n@MappyTinfoil: Or...if you're late in a team game, and have air cover from an ally, and plenty of gas coming in, make an uber-high DPS ground-only deathball of annihilation using Colossi. Replace Stalkers with Immortals for intermediate fire, and for the melee front, use Dark Templar like you would Zealots. Add upgrades...and then ground armies and bases get shredded FAST."

      "text": "mynameisgrax\n\nI've crunched the numbers, read a lot of threads, and have come to the painful realization that until a major errata is made to 6th edition regarding flyers, there are only six competitive army 'types' in tournaments:\n\nI guess you could say that there's only one type of competitive army right now: those that have access to inexpensive flying transports.\n\nYes, Blood Angels/Grey Knights Stormravens also have flying transports, but they're generally too expensive to be used in the 'game breaking' way that Night Scythes and Valkyries/Vendettas are used now, except perhaps at the highest point levels, so they're less competitive than the others.\n\nMost armies have some sort of flying unit, but since flying vehicles and flying monstrous creatures can't claim objectives (and as far as I know, only the monstrous creatures can even contest them), it's the transports that can carry troops to claim objectives that cause the trouble.\n\nHere's the problem: after arriving from reserve, flyers can immediately re-enter reserve. You just have them fly in near a table corner, leaving the one table edge and re-entering the other. Why is this broken? Because it enables you to have them all arrive on turn 5. With their speed, they can easily move to any unattended or weakly defended objectives, and drop your troops off on them.\n\nIn order to compete, an army without flying transports will have to simultaneously claim/contest the majority of the objectives on the board with units capable of defeating an Imperial Guard unit loaded with special guns (flamers/plasmas/meltas/demo charges), and/or 10 Immortals with a Necron Lord attached.\n\nThis changes a game that used to be 5-7 turns of struggle into a 1-3 turn endgame spree, with just about everything being decided by late arriving troops in 5 out of the 6 missions.\n\nSo who are the big losers? The only two armies who cannot get access to a flying transport one way or another: Dark Eldar and Tyranids.\n\nHow can this be fixed? As I see it, one of two ways: FAQ/Erratas need to either forbid flyers to fly back into reserve the turn they arrive, or allow all reserve/deep striking units to choose whether or not they enter the field or go back into reserve (won't solve the endgame problem, but at least it'll level the playing field).\n\nIn short, flying transports have f*cked the game balance in 40k 6th edition the same way magic f*cked it in Warhammer Fantasy 8th edition.\n\nIn other words: now's a good time to start playing Necromunda instead.\n\nComments\n\nShrug, you could always just make up a house rule that forces flyers to spend at least one turn on the table, so there's at least some exposure to AA fire. I'm fairly sure the big Nova tourney is doing something like that to prevent people from abusing that ability.\n\n...Or your gaming group could just dissuade those you game with from using such tactics in-game, especially if it's detrimental to the groups enjoyment of the game. 40k, and the meta used to play it, is only as bad as you, and those you game with, allow it to be. It doesn't really matter what 'waac' netlists and exploits/abuses pop up if everyone in your group agrees not to take advantage of them to grieve each other.\n\nedit: Though if you are looking are other systems to get into, might I suggest Infinity. It's squad-sized skirmish action similiar to Necromunda, with an average of 8-12 models per side. The setting is based on sci-fi high-tech black ops. Gameplay features a mechanic of models being able to react during an opponents turns whenever an opposing model acts within their line of sight (ex. return fire or dodging).\n\nIt's very balanced with generally all the units being viable, meaning you can take exactly what you want most times without worrying if it'll be 'good' or not. And the models themselves tend to be gorgeous.\n\nIt's also very cheap to get into, the 35usd starter packs come with around enough to play 125-150pts games, with standard games being 250-300pts. Free rules are available on their website and there's a wiki for quick reference and FAQ. Infinity: the Game\n\nWarning: it is a very terrain intensive game and not having sufficient line-of-sight blocking terrain can ruin it."

From there you can decide if you want to rename them or just go after the image files. Use the .rot viewer, open the files and it'll automatically create a .dds (or .tga) file. Make sure you have the .dds plugins for Photoshop installed, and open it in there. Then you can set about tweaking it. You can use .tga, .dds, or .rot images for fx. I always just use 32-bit .tga.\n\nTo use your new set of colorized effects, you open that .wf file and set the fx you want to change to the appropriate \"top-level cascade\" file. They're usually tagged as \"combo_\" and only have the names of other files in them, none of the other properties you see in the usual files. Most fx will work this way, but I think it's perfectly possible to reference, say, a bullet effect directly, without a combo file. Usually though, you'll want to use combos to get cooler effects. As for which file is referenced in which line...that's rather flagrantly self-explanatory. Bulletfx - bullet effect; hitfx - physical hit; nopenetratefx - shield hit (dff impact?); scartype - scar decal; now deathtype I'm not sure, back in HW1 this was the muzzle effect, though here it might mean the effect run at the end of the weapon's lifetime. Sfx ones are the sound effects for that weapon. I believe you can also add a \"firefx\" line into this file (I would add it by the hit and bullet lines), instead of setting the muzzle in the ship's .events file, and may be able to override it with the muzzle call in the .events file.\n\nThen when we got to the .wf you lost me completly...\nHow does the .wf connect to the .tga file? I couldnt locate that peice of text string. Becuase when i get the hang of it ill make many diffrent colours. BCs with purple... Uber BCs with orange maybe..."

      "text": "Some of these forces I know little about, though many are also dependent on what time frame one is looking at....\n\nBattletech: Is at best in the single digit kilotons (though some high end calcs can put them in the low triple digit kilotons), it lacks gravity generation and energy shields, it's FTL drive is capable but highly restrictive, sub light speeds is restricted to less than 15 gravity's (acceleration).\n\nStarwars: Most calculations often put it in the megaton to gigaton range for it's capital weapons, they have shields that can take this energy and can generate gravity (not to mention a less restrictive FTL drive, thats vastly faster), sub light speeds are hard to put down but in the dozens of gravitys.\n\nStartrek: Most calcs put them in the megaton range, with energy shields ships capable of withstanding these energys, they also have gravity generation for their crews, and a less restrictive FTL drive (though B-tech is roughly on par speed wise), sub light speeds are similar to Starwars.\n\nGundam: using the Universal century figures, they have good firepower but low armor, no shields, low fuel endurance / acceleration rates (Earth to moon ~2 days), they also have no FTL drives nor gravity generation.\n\nMacross: I know little about it's tech but I am familiar with it. It depends on the time frame, by Frontier their fighters have better acceleration rates than B-techs, at the lest their some what better than B-tech in most departments.\n\nZone of Enders: I know nothing about this game\nEve Online: I also know nothing about this game\n\nStarcraft is very hard to get reliable calculations but it's above B-tech but below Starwars/Startrek in the capital ship departments.\nI do know that Terran Marines use a rifle with the effective capability's of a 50 cal HMG.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nThough Battletech dose have some good infantry kits, it's battlearmor is quite good, their ground weapons are powerful but their \"range\" is at the lest problematic. Aerospace fighters are also good as well.\n\n------------------------\nThough it depends on how this brakes down, whats the forces available, all out war? Is this ground combat or space only?\n\ni went with star trek, depends on the faction Borg 8472 or Q. Borg cube and a 8472 bioship can regenerate themselves pritty fast Q simply put, is an omnipotent being, but since its space battles ill go with one of the follwoing two\n\nborg ship's will quickly adapt(a few seconds) to a sheild system and use its cutting beam to slive it up, alternative engage tractot pulse pull it into the main hold, and assimilate its technology and crew, or simply board the ship and take control of it XD 1 borg cube carved its way through federation and romulan territory. entire fleet of klingon and federation ships wasnt able to stop it. (wolf 359)\n\nborg space is vast and 8472 nearly annihilated them in a couple of months 8472 is a stupidly powerful race ships are higlhy regerative pilots or telepathicly linked to the bioship given them a reaction time advantage. there not impossible to kill, just incredibly hard to kill everything and made it a billion billion times more powerful).So before even getting into Wars, we'd have to talk about what to include and exclude, and what to go with over the mass number of contradictions caused by the EU writers not being satisfied with the established lore.\n\nSo setting Star Wars aside for a moment, because it's an unmitigated disaster on the technical side, I'm not familiar with all of these, but here's what I'd consider for some of them:That said, the EVE universe is also clearly very advanced. Like Trek, they pop antimatter warheads like candy, and their other ordinance is no less powerful. Their on-board FTL systems are capable of 6AU/s, which matches the best Trek FTL estimates I've ever seen (backstage or calculated from, say, time estimates on Voyager's trip across the galaxy). They also have a network of very fast FTL conduits which basically surpass anything I've ever seen elsewhere (admitted that that's just to make the game playable), again, save maybe the poor forgotten Stargate franchise. That said, there's little evidence of any kind of abundance of exotic tech in EVE.\n\nFleet sizes for all of EVE come from ~300,000 players, so we'll just call it roughly that many combat ships. That puts the entire EVE universe, across all races, roughly on par with Trek, across all the major players who might take place in any conflict (so no Borg).\n\nOn the whole, I'd probably rate EVE and Trek to generally be on par with each other (with Trek having better exotic tech, but vastly inferior FTL). All of humanity in EVE would probably beat the Federation by numbers, but not necessarily the Federation/Klingons/Romulans and assorted other races who might take part in a galactic war, which might include the Dominion, Cardassians, Breen, and a few other major relatively players.For the anime robot franchises, there's little specific data, but my impression is that, based on what I've seen, they just don't have the energy outputs to compete with the above franchises.In short, wherever you'd fit franchises specifically, Trek, EVE, and Starcraft would probably all fight for the top, while BT would be stuck at or near the bottom. everything and made it a billion billion times more powerful).\n\nDon't like it to bad it's canon, Their are however accounts of the deathstar consuming enough energy firing it's main weapon that would of been produced by a (several?) main sequence star over a week, the Mk II is stated to have been vastly more powerful (IIRC Hundreds of super giant stars). So technobabble or not the power requirements are considerable.\n\nThough it's funny you knock Starwars for this particular bit of technobabble and yet do not mention any of the vast amounts of technobabble that Star trek uses in many of it's episodes.\n\nThough technically IIRC the Death star had hypermatter reactors for quite some time in real life, as even Antimatter reactors are just to inefficient to power the stations planet busting shot (Which is around 1E33-38 Joules IIRC, your looking at a not so small amount of antimatter if it was one). Though hypermatter reactors do use fusion reactors to regulate them (It seems hypermatter reactors are a form of A/AM reactors in any case).\n\nAlso note that even ISDs are said to use more energy in a single hyperspace jump than a planet (inhabited) in it's life time and the bigger ships equal the power production of main sequence stars at full power.\n\nQuoteDon't like it to bad, crying about it dose not invalidate that starwars can be that powerful via these books. Though I will give you this many debaters tend to limit their use of info from the ICS for various reasons.\n\nAlso note lower canon can be over ruled by higher canon if theirs a direct contradiction.\n\nAnd technically your objectivity on the subject can be questionable as well. TheThough IIRC part of the reasoning behind these firepower levels comes from the stated ability of ISDs being able to slag worlds by them selves in only a few hours.\nTheirs also the Dodanna quote which technically would make SW have even more firepower than the ICS values... (SW4 during the rebel briefing on the death star it was mentioned that the death star has firepower greater than half the starfleet... based off the energy used to blow up a planet, and spread it to the starfleet, gives each ship massive amounts of firepower).\n\nQuote\n\nSo before even getting into Wars, we'd have to talk about what to include and exclude, and what to go with over the mass number of contradictions caused by the EU writers not being satisfied with the established lore.\n\nThis is true for MOST series, as even Trek is hardly a bastion of consistency.\n\nQuoteNot really. TheThough even their use of FTL combat is rare and some times contradictory (IIRC theirs even one time where even though they where at warp they where decidedly not at FTL speeds -I.e. IIRC counting down range in ~100,000km intervals every second or so and not sounding rushed).\n\nThough the trek M/AM reactor also uses technobabble as well...\n\nOn the other hand lets not get into a debate with SW and Trek as that road can lead to many a flame war.\n\nQuoteNever assume that when one uses one type of power generation that it must mean they have the same ability's of another universe that has a similar device. Or in other words even if they both have anti mater reactors one could have vastly better power generation than the other. Or one my have anti mater the other oh lets say some sort of fusion reactor and the \"fusion\" produces far more power....\n\nQuote\n\nFor the anime robot franchises, there's little specific data, but my impression is that, based on what I've seen, they just don't have the energy outputs to compete with the above franchises.\n\nMacross can give a decent showing but is not as capable as the others on the list, Gundam is not as capable as Macross.\n\nQuoteI will agree with you their, though battletech can edge out gundam, but its not quite as capable as Macross.\nAnd if you want ground combat it can do even better.\n\nthis kind of topic makes me wish bandai namco would put in battletech in a Super Robot War game...also with macross and gundam in the same game so that battletech meets it's biggest eastern influences.\n\nRemember, the SDF-1 was a small destroyer landed on earth, an abandoned part of the Supervision Army's fleet left as a booby trap for Breetai's Zentradi. The ship was then salvaged and jury rigged together by late 20th century humanity. In its prime, the SDF-1 Macross could fire a beam ten thousand miles long and a mile wide, capable of destroying everything in its path. It also sported the Omni Directional Shield Barrier, which, when it malfunctioned, turned Montreal into a crater. Which is why they continued to employ the essentially impenetrable pinpoint shields.\n\nThis same technology, expounded on by humans, created such weapons as the Grand Cannon, a weapon that was able to wipe out thousands of ships across a hemisphere of earth in one sweep.\n\nSure, the zentradi's planetary bombardment was pretty weak in the grand scheme of planet breaking. But the size, volume, and power of their ships (Numbering in the hundreds of thousands), and allied with the new Protoculture of earth, combined with the techonology that later created respectable fleets of Macross class carriers and resulted in humanity populating a significant portion of the galaxy, probably has the edge.\n\nNebfer, I don't have a horse in this race, since frankly, I think pretty much every franchise here is downright silly in most respects. It's part of why we love them, but it also means that I consider any such analysis to be rather silly, and only half-scientific to begin with, because these are universes where weapons can spontaneously change power, FTL scales can grow and shrink and grow again on a whim, and ships can spontaneously gain and lose size, all for no reason at all.\n\nWith that said, you're grossly oversimplifying, if not entirely misrepresenting, Star Wars canon.\n\nThe ICS books, and any other books along with games, or whatever other material, may be canon EU, but canon Star Wars consists of the screenplays, films, film novelizations, radio plays. This is the canon policy that has been consistently maintained, by Lucas himself, and Lucasarts, consistently, for years.\n\nLucas Licensing has released statements that are somewhat contradictory, but you know what? George Lucas is the franchise owner; he outranks Lucas Licensing, no matter what any of their employees have said.\n\nAt best, anything outside of that, including Saxton's ICS books, can be called part of the EU canon, the continuity recognized by Lucas Licensing, as distinct from what's recognized by Lucas himself, as part of his franchise.\n\nIf you want to include EU, we can include EU in this discussion. I'd be happy to bring in discussions of the Genesis Wave series by John Vornholt, or plenty of other ridiculous tales of absurd forces, but I'm under the assumption we're sticking to strict canon here, such as the novelizations, which repeatedly, throughout (even in the prequel novelizations) refer to Star Wars power generation as fusion, and nothing more.\n\nQuote\n\nTheI entirely agree, which is why I wouldn't use The Die is Cast to generally judge normal Trek weaponry, but to use your own logic on the high-end figures, it's canon, so tough luck.\n\nThe easiest explanation for the TDiC explosions would simply be special ordinance, or it could be a product of the reaction of materials not hardened to the rapid nadion effect of phasers (in use by the Cardassian Keldon class vessels), and the equivalent effects from Romulan disruptors.\n\nIt shouldn't be any surprise, given mention of the ability of simple hand weapons to vaporize entire large buildings (TNG frame of mind).\n\nBut I'm not in the habit of taking wild guesses of how much such things might play into these instances, anymore than I'm inclined to guess on the lower-end instances (the Pegasus episode is a perfect example).\n\nFor Trek, I usually stick to the ~250PJ range for warheads (give or take), since it's fairly solidly grounded in the annihilation of matter and antimatter in the quantities we're talking about, and then just assume phasers have roughly equal effectiveness. It's not a perfect approach, especially because, like any sci-fi, Trek has hillarious outliers on both sides of that figure (and because some of M/AM reactions go to useless neutrino production), but I find it usually gets me by.\n\nQuote\n\nTheIn a perfect world, I might be able to assume that every natural scientist is an objective individual, and that that objectivity extends to all aspects of their lives, but if I was ever that naive, it's been long since beaten out of me by seeing gross misconduct far beyond simple lack of objectivity, by scientists. It's not something I'd attribute to many, as indeed, the requirements of working in the sciences requires those of us in those fields is conducive to objective thinking, but there are exceptions to every rule, especially when dealing with human beings.\n\nIf I can watch, say, Patrick Michaels, walk into Congress and lie right through his teeth to them about HIS OWN FIELD, then I certainly would not put it past an equally passionate scientist to throw mere objectivity to the wind on something so ancillary was VS debates. Put simply, Saxton's status as a scientist guarantees nothing.\n\nHis mere status as a vs debater also doesn't guarantee anything, save the fact that he has never been a bastion of objectivity, and his behavior in VS debates has always been charged and vitriolic.\n\nAnd if you think his figures are merely extrapolations of his observations of canon, then first, it should be noted that pro-Wars debates have grossly inflated estimates from VFX and canonical statements to begin with, and secondly, those figures are irreconciblable with the canon novelizations.\n\nLet's take the Death Star, for instance:\n\nQuote\n\nTheir are however accounts of the deathstar consuming enough energy firing it's main weapon that would of been produced by a (several?) main sequence star over a week\n\nThe problem is that you're assuming the Death Star is a DET weapon; this cannot be the case.\n\nYour figures are actually low-balled (IIRC, the Death star uses YEARS of output from a star), but there's a problem with that.\n\nLet's refer to the Death Star I explosion, from the exploding reactor, as described in the ANH novelization:\n\nQuote\n\n\"Space filled temporarily with trillions of microscopic metal fragments, propelled past the retreating ships by the liberated energy of a small artificial sun.\"\n\nNow look at the phrasing there: the liberated energy of a small artificial sun. This clearly refers to a fusion reactor. If it was just trying to quantify the energy, it wouldn't have used the word articificial, nor is there any phrasing to indicate a comparitive statement to begin with.\n\nBut let's not dwell on one example.\n\nCurtis Saxton has no problem using entirely EU sources that are not part of the Star Wars canon, including magazines, comics, video games.\n\nPro-Wars debates constantly try to claim that Saxton's E2 ICS book was based on careful examination of the film, but nothing could be further from the truth: \n\nBut Saxton also has no problem basing his books entirely off of fan-based inflations of canon, something I don't have to bring up because you already did:\n\nQuote\n\nThough IIRC part of the reasoning behind these firepower levels comes from the stated ability of ISDs being able to slag worlds by them selves in only a few hours.\n\nThis is exactly what I'm talking about. That's not canon Star Wars! That's Base Delta Zero you're referring to, and not only is that is in no way part of Lucas' Star Wars, but in the way it's used by Saxton in the ICS books, it's not even canon EU!\n\nThe idea of slagging an entire planet is a big tall tale of fiction, based on nothing canonical, in Star Wars, or Star Wars EU, that's basically nothing but one big fan inflation to create a tale of something that never actually happened in canon.\n\nIt started as something real, at least in EU, a work called \"Scavenger Hunt\", which described the bombardment of a single Rebel base (not the entire surface of a planet), but the fans cherry picked words, until the tale grew and grew, and Curtis Saxton used it for figures in his E2 ICS book, which was then cited by others... until it became an entrenched part of EU canon, that never really was, and was just made up by some of the more fanatical fans.\n\nBut it gets better than figures that are merely innocently made up out of nothing.\n\nSaxton got help with his ICS figures, by corresponding with other pro-Wars debates, who EXPLICITLY STATED that they were producing the figures they were SPEFICALLY to make Star Wars stronger than Star Trek, in correspondence with the same people you see credited in the ICS books by Saxton (namely, Mike Wong and Wayne Poe).\n\nThat was the stated goal behind much of the work that produced the ICS figures, not to make ICS books that were consistent with Star Wars canon, or that were scientifically sound, but specifically to write the ICS books out to make Star Wars stronger than Star Trek.\n\nYou're right; there's no way to prove my objectivity, but the notion of objectivity underlying the ICS books is laughable at best.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nYou want to discuss Star Wars, WHICH Star Wars? The actual franchise, owned by George Lucas, or the EU continuity, and its myriad of inflated or downright made up figures that don't in any way even relate to the original canon?\n\nWhere do you want to draw that line?\n\nThis is why I pretty much just choose to not touch Star Wars.\n\nQuote\n\nThis is true for MOST series, as even Trek is hardly a bastion of consistency.\n\nTo some extent? Perhaps.\n\nBut no series is self-crippled to the sheer extent that Star Wars is, because no series suffers the particular problems of fan-inflated and intentionally biased figures, conjured up in relation to canon out of thin air for the express purpose of inflation, completely independent of the very canon its supposed to describe, not to the extent that Star Wars does.\n\nWho knows, maybe in a war, Star Wars would beat any franchise out there, but I can't answer a question of who would win a fight with such problems making such a muddy situation out of what information should even be included in the first place."

      "text": "Feedback on Rebellion - Please fix the small things!\n\nDaggaroth\n\nLet me start this post off by saying I have been a long time fan of the sins of a solar empire series, it is one of the few that have kept my interest in the long term and I hope to see it grow and prosper for many years to come with fresh content from the developers and the community alike!.\n\nwith the addition of Rebellion, a full sized expansion to the sins franchise, I would like to ask the developers to include a few small things that are not game changing but I believe would make gamers like myself enjoy the game so much more.\n\nnit pick 1: Sending more then 250 units of resource at a timeReason: I like my large fleets, but when I am creating 100 + of one ship I don't like hearing their spawn audio every 1.5 seconds and I highly doubt many people do. also when a large map is being played and each player has half a dozen deliverence engines or novalith cannons and shells are being lobbed everywhere, a audio notification happens which gets annoying to listen to.\n\nSuggestion: include a menu option to disable spawn audio. and/or include multiple spawn audio tracks for each ship so it does not get so repetitive when building alot more.\n\nnit pick 3: pirates can't use wormholes\n\nreason: It never made sense to me that pirates ( or rebels) could warp in to planets at will but not use wormholes, and on custom made maps where regions are separated by wormholes, it makes pirate raids very limited.\n\nSuggestion: allow for an option to allow pirates access to wormholes for travel.\n\nnit pick 4: Homing mines for the Advent are not built with build mines enabled\n\nreason: when i play Advent, I always want to defend my planets as much as possible, as a result I always put atleast 1 homing mine squad in with my fighter wings, but I typically let the computer auto place them, but i have to go threw each planet, manually select the mine squad and tell them to auto build.\n\nsuggestion: include a menu option which would automatically select auto build enabled when building homing mines.\n\nthat is all that I can think of for now, I hope this is read by the developers and community members who may be more experienced at the game then I am and can add some more ideas to this list. I want to see sins of a solar empire grow and thrive like I said before and I believe that with some or all of these suggestions it will make the game a fuller and richer experience.\n\nThisI understand the concept of asymetrical design in all things but for weapons on a ship I just gotta have symmetry\n\nPersonally I want My capital ships to have symmetrical weapon placements 4 blasters on left and right side that way I can move it between two enemy capital ships and blast at both of them which you can still do without symmetry, and or have it blasting at a bunch of ships that are basically all around. Either put it as an option or standardization.This is the horrible part that just wont happen at all, I always wanted to run around with A Akkan and Radiance battleship capital attack group as to how that would happen exactly either buying it from an ally or reverse engineering.\n\nAkkan and radiance are my favorite Aesthetically pleasing ships.\n\nI hate how theres the type of player the ai will be, Researcher expander Defender. I feel like there needs to be something more to it then just a classic stereotype option, that you or the game assigns to both enemies and allies. also its a pain when an ally has a artificat planet but refuses to setup tactical slots to defend itself from rebels in which case i have to go in colonize it and set up the defenses then abandond said planet and wait for the ally to recolonize. I would like a planet trade, so I can gift or buy a planet from an ally or neutral entity and have co-planets. The ping ally is too watered down. I really want the AI to be able to understand what I want them to do.\n\nLastly I want a Clear Cut Explanation as to If This one ship is supposed to dominate better then this other ship. or if the autocannon fire is more damaging to this or that then the plasma or laser fire and or missiles. Yes I understand that you can upgrade and get buffs. But at the pure basic level I really need the clear cut truth about the damages, Yes I know you can build a fleet of pure combat oriented Kol Battleships or radiance class battleships, however that just doesnt explain anything. I do like being realistic about my fleets im all about balance and so many lrms for so many cobalts I have in my fleet, for example for every 10 cobalts I have I make 4 LRMS or 5 Kodiaks. I really do need the clear cut what works, what does more, damage to what and so on.\n\nAnnoying construction announcements? But I love hearing \"behold my creations\" for the 1000th time in like 50 seconds whenever my desert production plant is running on full steam.\n\nOn a more serious note, if you could decide on the battle chatter level in one of the options menus (disable certain notification types etc) that'd be a help, my friend likes the Advent very much, but doesn't play them very often cause of \"that annoying bitch and her Verona Feldbusch voice\" (not my words, sorry to the voice actor. I like your voice).\n\nIt'd be great if the production infocards showed me the needed money/metal/crystal for 5 ships when I hold down shift to produce them in groups. I can calculate it in my head, but I'm lazy and computers are supposed to make my life easier, dammit.\n\n4) When a ship bombards from orbit the explosion on the planet surface should follow the rotation of the planet.\n\n5) I hate it when missiles just miss their target then rotate round to just miss their target again over and over till they have some auto straight at target guidance.\n\ngreat list. I THINK you can fix the navigation by holding down shift when setting their travel path and right clicking on each planet you want them to travel to. so you can have them move threw the phaselanes in the way you want them to. could be wrong though.\n\nI also highly agree with the planet diversity thing. I think moons would be awesome orbiting a planet, so it would be like having a planet and a mini planet in the same gravity well. add a few extra slots and functionality to that gravity well1) Can we change all the silly special effects. Like giant hands shooting away from my ship..this greatly breaks the immersion factor.\n\nNit-Pick:\n\nI assume this is in reference to the Advent Halcyon's telekinetic push ability? I think that is one that actually has a cool effect...they are psychically conjuring up extra-sensory hands to expel the heathen strike craft, looks and sounds pretty awesome to meYes and I often set my factory planets to rally to my lead attack ship, Titan now, and the route will vary based on where I am attacking and I will find I am losing loads to a pirate base too late.\n\n@Haree78 to each his own I guess. I personally could do without the hands or any other graphic effect besides lasers and various other firepower. possibly a \"realism\" mode that stripped the effects to just combat related ( explosions, debris, fighters moving around,etc) that could be turned on and off with a checkbox.\n\n\"Knit pick 2: annoyingly redundant ship creation / galaxy event / etc audio\" ThisHello Devs,\n\nI just want to hear when my planets are under attack or an enemy fleet is incoming\n\nI really do not want to hear those crapy warcraft-like phrases and its accually a reason not to play soase for long time\n\nI also dont want to hear a crap-phrase every time i click an *~+#ing unitCombat would be more fun, you could actually take on heavy fleets using spread formation, or concentrate your fire without looking like a mass gaggle.\n\n[quote who=\"Haree78\" reply=\"7\" id=\"3124175\"]Definitely would love to see all three of these implemented, especially diversified planets, kinda bugs me, I mean, shouldn't every planet look different? I know that's a lot to ask for, but a couple more skins for each type wouldn't hurt\n\nI forgot,\n\nmy biggest, and the most absolutely insane thing to me,\n\nDIFFERENT RESOURCES, I mean, it might be hard, considering it changes the base of game play, but another resource or two, would definitely add to the immersion and the experienceI suppose you're talking about very large numbers.\n\nJust want to point out in case you didn't know: I think shift-click allows you to send more than 250.\n\nI'm not trying to sound crabby, but the devs didn't make this game to be realistic they made it because they wanted to and they can do whatever they want. There has to be effects for a lot of these things because that's how games work. There's certainly a way you could mod this stuff out if it really bugs you that much but leave the vanilla stuff vanilla.\n\nIt's odd to even talk about Advent effects being \"realistic\" when we're talking about a race that has a giant psychic hivemind that is capable of mind controlling an entire planet's populace either to their side, or into mass psychosis and murder. Or of telekenetically controlling swarms of strike craft from the safety of the mothership, and of storing the souls of dead crews to implant them into new bodies. There's more, of course, but this post would be too long if I listed all of them.\n\nAnd we're not even getting into the implausability of phase jumping and ships of the sizes we have in Sins.\n\nGiant ghosty hands are a very clear and easy to interpret sign of telekenetic pushing, and one that is commonly used, it just works."

      "text": "really... that's like saying a modern-day battlecruiser (we don't have any real Battleships anymore) is always at tactical-station 24/7...i was referencing the second DS too. coincidently they fired 2 shots at it toothe ds is ftl dude, it travelled farther in an hour the ST does in a year.\nand don't forget they always can build several more.\nNow that would be nice wouldn't it. Taking out al important races their homeplanet is a few minutes. except those who still deepdown have a grudge for the ufp. they would be joining fast.\n\nWell for one thing ftl drives are a lot different than stl drives, and the stl drives on the DS are not very good. And also, building the death star took a ton of time, in several years after the first one was destroyed, the second was only somewhat complete.\n\nAnyways nobody really knows what the rate of fire on said superlaser is.\n\nAnd to be honest WH40k has already destroyed a battlestation much more lethal than the deathstar.\n\nIt is called the world engine, created by the necrons, wether it was a planet tranformed to be a star ship, or just a massive star ship is still unknown. But it was easily the size of a planet. No munition could pass through the supermassive shield and no squad could teleport through, and unlike the death star, it was packed with anti ship weaponry so it took on and destroyed fleets of enemy warships single handedly, and second, it's shields resisted solid objects too.\n\nIn the end, the Astral Knights space marine chapter all boarded one of their battlebarges and rammed the shield, as a testament to the strength of the barge's shields and the durability of it's armor, it made it through the shield, the barge was doomed, but the space mariens had already boarded their drop pods and thunderhawks and were already on the surface by the time their ship hit the world engine. Through many daring raids, the last 5 space mariens of the chapter disabled the shield and in their last breath destroyed a score of the necron horde.\n\nAfter that 15 space marine chapters and their star fleets showed up and destroyed the world engine through an apocalyptic orbital barrage. It is a rare day that 15 chapters fight under one campaign, and the show of force is infinitely powerful and there is no force in the universe that can challenge their might.\n\nsi in the end the winner will be the one with the best building faccilities and the most species to fly the ships. it will be a massacre with trillions of lives lost.\n\nno easy win for eighter side. once i tried to determine the parameters of such an engagement, i.e. how much of X of ST would nead to take out Y of SW and vice versa. i even started modding the bridge commander to pit and ISD vs a GCS, using only onscreen visible weapons placemets and firepower. i am still only half way through. you can't begin to fathom how dificult it is to script all those turbo laser turets and phaser arays\n\nHyperspace is an alternative dimension above our own space where the laws of nature don't apply\n\nBut you don't enter it... because if you did relativity would not apply, and thus the stars would not blue shift around you...\n\nas subspace is an alternative dimension below our own space.\n\nNot really... warp is more about bending the universe than moving into another dimension\n\nmultiverse is the theory that for every event that has multiple outcoms for every outcome there is a parrarrel univers.\nso in theory you could travel in a dimention where the bigbang didn't happen yet. or you could be in a dimension where your galaxy is very much smaller than your own.\ntthe point is that it's a theory. no-one has ever been to a other dimension. it's sci-fi even stephen king uses an other dimension in one of his books where a boy switches between his own and the other dimension but in the other dimension travelling goes much faster. If he walks 100meters in the other dimension and swithches back he'd travelled almost 1km in our own.\n\nTrue multiverse theory (of multiple dimensions) implies that every universe is similar to ours with some differences - the more \"steps\" away from our universe, the more differences. One of the biggest differences, though, is the apparent time the other universes are at. Time travels the same pace and all multiverses are the same \"size\" relatively, so how in the world would that work?\n\nexcuse me but that is one of the q's. Q's are pretty racists in my eyes.\nthey are at civil war because of the Janeway incident. with a possible outcome of the univers being destroyed whiping out humanity i don't find that having a vested intrest in humanity. but indeed there is one who thinks of humans as toys. but what if he gets a new toy????\n\nEr... no... Janeway helped END the Q Civil War by convincing Q and Q to have a kid, q... and Q wanted to mate with Janeway first...\n\nPlus Q owes Picard (and he even said he did) for saving his life.\n\nPLUS Q has consistently been shown to help guide Picard (and to a smaller extent, Janeway) when their own knowledge failed or when they got \"too big for their britches\".The reason for it is the Ent-D wasn't a pure combat vessel... if you meet a new race for the first time, you simply don't go running in shields up an weapons hot... that looks far too aggressive. No, you make a diplomatic encounter. Now, standard procedure for first-contacts is yellow alert (shields up, weapons on standby) but Picard has a habit of not following procedure... as you well knowNot really - their radar / conn / sonar are on tactical alert (bridge crew) but the rest of the ship isn't... you can't keep the crew at tactical alert for more than a week or two before it really starts to wear them out...I've been going Federation vs Empire for the most part as we know more about the Fed technology...\n\nAnd again, the Scimitar beat up on the Ent-E so badly because of 4 key points:\n\n1) The Enterprise was holding station of Romulus for a very long period of time - Diana could sense that Schinzon was there, but while they were cloaked the Enterprise couldn't detect him. Thus, he had all the time in the world to scan the Enterprise, especially as Picard hadn't yet gone to yellow or red alert, nor raised shields.\n\n2) With B4 on board, Schinzon had some info he shouldn't have - they mentioned it was transmitted all over the ship and that MOST of the data wasn't classified... who knows what all he sent over.\n\n3) The Enterprise got bitch-slapped mid-warp by a salvo of photon torpedo fire that would have blown many vessels apart at the seams. Her warp core was taken offline almost immediately, leaving her running on backup and auxilliary power only... not enough to fully utilize the phaser systems to their utmost and not enough to run the backup shield systems for the Regenerative Shielding.\n\n4) The Scimitar was a predator, built to capture Picard, destroy the Enterprise, and then go obliterate Earth with the Thalaron weapon... not unlike your Death Star, but far, far more tactically useful. Oh, and without the Thermal Exhaust PortRemember, that invisible ship the size of a small battlestation is moving at almost half the speed of light at impulse, if not faster...Actually, I would reckon a concentrated phaser strike from 1-2 sovereign class starships would do it - it'd be like drilling thru the Death Star to the Core and *boom*\n\nCase in point - in Star trek, we have seen the ability for multiple ships to concentrate firepower on a single spot (First Contact for example). We never saw that in Star Wars... they just shoot AT something as much and as often as possible and hope to god it blows up before they do... if a fleet of a dozen or so ships hits the exact same point on the Death Star in quick succession (within 5 seconds) with both rapid, sustained phaser strikes (full power) and photon and quantum torpedo barrages... I doubt there would be much LEFT of that location... you'd have a small crater there. Rinse, repeat, and soon yer hitting the core"

      "text": "[The Homeworld condition] only counts as homeworlds the origin of imperial/playable species. Is that correct?\n\nI think it should match planets on which player-controlled empires start the game. I'm not sure whether it would match planets on which playable species start if they start as natives, though I suspect it would not. It won't match planest on which non-playable species start. Some of this could be changed, if desired, though., and not for the homeworld test to be completely redundant if archives are present. At just remembered, there is an issue with the current implementation if we want to make native homeworlds significant-- The italic star-name type--which is supposed to indicate a homeworld-- is absent.\n\nGeoff the Medio wrote:...\n\nCouldn't non-homeworld stuff be plausibly rolled into the imperial palace?\n\nAnd since it is likely that a given minor or imperial/playable species will appear in a larger galaxy more than once (until we produce a sufficiently astronomical number of different species), it's likely that some species will have multiple homeworlds. I don't have a problem with that-- or more accurately i think any attempt to \"fix\" it would create a bigger problem. We can vaguely hint that some precursor is behind a species having multiple \"homeworlds\".\n\nGeoff the Medio wrote:\n\nAt agree.\n\nI had thought the cultural archives could be destroyed if population drops to zero (presumably a necessary precursor to a new species inhabiting the planet), but that wouldn't allow the species to take back the planet are regain the \"homeworld\" benefits. So that's not a very good way to simulate \"homeworldness\"\n\nP.S. The universe tables say on \"High\" there should be a native species per every 4 stars. But since species are allocated per planet, not per star, does that mean that on \"high\" ~ 25% of planets should have a native? I'm wondering what exactly it would take to put a unique species on each native world with max settings.\n\nThe universe tables say on \"High\" there should be a native species per every 4 stars.

It means that 75% (or whatever is 1 - native_chance), the game skips the planet without attempting to add a species. If a planet does pass the chance test, then it finds all suitable species (good environment) for the planet and randomly picks one. If no species are suitable for the planet, it should skip the planet.\n\nQuote:\n\nI'm wondering what exactly it would take to put a unique species on each native world with max settings.\n\nYeah. IGeoff the Medio wrote:\n\neleazar wrote:\n\nI'm wondering what exactly it would take to put a unique species on each native world with max settings.\n\nHeh, i meant fair and square without decreasing the number of natives.\n\nI actually misread what you want, but you also may not have understood the implications of my reply...\n\nChanging High to 1 from 4 would increase the chance of getting natives on each planet to 100% (when a suitable native is available). This condition is required since there is no spawn limit property for species (unlike specials... or was it monster fleets?... Something had them...).\n\nIf, as some people have requested, galaxies had much more than 500 stars, having enough native species would require more species. Perhaps an autogeneration mechanism for species creation would be required... EditThere's not much set criteria for what goes in archives vs. palace vs. homeworlds anyway, so it's probably not a big deal to remove the archives.\n\nI'm just concerned with the number of graphics i'll have to make, not how to script it-- yet. Since about 10% of the galaxy is probably uninhabitable Gas giants or asteroids, and 1 out of 4 planets with natives is IMHO sufficient, if not excessive, so i'll round it off and say I'll want to eventually have 1000 unique icons. Or 8 times the current number. Or practically speaking, lots, lots more.\n\nGeoff the Medio wrote:\n\nIf, as some people have requested, galaxies had much more than 500 stars, having enough native species would require more species.

And that IMHO is what galactic exploration should be about.\n\nGeoff the Medio wrote:\n\nEditPerhaps because it would make more sense that a captured Cultural Archives would confer advantages to invaders.\n\nGeoff the Medio wrote:\n\nThere's not much set criteria for what goes in archives vs. palace vs. homeworlds anyway, so it's probably not a big deal to remove the archives.It's not clear exactly what you mean, but would it not be sufficient to have a building only work when the planet it is on is the homeworld of the species that is on it? You should be able to do that already...\n\n...a building only work when the planet it is on is the homeworld of the species that is on it\n\nI haven't the faintest idea of how that could be scripted.\n\nYou should be able to pass Source.Planet.Species as the Homeworld condition's species parameter. So just \"Homeworld species = Source.Planet.Species\" as scope condition for an effectsgroup on the building. Maybe throw an ContainedBy around that (maybe Anded with Planet) if you want to match the building itself, such as for an activation condition.\n\nWho is online\n\nUsers browsing this forum: omgilibot and 0 guests\n\nYou cannot post new topics in this forum You cannot reply to topics in this forum You cannot edit your posts in this forum You cannot delete your posts in this forum You cannot post attachments in this forum"

However, once you get to the stage of building Shipyards (secondary construction facilities), a new level of choice opens up. You will be presented with the opportunity of hiring from one of the four or five Frontier Factions; whichever side you choose will grant you additional build options. Each Faction has its merits and drawbacks, and your choice will greatly affect the outcome of the match. More importantly, your enemies will be making a similar decision. If you can guess their actions ahead of time, you might tailor your choices appropriately... if not, you'll just have to resign yourself to a surprise.\n\nAnd then you can play another Deathmatch, and choose something completely different. And your enemies will do the same, and you just might be surprised again.\n\nSo, what would you prefer? The brains of Chimera Labs, or the brawn of a Pride Mothership? The sheer power of Ion weaponry, or a swarming rush of Microships? Ancient Progenitor technology? Or dalliance with the Dead. Ah yes, the Dead. I'll leave you to discover them on your own. You'll have to fight them, sooner or later. When you do, don't let them touch you.\n\nAnd that, in a nutshell, is what it's all about. Choose a side. Choose a tribe.

Go check them out... after you're done with MW, of course.\n\nThat's weird... it seems like the Filefront upload somehow damaged the download. I've replaced it with a new file and it seems to be working fine- the main link at the top has been repaired, but just in case here it is again:\n\nFurther thoughts: Interesting so far, though I've only played a little of it. AIn particular, I'd recommend trying to come up with new names instead of recycling the old Somtaaw ship names. The HW@ Valiants and HWC Acolytes are both fighters, but that's about where the similarity ends. Certainly its believable that over 100 years that sort of design evolution could have happened, but keeping the same name seems odd. On the other hand it is true that names get reused by militaries over time, but with it happening on both the Dervish and Acolyte, it seems somewhat strained. I'd suggest rifling through some religious terms and picking out some new ones.\n\nOther side note... I was quite surprised at the use of the Recon model, considering its not even textured. Is it even in the build menu in 0.0.4.0?\n\nAnyway, some pretty good stuff. I hope to have more feedback for you later after I play some more.\n\nAWill have to try that. Yes, some maps do screw you over a little bit... there's always the 'random start' button. Mainly it's because editing maps with notepad is surprisingly difficult when you're rubbish with co-ordinates. In a few cases it's intentional, though, to give any CPU players the chance to not behave stupidly.\n\nFeel free to take what you need; anything I've made for this Mod is public domain.\n\nOther side note... I was quite surprised at the use of the Recon model, considering its not even textured. Is it even in the build menu in 0.0.4.0?The second point I thought I fixed... none of the ships originally had gunfire sounds, but I added quite a few. Dervish must've slipped through.\n\nI actually like the MW Somtaaw... their fleet is supposed to look like it's been mashed together from all sorts of different designs. I think this is mentioned (though not dwelt upon) in some of the background material, or else on the website. The new Acolyte isn't even remotely the same ship as the old one. My thoughts were that since the economic collapse of around 59AHL (explained in the backstory), the Somtaaw haven't really had access to the same tech-levels as they used to. Most of their ships nowadays are plugged together from old or obsolete technology. The reason I chose the HW@ designs for them was because of the visible elements of HW1 Kushan and Taiidan- especially in the Interceptor model. The MW Acolyte is a kitbash of leftover parts from this era, so its not so much a design evolution as a throwback. It's actually a cross between Republican Taiidan stock leftover from the first war and second-generation Hiigaran Interceptors. They share the same name, because the Somtaaw are said in... I think it's the HW1 manual... to be traditionalists. They enjoy the link to their past, especially since they don't have the old Acolytes anymore (expensive to produce). Also, I wanted to keep it as a nod.\n\nYou may have a point as to the 'Dervish's' name. I wasn't going to call it that, until I saw it spinning around on the battlefield firing pulsar blasts. It struck me as looking quite similar to the old Multibeam frigates. I figure, if I noticed the similarities, so would Somtaaw engineers.\n\nPreliminary bug report: Unplayable with NLIPS activated, some ships are scaled up enough at range to fill the whole map.\n\nDo you know, I forgot you could even play the game with NLIPS on anymore.\n\nFurther: Chimera Station seems to be mostly lacking a death event\n\nDamn it. I just realised that I accidentally copied over the Chimera Death .Events from Complex- which doesn't, for some reason, blow up. I had a perfectly good death event of my own scripted, too.\n\nThanks, Siber! Look forward to hearing more. Clearly, no matter how many bugs you get, there are always extra.Nah, its still using the original scout texture, and doesn't really even have a finished mesh. It needs review, refinement, unwrapping, and ultimately textured, which is one reason why it wasn't in the build list. Still, I suppose you needn't let that stop you from using it as is if you like it that way.\n\nI'm totally playing this when I get to college and have fast enough internet to download it!Moleman2009 made all of his Beast Evolution mod public awhile back. If you have a .Big decompiler, you can get at the ships and extract their Beastly textures. Although I think I used the carrier wholesale.\n\nAiet, gave it another run... music looping is slightly broken, often times it loops in the middle of building up, which is pretty jarring. Something A third sound related point, did you change the fire sound on the Vaygr BC main gun? I don't remember it sounding like that, but it has been a while.\n\nThe Trader units seem to be lacking interface icons, which is bothersome\n\nA couple design/balance points: The Striker seems to have entirely fixed weapons, which is odd with quite visible turrets. If this is intentional I'd recomend stripping off the turret meshes and just using the fixed forward gun barrels, though the empty pads might look a bid odd. Still, I'd find it preferable to having the completely inoperative rear turret hanging there It'd be nice if battlecruisers weren't an absolute must to end every game. Still, I've only played a handful of games, so maybe there are more tactics to be discovered.\n\nOn the plus side, the new maps are quite refreshing, those I've played encourage a verticality and spreading of forces that HW2 generally doesn't, and your musical taste is admirable.\n\nAiet, gave it another run... music looping is slightly broken, often times it loops in the middle of building up, which is pretty jarring.\n\nAh, so this is universal? Unfortunately I can't fix this, because my HW2 Music.big, or something involved there anyhow, is corrupted... so even normal HW2 music plays in a strange way, often devolving into static during a match. I had noticed a looping problem, but I'd attributed it to this. Is there any way to control looping lengths? There's no command for it in the individual sound .luas.\n\nA third sound related point, did you change the fire sound on the Vaygr BC main gun?\n\nNope.I have no idea why this would be. None of these craft are classified as utility. I haven't reclassified anything as a resource collector.\n\nThe Trader units seem to be lacking interface icons, which is bothersome\n\nOn purpose-through pragmatism. There's no reason they'd share any of the other two fleet's ship chevrons, and I didn't have any replacements handy.\n\nA couple design/balance points: The Striker seems to have entirely fixed weapons, which is odd with quite visible turrets.\n\nThat's odd... I'm sure I've seen those turrets move in combat. I changed the weapon effect, but not the weaponfire itself\n\nThe idea is that Cradles are your AA guns... I figure that given all the extra hit-points, Cradles aren't going to be practically killable by strike-craft anyway. But strike-craft can still kill frigates and gut battlecruisers, destroy resourcing operations and cripple carriers (although the Hiigs have an advantage there). So they're still important, but it's just if you want to fight with a Mothership, you need something of comparable class. By the way, Hiigaran Motherships are still quite vulnerable to Corvette swarms, especially reinforced bio-corvettes. And Elite Bombers are okay against Vaygr missile barrages, because their hulls regenerate. Though don't get me wrong, you're right about Cradles stomping on strike craft. That's their thing now. They're like the queen in chess.\n\nIon and Heavy Missile Frigates can cause headaches for Motherships, if there are a lot of them- MS fire can only deal with one or two frigate class ships at a time, and to do that thet have to focus fire, which diverts the AA guns and exposes subsystems to bomber attacks.\n\nThis is a bit different for the Vaygr. Heavy Shrikes will die straight away when fighting a Cradle, but they can do a fair bit of damage first. And three squads of them will kill a carrier in one. And God Shrikes can kill everything.\n\nStill, I've only played a handful of games, so maybe there are more tactics to be discovered.\n\nI hope so... one thing about the MW mod, I've tried to dial down the strict Rock-Paper-Scissors dynamic. Hopefully, this'll make thing a bit more reliant on imaginative tactics.\n\nHum, There is only one start location in (6p) 2a) The New Frontier. All six players start at the same place and I've always one or two MS colliding each other at the beginning of the game.\n\nThat's completely intentional. See 'Unfair starts' in the Gameplay guide. There are only two maps like this in the whole mod, but the idea is to completely screw the player over from the get go, force them to think on their feet. Unpleasant surprises. The level's not called Welcome to the New Frontier for nothin'...\n\nIf that's not to your taste, you can always enable 'random start points.' Of course, then you risk jumping into the middle of a derelict...\n\nEdit : is the lone gunship in 2c) Gateway an easter egg or anything else ?\n\nYep, Easter Egg. Also, try playing Cathedral of the Dead. The best easter egg is there. Well, there also might be a literal egg amongst the salvage on the Welcome to the New Frontier mission, but I was never able to find it to confirm. If anyone sees it, please post a screenshot.\n\n4a) Stonefalls, isn't there a little too much asteroids ? I've 4Go RAM and I can't possibly run it smoothly.\n\nWow. I knew there were a lot of asteroids (there's a warning on the level-start), but I didn't think it'd slow down a 4Gig computer.\n\nIf that's not to your taste, you can always enable 'random start points.' Of course, then you risk jumping into the middle of a derelict...\n\nAre you sure this option works ? It seems to only circle through existing starting points, so all players still jump at the same place... Should try again though.\n\nAlso, try playing Cathedral of the Dead. The best easter egg is there.\n\nI think I saw it too. I've seen it's salvageable like in the HW2 campaign, does it do anything if you salvage it ?\n\nWow. I knew there were a lot of asteroids (there's a warning on the level-start), but I didn't think it'd slow down a 4Gig computer.\n\nIt may come from my crappy graphic card too. This is the only level that caused me problem though.\n\nOh, anybody fought the Dead yet?I think I saw it too. I've seen it's salvageable like in the HW2 campaign, does it do anything if you salvage it ?\n\n'Fraid not. Wanted to make it usable, but Megaliths can't be given the ability to move. Otherwise they automatically gravitate toward a certain orientation, so you can't have them drifting at unusual angles. You can salvage it, but it just sits there.\n\nWait, hold on. HW2 campaign? Are we talking about the same thing? This easter egg was in a couple of campaigns, but not that one...Sort of. The Dead have a very specific, quite tricky series of tactics that they rely on. It requires a lot of money, but if it works it's basically unstoppable. It won't so much kill you as make it very, very hard for your fleet to win. You'll see if you play against them with lots of resources.\n\nIt's a good idea to kill them as soon as you see them, which is obviously what the other AI did. If you leave them for long enough to build up... well, you'll probably see eventually.\n\n(You can play as the Dead, too, but you won't know how to use them until you've fought them properly).\n\n- Microships are unable to jump using hyperspace gate platforms. Is this intentional?\n\nRegarding The Dead (put in spoiler tags because I don't know how much you want to keep a secret):\n\nTheAlso, in the player info, I can clearly see the unit caps for them, but you apparently want them invisible? And what's with the bottom cap of 2? I haven't found anything that makes it go up.\n\nPlease don't hurt me for saying all of that...\n\nBy the way, the music during the ice level is absolutely beautiful. Could you please tell me who made it and what it's called?\n\n- Microships are unable to jump using hyperspace gate platforms. Is this intentional?\n\nYes, unfortunately. When I tried to give probes hyperjuming capability, the game would crash whenever they jumped. I have no idea why, though, and I'm looking into the problem. Meantime, I took out that ability to stop problems.\n\nNow, as for the Dead... the thing about them is, I wanted them to be a little bit of a puzzle. To use them right, you've got to watch the CPU and build them for yourselves, and then do a decent amount of guessing. But, just so that I can answer a few of Lovecrafter's points, here are some spoilers. Don't press if you think you can work out the puzzle for yourselves...\n\nSecrets of the\nThe CPU can build Slabs, but apparently never wants to. I think this is because all a Slab does is sit there and wait for things to collide with it, so the CPU is understandably confused at the concept. It will build Corpses, trust me. It generally only does it when the Corpse Bay is under direct attack, or else as support units- it doesn't always bother. This is the way it's supposed to be. If you've tried using a Corpse, you'll note that their weapons make them great for disruption and pretty rubbish at targeting anything specific. If the computer builds Corpses, they'll mostly hang around in the wake of the Corpse Bay, in it's tentacle-like tails of debris. They don't have any engine trails, so you won't be able to see them until they attack you. Mostly, the CPU only builds about six of them. They're not that useful other than as a desperate defence.\n\nBut they are funny.\n\nThe computer is using Big Misses perfectly, however. You see...\n\nI assume if you fought an expert CPU with a decent amount of money (the Dead are expensive, you need to be rich), you would've seen more and more Big Misses jumping onto the field. The longer the game goes on, the more show up... sometimes they cluster for a bit, but they'll always eventually spread out until they fill the map. They don't have any weapons, and they don't have any offensive skills. But if you build one yourself, you'll notice they have a red modifier sphere.\n\nAny enemy ship within that modifier sphere will experience a small drop in accuracy and weapon damage- barely noticeable. This is attributed to the morale drop that comes with trying to fight the Dead. But the more Big Misses there are, the more of these spheres overlap. The more they overlap, the weaker enemy ships become- eroding away at their performance. The more of the map the Misses cover, the more enemy ships are compromised. I played an expert CPU on 'uber-rich' once and left the room for twenty minutes. When I came back, the entire map was absolutely flooded with Big Misses. With that many enemy ships around, screwing up fleet performance, you have to spend valuable time trying to exterminate the Big Misses- but by the time you've killed one, another two have usually shown up. And all the time, Sally's will be doing what Sallies do. Which I'm sure you've seen.\n\nThe other thing is, collisions. Enough Big Misses can make it hard for enemy ships to maneuver without slamming into them. Strike craft can't pull up in time to avoid collisions, and if the Dead field gets dense enough, capitals will find their maneuverability compromised. That's what Slabs are good for- they're big enough to effectively 'wall-off' large areas, though they can't move.\n\nSo, that's the Dead in a nutshell. I wanted them to have a very different, very alien pattern of behavior. They just show up, act really weird and at times seem to be following an odd agenda of their own. To play well as the Dead, do what the AI does. Flood the map with Big Misses, which will impair the enemy fleet, then get moving with the Sallies. You don't really need Slabs, which are just for fun.\n\nHere's a hint at their motives; the Dead are debris. When they show up, the first thing they start doing is... building a debris field.\n\nBy the way, I've just realised how obscure this 'puzzle' is. Maybe I should have explained things a little more...\n\nAlso, in the player info, I can clearly see the unit caps for them, but you appareenty want them invisible? And what's with the bottom cap of (I believe) 2? I haven't found anything that makes it go up.\n\nPlayer Info? Where's that?\n\nOh wait. I vaguely remember there being a thing that displays... uh, is it fleet composition? Damn. I totally forgot that display would need editing. I think the '2' is probably the number of Frigate Points/Angel Barracks you can have. The Vaygr can't build them.\n\nBy the way, the music during the ice level is absolutely beautiful. Could you please tell me who made it and what it's called?\n\nIt's by Heitor Villalobos, but I'm afraid I seem to have lost the track name...\n\nWow, I never would've thought... That is impressive. If you really think you need to drop more hints, how about using the \"function\" line (or was it called \"role\"?) under the ship's name and write something obscure there. Thanks for the info!Thanks to a conversation with John Galt, I think I've worked this out. There are a couple of maps that take place inside huge dust clouds; sometimes the clouds are dense, sometimes they're virtually invisible. They will show up on the sensors manager when they ignite in the presence of energy weapons/explosions. They'll also cause minute damage to everything in the sector, much as a smaller dust cloud causes minute damage to everything in its reach.\n\nI've just checked this out and it turns out that Resource Collectors seem to be really sensative to Dust Cloud ingitions; they register it as an attack and don't shut up about it until you move them somewhere less highly charged. Lower strike-craft chatter frequency does silence them a bit, though.\n\nAnyway. Just to say, that's that mystery solved. It wasn't so much a bug as the RCs being oversensative and wimpy. Just so I can be sure, do you remember what map you were playing on?\n\nVery good mod, I like it. The mysterious setting of the dead is really interesting. The first time I read the part of the dead in the vaygr historical briefing my only thought was that I wanted to hear more about it. For that I think a single-player campaign would be really cool.\n\nBut I have a question: If I understood some of the previous posts right on some maps there spawn dead ships that attack all players for example from the dead gate?\nOr were they built by AI players?\n\nEDIT: I think I found a bug: Everytime I play a 1vs1 skirmish game against the AI (Standard Difficulty, Starting Resources: Under Funded, Race: Me and AI Vaygr) the AI is doing some crazy things. It builds maybe 10 mins normal, but then when the AI has built a Capital Ships facility it moves with it's Mothership straight to my location and attacks me with it's Mothership and some Destroyers. I have never seen the AI building a Shipyard and choosing one of the Second Tiers. I tested it several times with the same settings at different maps. Only in one 2vs2 game the AI's have build Shipyards and choosed Second. In Homeworld 2 Vanilla I've never seen the AI doing something like that (and the gameplay for the AI is exactly the same as in Vanilla Homeworld 2).\n\nThat's troubling, but I think it might have something to do with the AI and the money. I've only ever playtested against AIs set to 'HARD' and 'EXPERT' -they always build from the second tier, generally quite quickly. However, the second tier only kicks in once shipyards are available. If the AI doesn't have much money and is only set to standard, then it won't bother trying to build all the way up to shipyards- it'll just rush your Mothership with its own.\n\nI think this is a variant of the fact that in Vanilla HW2, the AI on lower difficulties takes longer to build shipyards. Here, for some inexplicable reason, it gets to a certain point and thinks: 'Hey, why should I bother building a shipyard when I don't have very much money but I do have this great big Mothership?'\n\nI'm not certain, though. Changing the HW2 AI can have very unpredictable effects. It took days to get the AI to do anything at all with even the slightest code change! Of course, that might be because I'm not very good with AI... it really needs a specialist programmer, if there are any out there.\n\nI've definitely seen the AI build from the second tier, though- but not in a 1 vs 1 game. Hmm. Let me know if other settings have similar problems.\n\nBut I have a question: If I understood some of the previous posts right on some maps there spawn dead ships that attack all players for example from the dead gate?\nOr were they built by AI players?\n\nThe Dead are built by AI players. They're a second tier option.\n\nAnd as for a campaign... well, I have some idle thoughts in that area.\n\nOk I will play from now on at hard difficulty. The complex mod has the same problem that an AI on difficulty standard is doing nothing or crazy things. Maybe it's a generally problem with Homeworld 2 modding. But if it works proper on hard or expert it is no serious one.\n\nI will do some more testgames. Maybe you can do some testgames in 1vs1 games, too.\n\nI played two 1vs1 games against a hard AI at the map Jadeth with starting resources set to Wealthy. In the first match the AI was Vaygr and in the second match the AI was Hiigarian. In both the AI built lots of frigates and destroyers and attacked me. But everytime the AI attacked with it's Mothership, but it hasn't built a shipyard.\nBut if I play a match on 2vs2 the AI really works perfectly.\n\nMaybe you can ask Beghins from the complex mod what coding at the AI to do for fixing this bug.\n\nMaybe you can ask Beghins from the complex mod what coding at the AI to do for fixing this bug.\n\nI appreciate the suggestion, but something tells me the Complex team are rather busy with, well, Complex. AI coding for Homeworld 2 is pretty tetchy- I don't like poking it with a stick unless I have to.\n\nI've been playing some matches of various combination- sometimes the results are as you describe, sometimes not. If the money level is above 'rich,' then you WILL get AI shipyards, though. Otherwise, just have a spare AI player set to 'easy.' 2 vs 1 also seems to work out fine.\n\nI do tend to play on Expert all the time myself. I just wasn't such a damn cheat.\n\nPurple\n\nWhere do I find this patch? I have tried but the game can't find the update server and all the downloads I got from googling it are pay to download sites...\n\nLuprica, a forge world on the oposite side of the eye of terror. Contemplating treason and revenge.\n\nI am having problems with installing this.\nI fallowed the instructions to the letter, copied the file \"MothershipWarfare.big\" into my HW2 folder (D:\\Program Files\\Sierra\\Homeworld2) and I patched the game beforehand.\nBut when I make a shortcut by your instructions all I keep getting is this:"

      "text": "Does the AI ever build starbases at stars?\n\nhdaboy\n\nYesterday I was playing Entrenchment as TEC on a huge random map against a single Vasari opponent on hard AI. By the time I had secured my home sytem with 4 starbases at the star, star bases on each side of the wormholes that linked my home system to one other, the AI had pretty much colonized all the remaing 5 stars, so I should have been toast or at least had a hard fight ahead of me?\n\nAs it turned out it was pretty easy - jump to each star with a moderate fleet (3 caps + support) and a construction ship, build a starbase with a construction bay pump out 4 more construction ships, build 3 more starbases, jump the fleet to the next star, rinse and repeat. All the while the AI made no serios attempt to stop me or to build starbases of its own at any of the stars.\n\nOnce all the stars all had 4 star bases then the enemy stars were effectively cut off from each other and I could pour all my fleet resources into taking one system at a time while the AI would send reinforcements in dribs and drabs which my starbases at the star would eat up without raising a sweat.\n\nDoes the AI ever build starbases at stars or even in non-colonizable grav wells such as wormholes? - I haven't seen it do so yet. Is the unfair AI any better?\n\nI've never seen the AI build starbases on uncolonizable gravity wells, star or otherwise. Similarly, it doesn't organize its own offensives against these starbases very well, and usually ends up getting its fleet toasted.\n\nDoes the AI ever build starbases at stars?\n\nOk thanks people. It makes my sp multi star games all a bit pointless then when I can use such a simple, and somewhat tedious, strategy . I suppose I should go back to vanilla sins if I want loooong games against decent opposition, but I do love all the goodies in Entrenchment. I guess expecting an \"AI\" to be able to react to all possible player strategies is asking to much, but the AI seems particuarly uncreative in its approach to using starbases itself or in attacking the players starbases.\n\nIt seems the devs might of gotten ahead of themselves..they are working on the second expansion but there are issues that need to be addressed now. One being all the formentioned posts about lack of ai building sb's in star wells.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that Vasari need a anti-structure ship because the vasari ai will not build a starbase to take down yours. At least when you play against the Advent you have to worry about those star antisructure ships. This is primarily a single player game these issues should be resolved. Ai still doesnt make superweapons, even on unfair.\n\nIf you're looking for decent opposition, then I advise you to come online. I know, I know. You probably don't want to play rush maps that are decided witihin the first 45 minutes, you'd rather play larger maps like the one you mentioned. You know what? There are plenty of people, myself included, that if you suggested it to them, they'll say yes, and do it gladly!\n\nYes, the people online are very good, but we're also very friendly (for the most part), and have no problem showing players who are new to the online community a trick or two. The learning curve online is only as steep as you make it. If you decide to figure it all out on your own, ur gonna get frustrated quickly. If you ask for help, there are plenty of people who will help.\n\nHope to see ya online. If you see Raging Amish don't hesistate to ask me anything that comes to mind.\n\nThanks Raging Amish. Yes online is probably where I will end up eventually - once I have exhausted the possibilities of the AI. At the moment I am still way too much of a noob at this game. Just reading the forums re the great LRF/carrier debate shows me how much out of my depth I would be against real players\n\nI was just very surprised to find that the poor Vasari AI effectively has no counter to starbases - at least the Advent have an anti-structure shipMy point being is at the present moment Vasari ai does not know HOW to counter starbasesI don't know if I'm a better player than I was and I love the sb's, but the ai doesnt give me the same challange as before Entrechment. The devs seem to have a problem with the starbases either being pushovers for online players.....or indestructable when the ai goes up against them.\n\nWhat's the point of the devs moving on to other issues before these are addressed?\n\nRTS ais are never that strong. an ai will never be able to out think and outsmart a human player. The only real way for it to win would be give it a huge resurce bonus. Really Its too bad less people play online. The ai is a joke and will always be a joke no matter how much work is put in it. A computer will not be able to outsmart a human player, and it is too predicitble. the only real way to get a chalange is to play online. There is many helpful people online as long as you listen to advice and imrpove you will fit in well with the online community.\n\nThe devs seem to have a problem with the starbases either being pushovers for online players.....or indestructable when the ai goes up against them.\n\nThe AI needs to learn the following behaviors:\n\n1) keeping its distance: it shouldn't enter weapons range of a starbase unless it has a decisive advantage, otherwise staying out of range and using bombers and/or anti-structure frigates.\n\n2) bypassing: the AI needs to know when it's worth its time to bypass a gravity well and attack the next one. The fact that it never does this greatly reduces the difficulty of defending.\n\n3) ignoring: the AI needs to know when a planet is just too fortified to take down, and instead to find something else to attack. The AI gets tunnel vision, and often you can leave half your empire completely defenseless against it because it refuses to try a different direction of attack.\n\nThe AI will never be a true match for a human, but it could at very least be a threat. Right now its love of the siege frigate and predictable and simplistic offensive and defensive behaviors make it shockingly weak. It's also a poor judge of fleet strength, usually overvaluing its horde of light frigates and seeing them torn apart by a smaller force of lrf.\n\nI just got out of a game where my ally quit partway through and was replaced by an AI, and I can tell you it would be very nice if he hadn't suicided his fleet THREE TIMES against the same starbase.\n\nIt is pretty funny to watch an AI win the game for you though, even if it has a massive advantage in number and strength of ships it will repeatedly beat its head against the same unimaginably fortified world until it has nothing left. It is almost sad, all the advancements in technology and thats the best we can do...\n\nIt is almost sad, all the advancements in technology and thats the best we can do...\n\nIronclad had two very severe budget limitations for developing that AI. The first was monetary; Sins is their first game, and at a certain point they had to say that the AI was \"good enough\". The second budget, and arguably the more restrictive, is the performance budget. The system requires for Sins are low (something done on purpose), and in order for that to work the AI cannot be a CPU hog. It's got to use minimal resources so as not to cause performance issuesIn multiplayer starbases aren't a big deal. Most people end up with huge bomber fleets late game anyways, and you need one hell of a starbase to actually survive that, even with fighter backup. It's the AI that has trouble with starbases. As I said, if the AI knew to keep its distance, bypass, and ignore starbases, it wouldn't be a problemWhat are you talking about?, looks like you're trying very hard to sound like you know better than most how best to impliment strategies. Anyway, we are not trying devise new strategies here, we are saying that the AI can't best starbases. Its too dumb for that. Right now the AI sacrifices high level Cap ships for no good reason, thats the problem! ships shipsI do understand what you are implying by creating a honeycomb-like formation to provide support for the cap ship, but IC is not gonna rework the entire pathing system of the game and the entire fleet management just for this issue. Do you know how many hours of work that would require? Maybe if they did a Sins 2 in a couple of years but right now if you're gonna make suggestions, I recommend making feasible ones. Like Darvin3 said, they are on a strict budget and they are currently working on making the diplomatic expansion so they dont have the manpower or cash to rework the entire fleet management system with multiple configurations just to please your egotestical personality.\n\nThe good news is that you know you are egotestical, so there is still hope for you.\n\nThe bad news is that egotestical people believe they always have the right answer, or the truthIf I read this correctly, what he means by 2-3 paterns is for example;\n\nConfiguration 1: Cap ship in the middle, heavy cruisers in the front, flak/support cruisers left/right and lrm frigates at the rear. Good vs. starbases and heavy fleet combat.\n\nConfiguration 2: Cap ship at the middle with flak frigs at the front, support cruisers/heavy cruisers lerft/right and lrm frigates at the back. Good vs. fighter/bomber fleets.\n\nConfiguration 3: fleet separated in 2 groups, one for distraction/kitting, one for heavy assault.\n\nAnd so on and so forth....\n\nBasically what he is proposing is to have the option to reconfigure fleet formations to face different threats while providing cover for the cap ships.\n\nBTW Darvin3, what you said about chessmasters not being good at military warfare, and vice versa is the best example someone could have made. Just because someone \"studied\" military tactics for 16 years, does not make them good at chess.\n\nGames have rules and boundries that you cant cross. Real military warfare cant be applyed to gaming. In real life there is always the possibility that something \"improbable\" could happen (a soldier is distracted by the tought of his wife, a shell getting stuck in a barrel, a targeting computer freezing...)."

      "text": "Oh I'd be fine with planetary output contibuting to the economy, provided that was actually the case where each planet produced X amount of goods per cycle of time and supplied them to factories and shipyards. Except that isn't the case.\n\nSome Terran sectors do actually have planetary supply (that's what the Lifter's you sometimes see off by the planets are doing).\n\nAre they really going off in the distance, filling up with wares, and coming back to unload their wares at stations?\n\nRegardless, it still doesn't mean anything if the Terran fleets and ships are not reliant somehow on those deliveries in order to construct new ships or be equipped with shields and weapons. Merely window dressing.\n\nTo make it actually interesting for me, whether or not those ships successfully make deliveries should have an impact on the ability of the Terrans to make and outfit their ships, something it most certainly does not currently do.. Other opinions may differ ., I've never regarded X as an RTS. Other opinions may differ.\n\nI wasn't having a go at Falcrack, (although on reflection at looking at my stark question it now seems that way, even to me!) I was more curious (no pun intended) if it was actually true and if I was to say, destroy or board that particular ship, if it would have any effect on Terran resources.\n\nDelete everything from the Universe! Then where on Earth (better make that 'where in space') am I going to land.\nAs for taking a look at the code, no thanks. I can't tell my code from my edoc!The main thing I guess is I would want X3 to have RTS-like mechanics in terms of unit and ware production. It wouldn't even have to have an incredibly huge variety of wares, though more is better and more interesting. An X3 where it is an extremely slow moving RTS because of the size and scale of the universe, and the length of time to produce wares, would be awesome. Even if I did nothing more than fly around and observe it would be cool, but it would be a lot of fun to interact with it even as a small cog in the machine, doing my part to aid one side or the other, or obtain a huge corporate empire and have a significant impact on it.\n\nBasically, in any good RTS, resources are gathered, and x amount of resources are consumed over a given period of time at a factory/bunker, and out pops a unit. I would just want the same underlying principle to apply to both bought stuff bought by the player (which it pretty much does right now), and stuff the AI gets (which it clearly does not, relying instead on free spawning on a massive scale).\n\nWith a good civilian economy which consumes consume end products, its possible to have a nice, convincing economy even in the absence of war and cosntant ships being blown up, though I would like to see wars and conflicts in X3 where the various fleets fighting each other are a direct product of the economy, and intercepting trade ships, blowing up enemy factories etc has a measurable effect on war productionIfI understand your point. I've seen ships jumping all over the Universe yet they don't have a single ecell in their cargobay. Now if they bought ecells then that at least would help towards keeping the industrial wheels turning.Mind you, the real scenery-only ships can become annoying - eg all those NPC shuttles and prisoner transports etc that clog up any Player-owned Equipment Docks and Trading Posts typically set in Unknown Sectors and so with nowhere else for the shuttles to go. I suspect their scripts did not envisage Player-owned Docks etc. (Especially now that in X3AP you cannot set your stations as hostile to races.)\n\n@ brucewarren. Thanks that is a good point. However, I do have trading stations for doing sales to NPCs in that sector too. I want the trading TSs to come in-sector but not the 'fluff' TPs that then will not go away A little challenge is something I like in a game.\n\nI just want the ships and races in X3 to ultimately rely on factory output for their existence (which they don't currently do), thus completing a product cycle which is complete except for what happens to the end products. Make it so that the production of those final products really has meaning, not just for the player, but all the NPCs and races in the galaxy.\n\nIf Rebirth is designed with that philosphy in mind, then all will be well as far as I am concerned. If not, if the end products are simply not used by anyone but the player, and NPCs are free to spawn in what they need outside of this production chain, then it might not be a game for me.\n\nThey could get rid of all the hospital ships and spacefly collectors as far as I am concerned, I would rather have the extra CPU power going into running ships that actually do stuff rather than are there merely to be seen (or possibly boarded).The point is not so much to make it more of a challenege for the player to find trading opportunities (though I would welcome the extra challenge), the If spawning of ships and wares were to be eliminated, and instead made reliant upon shipments by freughters for their use on NPC ships, then that makes it actually important that their freight actually arrives at the destination, and in a timely manner. As it is, it doesn't matter if they die in the Xenon meat grinder because it won't ultimately affect AI ship production or resupply.\n\nThe point of traders should not be, in my opinion, so that a freelance trade ship can buy at a super low price and sell at a super high price at a station the next sector over. I see trade ships more as a means to keep the economy moving and functional than as a way to enrich freelance traders.\n\nI would advocate though that if NPC traders cannot use jump drives, the player owned MK3 traders should not be able to either. It seems ridiculous to me that my traders should be the only ones jumping around the universe trading, while none of the AI NPCs are allowed to do so.\n\n[...]the [...]\n\nBut that's 3x times the work and 0x no fun.\n\nFirst, complicate how the economy works by having it rely on actual freight being delivered, second, complicate the pathing and scripting of NPC flight AI because it now has to reliably pick routes and deliver wares, and third and finally make it the player's problem!!!\n\nBecause the player now has to watch for what the traders are doing, otherwise he loses the economy in his game. It's like having to save the Terran economy in the first 3-12 hours of the game, when you're poor and just starting, because otherwise GOD goes to lunch on the stations and you lose the few rare missile and weapon factories.

This mini-game could honestly be a full game of its own, it's that good – and it gives pretty decent XP too…\n\nBut why describe when I can just show you? Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen (but probably mostly gentlemen, who are we kidding really?) I give you YouTube evidence of the awesomeness that is SWTOR space combat:\n\nThe ship actually has its own \"character\" screen with slots for a fair variety of upgrades including armor, faster (and more powerful) guns and extended magazines that offer you more missiles. The gameplay itself is basically a rail-shooter, though you do have a fair amount of mobility and they do make you dodge the odd asteroid or space-station antenna. You can use the keyboard (or a joystick if you're so inclined) to move independently from your aim point, but it wasn't really necessary for this mission so aside from a few overly-arrogant barrel rolls my ship pretty much followed the mouse cursor. The XP awarded is standard for simply completing the encounter and once per day you're eligible for a special daily space combat mission that grants a fair amount of extra XP.\n\nIn the video I've got the best stuff I could get at my level in every slot so I actually outgear this starter mission pretty considerably. Without the gear, the missions can be challenging and even with gear they're still loads of fun, though your focus does change somewhat from survival to total devastation of the enemy. Odd that a minigame should be my favorite part of a new MMO, but then I suppose I'm an odd sort of fellow."

There's probably not reason for a separate move mode just to get rid of a couple of clicks. Ah wells gave me something to do!\n\nSomehow I missed that. But yeah: we're running out of keyboard space, and my goal is also not to have a lot of new ship border colors. The more colors you have, the more meaningless they all become. That's why we make it so that the orders can all be mixed and matched and queued and all that sort of thing, is that then all the various permutations become possible.\n\nMore border colors! We need party move, where the ships all get a fluctuating rainbow border, and when they reach the destination they throw a raging kegger. We can invite the AI and work out our differences through dance.\n\nThat's what the alcohol is for. Enough of that and you won't remember that you can't dance and/or sing. Unfortunately everyone else will remember it. But you won't have to worry about that until the next morning, when you wake up with a hangover and look over to see an AI Bomber sleeping next to you."

Finally something to do.\nBut i was really disappointed when i found out that all you get from them is Mk IX items.\nI mean they are fun to do but the rewards you get from them are useless.\nAnd i also have millions of credits so theres no point to just sell them either.\n\nIt would find it much better if they would reward you with Mk X items.\n\nThe thing is ... even if they were MK X they'd mostly be vendor trash too.\n\nBecause most RA5's get their gear from requisitions. Especially if they're at the point where they're doing old fleet actions for fun.\n\nIf you got a MK X Postitron Deflector Array ... what would you do with it that'd be any different than a Mk IX?\n\nWell I will break it down as best as I can.\n\nMX X blues arent vendor trash, but MK IX are. This is because MK IX blue = MK X green. This is why, as you stated, \"most RA5's get their gear from requisitions\". However, MK X blues do sell, and are useful, because MK X blues > MK X greens you get from requisitions. The trouble is, the only way to get MK X blues is on STFs I believe. Even random drop world blues (EG one that might drop in B'tran) are vendor crap since they too are MK IX.\n\nAs for the \"MK X Postitron Deflector Array\" you referred to. Deflector arrays are one of the few useful epic items you can buy with the daily mission / STF badges, so a MK X blue array would indeed be quite useless.\n\nThe weapons that the badge vendors sell on the other hand are all antiproton/tricobalt and whatever. The trouble there is you lose so much speccing 9 points in, that to many, it just is not worth it to even use them over MK X greens.\n\nIn a nutshell, improving the loot in fleet actions gives you more variety in productive things to do at RA5 in a game that is severely lacking in them at max level.\n\nA lot of people still use MK X greens. So MK IX blues are just as useful as MK X greens.\n\nThe thing is ... your idea doesn't do anything to make loot more valuable. It just makes it more commonplace and less valuable.\n\nOk so you prefer useless loot, and buying stuff for 10 Million credits on the exchange? okay...\nIts supposed to be a reward. A reward should make you feel good, not meh-useless-crap ... *replicator recycles*\n\nAgree.. i tray SB24 fleet action yesterday.. i went second and i get a MK IX green regeneration shield.. i sell it on the replicator, not even bother to do it on a vendor.\nOk, yes, i was second, but the first one didnt got anything better..."

      "text": "Lasers - Lasers do not cost anything to fire except system energy. Each laser bolt that makes contact with a shield removes one level of it.\n\nBeams - Beams do not require anything to fire except system energy. Most Beams can't go through shields. Beams with power greater than 1 have their power reduced by 1 for each shield it must pass through. Beams cannot miss. Beams can hit multiple rooms in a single shot and the total damage dealt per shot depends on how many rooms they hit.\n\nBombs - Bombs teleport to the enemy ship, bypassing all shields and defense drones; they can still miss the ship by teleporting into empty space where they explode harmlessly. They can't get past the Zoltan Super Shield, but can deal damage to it. They consume 1 missile per shot. Bombs are the only weapon that ignores both shields and Defense Drones. A bomb can be destroyed before detonation by a laser blast or missile that hits the same room it is in, so be careful with timing.\n\nIn most cases Missiles, Lasers (Crystal weapons included), and Beams damage the hull, the system and crew of the targeted room unless stated otherwise in the weapons description. Bombs generally don't damage the hull, and most of them have some special effect (like igniting fires, causing hull breaches, doing ion damage to disable systems, or encasing the room in crystals) and bombs are the only weapon type that can target your own ship.\n\nThe crew damage depends on the weapontype used, beam weapons only damage the crew if the beam directly hits the crewman, while all the other weapons do damage to everyone in the room they hit. Every 1 point of (crew) damage from a weapon deals 15 damage to a crewman.\n\nVolley Control refers to shooting your weapons in the most effective volley possible. Effective depends on what weapons you have, how strong the enemy defensives are (shields, drones, dodge rates, rock plating, and cloak), and what damage you want to do. In general, you want your volleys to be as tight as possible with as little time possible between when the first shot hits to when the last shot hits (assuming no misses). This lowers the likelihood of a shield regenerating. When you fire 3 weapons or more, your more forward weapons will likely hit first. Ships like the Kestrel (either layout) or the Federation Cruiser (either layout) have a good distance between the forward weapons and the weapons in the wings. In order to have a tight volley, you will want to fire the wing weapons, pause-unpause-pause the game until your first shots are roughly parallel with your forward weapons, when that happens, you can fire your forward weapons.\n\nThere are times when you will be better off not having a tight volley. One example would be if you face a manned ship with a level 2 or 3 cockpit, little hull left (2 or 3 points) and the ship is about to jump (screen says 'imminent jump'). Also, the ship only has one shield (you may have partially destroyed the shield already) and you have the Red Tail (Kestrel layout B) with its original weapons (4 x basic lasers). In this case, you are better off firing all your weapons once and targeting the cockpit. With a little luck, your first 2 shots hit. The moment the cockpit is damaged is the moment the enemy pilot begins repairing it. As soon as the repairs begin, the pilot is no longer manning the cockpit, which means the ship's dodge rate takes a nose dive. If the ship has a level 3 cockpit, the ship can still dodge even when reduced to a level 2 (a level 1 cockpit only helps if its being manned; not repaired, and a unmanned level 1 or destroyed cockpit means the ship can't dodge). Your next 2 shots have a much better chance, if not guaranteed, to hit the ship. If you had tried to hit the ship with a tight volley, there wouldn't be enough time between shots for the dodge rate to drop (the game declares a miss before it registers damage).\n\nAnother pair of concerns for volley control are projectile speed and weapon type, but that's more connected to weapon order.\n\n7. Beam Weapons (You can fire your beam as soon as shields are reduced to zero)\n\nWhy use missiles-bombs first.\n\nBoth Missiles and Bombs bypass shields, allowing you to harm the ship's hull and systems directly. They are good weapons to open with because they can soften the enemies' defenses. A successful hit on their shield can reduce their shields by one while a successful hit on their engines or cockpit will reduce their dodge ability. Even if you aren't targeting those systems with your missiles/bombs, the damage you do has a chance of peeling off enemy crew members from those manned systems, which removes the manned bonus. In that case, the enemy loses 5% in dodge or shields regenerate roughly 0.2 seconds slower.\n\nThere will always be a wrinkles and exception to using missiles-bombs first. For missiles, there is the obvious exception involving defense drone. Defense drones have a slight chance of missing an incoming missile, especially in an asteroid field. Also, Defense Drone Mark II tries to stop all incoming projectiles (missiles, lasers, and crystals). You may be able to trick the Mark 2 by shooting another weapon followed by the missile. If you have the Pegasus or multiple missile launchers, you can get a missile by a single drone.\n\nAs for bombs, Ion bombs won't weaken the enemy ship defenses' unless you target those 3 systems directly or the enemy has a Zoltan Shield. However, the enemy medbay or drone room (Anti personnel drones are such a pain) might be more important. Healing bombs have no offensive use unless you have an away party. Lockdown bombs are tricky because they can be used in a lot of ways. You can protect your away team, or deny enemy crew a chance to heal. Also, you can lock the enemy crew out of a room (engines, shields, medbay).\n\nWhy use Ion lasers second.\n\nIon lasers take down then enemy shield, letting your other weapons harm the ship. If you want to stun a system, then shoot your other weapons. If the enemy has a Zoltan Shield, shoot your ion weapons first since they do double damage.\n\nWhy use hull lasers after regular lasers.\n\nRegular lasers don't do any extra damage and only have a slight chance of causing a fire. Hull lasers can do double damage to systemless rooms. Even when targeting system rooms, it is worth using the hull lasers after regular lasers. Hull laser can still cause fire but also hull breaches. Because of the hull breaches, hull lasers can be particularly useful in fights with AIs especially long fights. The AI's can't repair hull breaches and any system with a hull breach is permanently damaged.\n\nWhy use crystals after regular lasers.\n\nCrystals are odd and useful weapons. They bypass one layer of shield. They have a slight chance of causing a hull breach. Both defense drones can stop their shots. This is a great weapon to take out the enemy shield generator. If you have a couple of Crystal Burst (either Mark I or II), consider firing your crystal weapons at the shield room, then use your other laser weapons. If you have a beam weapon, remember it loses power if one shield is up.\n\nWhy use heavy laser after regular lasers.\n\nHeavy lasers do 2 points of hull/system damage, but only do 1 point of regular shield damage. For this reason, you really want them to hit the hull and not the shield. They also can cause fire and hull breaches. When you have a Heavy Laser Mark I and face an enemy with Zoltan shields, use the Mark I to take down the Zoltan shield as they do 2 points of damage to the Zoltan shield and have a very short cooldown (9 seconds at most).\n\nWhy Beams shot last.\n\nBecause shields block them. If during your volley, you knock the shield down to nothing, fire your beam immediately.\n\nWeapons Systems\n\nEvery ship except the Rebel Flagship has a standard weapons system, while the Flagship and both Federation Cruisers have special weapon systems.\n\nStandard Weapons System\n\nThe standard weapons system is indicated on your ship by an icon that looks like two warheads side by side. Like other primary systems (shields, engines, and drones), it can be upgraded to hold a maximum of 8 reactor power bars. Most NPC ships will also never have more than 8, though a few can sometimes be seen with more.\n\nEach weapon requires power, which you can provide with power bars from your reactor. In the ship equipment screen, you can click and drag a weapon from your cargo to one of your weapon slots. A weapon will automatically go into a weapon slot if one is free when you receive it. To power your weapon, simply exit the ship screen and click on the weapon's icon at the bottom of the main screen. If you have enough available power bars, and your weapon system has enough room for that power, the weapon will switch on and begin charging.\n\nSpecial Weapon Systems\n\nThe Federation cruisers Osprey and Nisos have a special weapon called the Artillery Beam. It has its own system separate from the standard weapons system, which appears with a single warhead icon. This system requires reactor power to function. When it is turned on, it powers itself automatically and will fire all by itself without your input when it finishes charging. You cannot target the Artillery Beam manually. Upgrading it allows you to put more reactor power into it, which in turn causes it to charge more quickly. If you take some of the power out while it is partially charged, it will maintain the same charge percentage and continue from that point at a slower rate. If you remove all of the power bars, it will stop charging and you will lose all of the progress it had made. There is a version of this weapon (Vindicator Beam) that operates like a normal weapon, but it can only be acquired via cheating.\n\nThe Rebel Flagship may have a weapon system composed entirely of special weapons; four to be exact. These, like the Artillery Beam, are represented on the ship with a single warhead icon. From left to right, these weapons are:\n\na burst missile system which fires 3 missiles that each deal 1 damage.\n\na giant Halberd beam which deals 2 damage per room hit, but has a beam length greater than the normal Halberd beam.\n\nEach of these weapon systems will fire when it finishes charging. The systems each have 3 hit points in stages 1 and 2 and 4 hit points in stage 3. Dealing damage to these systems may cause their corresponding weapon to fire more slowly. If you manage to destroy the weapon system, that weapon will stop firing until the system is repaired to at least one hit point. Unlike the Artillery Beam, these weapons have gunners.\n\nThere are normal versions of these weapons in the game but can only be found via an editor. It is possible the Flagship doesn't have special weapons but 4 seperate weapon systems. When playing as the Flagship (via cheating), you do have a special weapon but it is like the Federation Cruiser beam weapon.\n\nIon damage disables systems and does not damage hull. If an ion blast hits a shielded ship, it will apply ion damage to the shield system. Ion damage hits Zoltan shields for twice the listed amount.\n\nCrystal 'lasers' have 1 shield piercing and thus ignore the outermost layer of shielding, but generally have longer cooldown than their non-shieldpiercing regular laser counterparts, and more importantly the projectiles shot are considered to be missiles, thus can be shot down accidentally if crossing opposing laser projectiles path, or by Defence Drone Mark I (Mark II. could take down any projectile anyways).\n\nThe Burst Laser Mk I is inferior/equivalent to the dual laser in every respect but two, cost and availability. Dual lasers are neither sold in stores nor found at random drops. The Burst Laser Mk II is superior/equivalent to the Burst Laser Mk I in every respect but two, charge time and availability. The Burst Laser Mk I is one second faster and is more likely found at a store or random drop. Unless you need the Mk I to complete your loadout for some reason, it's definitely worth dropping.\n\n*=Remember, the Anti-Bio Beam only harms targets (life forms and half damage to drones) if the beam hits the square they are in.\nBeam Damage: Damage is per room hit, hitting multiple tiles in the same room counts as a single room hit. Fire beam is an exception to that and has a chance of starting a fire in each square that it its. Beams deal no damage to shields. Shields reduce beam damage by 1 point per shield level remaining. Only the Halberd, Glaive, and Artillery Beams are capable of dealing damage when a target is shielded.\n\nThere are two variants of the Artemis missile. The Kestrel and the Bulwark both start with a special version that has an 11 second cooldown instead of the standard 10 and requires only one power instead of two.\n\n\"Standard missile launcher on most Federation ships.\"Artemis Missiles\n\nCosts 38\n\nFires 1 missile at 2 damage, with low chance of fire and breach.\n\nRequires 1 power, and takes 11 or 10 seconds to cool down\n\nShield piercing 5\n\nThe two-power variant can be found in-game, and the one-power variant is only a starting weapon.."

      "text": "you get in game drops and loot. Take them back to ESD or a frieghter in space and sell the items to them. That usually nets the most Energy credits. Otherwise, press I for inventory. Then on the replicator there is a sell button and you can sell the items but for a lower EC then a vendor. Just keep doing this and the numbers will add up. There is a exchange on ESD where you can buy better weapons and other devices for your ship and your ground toon/bridge officers. If you at level 10 and about to rank up, wait till you get your teir 2 ship and get MK 4 items.\n\nWhenever you find equipment which is rare or \"good\" (by any means) which player's can't by from an NPC, I would suggest you offer it at exchange. You can really get some money by sorting out items of value which you can't or just won't use yourself.\n\nSector Space is a lot more bearable when you get to RA or VA rank.\nFrom there ypu can do the STF's to get the Borg kit (of which the engines allow for Warp 14 in sector space),\nYou can use emblems (or C-Store credits) to get the Advanced Heavy Cruiser Retrofit, which has the ability to transwarp to almost any Sector Block.\nYou got to think of it as the distance you are travelling. Ff it takes 30 seconds to travel the distance light would take 5 years to travel, you are going very quick!\n(technically you are not moving at all, space is moving around you. but that is a whole other discussion.)\n\nFor good weapons (and making good credits) i would recommend starting on crafting. It is a must have for end game in my opinion and you can always craft items to sell on the exchange for some cash.\n\nOff topic, but speaking of Sector Space, when trade ships (like the S.S. Azura) go to warp in sector space, what is going on there? Going to warp while at warp seems strange.\n\nI know that sector space travel seems at least a little bit faster to me if I have the throttle all the way up and my power is diverted to engines.\n\nIt's not a huge difference, and I could be imagining it.\n\nAnother thing you can do that helps over the long term is to do non-combat missions that give you Diplomatic experience (like Aid The Planet and Exploration missions). As you rank up as a diplomat you get access to Transwarp destinations that can jump you directly to certain Starbases. Just like the Transwarp to ESD power that everybody gets.\n\nOver time, you earn Bridge Officers as a reward. They can be assigned to positions on your ship and give you access to clickable powers. These are very important and get only more important over time. You can train your Bridge Officers in Earth Space Dock. As early levels, you will not have many bridge officer skill points to train them, so use them wisely.\n\nIf you have trouble in space, a few basic guidelines:\n\n1) Running 100 weapon power and 50 shield power is usually a good choice.\n\n2) From the Engineering Bridge Officer powers, Emergency Power to Shields is a very powerful shield buff. It gives you damage resistance, which means you take less damage. Coupled with 100 weapon power, this means you can usually kill your enemies before they can deal any significant damage back to you. At Levels 1-20, most ships can only have one Emergency Power to Shields. That means that you will be protected for about 30 seconds, and unprotected for 30 seconds (assuming you managed to max the skill). At Levels 11+ with a Cruiser or Level 21+ with any other ship, you can have Emergency Power twice. This will give you round-the-time protection. While you don't have two, just remember to have he skill ready before you enter the next combat.\n\nDo you have consoles equipped? Are you using your Bridge officer abilities during fights? These tow things I wasn't aware of when i first started and I was dying far to often. Also remember to use your arrow keys during space combat they control your shields. I run my weapons on full with shields next. and I run at 35% throttle when fighting for maneuverability. You may already know this. But It was like discovering plutonium for the first time for me."

      "text": "Is there any reason why ships don't have physical launchers on the ships but they have turrets all over? It seems odd when you shoot, say 3 missiles and they all seem to come out of the same launcher. Or 7 on a drake and it looks like one launcher firing 7 missiles together rather than 7 separate ones considering how large each launcher is supposed to be.\n\nAlthough its quite minor, I think it would look a lot cooler if missiles fired from separate launchers from different parts of the hull on the ship.. I think all the ships that utilize missiles have the room for missile mounts on them, or at least firing from different points on the ship using hidden launchers like a F-22 Raptor's underbelly and side bays. The drake sure looks like it could open up 7 or more bay doors when missiles fire.\n\nA blob of missiles is so much less appealing than different firing patterns unique to each ship.\n\nOriginally by:Amy KeiInfact, missiles never miss, they just can do no damage. In the end, the missile goes from Point A, to Point B.\n\nThere is so much wrong with this statement all i need to do is quote it to emphasise the incorrectness.\n\nBut since i'm nice, Missiles Miss alot. Mostly when they fail to reach their target.\n\nI agree with you concerning the missile damage, effect etc., but regarding the animation involved with missiles... last time I got shot at, I had the impression that even missiles that would explode before really hitting me due to range limits showed an animation of it exploding against my armor. In fact, even looking like they were exploding and hitting me, no dmg was done (that´s when I figured out that they were out of range).\n\n ratherI'm only really suggesting a visual change, I wouldn't even mind a single launcher, at least it wouldn't randomly spawn at the center of the ship. I'll just think of it as each launcher enabling another tube on the \"main\" launcher, each ship with a maximum tube amount corresponding to its launcher capable slots. Either a 360 mounted launcher(s) (Top and bottom of ship) or something like a turret that turns really fast, something visually appealing while also wouldn't change the calculations. As it is, It looks really weird having missiles fly through a ship, rather than above or below it cause they have to spawn at the ship's center. Or even from its sides....\n\nOr we can have ONE massive launcher that shoots off missiles like a gatling gun. It shoot one off, rotates to another barrel and fire off that one or just launch one massive volley from all the tubes in ripples or a large cicle shaped blob of death.Originally by:Jonas WinchNot sure if it's been mentioned here, but do do look closely at Drake's sides.\n\nWhat do you see?\n\nIs dat sum launchors perhaps?\n\n*imagines missiles being launched from them*\n\n*dies with a smile on his face*\n\nMost Calamari-ships and some Minmatar-ships have launchers or launcher-tubes integrated into their hull-textures, though the most obvious might be the Drake.\n\nOriginally by:BlastilAs much as I'd like to see it.\n\nAnd I think, that you're wrong. If you ungroup your launchers and shoot all from one spot, it causes exactly the same cpu-power-demand both from server and client as it would with firing each missile from a different launcher. Even if it causes much \"power-loss\", it could be actually solved like it is with turrets: Only those are shown and used, that are on your ship and the ship you're currently \"looking at\". Aside from slightly different starting positions, it could be limited to a mere animation-difference on the clients-ide, while it only keeps relative track on the server-side (the difference on the exact impact-moment would be hardly noticable).\n\nI think it is actually quite possible, that no \"real launchers\" (similar to turrets) were introduced, because of the hull-textures (most ships do not have any obvious missile-bay on their texture, even if they have missile-slots) and extra bays on, let's say a drake, would look... rather odd.\n\nOriginally by:WhiteWarpIf it aint broke, don't fix it (or it will soon be broken.)This is a pointless statement.\n\nEve graphics in '03 weren't broke, what was the point of upgrading to trinity graphics when there was \"no sufficient gain\".\n\nIt's all about aesthetics, and the fact that CCP can't somehow get over this seemingly impossible task of updating the missile graphics is pretty lame tbh.\n\nIf the \"object\" thing is a problem, why not keep that system but change the visual effect, e.g. firing effect you see missiles come out of seperate tubes and then form into the one blob etc. etc.\n\nWith all their prowess for programming at CCP, surely they can figure it out\n\nThis thread is older than 90 days and has been locked due to inactivity."

It pretty much confirms my suspicions.\n\nAs such, I would like to pose the question - why is it, then, that Sensor Analysis is looked at as some uberpower? I remember many debates about the Science Odyssey having it, and a number of people stating that anyone who knows anything about how the game works would pick the Science Odyssey for just that reason. It baffles me because it seems that it's got the \"market\" for DPS nailed down to one specific situation. While it's great for wailing on a Borg command ship or the gates in KA, it doesn't seem to do all that much to tip the balance insurmountably, and definitely doesn't seem like enough to get everyone in arms over it like they were.\n\nCan someone explain this to me please?

      "text": "(solo) camping Jump BridgeThanks for any info\n\nDon't think its a good idea to camp a bridge with a dictor solo.\n\nDo it in a bomber and go for soft targets, you should get a few vollies off before the guns lock you up. If you have friends, bring a cloaked dictor just off the bridge. Warp in rapiers and bombers out of bubble range, drop the bubble and mwd out to an offgrid spot when something jumps in.\n\nI've had a lot of success camping jump bridges solo or with small groups using grid fu in the past. Set up a grid wall along the path of alignment between the bridge and a gate or the like (did this when two bridges could still be in one system and it made sense to set up between them). Using a dictor and a scout of some sort, wait off the POS grid in a pocket grid (or cloaked) and drop a bubble on the POS grid when you have an incoming target. Then burn back across the grid wall. Because of the way people decelerate out of warp, they land off grid from the POS and you can engage them without worrying about the defenses. The advantage to this technique is that it really confuses most people, and if something goes awry you can move back across the grid wall onto the POS grid to break locks and warp off.\n\nA simpler method is just to extend the POS grid out past the 330km activation range of any defenses and bubble there.\n\nAt first I was like \"damn what sorcery is this...\" but then I found the old gridfumanual2.pdf and was like \"holyshit that's ingenious\". Specifically the bubble stopping thing which would stop the perpetrator inside the off-POS grid.\nI'll have to try that out and see how much of a hassle it is to make it work.\n\nYou mention 330km off POS - is that the general max locking/module reach distance?\n\nYeah, it was basically a random idea I had after reading the gridfu manual. The initial idea was simply to use the gridwall to stage behind so that incoming traffic from the jump bridge didn't see you there and report in intel what you were doing. The first time we bubbled on the POS grid we had a hard time figuring out what happened to the guy we were trying to catch until I tuned my dscan down to 50kms and realized he was right over the grid wall. Amusingly, I think he was so confused that even though this took us a good 20 seconds, we still caught him.\n\nIf you feel like putting a lot of setup in, you can actually anchor a bubble on the pocket grid to keep fast stuff from warping off immediately, and lay out decloaking cans and whatnot like you would for a traditional drag bubble camp.\n\nAs for the 330km range, that's the furthest activation proximity of any POS module. Activation proximity is the range within which a POS module will auto-aggress. If there's a POS gunner manning the POS, the effective range can be much further. It's important to note that this is the range from the individual modules, not the tower. So be careful of that. Only long range mods reach the full 330km, small guns for instance are only 90kms if I recall correctly.\n\nAs far as difficulty of set up, it varies moon to moon. Some grids manipulate differently than others, but there is always a fair bit of groundwork. The technique I used was to find the bridge you wanted to camp via dscan using a covops. If you don't have intel on where the bridge leads (and this can be useful for picking a bridge worth camping), you can warp to 0 on the bridge and right click to find out. In any case, bookmark the bridge module and then warp back to it at 100kms from the point you want to intercept traffic from. At this point align back to your origination point and travel till you drop off grid from the POS, which is normally 270kms from the tower. That is the natural grid boundary.\n\nOn the easiest of POS grids, you can now drop a jetcan on the new grid and align back to the jump bridge. In the easy situations, the POS grid is not able to shrink from that direction and you have already set up a grid wall that can be traversed back and forth. Often, the POS grid will have collapsed and you will have to find the new grid boundary and repeat the procedure. The best attribute of collapsing the POS grid in to create a wall, is that you leave no objects on the POS grid to orient incoming traffic to your presence or position.\n\nIn some cases, we had to create a pocket grid ~500kms from the POS grid boundary, and then expand the POS grid out to create a gridwall further in. But this was tedious and caused a lot of issues. To clarify, a grid wall is created when you can drop an object at the edge of the POS grid without causing the grid to expand. If you just burned out to the grid boundary and dropped a bubble, you would expand the grid out another 250kms. While this would be fine for engaging targets so long as it is outside the activation range of the POS, it lacks much of the elegance of creating and using a grid wall.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that when I did this about a year ago, it was against ev0ke when they still held sov in Cloud Ring. They caught on very fast and formed rapid response fleets. That being said, I imagine most organizations with bridge networks are more likely to be confused and slow to respond.\n\nWhile we're on the subject, one thing we always wanted to accomplish but never had the opportunity for, was to use this technique with bombers to obliterate a battleship fleet. One of the issues was having intel on a staging fleet in time, another was bomber pilot availability, and the real kicker was the lack of BS heavy fleets before the alpha doctrine really took off. At least amongst available targets when I was in a shitty NC alliance\n\nAnyway, the idea was to set up a grid wall on a bridge as stated above, and do it in preparation of a reinforcement or other large sov warfare fleet that was almost certainly going to move via the bridge. Then take advantage of the fact that a) bombs cross gridwalls prior to detonating, b) most sov scrubs don't turn on things like damage controls, hardeners, and warfare links are inactive while being fleetwarped to jump bridges, and c) catching a BS fleet in such a manner that they are all clumped together in a predetermined spot.\n\nSince bombs travel across gridwalls, the target fleet wouldn't have the full 10s to even notice the presence of the bombs before they exploded and the bombers themselves would never be exposed since they'd launch from off grid. Ideally a double bubble (or two dictors) dictor would be able to bubble both on the POS grid and on the pocket grid for added hilarity.\n\nThis would also only require the smallest number of bomber pilots to accomplish, making it more likely to guarantee that the enemy fleet wouldn't have intel on what you were doing beforehand.\n\nAnyway, slightly off topic but it's never something I had the opportunity to set up and I'd love for someone to do it successfully. For the lulz.\n\nA) anything you can instapop with a bomb you can probably kill with torps, or it isn't worth your time.\nB) you can only carry a few bombs, and will quickly be out of ammo\nC) your target selection is much lower as you sacrifice dps, tank, or both to fit it.\n\nMy above two fits are designed for maximum dps on a single target.\n\nWith the above fits you can engage anything from another covops up to a battleship. Cruisers are much more situational, and in general stay away from HACs or most t2 midsized ships as they will FUCK. YOU. UP.\n\nI will elaborate more on the actual usage at the end.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n2. - Bookmarks\n\nYou will require 3-5 bookmarks per JB you plan on camping.\n\nThe first should be of the POS itself. You can use this as a general reference point, a safepoint(you have the PW right?), and an easy bowling warpin point if you see someone afk inside =)\n\nThe second and third should be locations between the POS itself and the JB. They should be no more than 20 or so km from the JB, and should be as close to the edge of the shields as possible. It is adviseable to have as many of these as possible as after several hours of gankage I've had entire fleets trawl around dramiels with drones trying to catch me-dont use the same spot all the time.\n\nThe 4th should be a spot above or below the POS and at least 150-200km from the jump bridge itself. I have had hostiles rapecage their own pos many times hoping to land me in a bubble and uncloak me. Use this spot to check for bubbles, and if it's clear, warp down to one of your safes on the JB.\n\nThe 5th is somewhat optional - the JB itself. If you're absolutely nuts like me, you may want to go back and scoop the lewtz. A bookmark of the JB itself is handy as you can warp out and come back to the JB at zero easily and scoop/destroy wrecks.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n3. - Meta\n\nAfter selecting an alliance, you should know what will be going through this jump bridge. Know which alliances to engage, and which not to.\n\nIf I see a drake coming through that's from a main sov-holding pvp alliance, I will hesitate to engage it. If it's a drake coming through from a renter alliance, I'll engage it in a heartbeat (with the usual precautions ofc).\n\nALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS know the password to the JB pos. This is extremely important as outlined below.\n\nA spy in their intel channel also helps out a ton. I don't know how many times I was saved by my spy last time I did this. Listen in the intel channel for \"I'm going through in a bait tanked xxx specifically tanked against his dmg, yyy\"(stealthbombers are VERY easily tanked if you know what you're looking for....one dmg type ftl).\n\n-------------------------\n\n4. - Application\n\nSit cloaked in one of your spots around the JB, if possible move around so when u uncloak it's not exactly on your warpin.\n\nWait for stuff to come in, if it looks engageable, shoot it.\n\nI typically engage any t1/t2 hauler, t1/t2 mining barge, or covops without worry.\n\nBattlecruisers can be engaged, but be EXTREMELY wary of them. Hurricanes will generally fuck you up unless theyre a nub pilot from a renter alliance(know thine enemy alliances). Drakes take full dmg, but can sometimes out tank you unless you're in a purifier. Ferox's are generally an easy kill, as are blaster brutixes(blaster range still sucks). Avoid laser ships like THE DEVIL. Harbingers not only melt your buffer, but typically have a solid enough tank and low enough sig that you won't be able to gank them before you die/have to gtfo.\n\nThe same applies to BS, engage at will but know when to draw the line. I have solo'd and almost solo'd many BS, including a nightmare(one of the one's I solo'd). Your damage is very solid for your size, and almost noone expects their BS to be in any danger on a JB.\n\nCruisers in general are a mixed bag. Shield tanked ones(Caracal, Blackbird) are typically easy kills and/or can't do much dps to you at the range you're at(beware the AM Caracal if it starts burning at you and you start taking dmg). Omens - See harbinger, but if it looks nubby engage at will. Arbitrators and Vexors will generally have a low enough sig that you do shit dmg, and their drones will eat you alive. Pretty much if it's armor tanked and has any way of hitting you at 20km, do not engage.\n\nInterceptors and faction frigs depend on how high their sig is, and if they look stupid enough to run their MWD straight at you.\n\nWhen you uncloak to engage, the first thing you need to do is turn your afterburner on, and start burning parallel to the shields (preferably keeping the target within point range) you may have to tack back and forth or up and down the shields. This both increases transversal for the POS guns(which generally can't hit you as long as you're moving) and increases transversal against your target should it turn out to be capable of raping you.\n\nIf the target somehow manages to start dealing DPS high enough to kill you, simply spam approach on the POS, have the PW pre-entered, and laugh as they accuse you of HAX in local. Once you're inside the shield, wait til nothing is pointing you, and then warp out. Warp back cloaked to one of your safes(preferably the 200+ one incase they bubble up) and then back down to the bridge. Beware - do not delay too long as CCP doesnt really like fixing bugs in their game - I've died up to 10km inside a POS's shields to pos guns and other players outside. It's pretty much a tossup as to when ppl lose their locks once ur inside the shield. In general if you start taking dmg and the target isnt already/almost dead, gtfo.\n\nFor longer fights don't be afraid to dip in and out of the POS shields to have them/pos jammers lose lock.\n\nI'm sure I forgot something as its now 3:15 AM my time and I just got off a 10+ hour shift at work, but you get the general idea. I have a shitton of fraps I should probably release sometime(~my pvp vid backbone~) that includes most of my POS ganking that I did, including some nice footage of some epic kills.\n\nIn general, don't worry about losing bombers as it can and will happen. Your epic kills will easily make up for it and depending on what you kill 1-2haulers or any targets in general will make up for your loss efficiency wise.Ofc with my next idea/ship I'm totally breaking that idea but.... :P\n\n-LS\n\nRage ammo is just because I copy pasted from the hound thread, bane ftw. Agree about the named point but I think you could still pull it off."

      "text": "Topics - Philo\n\n is distribution with\n\nI think there's a bug or something to do with how many Stealth Battleships the AI gets. In our current game we have an AI Progress of 340 and the AI has about 5-20 Stealth Battleships on each planet. I think it's a bit too much. Since the cap for human player is like 4 per mark level and they're very expensive I don't think the AI should get that many.\n\nIt's getting pretty hard to get through anywhere since these monsters are so effective at destroying anything they come by.\n\nWell in our game we have both of the last core reactors on different parts of the galaxy. The other one 9 hops away and the other 5 something. Got the core reactor 9 hops away by first going with force with an armored golem and some fleet to destroy the tachyon guardians and most of the fleet and guard posts on the planets on the way, left the CS's intact though. Then with cloaker starships sneaked some Colony ships on the planet, made a CS and took the core reactor out.\n\nNow this sounds pretty simple but it took about 2 hours to actually do this. And I might have to do this on a smaller scale again on the other core reactor. --\n\nAnd to top that, both homeworlds are right now about 10 hops away, each in totally different direction. Right now we have about 25 planets. --------------------\n\nSo, a few patches that I think would be nice to lessen micromanagement.\n\n1. The auto-build remains rebuilders/engineers doesn't work on allied planets, only on your own. So if you have turrets on an allies planet you always have to make sure to manually reconstruct engineers and remains rebuilders there. This should be fixed.\n\n2. There should be an option to auto build energy reactors on your allies planets as well. Since you almost always have to do it anyway.\n\nAs well polished this game is, managing the amount of power you have is really not that well thought out. Or rather, it lacks a good interface.\n\nFirst of all, I can't directly see how many Mark III power plants I've built on the galaxy. Or rather, I can't see at all how many power plants I've built all in all.\n\nSo say, I have a 200 000 excess power, and I remember I had a Mark III power plant made somewhere. I have to manually skim through each planet on the galaxy view to see which one has 3 energy reactors. And then, I have to pick energy reactors from the list, pick Mark III energy reactor and put stop in it. Now I have 110 000 Excess power. I then need to manually turn off many of some of the mark II energy reactors which is really tedious micromanagement that I'd rather use for something else. --\n\nJust make a simple interface from the CTRLS view where you'll be able to turn off Energy reactors at will without the need to manually visit each and every planet.\n\nBeen playing against a AI lvl 6 and 7, and we still get beaten by the exogalactic waves. The first waves aren't that bad but after some hours it starts to be \"6-12 massive ai ships en route to destroy you\". How do you survive these?\n\nWe had to switch from playing against 7 and 8 AI because these waves just kill you. The waves always have mark IV and V ships too. They just chew up fortresses like nothing. I dunno, the other part of the game is not that hard, the exo waves are a real killer though.\n\nJust played our game \"almost\" through. We stomped everything except for the last main base and had everything secured. 5000 troops, Superfortress, a lvl 3 fortress and a million turrets guarding the only planet leading out. The AI just amassed an Armada of ships, there was nothing we could do.\n\nOver 30 starships came in each wave. Around 24 of alien starships which I figure is Spire and Zenith starships. And 400 troops of mark V ships. The waves came in every 30 seconds or so. In an hour we had lost all our planets and every planet had about 100-400 mark V ships with lots of starships.\n\nI mean yeah, the AI progress was almost 2000 but the AI shouldn't be able to amasss such an army from just one planet, it's a little bit more unfair than the usual unfairness that there is in this game.\n\nI've had 4 golems in the last game I played. All were killed very quickly. Got two Artillery golems, a regen and a botnet golem. Not at the same time on the game ofc. Out of them only the Artillery one seemed to have any use before dying. The other ones just were killed instantly. Even when I sent them with 500 troops against like 200 AI troops.\n\nHow much do you need to micro them to keep the Golems alive? I don't find them that useful for me since usually in a few seconds they're down to like 10-30% health.\n\nThe 5000+ cross planet attacks etc. sound very scary but actually are not since the AI carriers are so dumb. How it basically has went down for me is they have maybe 2000 troops at large or less, and the rest are in carriers.\n\nBut, when I bring my troops on a planet to battle the AI the carriers somehow just wait there and don't try to go after any of my key planets or unload at that planet to assist the battle.\n\nSo basically I bring my own 5000 troops to defend against the 2000 AI + 3000 in carriers, and when I've dealt with the \"ground troops\", I shoot down one carrier, now 5000 my troops vs 1000 AI. I take them down, now there's just a few carriers left which I also take down one by one.\n\nAnd my losses in that battle will be very marginal because I always overpower their ground troops by at least 2 to 1 but the losses for AI are huge.\n\nFor people new to AI Wars, what AI Eyes do is they will spawn more troops for the AI if you go 2x over the troops they have on the planet. So say, they have 100 dudes over in their planet, if you send in 201 people, the AI Eye will start spawning more fleet for the AI. ---\n\nAs of this moment in all of my games, AI Eyes are spawned on around 60 of all the 80 planets. This really makes the game feel repetitive cause you always have to deal with the planets in the same manner.\n\n1. Send all bombers you have and a distraction fleet with them so the bombers don't take all the damage. The distraction fleet can't be good against dealing against the AI troops since this will diminish their numbers and the AI Eye will spawn hell on you. Rather send in a very crappy army + bombers. 2. Bombers are probably able to take out about half of the guard posts in that planet 3. Rebuild bombers and repeat.\n\nDealing with AI Eyes is REALLY grindy. Cause you almost never are able to take out all the guardposts in one go AND you can't afford to send in a complex fleet of any kind because then you will go over the double limit AI Eyes have and it will spawn free bots against your fleet. I'm sure everybody's also had to deal with sending a fleet in that doesn't go over the AI Eye limit and then watch as the AI uses almost all of their fleet on that planet to attack your base which in turn makes the AI Eye spawn a huge free defensive army for the AI on the planet. And if your troops were already deep in territory with the AI Eye now blocking escape back to your own planet you can say goodbye to them.\n\nI think the AI Eye is a fun concept if it was special event. Like if there were only a handful of planets say 10 in the whole galaxy that had em'. But now it really feels like your huge fleet is always just standing there as you send in a wave of 200 dudes at max. AND, you're never really dealing with looking at, hey, what is their fleet comprised of in this planet? Should I send in more of these dudes to counter those? No, you're always forced to send max bombers to take out the guard posts as fast as possible so you can send in your main fleet.\n\nI don't want to worry about sending in a fleet that WILL destroy the enemy cause the Eye will just spawn more of them. Isn't finding a good fleet composure that kills the enemy kinda the point anyway?\n\n- Player Home planet under small attack \" Keep it cool, we won't lose here\" - Player home planet under medium attack \" All cannons load... fire!!\" - Player home planet under heavy attack \" We can't fall now!! All units, engage the enemy!\"\n\nI'm sure not everyone would appreciate this, and it would be some work to be done. But in my opinion it would make this game just that little bit more lively, that feeling that you're actually fighting for the survival of the humankind. Btw, I'm not saying the lines should be precisely that what I just wrote. They could be comical, dramatical, overplayed, cheesy, hell whatever. Even better if it was a mixture of all of them."

Orks are so predictable that you can build only anti-infantry/anti-vehicle weapons against them and win without breaking sweat lol. That's because they WILL always try to swamp you in melee and then proceed to build their Relic unit(forgot its' name-Battlewagon?)-a rather predictable strategy. If you REALLY want to do sth. with your AI you have to do it the way Thudo did it for DoW1 and that means programming AI to use multiple, random selected strategies. Orks, for example, could go Bad Moonz way and just go overboard with ranged units or they could try to prove their mettle in melee the right and proper Goofz way...\n\nwell you will be missed,as you of anyone can agrea with me when i say :you have the best ai in any mod:And if no one does ill take it over.\nbut it would be of course until i have alot of uw work done and finished.But im shure someone will get this mod .but if not ide hate to see all your work go to waste....if it does and no one answers your call ill take it over as a side project.And adratus ty for all youve taught me budy."

      "text": "Introduction:\nTCS Mk III basically adds 2 commands, Start Sector Trader and Start Universe Trader. Or as Professor Fit S. Pro of the Profit Guild aptly describes it, \"Profitsss\".\nPlease note that this is a \"for Dummies\" guide. If you want a more organized and/or descriptive guide, check the links section of this guide. (i.e. Scroll down you dummy!)\n\nThe Basics:\nA Sector trader looks for wares in their assigned sector that are selling below average. If he finds a ware that is selling below average price, he will check if there is a selling place in the same assigned sector that is buying that specific ware for an above average or average price. If both conditions are met, you can expect your bank account to become a few credits richer!\n\nSector Traders gain levels based on how much profit they make. As they gain levels they learn new skills. (Eg. Using the JD, selling below average and still making a profit, not doing the same trade run as other STs in the same sector, docking at a shipyard for repairs, etc, etc).\n\nAfter reaching level 6, when choosing the begin Sector Trader command, you are asked for a jump range. This sets if and how many sectors away a ST (which is now called a Local Trader) can move. (Ie a jump range of 1 means that your ST can also trade in any of the sectors that are adjacent to it's assigned sector. This generally means more profitsss.\nWhen a LT (or an ST if you decided to confine your trader to one sector) reaches level 8, you can choose to begin Universe trader. This is basically the same thing as the Sector Trader except the trader traverses the entire universe in search of good deals.\n\nWhatever it might seem like, don't forget that this is trading, not magic, so it might take sometime for the credits to start rolling in. Also, some less experienced pilots might pickup more than they can sell, so you might have to manually get rid of wares sometimes. Oh and don't ever forget that you need credits to make credits! Without credits in your bank account how is the trader supposed to buy the wares? Try to keep at least 100k in your account at all times per ST for them to be effective.\n\nSetting up a ST:\nWhat you need:\nA TS,TP,TM,M3,M6 or M4 class ship. (TS works the best)\nTrade Command Software Mk III (available at some Teladi EQDs and the Terracorp HQ in Home of Light)\n\nWhat is recommended:\nEngine tunings\nMax Shielding\n\nOpen up the ship's command console and select trade. Then select Start Sector Trader. After that choose a sector and watch the profitsss roll in! (Empire's Edge, Queen's Space and Power Circle are generally regarded as a very good training grounds for STs).\n\nSetting up a ST should cost you around a million. 500k for TCS Mk III, 300k for the freighter and 200k as starting capital.\n\nLinks:\n\nA more detailed guide here.\nThe most detailed guide ever (i.e. a Dev wrote it) here.\n\nMight be worth leaving it a day or two, see what feedback you get (eg more suggested good training sectors like Queen's Space or Power Circle) and then saving it into a doc/pdf/rtf or starting it's own thread. You can then get it linked into the resource sticky, if you wanted - everlasting fame\n\nI have 3 sector traders in maxxed out mercury tankers and all at level 8 or above. They don't go into neighboring sectors. Now I was never prompted to change jump range and have not set it due to disastrous results from the first attempt (I lost some money and then the ship just stood by).\n\nI would like to state that I've found Ore Belt to be an amazing spot to train UTs as well. Two power plants to buy E-Cells from, two mines plus a factory to sell them to, two mines to buy Ore from, and a factory plus the Plutarch HQ to sell it to. The STs I've told to train in Ore Belt have always outleveled any other STs I've had going.\n\nI also like Lucky Planets; two ore mines, two silicon mines, and 4 factories all in one spot. Sometimes the traders get stuck with a load of silicon, though, because only one of the factories use it.\n\nTurning tunings are a good idea unless the AI can use the docking computer, but not so essential that you need them immediately. 25MJ /total/ shielding is the minimum required for UT (you can make it up with many smaller shields if you can't get hold of 25MJ shields)\n\nYou may want to add that the AI can use the jumpdrive (emergency jump setting) & mosquito missile defence even before they have the trainings, but won't restock missiles or ecells automatically until the training levels up.\n\nOthers have mentioned about restarting the command to change from ST/LT/UT\n\nQuote:\n\nAfter reaching level 6, [...]This generally means more profitsss.\n\nThis will continue training until L20\n\nQuote:\n\n[...]Universe trader. This is basically the same thing as the Sector Trader except the trader traverses the entire universe in search of good deals.\n\nI'd suggest '.. the trader /will eventually/ traverse the entire universe..' once he's trained up to the maximum L25\n\nA pure ST left on 0 sectors will only train up to L10. The UT will automatically buy a jumpdrive at (IIRC) L12 or above (you can't prevent this with a UT) at +50% cost price"

      "text": "VE devblog: The Jita Conundrum\n\nA Tale of Two Cities\n\nIceland's capital of Reykjavík is an interesting experience for me. It's big, it's busy and, as a result of being a convenient place to get most anything one needs, it can be a bit expensive; much like any other major metropolis that has over a hundred thousand inhabitants. It's a place with a little too much hustle and bustle for me.\n\nOften times though, I do have to travel there. For example, if I find myself needing a new bicycle, I know that the stores in Hafnarfjörður simply don't have the same stock as the ones in Reykjavík. Therefore I hop on the bus and go through the pain of entangling myself in the fast-paced lifestyle and traffic congestion of the capital (we do have some bus priority lanes, which is cool).\n\nI can't really complain since it's my own decision and I'm going back to Hafnarfjörður with a spanking new, albeit overpriced due to run amok inflation, bike. *ring ring*\n\nWhat really grinds my gears to a halt is that I can't go visit my sister in Mosfellsbær without first going through the traffic-congested Reykjavík. If only there was a way to go around Reykjavík...\n\nWhere was I? Oh yes.\n\nWe have a similar problem in a little space game called EVE Online. The Jita system is a lot like Reykjavík. The biggest playability issue with Jita (if you don't count the lag and spam) is that people sometimes have no choice but to go there for various reasons:\n\nWhen navigating through this region of space the autopilot sometimes wants to send you through Jita.\n\nThere is a constellation you cannot reach without going through Jita.\n\nThere are some agents in Jita that new players sometimes have the misfortune of working for.\n\nAgents sometimes send you on missions into Jita.\n\nWe are (finally, I hear you scream) fixing all of these issues.\n\nAutopilot Avoidance\n\nWe have a new feature in place that allows players to set a list of systems, constellations and regions that the autopilot should never send them to. This list is preconfigured to avoid the Jita system.\n\nThis works the same as the current \"avoid pod kill\" feature; the autopilot will act as if the system isn't even there and will rather return no path at all than a path that takes you through the undesirable systems.\n\nWhat this means is that you can happily navigate all around the Forge region on autopilot without having to worry about getting stuck in the Jita blackhole for the better part of a Sunday evening.\n\nThis is a completely general system to avoid any number of star systems, constellations or regions. You will therefore be able to use this to avoid that annoying faction that keeps shooting you or that constellation that has those pirates in it.\n\nWorld Shaping\n\nThere is a constellation called Ruomo which is famous for being a place where you cannot go unless you go through Jita. Citizens of the constellation have finally rebelled and gotten themselves a spanking new hyperspace bypass, courtesy of the Interstellar Bottleneck Bypass Initiative (IBBI for short).\n\nSoon you will never have to go through Jita to reach any other system.\n\nAgents & Missions\n\nAgents in Jita have finally had enough and are hauling butt out of there. Jita will be completely agent-less soon.\n\nAlso, agents outside Jita will never send you into Jita to complete a mission for them.\n\nWhen will we get it?\n\nThis system will be implemented incrementally but you should see this start to trickle in soon. Not the CCP soon(tm) mind you, but very very soon.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is being implemented at the same time as we're aggressively optimizing our software backbone to provide a smoother playing experience in Jita. That is, however, outside the scope of this devblog.\n\nOur goal is to create an environment where players don't have to go to Jita unless they want to. This is very important to the overall player experience.\n\nTogether, these two avenues of attacking the problem should provide the EVE denizens with a much smoother and more consistent playing experience. It's not a silver bullet, but every little bit helps.\n\nNow, if only the Reykjavík Transit Authority would do the same...\n\nBy the way, \"A Tale of Two Cities\" refers to Reykjavík and Jita. Clever, ain't it? Jita isn't even a city... Hilarious!\n\nThis will fix absolutely nothing, if Jita becomes an inconvienient for use as a hub, people will simply form another hub that has good access. Perimeter? New Caldari? Watch it happen.\n\nThe only upside is the avoid-system feature, now that idiot corpmate of mine that insists on flying through the 0.0 gatecamp next to Pertineere in Solitude, because \"it's the next yellow system!\", will be able to avoid losing anymore boats to stupidity.\n\nIn this case I don't see Jita being made inconvenient as a hub, so nothing should change. It's still in the middle of everything, still easy to get to, and the loss of mission runners won't mean a thing. This will be a pure improvement, by allowing traffic to bypass the system.\n\nChrist, these guys are backwards ass fucks, it's no wonder the game's so fucked up. 100,000 being a \"major metropolis\"? I guess if your country only has 250k people, yeah. You could put the entire population of that fucking rock into the Indianapolis Stadium. Their \"fixes\" anymore feel a whole hell of a lot like desperation moves. The \"too many people in a system? Can't log in, loolz\" maneuver was especially pungent. Now putting up the equivalent of \"go away\" signs around Jita? good luck with that.\n\nBest solution is to make Jita 0.4. Once a system get to crowded, crime increase and concord becomes ineffective.\n\nI'm sorry but thats completely wrong, unless you're proposing a system whereby the number of transactions in a system will cause its security status to drop. Most proposed \"fixes\" of Jita are ignorant of what the real problem of Jita is.\n\nClaim: The problem in Jita is lag, due to lots of pilots wanting to go there to buy and sell.\n\nAssumption: This problem has anything at all to do with Jita.\n\nWhat's really going on though? Players want an easy way to shop, get their goods in one go, fit ships etc.. They like being able to completely fit a pvp or pve ship and leave, because logistics is one of the hassles of Eve. Any problem that specifically addresses Jita will simply move the problem. If you know Eve history you know the main trade hub wasn't always Jita.\n\nThe problem CCP needs to address is the need to go to Jita at all. Interbus is probably the best solution, allow players to shop remotely and have goods delivered to them via NPC's so as to lower the lag. It may break the immersion, but it will make the game less frustrating.\n\nThey could also put in place a system to penalize players for using systems such as jita, like having all station managers slap a tax that constantly goes up and down depending on how many transactions there have been recently. However this \"solution\" could lag the fuck out of the system, so it might not work, I'm not a coder. It might be possible to assign the value at DT, based on the last 24 hours activity in each station/system, but again I don't know if that would cause a lot of lag.\n\nThe steps CCP have taken are good interim steps, removing all possible incidental traffic, and making it so that anyone in Jita is in there specifically to be there, not passing through or running missions. These are good steps, although they will probably not have a significant effect, they have no real cost and do have some benefit.\n\nHow about they instead make it so that in a handful of other systems in the Forge, you can buy stuff from Jita and have it delivered via the \"interbus\" for a fee (say 5%)?\n\nFurther, that fee should be split between the seller and, well, being an ISK sink.\n\nThat way Jita would still be a market hub, but only the SELLERS would need to actually go there physically, their customers could scatter around several other systems. And buyers would have every incentive to avoid Jita itself and go to the system with the LEAST lag.\n\nSay, tie in every highsec system within 2 jumps from Jita into this network.\n\nThen, in fairness, do the same for the market hubs in the other empires."

      "text": "ude I apologize in advance if this comes off wrong but if your shields are going down when you're hit by a Subsystem Shields I then you really need to work on your PvP.\n\nWhen comparing a Sci vessel to a BoP - Target Subsystem I does not equal out to the cloak evade capabilities or burst damage of a BoP.\n\nYes I do?\n\nEscorts do NOT have BO Sci stations that are able to access to VM.\n\nWeren't you just attacking me about not understanding the \"basic mechanics\" behind PvP?\n\nSubnuc beam is another topic altogether. No one disagrees that it's a tad bit on the OP side atm.\n\nHowever you don't need to be a Science officer to use a BoP with Sci spamming CC abilities.\n\nYou can be a tac officer and do a Jam Sensors + VM move for example that you CANNOT do on an escort.\n\nSimply put, BoPs are \"SUPER Sci\" Escorts at the moment.\n\n#1. They can Sci spam.\n\n#2. Do Escort \"like\" damage\n\n#3. Easily evade out of range using RSP then cloak.\n\nToss in the fact that most PvP fights are pug vs pug, pug vs premade, or 1v1 and it makes those characteristics even more potent.\n\nBattle Cloaking/Evade is countered by tractor beam or scan. You know this. Also, when you pop that BoP out of cloak, they don't always get their shields up. So you get to do phaser (if you are using anything other than phasers, you really should consider switching.\n\nThe sci spam? Well, I personally hate that build, but even so, it is a weak build because it lacks both damage and defenses...especially with the upcoming nerf to cannons.\n\nAll in all, I feel that the advantages of the BoP are balanced with it's weaknesses. I am not saying that there aren't problems with pvp, but that you are focusing on the wrong aspects.\n\nOK, I'm not that big PvPer and it's clear for me that fair PvP balancing is impossible, one side is always a bit better. In beta Feds always won and seems so as if Klingons now more often win (has of course something to do with the fact that Klingons have more PvP practice because of missing PvE content).\n\nBut I just read a thing in another thread which gives me the impression this could also be a reason for the PvP imbalance:\n\nOn Fed side escorts can't have higher tier science BO skills like Viral Matrix, only Sci-Vessels. On the other side only escorts can have the counterpart (Attack Pattern Omega). So it's more or less balanced on Fed side.\n\nBut if Klingons can have the advantage of both, escorts and sci-vessels like in the quote then I think it's out of balance. Cloak, high dps and high tier Sci BO skills, isn't that too much?\n\nWhat do you think? Give me a reason why I should not think that's unfair.\n\nYou make a good point, not denying this, however I think the issue is more subtle.\n\nthe solution in my opinion should not be to Nerf the Ship but rather to revise the ability/power.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, BOP's are the equivalent of a Science Ship from a Warrior society perspective. Within the premise of a War a science focus, takes on the Role of Scouting, intelligence gathering, infiltration, Sabotage, and the BOP is a perfect ship to this, it is supposed to be versatile.\n\nTherefore in my opinion the Ship and its capabilities is not the issue causing imbalance, but rather the nature of the Abilities/powers combined with the capabilities of a versatile ship.\n\nIf we wish to really correct the imbalance it would be more effective to do it by eliminating the Overpowered Element, in this case, certain abilities and powers, that would need to be revised so that when combined with a versatile ship it does not result in an Overpowered mechanic.\n\nYour BoP team really doesn't need THAT many \"Tactical\" Officer BO abilities to blow up 3 or 4 ships that have been effectively locked down completely.\n\nWhat you are suggesting is a bit overkill especially with the changes on Tribble coming up.\n\nBoPs have escort LIKE firepower although slightly less if they decide to Sci spam.\n\nBut hey that don't need it if they Sci spam? Everyone can't move, target them, or respond. LOL\n\nIs that why BoPs outnumber Raptors 1000:1 in PvP games?\n\nYou're not honestly putting a Raptor on the same level as a BoP in PvP are you?\n\nYou really want to take that position?\n\nYes it is especially if you save a RSP.\n\nIf you can't do it then you're the only one I've seen not be able to thus far.\n\nOk first off, the popularity of the bird of prey versus the raptor in tier 5 has no basis on the discussion other than it hints at the PERCEPTION people have about strength, and not about the actual strength of the ship. If you want to try to argue that having 1 more turret with rapid fire going and 1 more disruptor console for even more damage doesn't equate to more dps than go ahead and try.\n\nAlso, if you want to kill someone in sub 5 secondsSo why would I need someone to not being moving because of VM when I can sneak up to within 5 km and instagib people with my raptor?\n\nThis next point is basically the same as the first, you're using your own anecodatal evidence that points to the popularity of the bird of prey versus the raptor and therefor the BoP is better. This is a fallacy, just because something is popular DOES NOT MEAN IT IS BETTER or correct. And yes my position is precisely this: The raptor is on par with the bird of prey in pvp as the premier damage dealing platform available to klingons. WhyOk first off, the popularity of the bird of prey versus the raptor in tier 5 has no basis on the discussion.\n\nActually the popularity DOES have a direct relationship to it's usefulness in PvP.\n\nEspecially on a side that is mainly geared towards PvP functionality.\n\nI'm not sure why you would think that someone is going to just randomly pick a specific ship type on a PvP faction \"just because\".\n\nThere is no logic in that, it doesn't make any sense, and it would be 100% wrong.\n\nJust ask the Klink players in the OrganizedPvP channel.\n\nPlayers are going to lean towards the more \"OP\" ship for obvious reason. lol\n\nQuote:\n\nA few things.\n\n#1. Sci spamming lasts longer then 5 seconds.\n\n#2. Again loading up with primarily Tac Slots is unnecessary when Sci spamming.\n\nQuote:\n\nSo why would I need someone to not being moving because of VM when I can sneak up to within 5 km and instagib people with my raptor?\n\nBecause VM does more then not make someone move.\n\nIt disables all their abilities (except team abilities) until they are hit with Sci team again or it's extremely long duration is completed.\n\nNo offense but I feel like I'm running a PvP Clinic here where you don't understand the full functionality of certain abilities.\n\nQuote:\n\nWhyA few things here -\n\n#1. Because more Sci spamming atm is always best. It disables people from being able to help another person who was just Sci spammed.\n\n#2. Because the only other ship with that type of Sci slot capability on Klink side is a Carrier and their Sci effectiveness is much less due to their turn rate.\n\nQuote:This is the point of the conversation that gives me doubt you have ever done any T4-T5 PvP.\n\nYou seem to completely not understand how these abilities work and how they're used in normal PvP.\n\nAllow me to reiterate - It is EFFORTLESS to distance yourself 15-20km away from your enemy using a Evasive Maneuver + RSP move then cloak.\n\nThis maneuver can be done in split seconds and is highly effective for survivability on a BoP.\n\nEspecially when the majority of players are still using Efficient engines and are CRUISERS.\n\nHonestly I think a lot of this is a l2p on the side of the Klink players desperately trying to hold on to Sci Spamming BoPs that can Battle Cloak, have high survivability, and Fed escort \"like\" damage.\n\nI really thought about this a little bit when I posted because of the fun factor that exists when I'm on my BoP PvPing.\n\nHowever that fun factor is slowly fading because of the amount of ease that ship is to use in FvK PvP.\n\nI really don't mind if someone here has a valid argument against my points.\n\nBut please at least have a basic understanding of PvP, don't try to fool PvP savvy players with silly comments based on fiction, and by all means counter the point with a fact or at least an opinion that can be based on some form of logic.\n\nSaying that players choose a BoP over a Raptor not because of it's functionality and abilities in PvP but \"just cuz\" is a good example of a failed argument.\n\nIt ruins your credibility, wastes time on the forums, and most importantly wastes my time in replying if I choose to do so...."

      "text": "In the case of a sandbox game, a great chunk of the time in the artificial space universe the player will spend flying from point A to point B somewhere in space. Hence why that aspect of the game is pretty crucial, since the player might get bored over time when repeating that task, regardless of whether or not there is a comprehensive autopilot function visible to the player. That's one of the problems we'll notice once we want to break up the \"big\" game atoms into smaller pieces. Breaking up that chain reveals that a great deal of repetition is present, which can't be broken up by a waterfall design. So making flight least painful or boring as possible is important! Unless the aim of the game is to bore you to death.\n\nThe concept of space flight differs a lot from game to game. It's also linked to the objects in space are arranged - whether you travel from one star system to another, or from one section to another inside a big star system, or even just \"random\" sectors in space connected through some kind of gates or whatever, that all defines the layout of your star systems or sectors, etc. . Whatever we'll choose, it'll fundamentally define the way the game is played. Instead of choosing one right in the beginning, I'd like to discuss that first.\n\nI'd like to briefly describe some layouts/concepts which come into question and point out the one concept I like the most right now. Disclaimer: All those concepts revolve around star systems with no objects moving around the sun(s)/planets/etc., i.e. \"unrealistic\" systems.\n\n1. The gameplay-relevant sections are star systems which are divided into sectors according to the position of planets, stations etc. (one other way to divide the star systems is into equal rectangular sectors, however that's pretty inconvenient in my opinion and doesn't suit my image of the game) The means of travelling between objects inside the system consist of acceleration gates or rings (or whatever they'd be called) that would convey ships from a relevant sector to another. Travelling from one star system to another is done using jump gates and/or worm holes, whose positions are independant of those of the remaining stellar objects. In case of acceleration rings, the disruption of one portion of the ring system would be possible, thus allowing pirates to disrupt these and camp at those acceleration lanes. (People who have played Freelancer are familiar with the concept of \"lane hacking\")\n\n2. The relevant sectioning is done in space sectors. Space sectors are small chunks of important space, arranged in a matter possibly independent of logic of any kind ;). Travelling inside those sectors would be no big deal as distances aren't big. Jump gates interconnect all space sectors.\n\n3. The concept I favor the most is kind of a compromise. I just see it as the best way to include some interesting gameplay mechanics and get some action going. The gameplay-relvant space portions are star systems, which are again divided into sectors of different size adjacent to stellar objects or inside formations etc. (asteroid fields/rings, dust/gas clouds, scrap fields, rock formations of other origin). The means of flying from one sector to another would consist either of a \"in-system jump drive\" or, again, acceleration gates. However, travelling from one star system to another requires the space ship to be far enough from the gravitational influence of the sun(s) and planets, meaning that one would need to get to the system's far end (depending on its size, the \"far end\" can vary :D) to use the inter-star jump drive. Parallel to #1, pirates would eventually be able to stop ships by disrupting acceleration lanes or the ship's in-system jump drive along the path.\n\nDiscuss.\n\n]]> is a bitch [1] (updated diagram)\n 18 Feb 2009 22:53:21 +0000Sindwiller one of the things, which bother me the most in space sims, is that space fights can get pretty dull after a while. The style of combat tends to be monotonic, the design surrounding and accompanying space fights is the lamest one; literally the one element evolving the least in space sim designs. It gets even lamer once one considers the number of space sims focusing on combat. The god of war (Mars/Ares, not Kratos) appears in space sims as a destroyer of the habit, as an annihilator of boredom and as one of the paths of playing the game, of which the player can choose from. So why do people neglect the mighty god of war despite the fact that he could bring many, many positive changes to the game?\n\nTypical combat designs in space sims consist of chasing the enemy by flying around in circles, while he may or may not be able to get you on his front side to be able to shoot you. If the enemy has gotten turrets, you're screwed, - or not - depending on the game's design. Simply put, the ships with the highest speed, most firepower and fattest shields wins. One of the obvious reasons why combat is so dull is the very simple ship balancing. Every ship owner will come to a point at which his ship is basically worthless, due to the \"if you aren't this big, you're too weak\" design, meaning that every \"more advanced\" ship can defeat any ships below it, regardless of fitting or tactics - no exceptions allowed. That design can be loosened pretty easily though. I'd like to introduce a design with more variations, involving more tactics - rather than just a straight line.\n\n(both diagrams were made by Tranberry from the FGD forums, visit his wobsite under:  )\n\nInstead of being instant cannon fodder and thus good for basically nothing at all, fast and light-weight ships, you may call them interceptors or scouts, now have the possibility to be used for, what their name actually suggests, interception of fighters and bombers. They should be quite effective in groups, especially for perturbing the enemy. Interceptors/Scouts should be the cheapest ships in the design. Excluding civilian ships, if there is the need for a separation between faction/military ships and 'mere' civilian ships or ships manufactured by independent companies.\n\nThe gap in-between would then be filled by fighters, which would be somewhat limited omnipotent packages, perfect for raids, escorts and patrols in small numbers and for hit-and-run tactics, in which you don't necessarily want to lose a great bunch of your ships.\n\nThe next class is filled by heavy fighters and bombers. Heavy fighters, the more expensive variants of the fighters - also with a much greater mass - are intended for universal use. If you have the money and the nerves, that is. The fighter<>heavy fighter relationship might be a critical point in the design when it comes to balancing. Bombers will be designed for anti-capital assaults. They're particularly slow for their size, although they will have the ability to get a fair speed boost for a limited amount of time during strikes and for evasion of heavy capital turrets and missiles, and their energy systems will be specifically designed for the carriage and launch of very heavy missiles or energy-based bomber equipment, so they won't be abused as \"very-very-fat\" fightercraft.\n\nThe gap between capital ships and heavy fightercraft will be filled by gun boats (their purpose being the interception of small and medium fightercraft using turrets), corvettes, cruisers and frigates… I will have to think this class through I think.\n\nThe capital ships (destroyers, carriers, etc.) are self-explanatory.\n\nAs I was already saying in the beginning of this mess of an article, another quite soporific spice put into combat design is limiting and boring navigation and flight physics. Though by any means, do not interpret this statement as it would promote realistic space physics; please don't. Ultra-realistic flight physics destroy the fun of combat completely. Instead, consider flight physics a way to introduce new elements to combat. Instead of putting all down to physical laws, you should also think of ways technology would've worked out the issues of space flight by then. After all, it's a science-fiction game - don't take the 'science' thing too seriously.\n\nImagine a simple spaceship having two engines. This would allow the ship to accelerate in one direction and thus travel in one direction, but it'd be heavily affected by the gravitational force of the celestial bodies near or not so near it. Thrusters on the front side and on every other sides are added to allow manipulation of the direction in which the ship is heading, as well as the roll of the ship. After a while, a trick allows to get the gravitational force of the celestial bodies out of the picture, which allows much more freedom for space flight. Also, the correction of the course by the thrusters is handled automatically, even though more advanced pilots may consider manual operation for sliding/gliding. The thrusters on the front side are especially effective, in so far as it is possible to stop immediately, decelerate and then recelerate again, making room for many wicked maneuvers. Just to picture it:\n\nYou can bite your fingers off at that, vector mathematicians.\n\nNow to a little bit of history. In the history of sefaring, due to the lack of long range weaponry suitable on sea, the first way of nautical combat was quite simple: ram the enemy! The ships were obviously constructed with that kind of combat in mind. The nose of the ship was reinforced with metal and made extra sharp. Thus, the ships weren't too big and were quite agile. That method of combat was used by the Greek and by the Phoinikians, probably invented by the Pelasgians. Don't quote me as a reliable source though; the origin of this tactic is unknown.\n\nDuring the Punic Wars, the Romans were faced with that tactic, since the Carthaginians/Phoinikians were masters of seafaring and nautic combat. They were at disadvantage, as their ships were quite… crappy. Until they had found a solution, they were never able to secure their sea or cut off the Carthaginians from their usual trade routes (Sardinia, Sicilia, etc.). One day, they decided to turn the whole thing into land combat again and filled a whole ship with soldiers, everybody well equipped and well trained for battle. They tricked the Carthaginian ship into approaching them, at which they evaded the Phoinikians, smashed their rudders, sailed to one side of the enemy ship and jumped over. Seamen can't fight. And so they were doomed. And so, boarding ships was born.\n\nThe same thing would be quite interesting in space: Ships of the size of corvettes - so right in-between capital ships and bombers - with the ability to harden certain areas of their shields for a period of time. A new kind of hit-and-run tactic would be born.\n\n]]> games don't consist of sand…\n 08 Feb 2009 16:32:26 +0000Sindwiller sum this up effectively and as simple as possible: A sandbox game keeps the player (or players) busy with a chain of events and tasks. There is a certain 'rhythm' based on the intervals between whenever a task (doesn't matter if it's a 'chore' or a 'carrot'/'goodie') pops up and gets performed, when an event is triggered and when the player has to reorient himself, aka \"What am I going to do next?\". In an ideal situation, the player doesn't have to reorient himself at all.\n\nThe diagram has to separate branches. The red one is the very simple 'isle' sandbox design. After having performed a task, there is no reaction of the environment around the player, nor is there development outside the player's microcosmos. Usually, there is a time span between the tasks in which the player is pondering about what he will do next. Projected onto a space game, the factor that defines the outcome of the reorientation phase lies in what the player's basic occupation is, so whether he favors trading or a more martial style of playing, and how many possibilities the game holds open in that situation. This is usually shaped by the price of items and ships, the galaxy map and occasionally by racial differences. I have noticed that as for space sims, it is quite hard to keep up the \"Aha\"- and \"Wow\"-moments high in number and concise in appearance. Frankly, there are hardly any \"Aha\"-moments in current space games (the exception proves the rule), as most mechanics are either obvious - a prime example of that would be the rule of thumb in a simple combat ship design, in which ships with more firepower or shields are simply better than everything else - or built on top of simple, easy to see through mechanics - yes, I'm talking about you, Freelancer weapon balancing. But after all, there may be a way to analyze that and come to a solution (thinking game design atoms). That will mean a lot of handwork though.\n\nBack to the diagram: The plain black branch is what I like to refer to as the \"waterfall\" sandbox design. It's a lot more laborious to design, let alone to implement and to maintain - but it is more interesting to design, of course, and a lot more fun to play in the end. It limits the importance of the player as a parameter for the game world, so the environment (factions, economy, etc.) may take a completely different direction, hence the \"waterfall\". Though the player is able to manipulate his environment; if he participates in raids of a faction against another faction in the conflict; if he's a driving economical power (again, space stations, trading, escort/police service, blah, blah, blah); and of course if he has a huge fleet, an enormous wallet and can just gank everything and everyone in the universe.\n\nIn the diagram, the normal arrows point at events or tasks that get triggered or are opened after player interaction or rather the performing of a task. The diamond arrows on the other hand point at events or tasks opened up for the player, without the need of player interaction - they just happen or appear. An example of that would be the beginning of a conflict over a system rich on sources. No player interaction needed there. Although, the faction may now offer missions regarding this conflict (raids, defense, recon) to the player. The goal would be to make the waterfalls and occasional isles as long and as rich as possible.\n\nAnother trick beside the usual waterfall and isles, and of course, making the basic elements of the game - trading, combat, exploration, story - as fun as possible, to keep the player at it is by adding fun activities or \"pretended\" fun activities. Say, space racing, gambling, etc. The key there is to add a money bonus to it.\n\nOther than that - my typical credo - : Increased interaction between the player and his/her (AI) environment. A martial player will eventually have somebody holding a grudge against him at a certain point. The player's standing towards one or more factions will eventually be so low, that the faction will send ruffians to attack his fleet or his stations (if he has any) as an act of retaliation or rather aggressiveness. That would also be a reason for the player to continue shaping his environment and attacking other factions or teaming up with some.\n\nI hope I have cleared things up a bit…\n\nPS.M64 mentioned in his Blog that one of the issues that FOSS game development has to tackle are huge, bloated \"game designs\" (quotation marks by me), which try to imitate commercial games to some degree. FOSS games should rather focus on casual games with smaller designs, so he says. That is true for most cases, but in the end, everything gets down to the game design, and if there is none, a bigger game can't be played consistently nor be really fun. I want to prove that\n\n]]> - Further Thoughts and Persistent Universe\n 26 Jan 2009 21:19:51 +0000Sindwiller the 'problem' with sandbox games is that most of them don't have a general objective per se. The player is given the possibility to do anything he wants to, as long as it's part of the game obviously. In GTA, if you're not doing missions at the moment, you run around harassing people, set them on fire, run them over, jump from an airplane with a parachute, mostly senseless things like that. Newer GTA games have a storyline which you can play through, GTA2 (and so the first GTA as well I'd reckon) on the other hand didn't have something as concrete as that. You simply could choose between three rivaling gangs on each island for which you completed missions. The more missions you completed for, for instance, the Yakuza, the more they liked you and the worse the standing got of some other gang towards you. Once you had done enough missions for one faction, you could move over onto the next island. A good sandbox game should be full of surprises for the player, keep him busy as well motivating him to stick at it. A sandbox design, which sadly is too common, rests upon the lack of a greater aim in the game, while giving the player opportunities to set goals himself, e.g. making a fortune, or more short-term goals, such as improving standings for a particular faction, being able to acquire a particular good, et cetera. Activities of simple fun should be present, too. Of course, those heavily depend the type of game.\n\nWhat space sims these days lack are real dynamics that affect the short-term and long-term goals and the activities of the player. By adding the feature to choose between several races at the start, it is possible to not only define the location the player starts at and the ship he's preferably going to fly, but also to define the style of playing and the player's long-term goals, including his impact on the persistent, dynamic world. Other possible differences can include the reaction of the player's environment towards him, possibly biased/defined by his race's mores, traditions and political standings to other factions and/or activities. But before one can even get to a design as complex as that can be, one has to define the fundamental mechanics underneath.\n\nThis might start to get slightly technical, as the scripting implementation of the game logic and AI also depends on the game's design. In the case of an implementation (which is unlikely to happen, anyway), I'd like to make sure that nothing goes wrong on that end. At the bottom of everything lie the basic AI commands for ships, no matter how they're called or executed right now. Fly to position, follow ship, attack ship, and so on. Simply by utilizing simple commands such as these, which then again consist of lower level commands utilizing vector operations etc. (I'm not into things like that), a complete assault of a faction against another one can be staged. Furthermore, if that event depends on whether certain conditions are met, it will seem realistic and logical to the player and there'll also be room to notify the player and to give him the opportunity to join that assault or prevent the enemy faction from gaining his faction's space, or to economically support his home faction with resources and equipment. That would then be one of the player's temporary objectives possibly given by the game at some point or another - preferably taking quite a time.\n\nProjecting this from the macrocosmos of the game world to the microcosmos of the player, which he is experiencing at the moment, to the bigger game world, would mean that there would be systems which two or more factions fight over for a certain time frame. The time frame and the intensity of such a conflict would be affected by economical and military factors, for instance the amount of equipment a faction can ship to support the fleet or the number of ships a particular region can summon up, the arrangement of sectors and systems across the space, which is being fought over, and the direct or indirect interventions of the player or of other factions (pirates cutting off trade and supply lines, etc.), either on one side or another.\n\nThis would require that the owner of a system or a part of the system can be changed through scripting. Sounds easy to do, but what might come up is the issue of when a system actually belongs to a faction and when it's effectively war-torn territory. That will be a subject of discussion. These pictures are only there for clarification of what I have in mind… more or less. The global AI relationships and its impact on the player's decisions and goals will, too, be a hot subject of discussion.\n\n(Yes, that's the Llama from Vegastrike, GPL)\n\n]]> thoughts and breakdown: Spacesims\n 18 Jan 2009 16:19:58 +0000Sindwiller recently got into playing the X games again, namely X3: Terran Conflict, a real gem in this sea of crap, which the world of space simulations is at the moment. Since due to the fact that there's a recent lack of decent spacesims out there, it's kind of obvious that one single game, even though its storyline missions have some annoying bugs, shines through. X's design has been proven since and improved in Terran Conflict, rising it's popularity-bar quite a bit. However, some start to think of X as a real time strategy game or merely a space shooter - or a mix of it. If you think so, you're wrong. It's neither. Nor is it both. The only space oriented game that I know and counts as an RTS is Homeworld, which does not have a persistent world, nor free-roaming elements, hence why it's labeled an RTS. The fact that you can own multiple ships in X and control them through a communication console that allows you to execute AI commands (Follow me, Attack enemies, Trade wares, etc.) doesn't mean that X is a strategy game per se. Other's suggest the implementation of a fleet command interface, similar to RTS games' interfaces, hence why they assume X has to be an RTS of some sort. Misunderstanding the basic concept of a free-roaming space simulation is like assuming that you'll get a full-fledged, healthy dinner at Mc Donald's - it's just wrong, no, retarded.\n\nOn the other hand, X3:TC made me think about what amazes me about spacesims the most. I've been addicted to space since the first Escape Velocity, then the other 2 ones, which were unbelievably fine games, defining free-roaming spacesims for me, although they were 2D top-down games. It's an incredible experience to fly around with a fleet of \"merely\" 5 destroyers, wiping out pirate or alien space. I got my hands on Descent: Free Space, a really compelling combat spacesim, which had top-notch graphics back in the day. Saving earth from weird alien threats was my duty! There was also Starlancer, with which the *Lancer universe started to become colorful for me. Years later, I stumbled over Freelancer, the technical sequel, but with free-roaming elements this time, eventually bought it and had lots of fun with it, especially the entraining storyline. Later the same year, I had bought a gaming magazine, just for the heck of it, which also had some free full game with the weird name \"X-Gold\", which I reckoned to be some shitty retro game nobody ever heard of, thence I didn't really care. The same year, I read about the sequel of a well-known and immerse space game, called X2: The Threat, on the Internet. I figured this X-Gold CD must contain its predecessor and thought \"Hey, why don't I give it a spin\". So the beginning was kind of 0815, \"Weird controls, mmkay, probably some mission-oriented game\" and then SWOOSH I don't know where the fuck I was and then this reptile or something talks to me and he has to lend me stuff which I have to pay him back and WHAT PROFIT AAAH WHERE AM I. - That's the element of surprise, my friend. If I could, I'd buy a game I know is good but I don't know what it is about, and play it, just for the element of surprise. Anyway, I kind of started with X - Beyond The Frontier, didn't play that game too long though (sadly, I can't find my X-Gold CD anymore the story really rocked), then tried X-Tension, then went onto X2, a very cool game with really dumb storyline missions. I had some issues with it and X3, too, but I must say that they are really good games at their core, it's just that Egosoft had to release fast to keep up with the deadline and they had kind of neglected some parts of the game. Terran Conflict somewhat fixes this, however there are still some bugs present. The kind of bugs you can easily find a workaround thought, so it's not a big deal. Plus all the free-roaming aspects, the new ships and sectors (<3 Terran Cutlass) and the newly added mission system - it's just overwhelming.\n\nSince the beginning of my obsession with spacesims of all kinds, I've always wanted to make a space game myself. That's the reason I'll be doing some thinking and breaking down of the spacesim genre here and now and in the next posts of this Blog. Thinking and writing about crap seems to always have been my strength, which is obviously stronger than the restraint of doing something serious. Starting with my thoughts on the spacesim genre and what it should focus on, I'll try to assemble a game design document. I'll be trying to do this periodic to some degree, if I find the time and motivation to.\n\nAll of those points are pretty much self-explanatory, so I don't need to give them a closer look (yet). What really bugs me is the way how they are combined into the game. I'm talking about subtle style and story impressions given to the player to build up an atmosphere, how war can affect the economy in said persistent universe, how relations between races/factions or between the player and NPCs/factions can affect the way the player, how flight time and such can slow down your gains from trading, etc.\n\nLet's start with the most important thing to me: The background story and how it is linked to the universe. A link between those two are considered obvious and easy to achieve by most players and thusly by most game designers, except for the ones focused on multiplayer FPS games with or without a minimal storyline that everyone ignores anyway, because it's of low quality and of no use in the game itself. You have to kill stuff and that's it. In a spacesim however, a link between said two is crucial and helpful in creating a chain of tasks and events for and around the player(s). A good free-roaming space simulation can keep the player(s) busy if they're not involved in a concrete storyline of some sort, by giving possibilities to make money, spawning events, missions, showing off new elements (aha-moment; think game play atoms). If the space the player is in is in some border region and the race the space belongs to is basically some unfriendly, violent bunch, the systems/sectors may contain lots of vibrant yet aggressive coloring, lots of nebulae and debris, frequent pirate or enemy raids and lots of military activity (or none at all). The pilots the player tries to contact may be unfriendly and in a hurry, in order to avoid pirates or enemy attacks. They may be out for the player's cargo. Et cetera. Besides having many background story elements weaved into it, there may be an explanation for all that. Even more so, the more background information there is, the more events, elements and style accents can be utilized. It's fun to read, fun to imagine and fun to experience. Or it should be. Some people lobby for scientific accuracy in space games. I for one give out my Ceterum Censeo for deep and thought-out space games stories and universes.\n\nDistantly related: Economy and combat. How so? Economy affects combat, combat affects economy. Moreover, both elements haven't received any modernization in the past decade. X Beyond The Frontier added the production factor into the dry system of supply and \"demand\" (or, in other, less economy-oriented space sims, \"*swoosh* and the ware is there\") and introduced player driven trading and station building. X3 introduced station complexes which you can connect multiple stations with. As already noted, other games, such as Freelancer or Vegastrike (and thusly probably the old Privateer games, too) have a system with fixed trade routes between big stations which supply or demand certain wares. EVE - more an RPG than a space simulation; interesting nonetheless - on the other hand has a 98% player driven economy in and outside NPC/safe space, 2% formed by blueprints, skill books and basic junk offered by NPCs. That on the side of an MMO space sim though. If you're asking now \"Why should I look at other games\", you should also ask yourself \"Why should I reinvent the wheel?\".\n\nThe innovations in combat are even fewer in number. Capital ships and semi-capital ships which are thought as gunboats to take down fighter swarms. Time get some speed and dynamics into it."

If it's not a statement that GW has approved, then there'll be something that contradicts it. If it is a statement that GW has approved (such as \"Space Marines are always male\"), then someone will find the whole thing to be thoroughly distasteful and begin desperately searching for a loophole.\n\nIn either case, I've learned to avoid them. Phrases like \"overwhelming majority\" and \"so rare as to be essentially unheard of\" allow a little wiggle room just in caseThe Schola origin would be more in-line with fluff, yes.

Please take a look!\n\nThough just to nitpick about the idea of heresy vs mutants… should mutation & heresy be defined from the perspective of the SoB, or what? Like, space marines, and the admech are totally heretics, the Ecclesiarchy just wouldn't bother attempting to enforce it. Likewise, psykerdom should be considered a mutation… in humans, but I'm not sure if a daemon or, I don't know, an eldar, can honestly be considered a heretic or a mutant.\n\nAnd I doubt there are times a Sister wouldn't consider her foes to be hereticsOh no, of course! But this was just a fun way of making a recognizeable archetype within OW's constraints. 6 AP might not be power armour, but it sure isn't bad. They do have Frag and Krak grenades, actually.

Only those who prosper may truly judge what is sane.\"\n\nI think they all come from the Schola actually. I haven't seen any other recruiting sources for them. I could be wrong though.\n\nTo resolve the confusion: This is one of the cases where it all depends on which sources you may go by. If you want to stick to GW's books, yes, they all come from the Schola - in fact they were raised there \"from infancy\". Some licensed publications such as FFG's RPG or various Black Library novels, however, simply follow a different interpretation. For example, the Inquisitor's Handbook allows SoB characters to have a Feudal World background, and the Enforcer omnibus briefly mentions a convent harbouring a newly inducted Sister who was a noblewoman before deciding she should become a nun.\n\nThe same interpretations preference would also concern their equipment - be it the quality (you know what I'm talking about) or the loadout (as opposed to the Codex list mentioned by andrewm9, Blood of Martyrs does not grant the bolt pistol as a standard weapon and grenades are missing from the requisition list entirely - also, the Inquisitor's Handbook actually offers carapace armour as starting gear for a Sororitas Novice, so Plushy's take is quite close to what this RPG has already published).\n\nIt all comes down to one's personal opinion of the Sisters and/or what sources we choose go go by. Same for the Storm Trooper! :)"

The Intrepid has better DPS at 150y-500y and 525+\n\nSomething you have to take into account though, the Bloody Dagger is sailed by the CT while the Priv sails the Intrepid. The CT can take a much bigger advantage of high DPS ships then the Privateer, who excels at taking advantage of ships that spike well. The CT also has much better turning and acceleration buffs, to the point where a CT in a Bloody Dagger closes the gap to a point where there essentially no difference in acceleration or turning, while the Priv has Unpredict Maneuver on. If the Priv does not have Unpredict Maneuver on then the Bloody Dagger will turn much better.\n\nAs expected, when you take into account the CTs buffs the DPS advantage of the Bloody Dagger is increased to a point where it has the advantage at all ranges. The spike damage gap between the ships is increased with the benefit towards the Intrepid, as expected with the Privateers +Dmg.\n\nAll up, the Bloody Dagger wins the fight, having equal turn and acceleration, but more armour and DPS. Even if the captain is losing the fight the Bloody Dagger can simply point at 180 and run away with a significant speed advantage."

      "text": "rebalanced\n\nDesigning towards specific goals is a base tenet of game design; without goals there is not much to aim for. Yet, design goals can be very hard to put down on paper. Even with a room full of people where you're sure everyone has the same basic vision, nailing a lengthy and lively brainstorm down in a clear and concise way can be like returning the toothpaste to the tube at the end of the day. That being said, this is what four of us came up with during the course of a mere five hour meeting on the current speed crisis:\n\n* Speed must never reach ludicrous speed, which is defined as speeds where missiles and drones don't intercept the class of ship they were intended for.\n* There should be a significant and meaningful difference in speed between the ship classes.\n* Speed should not permit a larger ship to perform the role that a smaller specialized ship was intended for.\n* Afterburners should be a viable module selection for PVP.\n* Guerrilla warfare must remain a viable combat tactic.\n\nHmm, hard to say how bad it really is, will have to see on SiSi how fast ships can still go. Most nanogangs I was in were fine with the 3k to 5k ships. You don't need a 15kms vaga or a 20kms interceptor to do well. Handy, but not vital. So if ships still go 3kms to 5kms, I don't think nanos are really that nerfed.\n\n* Warp scramblers (the close range ones), are due for a complete\nmakeover. Our current idea is to have MWD's deactivate as soon as they\nget hit by their effect, and continue to be disabled until the effect\nis lifted.\n\n* A brief reactivation delay added to the microwarpdrives might ensure\na speedy target actually slowed down, and of course with the MWD\ndisabled, a webifier would have an even greater effect.\n\n* Our current idea is to have MWD's only differ in capacitor capacity\npenalty as well as reactivation delay, instead of the speed\nprogression between meta levels.\n\n* Currently when you're webbed it's pretty much game over unless\nyou're doing more DPS or have a better tank. The 90% speed reduction\nmakes combat too static and predictable when webifiers have been\napplied. To address this, webifiers in our proposed changes have been\nreduced in effectiveness down to between -50% and -60%.\n\n* Nanofibers and polycarbon engine housings changed to affect maximum\nvelocity and agility (which is basically what they did before, through\nmass reduction) would ensure balance, morphing them into a mixture of\noverdrives and inertia stabilizers and thus stacking penalized against\nthose modules. Our current implementation makes 3 nanofibers\napproximately as effective as 2 overdrives and 2 inertia stabilizers.\nThis means, if one would want to fit for maximum speed, go for\noverdrives; maximum agility, fit inertia stabilizers; a bit of both,\nuse nanofibers.\n\n* Polycarbon engine housings are overpowered, both in general and with\nregard to corresponding modules; this is because the tech1 version is\ncurrently more effective than a tech2 nanofiber. Following our changes\nwe're looking at them being 30% less effective than their module\ncounterparts, which is more similar to the difference between modules\nand rigs in other categories.\n\n* Our intent is to have overdrives range from approximately 7% to\n12.5%; the high-grade snake set 24.7%; the low-grade snake set 16% and\nthe gang bonuses down to 25.8% but with an added agility bonus.\n\nI agree with Grunt. The fastest I've ever gone was a bit over 10km/s (in a frigate sized ship), as I've never well and truly nanofagged it.\nAnd for the most part I stick to 2-4km/s ships for nano gangs. That's really all you need for avoiding BS gatecamps.\n\nAnd the whole \"but they'll catch my nanoship now\" argument is kinda moot, since the opposing ships will go slower as well.\nI do however agree that this is a serious nerf to Minmatar ships, as if CCP mess up (which is likely) they will not only slow down the *fast* ship setups, but they'll slow down the sane setups on other ships.\n\nThankfully for me, the only ship I particularly care about is my Kitsune, which I only run a single MWD and nanofiber II on anyhow. So I don't see this nerf affecting me too much, but for anyone that tries to get their ship able to hold a 2000+m/s orbit around a BS to avoid cruise missle rapage... well there goes using small ships to gank ratting Ravens.\n\nif that wanna nerf speed ok nerf polycarbons and put some mass on vaga etc\nbut this is a complete change on speed\nother change leaded by the same dev grrrrrrrrrrrrThis had to happen. Don't know if I completely agree with how they are doing it though, seems to me that this is a HUGE boost to Caldari and Amarr, and a devastating nerf to Minmatar (speed was all they had) and Gallente (all their DPS ships are short range blaster boats).\n\nI think they could have done it better. I'd have introduced hard caps on ship hulls instead of the radical changes to MWD'sWhat they should have done was introduce scripts for warp scrams and webifiers that let you choose to scramble MWD or WD, and to boost web range (at the expense of strength) or strength (at the expense of range).\n\nHonestly, they could have fixed a lot of the nano problem with that alone.\n\nWildcat, I see the webifier nerf as a method to \"weaken\" the nerf to nanos. Webbers will be less effective, but ships won't be going as fast. So the webbers won't need to be as good to be balanced with their current level.\n\nThe problem there lies in the fact that velocity usually meant webbers were useless. To get one to work, you had to be able to stay close to your target, which usually meant that *you* had to be faster.\n\nIf it were up to me (and along CCP's current plan of attack), webbers would get cut in half, but with double the range (or more). That way in order to stop someone with webs, you need at least 3 (45%, 45%, 45% = total reduction of 83%, which is less than a single good webber does now). But if you just need to slow that 3k/s ship down, one web will drop them to 1500, and if you can tag them from 20+ km away, you can catch them in it even if they are faster than you. But one web wouldn't catch someone if they were significantly faster than you (over double your speed).\nAgree/disagree?\n\nBeyond that, I think the speed nerf is messed up. I'm a Caldari/Gallente pilot, with good speed skills and fly matar t2 frigates as well. So I'm looking at it from both sides. Just haven't flown a vagaI'm going to abuse the new mechanics as much as I can with my Lachesis. I got a bunch of Domination scrams sitting around (22.5km scram range on the lach/arazu). With 3 RSD's thrown onto it I should be able to drop the majority of ships lock range below 22.5km.nano-ships can choose if they want to engage or not, there is no risk involved in using one until you choose to fight.\n\nKeep the web effectiveness the same as it is now, but add some fall-off. It gives slower ships a chance to catch up by lowering the target's speed from further away, while still not being unfair to the webbed ship."

There is NO WAY im going to be putting 4-6Mil NIC worth of T1 damage guns on my mech right now (and that's not why I did it) but given how easy NIC is to come by in this game, someone has probably done something like this with T3P or T4P by now.\n\nHas anyone crunched the numbers on T4P stuff? How much does each item actually cost to prototype? T4 items can be horribly expensive on their own, so its possible T4P stuff isnt actually that much more..\n\nAs I understand it, the problem with trying to use T4P items is the build times and costs involved. At the higher end the mats required scale very very high, and while you can bring that down with relations and extensions Your still talking about 5-10mil a module. I'd do it for say a MK2 reveler (T4P medium miners yo) but not for combat bots.\n\nIf it wasn´t for the whole alt-mayhem already you could make money with them i think. If you specialize in building prototypes you can provide a steady supply of the for eager industrialists to RE them or for some people to actually fit them.\nShould be possible to make money with that if it wasn´t for the age-old problem of corp-intern production and everyone into it having an alt anyway.

      "text": "Monday, 15 September 2008\n\nI can tell there'll be a few voices crying, 'Foul!' over that title. Let me point you towards this article. It's what you get when you type isk farmer into Google search and hit I'm feeling lucky. It's a nice relief to me: I never saw that when it was first published, and I did just find it five minutes ago as I was looking for a way to avoid having to repeat what everyone probably already knows. After a skim through it, I can see that it contains nearly everything I've learned through personal experience, however there's not much more than a single line regarding the mission-running farmers I'm accustomed to and can spot from five systems distant (slight exaggeration).\n\nI think it's quite amusing the way they detail how to go about farmer-hunting. A guy from Enuma Elish apparently - according to the corp rep who showed up an hour later to ask why we'd popped his corpmate's mega - mistook me for an isk farmer when Atrocitas first moved into Arzi. Considering I was already on my way to Outlaw and had just acquired a 25mil bounty, we were all a bit sceptical about his motives.\n\n*gets giggles from reading back through the chatlogs of the incident*\n\nAAAaanyway... ^__^\n\nArzi was crazy with farmers when we moved in. There were literally hundreds of them. A few were definitely macros and they disappeared quickly after we started shooting them, but most were real people being paid to run hauler missions back and forth 23/7. I honestly don't know if the alliance that was in residence when we moved in was letting them run in exchange for protection fees the way they were doing for all the other carebears in there, or if they were just crappy at shooting them. But we settled in and got busy, and the farmers were anything but silent.\n\nAnd they weren't all in haulers, either. I lost a myrm when we went after a raven in a mission and he called in a neuting scorpion for backup. They were ballsy, bumping us with shuttles and noobships if we were sitting outside; if someone was flashy, they would shoot, too. Well, they learned to only shoot the red ones after the first few errors...\n\nA lot of our sec went because we were killing them before they could loot wrecks - theirs or someone else's, they didn't seem to care which. Some, like 'be ture', 'Bwotau Zhao' and a few others, were fun targets and fought back well. Others were just meat on a hook and would return the most outlandish insults in exchange for their popped haulers. We got to know them and could identify one worker's set from another's based on the way they were named, the race of the characters, 'birth' times, and how often we scanned out 'AHYAMAHA' flying SHASENG's Bestower. Some were Japanese, some were Korean, a couple were from Singapore; most were Chinese. Every so often, one of us managed to get them talking and they were quite happy to describe the production-grind-style life they were used to. They were interested in knowing where we were from, what we did when we weren't playing Eve, if we would give their mission loot back or take money to leave them alone.\n\nAnd we were costing them. Every time you steal a farmer's ore, pop his wrecks and cut his missions short with the aid of a well-placed missile, you are interfering in their job. You are costing them a lot of real-world money and making them a workforce liability by taking their stuff and hurting their agent standings. I'm not saying this to make people feel badly for griefing them; I'm telling it like it is. I could say something about how the gameplaying industry fits into East Asian society, but I don't know enough about it to make suppositions like that; if you start making generalisations, you end up on the edge of prejudicial stereotyping, which is something I have a raging aversion to :p It's an industry that may well stem back to the first days of online gaming - earning and selling ingame money for real-world cash. Supplying the demand, because nobody likes being skint; and while you can't do much about that in Real Life when you're stuck in a rut, it's a much smaller felony to remedy the situation in a virtual world. There isn't much that can be done to stop the practice, either - it's not considered a crime in the Real World, the perpetrators live on the other side of the planet, and the only measures that could possibly bring a halt to it would also ruin gameplay for the people who continue to play legitimately. All they can do is enforce measures to discourage player endorsement of farming, relying on the word of players to point out the farmers and banning accounts which receive inordinately large amounts of ingame currency for no apparent ingame reason. It does nothing at all about the source of the issue, since they just make new accounts, get new ISPs, rinse and repeat.\n\nThere's nothing that can be done about the hundreds of workers who rely upon the game currency industry for food and housing without applying far more severe consequences than any police force would see as reasonable. If we were to make OOG currecy trading a criminal offense, it would raise all sorts of issues about international trade, the limits of the world market, and who, exactly has jurisdiction over what happens on the internet. There are places in the world where certain actions which may be wholly legal in a game would be considered vastly more heinous; do they have the right to prosecute a member of their nation for doing something in a virtual environment? Or to enforce their own laws into a game which is published and run from another country and culture where virtual actions aren't taken as seriously?\n\nDo we really want to go there just now, when the games industry is still considered a niche market, despite being bigger than Hollywood by now? I'm not going to outline the potential consequences of that; chances are, I'd only hit the less severe ones. We all know how members of the government can fuss over games content and propriety; what do YOU think would happen if they suddenly realised they could have a LOT more control over that than they thought they did? Or worse, that they could be making money from it?\n\nAs much as we might not like to admit it, ISK farmers are people, and they're not going anywhere.\n\nLengthy post but well written and it makes some good points. We see a lot of suspicious activity in the area where we live--haulers and smaller ships piloted by characters that just scream \"farmer\" which seem to be able to travel with impunity. One almost *never* sees their \"easy target\" wrecks at gates and stations. Yet two fair-sized pirate/PvP corps with quite a few players online all the time are located in systems that these easy targets travel through regularly. You'd think more of them would be getting popped. It might be related to the fact that many online members of those corps never seem to undock. I wonder why that is.\n\nIt remains to be seen if there is a connection between the two...and if there is, what (if anything) can or should be done about it. I'm not necessarily keen to have a killboard full of popped farmer haulers and frigates (especially as they are known to carry nothing of value), but it might be worth launching a campaign to see if any kind of obvious response pattern emerges over time. relating"

Sorry.\n\nBeam Frigates are quite dangerous to your turrets, especially if you use Ctrl-click like I do. They were probably my least favorite wave to see in this game. So. Much. Carnage.\n\nI took the rebel colony and found out just how tough those rebels can be. If they can clear out a quadrant by themselves, why did they need me to rescue them? They freed up the rest of my fleet to capture the Warbird and Bomber IV Factories. It was easy to clear and hold them, and I got to play with some new toys.\n\nI really, really like the new Warbirds. They're deadly but not invulnerable, and just a lot of fun to play with. I used them with Raid Starships to make a fairly unstoppable raiding force. Bomber IVs were exactly as I remembered, turning things into debris quickly and efficiently.\n\nAll was well, and I was happy, and then...\n\n\"2,407 ships are massing for a Cross-Planet attack.\" I had less than 12 minutes to prepare and I had just crashed my economy building very expensive starships. You can probably see where this is going.\n\nA more skilled player probably could have fought on that many fronts and managed better. I should have unlocked fortresses earlier. I had time to build one before the warning, and none after. That could have made a tremendous difference. I also probably should have unlocked some mk II and III triangle ships, but I was too enamored with my reclaimers. Once your reclaimed fleet goes down, the mk I gets chewed up pretty quickly by mk II and III fleets. My empire was fragmented, with too many places to defend. I expanded too quickly after getting giddy with how much power I had.\n\nStill, I held out for quite a while. The Zenith fleet dealt more than its share of death to the AI and managed to hold the the Nanoswarm and Blade Spawner Fabricators. They just turned out to be the wrong planets to defend in force.\n\nThe Resistance fleet was a standout, holding its colony by itself, then carving a path through AI-controlled space to the Homeworld, only to arrive too late to save it. It's doubtful how effective they would have been against 800 ships, but I would have liked to see it.\n\nI had used all of my Starships to protect the Warbird and Bomber fabricators, and they were very good at it. A full cap of Mk I and II starships, supported by the Warbirds and Bomber IVs, cleared at least 300, maybe closer to 400 ships worth of Mk II and III threat without any fleet support, and very few turrets.I'm STILL learning...\n\nThat volume of CPA is due to not keeping better AIP control. I'd have figured your reclaimers would have fared better turning the CPA on itself, but I guess not.\n\nWhen you have something like that coming in at you, you have to basically do what your body does for frostbite control, abandon the extremities. If you can mass your force at a choke or two and eat heavily into the CPA, you've got a shot, but otherwise you'll usually lose all your fabs and whatnot to a CPA of any intensity.\n\nPost-mortem for the CPA: - The Nanoswarm fabricator should technically be able to defend itself given a healthy amount of income and mark I triangle ship support. With a stream of paralysing/reclaiming bombs, this leaving you with time to focus down immediate threats like Electric Bombers and Starships. - Once you've built your Blade Pwners V, you can ditch their fabricators in an emergency. In my experience they're easier to keep alive than most fleet/star ships if you keep them within a fleet-ball. - IIRC, CS-destruction restarts the count down timer and does not decloak the Rebel Colony. Therefore you can ignore that system and send your rebel fleet away, and still have time to reclaim the system after the CPA.\n\nThe above decisions frees both the Zenith-ball and rebel fleet for your core defense. Shifting the Plasma-Siege Is would also help. As you found out, never skimp on core defenses with mark-I triangles. You can skip fortresses on 7-like difficulties if you had those good ships to counter likely AI assetsZharmad, I didn't know that about the Rebel Colony. That would have definitely changed my plan. I like the rest of your strategy. I have a save about 8 minutes before the CPA hits. I could reload it and see if that makes a difference. It goes against my nature as a Roguelike player but I'll make an exception for research purposes this time.\n\nAmusingly, I once just could not get to a colony in time to stop it from decloaking. Once it decloaked, it stayed alive for the next hour and change. Long enough for me to win the game. So just because it decloaks doesn't always mean it's toast. I wouldn't count on that happening every time, but it is possibleLOL, luckily, I'm quite sure I'm not either. The information about the Rebel Colony is correct, ti just goes back to being cloaked and hides again for a 2 hour timer.\n\nI'll admit it was exhilarating. I even thought I might win for a few minutes, there. While I never use humanity's ultimate weapon usually, I decided to see what would happen if I changed my strategy. I abandoned the rebel colony and the Fabricators, and sent most of the fleet back to the homeworld. It was still a tough fight, and I lost my Hive Golem, about half of the fleet, and five planets, but I survived. The AI didn't even attack the fabricators. What luck, I thought.\n\nUntil waves of 902 fighters and 987 Polarizers were announced right on top of each other. They rampaged through four of my remaining worlds to get to my homeworld, losing more than half of their number. What was left was enough to finish me off, though."

Not just in being the second species to join, but in how they changed.\n\nIn a way, some of the krogan found religion, or rather, religion found them.\n\nOne of the battlemasters working with special forces units made a friend who happened to introduce him to Norse mythology. It seemed that the viking sagas managed to mix well with the few religious tendencies of the krogan.\n\nIt was an unexpected shift, but after a second look, relatively unsurprising after the fact.\n\nOf course, the shift must have startled the hell out of the Citadel at the time, and it took a lot of effort to shift them back to sane armor rather than adding the horns to their helmets that they saw in art and fantasy stories.\n\nThe helmet cam from the STG team trying to gain access to our datanet is still rather far up there in the ratings. Ten salarians trying to deal with an enraged krogan in the buff singing some of the old norse sagas while using a decorative warhammer.\n\nMost still aren't sure if the krogan was just that good, or if it was the shock of stumbling upon a drunken, naked krogan that gave him the advantage there."

The dramatic impact of a death star with lots of little weapons isn't nearly as dramatic the one huge beam.\n\nIf we assume that one slot represents a fixed volume of physical space, then this might be a problem, but the number of slots in a hull doesn't necessarily have to scale proportionally with the on-screen apparent volume of a ship model, as long as we can fit the weapon models onto the hull model somehow... So, we could have a single-slot death-star laser that looks much bigger on the model than a single-slot pea shooter tier-1 PD weapon.No, variable space-slots is not a workable option, assuming:\n1) the smallest ships are much smaller than the biggest ships\n2) the difference in the size of weapons is significant\n3Slots need to have at least a general association will a volume of space. — or else weaponry doesn't show on the model, and the question is moot.\n\nThe physical positions on ship models corresponding to individual slots could perhaps just be spaced out far enough for the largest weapon models to fit... Then smaller weapon models would just have some extra space. Not ideal graphically, obviously, but if such a system was better in various other ways...Ok, so I assume you are talking about a grid of squares where we try and arange components in this grid, where each component takes up: (1) or (2) as you state.\n\nIs (1) that a weapon always takes up multiple slots, eg 2x2? Is (2) that a weapon takes up any number of slots, eg 1x1 or 2x3, etc? How is (2) not achievable? It has been done in games like Diablo and many other RPG games.\n\neleazar wrote:\n\nNo, variable space-slots is not a workable option, assuming: 1) the smallest ships are much smaller than the biggest ships 2) the difference in the size of weapons is significant 3Why do we suddenly need to be able to attach weapons onto the hulls in a 3d model system like Galciv2? This seems overblown to me.\n\nWe should just place components in slots, how ever many slots they take. Have the 3d ship models be some overall ship design that doesn't show weapons.\n\nWhy do we suddenly need to be able to attach weapons onto the hulls in a 3d model system like Galciv2?

Not an impossible situation, but certainly undesirable.Being able to identify on sight many of the capabilities of your own ship would make sorting and controlling your own fleet easier too.\n\nIt should be obvious i'm not proposing anything like GalCiv2. There is nothing in my proposals that would allow you to make a ship that looks like a Transformer, star trek ship, or whatever. I'm proposing a 1-to-1 correspondence between what has been placed in various external slots, and how the ship looks— no complicated 3D modeling interface of any kind.\n\nBecause if we don't there's no way to gauge on sight anything but the size of the ship. Not an impossible situation, but certainly undesirable.\n\nI doubt that even if there was a bunch of guns on a ship, whether big or small, 1 or 50, you won't be able to tell what weapons and abilities it has. Sure, you could see that a ship has a stellar converter, because it is the biggest gun in the galaxy, but what about the little laser cannons or nuetron blasters.\n\nThis is not an RTS, so there is time for the GUI to tell us about each ship, but I think you should still be able to give each ship a distinctive style and look, but were only focusing on weapons. Are we gonna show what systems the ship has by making them visible too?\n\neleazar wrote:I like not exactly knowing what the enemy has. Eg you see some Shadow ships (Babylon 5). No sweat you think, then bang, massive pink particle beam cuts your ship in half.\n\nSuprise is good. Besides knowing what the enemy has is what scanning and detection is for. I don't think visual clues by themselves are going to make the difference you think.\n\nAlpha Centauri had rather poor voxel unit graphics, but if you looked reasonably closely, you could usually figure out what weapon a unit had, and could always discern a terraformer or colony pod or supply crawler due to their overall different appearance. As This would have a drawback of making it harder to decide where to show beams or fighters or missiles coming out of an attacking ship, however...\n\nPerhaps, but no one has made a case that being able to see some of what a ship can do is bad. (The coolness of something in a movie doesn't usually carry over to a movie intact.) These are the strongest counter-arguements i can imagine are: 1) it's too much work 2) it will prevent the ships from looking really cool\n\n1) it's too much work Well, this certainly is a less functional aspect of v.4, and the whole could work without it. I can't accurately estimate how much additional coding this would require, but it'd guess it's a small fraction of the total v.4. As for the art, it probably would be a lot of work to create all the weapons and whatever, however it should be easier to create a weapon than a ship. And we don't need to wait for all 3D models to be complete before this system has value. Even if at first the whole gamut of laser cannons is represented by only 3 models, that's still more information than nothing.\n\n2) it will prevent the ships from looking really cool This is true, to a point. Ship models that must accept arbitrary additions all over the outside will generally look less cool than ships models designed as a single piece. However, realistically FO is not going to win in the contest for wiz-bang, snazzy, eye-candy-yummy space ships. Even if we attracted top talent, graphics that impress are judged on an ever harsher scale as technology improves. So while we should make things look as good as we can, it's unlikely we'll knock anyone's socks off with pure eye-candy power. So let's not try. Rather let's give the form of our ships interest by giving them meaning. The image of a destroyer with a doom-ray may still give the jaded player chills, not because the art is the best ever, but because that doom-ray has, in the past, cost him victory.\n\nGeoff the Medio wrote:\n\n...AsExactly what i'm thinking.\n\nGeoff the Medio wrote:\n\nI think there should also be ways via the GUI to find out more detail about a ship— possibly related to your scanner tech. But persistent indicators, that gave more than the most simplified info about a ship would be intrusive and probably annoyingA heavily armored vessel might have enough armor covering the outside of the ship that it's (visually) little more than a metallic blob. It might not have any visible systems at all. Many ships in Babylon 5 and Star Trek were like thisYeah, sorry, it was hard to find pics of a descent sice. But yeah, Ive made it into a URL link. All other pics can be done like that, to give people the option.\n\n@eleazar\nI see that your idea of weapons visible on ship models is similar to Galciv2, except that it is automated, so it is really closer to Diablo 2 and other RPGs where the players visual appearance is a reflection of what they have equiped.\n\nI wouldn't mind your system, but I am just weary that we do it the right way. I don't care if it is difficult, just that it is done right.\n\nBut what about more nonmilitary designs, i think i proposed somewhere sometime ago miningship for production bonus from asteroids. And if you do cataclysmic events then special event required ships would be interesting too - Your sun is not stabile anymore build 4 scientific baseships that would hold sun stabile. And if enemy attacks your system and destroys those baseships orbiting sun, well...\nWell those things probably cannot be for 0.4 but it would be very interesting and new strategical angle to game imho.\n\nBut.... those would be best done as special ship designs, not as special ship hulls.\n\nAgreed.\nI don't think anyone has seriously proposed that ship function be strictly limited to special hulls.\n\nUnless it somehow impacts the way ships will be put together, this thread isn't about the various roles ships might perform. I don't believe any of the ship design methods discussed would have any more difficulty accommodating a solar-stabilizing-beam than a planet-busting-blaster.\n\nWeather we have solar-stabilizing-beams is a question for another time or at least"

The good news for Hadley's would be that most of the explosion's energy is spent either vaporising the rock or spewing straight up into the heavens (where it can't even drop a dropship!).

It's a long way from the AP.

As Deez said, the derelict would have been more or less intact (at least, in the same state as the Jorden family discovered it). The derelict, being an interstellar starship, would require pretty strong radiation shielding, thus protecting at least some of the eggs within from fallout (although that's assuming that the eggs are vulnerable to radiation). If the game didn't exist, this point still stands: The fourth installment in the franchise should have seen a return to the derelict site anyway, instead of the hokey clone-with-genetic-memories-of-Ripley storyline.\n\nThey could have done so much with it, maybe even set an entire movie in and around the derelict, but no! We have a story that glosses over exactly how specific memories can be encoded into DNA! That's why I don't count that movie as canon, it's bad Science-Fiction! I digress.....If the planet was subject to asteroid bombardment or high levels of radiation, sure - but that would have made it much less suitable for colonization in the first place. It seems more likely to me that the Company just dropped a bunch of somewhat-sturdy, but very cheap, prefab modules on-planet.\n\nIn fairness to Wren, nobody found the Derelict even when LV-426 had been surveyed and had people living on it for 20+ years. Apparently without the beacon or grid co-ordinates it's quite an easy thing to overlook.I think if WY had been concerned about the colonists' safety, Hadley's would have been established a long way away from the 'fully automated' AP."

So fragile, in fact, that a single misclick can lead to a fracas that quickly snowballs into all-out warfare. That's what happened to two of the spacefaring sandbox MMO's largest player alliances in the Battle of Asakai, a massive fleet vs. fleet onslaught involving 3,000 players piloting ships ranging from small interceptors to gargantuan capital ships. Straight from the wreckage-strewn outcome of the battle, we're breaking down the basics of what happened for everyone to truly fathom one of the biggest engagements in the game's history.\" The costs of this battle in in-game currency is, so far, 700 billion. While MMO's don't float my boat, I have to say that this is still pretty awesome. Penny Arcade looks at the technical details server-side, and what a battle like this does to the game's backend infrastructure.\n\nI want to avoid getting lost in the weeds when it comes to terminology is all...\n\nA distributed system is really just a collection of network connected machines running software to facilitate a common goal.\n\nBitTorrent is a good example of a distributed system. So is Seti@Home and the other examples you gave.\n\nBut one of the things you mentioned is live migration. One way to do live between two nodes in simple layman's terms:\n\n1. On the source node, snapshot the current servers complete state, and start doing incremental differential snapshots at set intervals.\n2. Send the full snapshot to the destination node. Once it has it, start sending the incrementals until you get \"caught up\"\n3. Freeze the state on the source node, send the last incremental to the destination and have it wake up, and then direct all clients to reconnect to the destination node.\n\nMy point is this process has absolutely nothing to do with distributed computing - it is the same process you would go through if you only had one server and wanted to migrate to another one. It also has an achilles heel, namely the larger the amount of state and the faster it changes, the longer it takes to complete. There is almost always a significant amount of \"lag\" involved with a fall over unless the amount of state is trivial.\n\nAll I was getting at is that EVE Online may be a poorly designed systems in some respects (I really don't know much about it), but the deficiencies you mentioned don't have anything to do with it being more or less distributed...\n\nTake seti@home... How does it deal with a non-responsive node (i.e. a user's computer that goes offline)? It simply moves on - give the work to someone else. The point is the system doesn't care about a node going away, because all a node is to it is a compute resource working on a small dataset. For seti@home, compute cycles are the gold - they don't care about latency because it doesn't matter to them.\n\nEVE is the opposite - the problem they have to solve is reducing the latency to a large number of clients in a world represented by a shared state - latency is their gold. Performing compute in separate \"islands\" is the way they reduce latency.\n\nThey are both distribute systems, but they are almost opposite in purpose and design. The bigger an EVE backend node is, the more clients it can handle with low latency, but the more state it has to manage. Live migration of a large amount of state, without negatively impacting the latency of the users, is simply not an easy problem to solve. Not saying it can't be done, just that it isn't trivial and it would almost certainly not be transparent to the users"

DS9, K7, even ESD. Once you get assigned a mission of exploration, you \"ready your crew\" and head out. You will see your ship enter warp and you will be sent to a randomly generated sector with planets that can be a mix of randomly created planets (with names like you currently find in the generator) or those with names that have been created by players for the \"Organian Trail\" - Foundry created content/planets.\n\nSince this is a video game, you don't want to upset people so this \"sector\" will be saved for the player so that he can get back to the regular game when he/she wants, and when she wants to get back to exploration he/she can get right back to this sector.\n\nYou can spend a lot of time in this sector, doing random missions (you could even have randomly generated \"dailies\" as well as the Foundry missions (randomly chosen from the growing list of player made missions). Once you \"clear\" the sector, you would get a small reward or something and can either return to your home base (ESD/DS9/D7/etc.) or decide to move forward and move further away from known space.I do have some answers for you:\n\nA) YES - when you create a Foundry mission, right when you begin working on it you would click on a tab that would make it either a player made mission that you would find \"inter-connected\" with the rest of the game world, where you would link your mission to Admiral Quinn, other known NPC's etc, and the other option would be to make a mission that would be an \"Organian Trail\" mission i.e. an Exploration Mission, which would have NO CONTACT with known NPC's other then perhaps \"hey, you got a subspace communication from Admiral Quinn about the race you are having talks with.\"\n\nSo there's no way you would accidentally have a mission out in deep space that would take you to Utopia Planetia since you would chose \"Known Sectors\" or \"Exploration\" before you begin work on your mission.\n\nB) Each type of mission would still be run through the group that approves missions, so that would prevent us from running into the \"Jah-Wahs\" lolIdeas to continue later...It will be good if is done as player/team inctance - so you not going to race about exploring a system with 10 others captains (it is totaly ridiculus).\nThose missions has to be randomly swithced, Space combat, space explore, diplomacy, ground combat, ground explore.The further OUT from your resupply point (the spacedocks) you get, the harder the missions get. Since it's a video game you don't want to make it too hardcore, so the player can \"leave\" the Organian Trail whenever he wants and get back to it when he wants. Until he \"cancels\" his exploration mission he keeps on moving further away and into more difficult sectors (and better rewards).\n\nThere should be some kind of system to make things much more difficult as you progress. For instance, getting three \"sectors\" away from home you run into a species that doesn't want you travelling through, so naturally you need to diplo them into letting you pass. Likewise, trade missions or something similar to the Mem Alpha missions to allow you to continue progressing. Otherwise it's just another exploration cluster with better loot drop.\n\nAlso, it shouldn't incorporate UGC only.

All the current rewards are locked until we reach tier 5? I mean come on guys we worked hard and long for that stuff, and suddenly we don't have access to it? After looking at it, its clear that completing the rep system up to tier five will take weeks at the minimum. Am i missing something here? I'm one piece short of completing my mk XII ground set, I have two complete mk XII space sets and maco commander title. While I hope to get the final piece of the ground set before the launch of 7, I have killed IGE many, many times and never gotten the prototype shield tech. But if I don't I'm suddenly locked out, from getting the set for weeks maybe months, regardless of whether i can speed through all the Ground Elites. How is that fair?\n\nGiving bonus dilithium does not suddenly make that better, I have more dilithium then I care to use right now, which will certainly will help me in my quest to get my gear back, but I'm gonna have to spend resources and a large length of time getting back what i spent weeks and months getting in the first place? Come on guys, there has to be a better way of doing thisFirst of all Cryptic, stop adding ******n DOff requirements to these things. I don't know how you haven't noticed the huge problems yet but to put it plainly, your in-game economy cannot handle it. There simply aren't remotely enough DOffs either on the market or through existing means of production that can support even a few of the players' higher-end requirements, let alone everyone's.\n\nSecondly, gating people out from commonly-used equipment (the Borg console? Seriously?) means we'll see a wider gulf between geared players and naked ones and the PvP queues will suffer even worse. If you want to make a quick buck out of forcing people to buy dil, fine, but just be straight-up honest about it and remove all the other item requirements. Just make it a dil store. What we have right now is absolutely awfulthere's a giant gaping flaw in your logic.... I don't buy doffs more than once a month or so. All I do to get them is academy recruitment. Most on the exchange are idiotically priced as is. The main change in cost is the compactor, which yeah, now you have to pay to compact and uncompact over and over. Uncompactor is still free to use if you really need more commons.\n\nAnd yes, I am a student of peak oil theory. More people should learn about it. But the analogy is inapplicable as it's merely a small change in cost not the drastic changes that you'll get when the major oil deposits are tapped out. That would cause oil production prices to rise a lot more than the season 7 vendor prices will. Secondary market prices.... good luck figuring those. but yeah, SBs have caused the availability of certain doffs to tank totally. The other flaw is that oil is used for fuel. While doffs have been compared to fuel, they aren't directly comparable. You don't need a steady supply to keep your starbase running, only to improve it.\n\nthere's a giant gaping flaw in your logic.... I don't buy doffs more than once a month or so.\n\nSo are Starbases a Zen Store purchase? is the upcoming Reputation systems also a Zen Store purchases?\n\nIf they are they lets drop the pretend and put it there, not destroying the Commendation system so Cryptic can go about saying its not Zen Store purchases since they only fooling the people that refuse to see and those people would line up and jump at the opportunity to defend all things Cryptic.\n\nSince the new c-store ships should have 10 consoles after the sovereign failure (they won't admit it but this ship wasn't a success at all, you'll see very few people flying it), you don't even need fleet ships. New c-store ones will have up to par stats. And of course the lockbox ones will remain slightly superior.\n\nYou didn't need the starbases' weaponry: the STF store is still free in season 6, and you will unlock new stuff in your personal stores through reputation. Of course this weaponry is competitive with the fleet one; there's nothing you need in the fleet stores, except the hangar pets (and fleet hangar pets might not be that great since some guys can't stop whinning about runabouts. ). And of course the STF sets are better than any fleet gear, because they have good bonuses and powers.\n\nSo, if you're logical, you should stop working on your starbase right now. There was little to no reason to start a starbase before season 6; with season 7, there is absolutely no reason to upgrade it anymore. Their rewards sucks. They have no use, everything can be found in other stores or on the exchange. Eventually, they will toss better carrier pets in the lockboxes and there will be zero reason to even consider spending something in the starbases."

Stand together.\"\n\nDespite my hatred for the ending of Mass Effect 3, I will admit that I thought the rest of the game was quite good. It lacked in certain areas, but it really wasn't a bad game overall.\n\nHowever, I wonder something… was I the only one who thought that the human attitude toward dealing with the Reapers was a little… selfish? I mean, every single populated planet in the galaxy is being either bombarded or invaded on a massive scale and humanity's attitude is never anything more than \"MERRRR, earth has it worse!!\" Every human you talk to seems to think that the council is simply being anti-human rather than understanding that every race in the galaxy is currently dealing with the same problem. I'll admit that some of the grudges between races were absolutely childish, and in those cases, I can understand certain races being frustrated with others… but the Turian and Asari not being able to commit ships and soldiers to take back earth right away… come on. Did you expect them to abandon their planets simply because earth had been invaded also? Palaven was smoldering just as badly as earth was, and Thessia looked like it was completely destroyed after the Kai Leng fight. My point is, I wonder if anyone ever stopped and thought to themselves, \"Well, the Asari councilor actually has a point.\"\n\nI love the Salarians. And actually, the Salarian Councilor is the only member of the Council who I actually like. Even though he doesn't believe in the Reapers, he always hears you out and he always sounds sincere.\n\nI was thinking about this last night and I couldn't figure out why BioWare hasn't really touched on the issue at all.\n\nWe know why we never see any Krogan females\n\nWe hardly see any male Drell, so I assume any Drell sighting is rare\n\nThe wiki mentions that it is unknown as to whether or not Hanar have separate sexes or if they are asexual\n\nAnd I'm unaware as to whether or not the Elcor, Batarians, Volus, or Vorcha have separate sexes or if they are similar to the Asari in that way\n\nThat being said, the only females (besides humans) we see in Mass Effect are the Asari (which is a given seeing as how there are no male Asari; the wiki mentions that the codex indicates that the Asari are \"all-female\" despite gender differences) and the Quarians (of which I often feel like we see more female than male).\n\nWe know for a fact that there are indeed both Turian and Salarian females, but we never see them. The Turian at the bachelor party mentions that there aren't many Turian women on Ilium. The Salarians have no sex drive, but we know that females exist because of the reproduction contracts they agree to. So then how come we never seen Turian or Salarian females on the Citadel? Or on Ilium?\n\nI find this quite strange. If I'm wrong about any of this, feel free to correct me!"

It's quite easy to live in nullsec without being the nearest entities bitch; the best example I can think of atm is Valor Empire & Outer Ring becomeIn short, no.\n\nThat said, you can be treated extremely well depending who you go with. DC might treat you well if you team up with c0nvicted for chunks of Delve, and Tri(NCdot/Ev0ke) isn't that terrible either if they have any extra space and you don't mind the . DRF has great space to build up your supercapital force.1. Rent\n2. Pile onto a rotting corpse as part of a coalition and be rewarded with space\n3. Take space on your own (really hard)\n\n4. Be shobon as fuck newbies from an existing online community\n\nAlso delve/querious/half of periodbasis is wide the fuck open\n\nIn all seriousness, you state your 'industry side is top notch' because of some blueprint stuff, but particularly early on your survival will be dependent on having trusted people who can poopsock fueling, timing, and gunning towers 23/7. If you can't get a handful of people to do this without fail it doesn't matter what the other 99% of your alliance is capable of, you will die and leave\n\nGetting sov solo would be very difficult while being unaffliated, though depending on how smooth tongued your diplomats anything is possible.\n\nParking yourself in NPC space with a group that size should be fine as long as you pick a fight you have a chance of winning.\n\nOriginally Posted by BrutorWarriorAgreed. 60-80 active dudes that would X up will get a lot of interest from established alliances.\n\nIf you can field 80 man gangs you'll be able to wreck some shit in NPC 0.0\nI'd say just go \"take over\" a station in GW or Syndicate. You won't get all the benefits of having sov, but you wouldn't be able to claim sov anyway, and if you live in an NPC region you're within striking distance of sov holders. NPC 0.0 can actually be a lot of fun, and I'm sure your alliance will enjoy the challenge. If you went to sov space you'd likely get sick of the blobs very quickly and it'd hurt your memberbaseJust wanna say thanks for all the great feedback so far, lots of stuff I really never thought of. I kinda figured we aren't ready for SOV yet, probably won't be for a long while, but NPC null does sound really, really tempting. becomeThis. Every bit of this is spot on.\n\nAlso, Ransom's thing about wh's is spot on as well.\n\nIn regards to the pee ell post, a great example is Appetite 4 Destruction. They formed an alliance called Aggravated Assault with some other brosefs from back in the day and they've been living in curse since like... 05? They basically go pew pew into Catch / Provi / Tenerfis / etc etc and run Angel missions farming Cynabal and Machariel BPCs during slow times. They make a fuck ton of isk doing so and there's always shit to kill.\n\nYour best bet, imo, is to either A) find a wh for sale that's a c4+ (for capital escalations) or B) move into NPC 0.0 and just grow. From a large class wh, you can do actual k-space 0.0 roams and make a fuckton running sites. And in NPC 0.0 space, you can run pirate missions and ninja rat in an alliance's space during their downtimes. If your eventual goal is sov though, NPC is your best bet. Your guys get accustomed to the logistics of living in 0.0, you can't really get ~pushed~ out, you make decent money depending which region and you'll quickly find out who can hack it and who can't. Once you get your capital / super fleet established, then you can start throwing your weight around, etc etc.\n\nHere's a list of the most profitable NPC regions to live in based on my experience:\nBest: Delve, Curse, Venal\nWorst: Outer Ring, Great Wildlands, Syndicate\nMeh: Fountain, Pure Blind\nStain is the wildcard. It's insanely profitable if you can manage the logistics of keeping members supplied. It's literally fucking forever away from lowsec and I believe you'll need JDC 5 with multiple mids through GW and Curse to make it there (you might even have to ninjacyno in AAA space v0v). I wouldn't advise making Stain your first attempt into 0.0 though because it will literally break you off :P\n\nIf you want to learn how to rape the fuck out of c5's with caps, hit me up and I'll tell you how to farm them.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n[B]I PAID 25 EUROS FOR A SIG AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS SHITTY TROLL ATTEMPT[/B]Null just went through some income changes. Perhaps Providence will have some space available soon. You might consider speaking to Ev0Ke or Ewoks about that. Of course the reason that might be is the Provi stations will be more of a challenge to pay for sov due to a scarcity of good moons, ore, and anomsMalcore got it basically right and I'd second NPC Delve as well. There is really no benefit holding 0.0 sov in your situation and lots of drawbacks. If you get your shit pushed in by some bigger/older alliance (this will happen repeatedly) your stuff is safe in NPC stations and at worst you lose some moons. The nice thing about NPC Delve in particular is the logistics aren't terrible and that is going to be critical for your industrial guys to be useful (even if it is just JFing the crap they made in empire into your staging station.)\n\ned: I don't recommend negotiating with anyone who currently owns shitty space about entry as some sort of junior partner because there is a reason they are suddenly looking to get rid of said shitty spaceNo problem broski, best of luck. Hit me up in-game on Kimerra when you get the chance.\n\n[B]I PAID 25 EUROS FOR A SIG AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS SHITTY TROLL ATTEMPT[/B]\n\nMate - feel free to hit me up any time in-game. What you are looking at doing is a question almost every small alliance asks itself at some time or another.\n\nIn my case, we went from Metro Losec to Syndicate as a corp (not alliance) to blood my guys, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. I know these other dudes think WHs are the go - and they may be for ISK - but tbh ISK is the very LEAST of your concerns - it will come with the upgraded environment.\n\nI chose to stay in NPC 0.0 for 2 years and every day was a blast. It teaches you \"the old fashioned way\" of holding and keeping space - by literal domination of your environment and the tenacity to keep going because ooutlasting the other guys in a patch war is the ONLY way to win. The lessons you will learn there are invaluable.\n\nSince finally making the move away from NPC 0.0 its a somewhat different skillset - but not seriously so. Whatever you do, if you choose to align to a bloc (like us) make the right choices. AIF is an object lesson in that regard\n\nBeing a pet and how you handle that position is a mindset - not necessarily a sentence. Act and operate as independantly as possible - call on aid/assistance not at all or as little as humanly possible, and help your partners as MUCH as possible.\n\nIf you are already fielding 60-80 man gangs you will do just fine in NPC 0.0 on your own. I'm not so sure Delve NPC is the best way to go - Syndicate isnt the best for ISK but its great for PvP and has some nice little pockets to establish yourselves in and fight for. I never lived in Venal or Curse, so can't comment on thoseThis is probably the single best bit of advice (although there is also some other very good advice). I'd expanded on what Wusti said with this: almost every aspect of sov space is a giant incentive to massive faggotry. Your alliance quickly fills up with worthless bears and spies, you have to abandon any ideas you had about a short blue list and in general you have to compromise your fun at every turn.\n\nUnless you're really really sure that you want to be a space emperor and all your alliance are right behind you in that ambition (in which case you and your alliance are already by definition terrible faggots, so what the hell, go for it) then go for NPC 0.0 or W-space or just bulk buy some eye-patches & parrots and lock down a nice juicy bit of lo-sec with some good agents in a dead-end pocket.\n\nReally good advice has been given in this thread, most of which is much better than anything I can offer. My main suggestion is this: There is a lot of space held by IT in Delve that they are not defending and is not being sought after. I would suggest taking a few systems, without the intention to keep them. Move your stuff to NPC Delve, and then begin assaulting one or two IT station systems. You'll learn about moving your entire alliance, you'll deal with constant gankers, and you'll also learn just how frustrating and time consuming sov warfare can be. The main problem is some members of your alliance might not be willing to part with space they \"took\" and you'll end up stuck there until someone kicks you out - which is a massive morale kick for a starting alliance.\n\nIf Wusti is still scheming to create a new, small coalition in Delve/Fountain/PB then hit him up. At worst you own a system or two among numerous other smaller alliances, and you'll probably have around 6 months before one of them realizes it can dominate and absorb all the others.\n\n?\"eve's a bad mmo, really bad, it's only saving grace is the people playing it, which i guess doesn't say great things about the people playing other MMOs\"\n\nOur corporations have lived in Wholes (not alliance in general) and they are good alternative to empire and accessible for smaller corporations/alliances too. Good places for a while but a bit boring in the long run.\n\nWe lived in Syndicate and Pure Blind just to get a hang of 0.0. Nothing spectacular happend in those places but there you learned fast that its strenght in numbers or you better be quick and skillfull.\n\nThen we moved to Provi/Catch and rented some systems. Wars started in that region right away when we moved in and that was a good school to learn bout fleet fights, diplomacy and getting connected.\n\nFor smaller alliances itīs not easy to find your corner and get settled. Basicly i would say that get your pvp skills in order and learn to operate as a group. Get respect from neighboring alliances and keep the lines of communication open even if itīs day to day firefight with neighbors. Someday they might think that hey those dudes can really pack a punch lets work together instead of fighting or you just end up kicking their ass out and move in (or they send u back to square one).\n\nLooking back i now get why most say renting is not a good idea if you want to be more than anomaly farmers. But sometimes it can be the opportunity that opens doors for you to show you are prepared to be more than a possible paycheck for the big powerplayer in whatever region you are in.\n\nIīd say that wars create oportunities too. Keep your eyes on regions that are in conflict and pick your side. If you show you can take care of business amazing things might happen or you loose everything but atleast you learned a valuable lesson.. hopefully..\n\nYou really can't be driven out, as long as you're more patient than your enemies. You can grief the hell out of whoever lives where u set ur sights. Most of the alliances around where I live fold whenever u grief their ratters for more than a week. Blackops bridging of bombers is amazingly good for this as long as u have enough good pilots with cyno V and someone that can operate the bridge with JDC V.\n\nThe problem with Sov 0.0 right now is that all of the powerblocs can out number u 10:1 so fighting them is extremely difficult over Timers and Structures. The only real advantages to sov 0.0 are anomalies and ego.\n\nIn NPC 0.0 The random spawn of 10/10s, 8/10s, and 6/10s and the occasional officer from belt surfing regularly will fund your operation fairly well. Choose a region where jump logistics aren't too difficult where u have a few options otherwise u'll burn out ur JF pilots quick. Syndicate and Great Wildlands are large regions where people come and go regularly. Or u can setup shop in a Sov region with an NPC constellation like FDZ in Geminate or KFIE in Delve or X-7 in Pure Blind, these areas are almost constantly staging points for wars however. Hope it helps\n\nAlso remember the golden rule if you're trying to build relationships - Everyone remembers the asshole (and not in a nice way)\n\nDon't smack after your fights and you'll get further with the local lords. If you're trying to build relationships and see what happens fight by all means but don't be a raging faggot at the end of it.\n\nWhat I was trying to iterate was that you will be looked upon more favourably if you show respect to your enemies. Nobody minds pew pew and roams and beating eachothers towers, but if you smack like a retard and generally show disrepect for other people who are playing you will be remembered for it and it might come back to bite you sometime in the future.\n\nEve is a very long game and in many ways cyclical. Every few months people shuffle another 30 or so degrees around the 360 degree map in various directions. You will eventually find yourself on the \"other side\" one way or the other having to work with people who remember you as a sperging retard.\n\nSo really, it pays to be smug only some of the time.\n\nI - of course - am the worst possible example of this. But I do speak from experience\n\nI agree with your iteration, Entaran. I also would iterate that pew pews and cycles be managed mindfully, else your space honor will not be honored in future pew pews, after the degrees have shifted in various directions, cyclically.Its why Aussies are usually good posters: We have some of the finest Pinot Noirs in the world\n\nThe Coonawara valley is very good, but I prefer the pacific northwest don't know, man. I'm not thin skinned (though I'm easily trolled) but the peeps at Kugu seemed much cooler than the ones as SHC and CAOD. I lurked at both for a while and never bothered posting in SHC but new people over there seemed far more likely to get burned down than here."

I would say, by going not by victories, but by scores. So what you have healed, what you have dished out, how much movement you have impaired, how much damage resistance negated for how long (and how much additional damage your team could get out of it), etc... of course, for this, the game would have to be able to keep track of these things.\n\ncreate a seperate que with no lockbox c-store or lobi ships or gear and give everyone a pvp only ship where they have acess to only generic gear so no one has a huge p2w advantage\nlike in the current system also all teams must be random no premades\n\nOne could say the game's already overdue for some sort of PvP Rating System.

They're both sporting T5 ships though... /cough\n\nIf gear, rep levels, etc, etc, etc had a point level - then the cumulative value of those points could give a Rating...as far as queues go. In Ker'rat and other such areas, yeah... hopefully the fresh 50's a KDF looking to complete his Die25, eh?\n\nThe gear gap is only going to grow and grow as time goes on...and personally, I think such a Rating system is already overdue. With such a system in place, one could easily envision multiple levels of PvP Rep Ranking based on the divides from that PvP Rating.\n\nIt's just kind of funny - in thinking about my #1 toon and my #6 toon. The #1 guy is sporting that mix of VR Mk XI/XII gear, has various set bonuses, and is T5 in both New Rom/Omega. The #6 guy is sporting that mix of...Green Mk X through Blue Mk XI gear, no sets, and isn't even T1 in either New Rom/Omega. Both are in T5 ships though, eh? That gear discrepancy is only going to get worse as time goes on...\n\nAnd I honestly do think it's overdue in the game as is...\nAnd I honestly think it's only going to look more overdue as time goes on...\n\nEver considered why its an ass whoopin when you enter arenas?\nThe pve game is so mindless in terms of AI that it misleads people into believing they are good. This mental state of mind is taken to the queues for the first time and then smashed to bits. To preserve whatever is left after that, they never enter queues again.\n1 simple thing would improve the state of play for all newcomers overnight. Make distribute shields a standard feature which is always on and does not have to be activaed. This in itself would reduce the insta pop face role pattern.\n\nBalance is another issue altogeter. As the devs have confirmed themselves, balancing on 1v1 is not possible. I fully agree with this.\nQuestion has to be what are you balancing against? What is the benchmark? If this isnt defined, the question is pointless in itself.\nWhy bother trying to balance to an unknown criteria? You will never balance anything.\n\nOh i do agree that first time in arena is learning exp because of the mindset pve puts one in.\n\nBut even many in my fleet love to pvp infleet but never like to hit the arena because a pug vs premade will lose and lose badly 9/10 times. Only once was i in a pug vs premade and we actually racked up like 10 kills, but usually its 0-2 kills, likewise everytime ive gone in with my premade against pugs we destroy them easily, its literally like all 5 of us are just standing still shooting ducks. And that is what causes so few to hit the arnena is fear of being a pug and going against a premade that you have no shot to winAgree with your idea, but the statement about having no balls to face each other privately is a bit misleading. We ask virtually everyday now for a premade match and maybe get 1 if we are lucky. We dont care if they are klink or fed. If we dont get a response and we know there is a premade in queues, we will go hunting"

Such changes can impact documentation like tooltips, so it's a moving target as well as being a big one.\n\nThis is actually a big issue to me, and a lot of other players I believe, Phoxe. I hope that we get free respecs every time a major, fundamental change to the game system comes out. If I build a character based on One system, and that system is completely overhauled and replaced, we really do deserve a free respecification of our characters. Its a change by no fault of our own. I realize that the game will change, and be tweaked and made to be better and better, as well as more fair. I just think it should be fair to those who have invested in traits that are being completely redefined. I actually wouldn't be surprised if they do this though, its a very logical choice after all.\n\nEspecially when it comes to maneuverability.... I'm actually surprised how well my cruiser handles compared to an escort... especially seeing as the cruiser has a mass at least 1000 times that of an escort.\n\nYou're forgetting this is in space, not water. There's only so much you can do with mechanically driven props that can only be mounted in one plane. In space, if you're 1000 times more massive, you just put thrusters that produce 1000 times more force, in the exact same orientations as the ship that's a 1000 times less massive as you and both ships should do the exact same thing."

      "text": "that it really doesn't matter who you assign as a Department Head when it comes to the messages that come from your BOFFs. For instance, every time I warp from one sector to another, whoever is assigned to the first tactical station is who tells me we're cleared to warp. If there is no tactical officer, then you get the BOFF assigned as First Officer. The same seems to be true everywhere else with other functions. If you're flying a ship with only one engineering station but happen to have two engineering BOFFs, one of whom is assigned as Chief Engineer and the other of whom is assigned as Chief of Operations, you're always gonna get the Chief Engineer (or more puzzlingly the Tactical or Science Officer) for Ops things if that's who's slotted in a station.\n\nMy question is: why does the system defer to the stations when the point of having more than five or six BOFFs is to be able to change these station abilities out, while the point of the Department Heads is to provide a senior staff face? Shouldn't all these messages that we get in space come from Department Heads or the First Officer all of the time, regardless of whether or not they're currently occupying a station slot? I feel like it's an easy change to make the Department Head system mean a little more.\n\nAlso weird, and in the opposite direction, is when a Department Head talks to me as a member of my away team as if they're still on the ship. Or when a Department Head comms in from the ship to tell me about something I just found on the planet (which happens way less frequently). I understand that, in early parts of the game especially, sometimes there's just no convenient way around the fact that the ship has something to say to the away team and all the BOFFs are on the ground with the PC, but it's just awkward when it happens. Perhaps a general (non-playable, non-functioning, non-buffing/debuffing, non-anything else) security or communications officer can be assigned the function of reporting things from the ship when all of the BOFFs a player owns are on the ground. Just pull one of the already existing faces from the system and throw them at the bottom of the list. Maybe this is easier said that algorithmed. But, the immersion would be better.\n\nAnother question, when/if there's ever the ability to choose to play as the FOFF on away missions and leave the Captain on the bridge (where Starfleet Regulation says he/she belongs), will the Captain (aka PC) report things from the ship to the away team?"

      "text": "The Inevitable\n\nWith the apparent demise of Wing Commander, there are only two major space action genres left, and it's inevitable that they'll be compared. Much like UT and Q3A get put up toe to toe, Starlancer finds itself poised against FreeSpace 2. In the graphical department, there is no comparison.\n\nI'm blind!\n\nA Nanny Ship?\n\nFreeSpace 2 is gorgeous. It does a lot of things, and does them very well. However, it can't stack up to Starlancer's polish. The extra time has definitely made a difference. Starlancer might not have effects like beam weapons, but that's about all that it is missing. The capital ships have a more primitive, smaller look to them, but feel more refined. The texturing is simple, yet there is a clear luster and... believable quality to them. The simplistic designs fit. Your ship, the Reliant, for example, looks like the most primitive cargo carrying box out there. However, newer designs are obviously better looking - the Yamato, for example, is a more modern carrier than yours, with the looks and firepower to prove it.\n\nThere's the Reliant\n\nThe Sun's Very Orange this far out\n\nFighters are much more detailed in general - compared to both capital ships and their FS2 counterparts. It might be just the light reflections, but they do look a whole lot better.\n\nThe Worlds\n\nOne of the cooler things you'll get to see is the planets. Flying around the solar system, you'll run into several of them. Early on, you'll have Neptune accompanying you way off in the distance, shining its calm, blue, in desperate need of FSAA glory at you. You'll see a few of the other planets as you go on, but the one I could not forget myself was Venus. You end up very close to it, and it's just an awesome sight, filling up all of your view at times.\n\nJumping Out\n\nThat ship looks a 'bit' better than the Reliant\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots, the planets aren't always fully visible. Depending on your angle on a planet and the sun's direction, you might see all of it or only a crescent. This is just one of those many little atmosphere effects you'll probably never get the time to get tired of. Why? Those explosions will draw you away. Oh man, Starlancer has the best explosions we've ever seen. The fighters blow in the typical expanding ring, but capital ships have this cool cascade explosion effect. The explosion doesn't build up like it does in FS2 - there are no electric shocks arcing the hull and smaller blasts. The ships simply disintegrate, blasted to bits, section by section. Imagine playing dominoes with nitro-glycerin!\n\nThere was, however, one problem with the graphics (in fact, the only thing that might be construed as a bug in the entire game). Sometimes they got very choppy - unreasonably so given the current detail level. The adjustment of 3D sound and graphical resolution was no help. It was as bad at 640x480 as at 1024x768. This seems particularly odd in light of the fact that the beta appeared to run smooth on a Celeron 466. It just might be system specific."

      "text": "was thinking... I really kind of hate the idea of \"sacrificing\" DOFFs to feed the Hungy, Hungy Hipp-- err, Starbase. Why do we have to \"give up\" DOFFs? Will we ever be able to give up BOFFs (which seem pretty useless)? We just finished a mission where we all had to give up a bunch of green level diplomats. I think the entire fleet HATED that mission with a passion...\n\nI like 'leveling up' DOFFs through the personnel office, where I get some kind of a reward out of it and get to do better on future DOFF missions. I don't like summarily getting rid of doffs without like-form compensation, in ways that will NEGATIVELY impact my own performance on my own DOFF missions.\n\nWhat I'd kind of like to see is a set of COOPERATIVE DOFF missions for fleet starbase construction. That is, a non-destructive way to use DOFFs to complete the starbase. It \"feels\" more right. That is, we could send engineering DOFFs off to \"upgrade power conduits\" or send fabrication DOFFs off to \"build phaser turrets,\" etc. These would be kind of \"super DOFF missions,\" requiring fleet participation. It would also encourage people who would otherwise not necessarily use the DOFF system or upgrade their ranks & DOFF inventory to do so.\n\nI'd envision it as a slightly larger version of DOFF missions with maybe a few more DOFFs than the typical mission required (or just MORE MISSIONS, but similar numbers of DOFFs). Certain missions would be white level, green level, blue level and purple level, with differing levels of success/failure, etc.\n\nBasically, each fleet member could tag their DOFFs into a pool of DOFFs, from which maybe the people with permission could select the best DOFFs for the mission and assign them to get the best success percentage and/or reward bonus. Then everyone who participated gets DOFF XP out of it. This would help the fleet level up their players DOFF rankings, and it would encourage people to level up their DOFFs to better participate.\n\nPerhaps it could even give slightly better XP rewards to those whose DOFFs were assigned the mission, medium XP rewards to those who offered their DOFFs for the mission but whose weren't selected (a small 'activity bonus') and minimal or no XP for those who didn't contribute at all.\n\nMy thought is that this might make people start using the upgrade options to bump up their DOFFs to higher levels so there's a higher chance of their DOFFs being selected as \"best\" for the mission and getting the highest bonuses out the other end when it completes. And/or just make people who typically don't \"do\" doff missions actually start using the system. I have a few friends who never bothered with it that I'm having to coach through it. Seems like this might give people an incentive to learn...?\n\nIdeally, nobody would have to click \"collect rewards,\" the mission would simply complete when it completes and everyone gets their DOFFs back on reserve (rather than having to kill them off). This way nobody has to \"give up\" their favorite DOFFs to feed a hungry starbase.\n\nThat said, maybe some of the missions would have medium, high or extreme casualty risk, so there might be still some CHANCE of losing DOFFs if the mission is poorly staffed. But not a GUARANTEED loss like the current system. And, this way, fleet members won't necessarily have to make the hard decision of whether to support the fleet by killing their DOFFs or support themselves by leveling up their DOFFs (but not having the extra doffs around to \"kill off\" for the fleet). We could have it both ways (being able to help the fleet by participating in missions, but ALSO being able to bump up your own DOFFs without feeling like you're going \"Semper I, to heck with the other guy\"). Currently I'm torn between helping myself out in leveling up my DOFF ranks vs helping the fleet by sacrificing the DOFFs I'd otherwise be using to level myself up. It would be nice if we could have it both ways: being able to help the fleet, while also being encouraged to develop one's own resources. I like to have my cake and eat it too, and I feel like this would be a better solution than the current system. I feel like it would have more of a STO feel to it too. Actually completing \"missions\" rather than just resource grinding & dumping.\n\nMaybe you'd even have certain short-completion-time repeatable missions for resource grinding things like provisions or turrets, which you then use those things to complete the higher level missions. So, like, the repeatable grinding missions might be white level easy missions, which you use to get the resources to unlock the green level missions, etc. And there could even be assignment chains for some of the limited-time-missions for s/b improvements. So, you'd have to successfully complete each of the steps of the chain in order to get the improvement.\n\nAs I'm thinking about it, the grinding missions could be like \"failure, success, profitable, very profitable\" with higher payouts of the grinding materials for the different levels of critical success. Maybe critical success = you get all the 1000 provisions, profitable = you get 1/2 the stuff ~500, success, you get maybe 100. Failure, you get nothing...\n\nAnd of course, the missions could still each require things like to'duj fighters or provisions or dilithium, etc. It would just require adapting the current doff missions system and applying it to the starbase system. We already have missions in game that require brief DOFF missions as part of the mission (some of the Bajoran / DS9 missions, if I recall right?)... Why not make Starbase leveling similar to that?\n\nWhat do people think? Would this be a better solution? I think so, personally. It would treat DOFFs more like crew than like disposable commodities to perform Satanic sacrifice rituals on...\n\nIt would probably also help even out the ridiculous DOFF prices in the exchange... Since probably people wouldn't be buying up DOFFs just to dump them out of the system entirely. People would just be buying them to actually use them. Or MAYBE for leveling up. But if for leveling up, they wouldn't be making runs on SPECIFIC DOFF types, but more evenly distributing their buying, or just buying the actual USEFUL DOFFs for completing missions, and prices might once again reflect actual in-game utility rather than just which DOFFs happen to have been randomly picked as \"dump this DOFF type\" in starbase missionsI mean, if the base needs to be staffed after construction it would be easy enough to add that to the missions as like an assignment chain for actually getting the upgrade going. So, you'd maybe have \"staff the bar,\" \"staff the kitchen,\" \"staff the store\" which would be easy missions, with no chance of failure, just a requirement to give up x number of DOFFs of the proper type. Maybe staffing the kitchen would even be preceded by some of the \"prove your culinary skill\" missions, where your chefs have to actually complete the mission successfully before they can be sacrificed. Y'know, things that might actually happen as real parts of staffing a place. I mean, you don't just take your staff and shoot them all in the head out back and call the place staffed, which is about what it feels like, currentlyAgain, just my 2c.\n~MG\n\nSomeone with more spare time than I should calculate (or look up?) how many people is required to run a full \"Tier 5\" starbase, and how many DOFFs get thrown into making a \"Tier 5\" Starbase.\n\nYeah, I bet. I was torn between sacrificing a green Diplomat yesterday and selling it in the exchange for 2 mil. EC then buying about 4-5 purple Tholian DOFFs. My fleet finagled me into just tossing it into the mouth of the monster rather than going all \"Semper I\" and making a killing... *Sigh*\n\nI have to agree with the OP, I do not think its really cannon to sacrfice so many doff's and the doff's in our starship mission normally tend to return to us in good health or require some medical attention very rarely do you get a mission where they die."

In Onslaught, both sides have access to the same weapons and vehicles, which makes an intuitive sense in the sports context, and neatly avoids most of the endless complaining about faction balance in Planetside. The critical network nodes are quite exposed, which makes no \"real world\" defensive sense, but allows for some furious open battling, instead of the sometimes unsatisfying attritional meatgrinder corridor and stairway battles in Planetside. Overall, by not having to adhere to so many background story/worldbuilding elements to justify the gameplay conventions, is a better game created? Is the loss of the deeper meaning written into the background story of Planetside and other fictional conflicts, or recreations of historical events like WW2 worth the tighter gameplay?

Could you accelerate to the speed of light?\n\nyes, in theory you could accelerate indefinately, BUT:\n- acceleration slows down gradually (ie, speed gain per time interval gets smaller) and the \"realistic\" speed you could achieve by using afterburner is around 8000 (this was talked in a starwraith forums but I can't find the thread, sorry) before you run out of fuel"

      "text": "The Void Ray is a Protoss air unit new to Starcraft 2. It's attack does more damage the longer it is locked onto a single target, making it most effective against powerful units. The Void Ray can move while it attacks, including moving closer to the unit it is currently attacking. It is not currently known how the player controls this.\n\nContents\n\nLore\n\nUnit Portrait\n\nThe reunification of the Aiur protoss and the dark templar has been a time of many trials for both peoples. Overcoming centuries of the fear and mistrust that had built up after the exile of the dark templar is no easy task. Nonetheless, the melding of technologies that developed along separate paths for so long has heralded spectacular new developments for the protoss. One such creation is the void ray, a new capital vessel that many believe will eventually replace the venerable protoss carrier as flagship of the protoss fleet.\n\nA void ray is a ship virtually built around a single gigantic power source: the prismatic core. This device seethes with energy drawn from two realms: the Void, which is truly understood only by the dark templar, and the psionic matrix, which underpins the technologies of the Aiur protoss. In combination these two energies form a self-sustaining reaction of terrifying potential.\n\nNormally the prismatic core is held in check by an arrangement of flux field projectors. When a void ray locks on to a target, the projector arms smoothly part like the petals of a flower. A complex array of warp lenses and phase-crystals works to focus the energies of the prismatic core into a ravening beam of destruction.\n\nAs the prismatic beam is held on the target, more of the focusing array becomes aligned, and up to three individual power streams combine together. Over a few seconds the beam's intensity and power grow exponentially. Few enemies can withstand the awful power of the prismatic beam for long: even large and heavily armored targets like buildings or battlecruisers are incinerated in moments."

You can see this poor relationship the most with Transphasic and Photon as they deal so little damage. (Transphasic torps will deal as much damage to a hull through shields as a quantum will, same with Chroniton)\n\nHonestly they do great against a hull, but not so great vs shields and I think this is where most of the problem is. A beam overload is a far more attractive choice for most gamers than a high yield 3 is. (Which is by far the least efficient torp skill..... Torp spread is so poor I just deny it's existence) Because it's a gauranteed Shield Be Gone, as well as Hull Melter. The problem is with torps is your opponent can probably at least manage to get a magical Sliver of a shield up to mitigate pretty much all the damage from a torpshot.\n\nWhere is if that had been say a BO3? you just probably melted his hull anyway.\n\nWhat they could do is simply add a torpedo power like HY that does full damage to shields but barely any damage to hull. Call it \"Torpedo target: shields\" so the torpedo hits and devastates shields for full damage, but does 10% of its normal damage on bare hull. Give it an instant activation and 30 second cooldown and have it fire the same number of torps that high yield does."

      "text": "This week, I am pleased to present a glimpse into the setting for the Deathwatch RPG: The Jericho Reach! This guest designer diary comes from the pen of John French, part of the Deathwatch design team. Enjoy!\n\nAnd that Warp Gate looks Eldar to me, and if it is, no way they just give something like up to all comers. That's the kind of thing a whole craft world could devote itself to protect. And we all know there are Orks all over. Looks like all the big bads will be in this one, can't wait to pit my team against those odds.\n\nWow.Very impressed with a glimpse of the setting.Should make for some interesting campaigns.Looking forward to the next update..Jericho Reach sounds like an ideal all encompassing setting. You could easily put the inquisition and rogue traders in a crusade. I hope a IG supplement or game is on the market soon as well.\n\nIt would be very nice to have a appendix or two dedicated to using DH and RT with DW's Jericho Reach.\n\nCouldnt agree more with youI have to agree. The bit about the warp gate thing made me roll my eyes a bit. It's just seems like a fairly transparent attempt at having their cake and eating it too (moving DW to the opposite side of the galaxy and having crossover potential with existing DH and RT campaigns). But like you, I'll reserve judgement until I see more. I already stuck my foot in my mouth arguing against the plausibility of Ultramarines in the game (they're now the Chapter that makes the most sense).\n\nHm, I'm on the fence at this point. There wasn't anything mentioned in that write up about the setting that made me go 'WOW!' (though nothing made me go 'Urgh!' either), and it does smack a little of squeezing all the enemies into a relatively small area so they can all be met. Not necessarily a bad idea, so long as it's done well.\n\nThe idea of DW teams clashing with Crusade commanders because they are doing their own thing, often at odds with the Crusade army groups campaigns, is a good one imo.\n\nCan't see that DW teams would be deployed against Chaos forces (such as those mentioned in the Middle Salient) much though.\n\nUltimately my opinion will be decided by the detail however, and we haven't yet seen that. Unlike with the Koronus Expanse, FFG have no excuse for shirking on detail with the Jericho Reach, and I hope and expect it to be as detailed in it's own right as Calixis was in the original DH rulebook.\n\nEDIT - Thinking.\n\nBravo, FFG! You managed to come up with a premise that is actually interesting and not just \"Marines wailing on stuff\". I can already see potential for politcal conflicts and diplomacy. As Peacekeeper_b mentioned, this setting is also great for mashup games of DH, RT and DW.\n\nThe Warp gate bit sounds pretty interesting. It's not an overused plot device in 40k, and since the introduction of stable warp gates in 3e TT rulebook (IIRC) we've hardly seen any examples of them. It doesn't really look Eldar to me, and why would Eldar use Warp Gates if they have Webway? On the other hand it is pretty similar to the War in Heaven era starships seen in one issue of Kal Jerico, so maybe a relic of the Old Ones? One of the three legendary \"Gateways to the Gods\" of the Eldar legend maybe? Regardless of what its exact nature, I'm interested.\n\nWhat I'd like to see the most is some new and horrifying Xeno race beside the vanilla Tau/Nids/Chaos.\n\n[QUOTE efidm=307843]g.[/QUOTE]\n\nA few months ago I'd have agreed with you. But then Robin Cruddace came and merrily retconned the Hive Fleet Naga into 812.M41, Gorgon into 900.M41 and Jormungandr into 997.M41. And invented Narvhals <shudder>.\n\nOkay, the DD seems to answer some of the questions about the kind of adversaries (Xenos) going to be present. Looks as though it is one big melting pot...or meat grinder...of a war zone. Also, the presence of a warp gate, riffing on Babylon five or the Stargate movie?\n\nWill be interested in how it gels together, though I'm beginning to get the impression Death Watch move around like they're the MiB's of the Astartes from the DD (no prisoners, no witnesses...)\n\nEldar: Many Exodites Worlds, Craftworld Iyanden is close enough to lend support as well as Craftworld Biel-Tan which is known to rush to the rescue of Exodites Worlds.\n\nGiven the presence and utility of the Webway, Eldar operating on the far side of the galaxy from the (often irrelevant) physical location of their Craftworld is not exactly uncommon. Eldar forces can walk from one side of the galaxy to the other if the situation requires it...\n\nLucius Valerius said:\n\nDark Eldar: The only one without a presence in that region.\n\nThey live in the Webway; technically, they don't have a presence in any region, yet can be found raiding locations anywhere in the galaxyEldar: Many Exodites Worlds, Craftworld Iyanden is close enough to lend support as well as Craftworld Biel-Tan which is known to rush to the rescue of Exodites Worlds.\n\nOrk: Waagh Grog is heading that way.\n\nNecron and Tyrannids: Way more then anyone can handle.\n\nTau: Their region of space is right there.\n\nDarl Eldar: The only one without a presence in that region.\n\nNow tell me, how is it you can't see all of them in one place ? =P Imperium doesn't credibly stand a chance. That's a retcon in the wrong direction as far as I'm concerned.\n\nThe Tau Empire would be swallowed if they got in the way of a Hive Fleet. The Imperium is only able to stand against Tyranids due to it's enormous size and it's numbers.\n\nI'm not even saying squeezing loads of enemies into one war zone is an inherantly bad idea, it's just a bit ... cheezy I guess imo. It risks feels clumsy, unless handled well.\n\nEDIT - Again, I'm on the fence until I get to see the detail. What's the setting like on the ground? What are the individual worlds like? What's the background and fluff on the Chaos forces? What's the story on the Crusade, what forces are there? What's the story to the Gate? etc etc At least this time setting detail and fluff is essential and needed, no more 'we're all about the vagueness' excuses for not doing the work, I hope. Imperium doesn't credibly stand a chance. That's a retcon in the wrong direction as far as I'm concerned\n\nThe Tau Empire would be swallowed if they got in the way of a Hive Fleet. The Imperium is only able to stand against Tyranids due to it's enormous size and it's numbers.\n\nAre you aware that numerous Hive Fleets of different sizes have struck at the Imperium since the arrival of Hive Fleet Kraken and from different angles of attack (Leviathan is somewhere in the centre of the galaxy)? And that in fact Kraken was defeated and smashed into smaller splinter-fleets at the battle of Ichar IV? A single fleet of Hive ships arriving in the Jericho Reach is hardly unusual or necessarily that big a deal - it depends on the size and strength of the force and whether they have enough time to grow (as in whether they can harvest enough worlds before being destroyed by the Imperium).\n\nThis also affects the nature of Tau-Tyranid conflict. The Tau empire has been attacked by some 'nid splinter fleets and destroyed them, though at the cost of a few worlds. The Tau are strong enough to hold off smaller 'nid fleets. It would take a fleet as strong as Kraken or Behemoth to threaten the Empire as a whole, though I think that the Tau would be strong enough to defeat them"

      "text": "Operations\n\nNon-playable starship\n\nFor an overview of playable starships within Star Trek Online, see the Playable starship article\n\nThere are many types of non-playable starships for each faction, ranging from civilian freighters to enemy warships that the player must overcome in space combat. Players will encounter these ships while in space, either when running missions or traveling between star systems.\n\nContents\n\nFighters (also known as shuttles or small craft) are the weakest NPCs found on space maps. Equivalent to Neophytes, they are even weaker than frigates and are no match for players. Some fighters, such as the OrionInterceptor, are launched from higher-level ships (carriers).\n\nFrigates (also known as Corvettes or Light Cruisers) are small, maneuverable vessels used by almost every faction. They are generally the weakest NPC vessels in the game (aside from Fighters), and as such they typically appear in groups of three. Frigates generally carry three or four weapons and only a couple of abilities.\n\nEscorts (also known as Destroyers or sometimes Cruisers) are smaller vessels that typical serve in the front line attack role, engaging at point blank range with forward-facing cannons and torpedoes. They typically pack a tremendous punch and have great agility and speed compared to cruisers and science vessels. Escorts favor forward-facing weapons and an outstanding turning rate. However, they have a smaller crew and weaker hull and shields.\n\nBattleships are the second most powerful NPC vessels used by factions, outgunned only by the dreadnought. They have very strong hull and shields, five or six weapons slots, and a wide range of abilities. To compensate for all their power, battleships are very slow and not at all maneuverable. Some battleships, such as the Breen Capital Ship, are carriers capable of launching fighters.\n\nDreadnoughts are the most powerful NPC ships in the game. They are comparable to battleships in terms of speed and weaponry, but they have much stronger hull and shield strength. They are dangerous and resilient to the point where defeating a dreadnought usually requires more than one ship (player or NPC regardless). Some dreadnoughts, such as the Klingon Vo'quv, are carriers capable of launching fighters"

      "text": "And these caccoon ideas are sound, but i stand by my original point that regular humans standing or sitting in a drop pod with a restraint harness just like in Astartes drop pods would be absolutely squished on impact… hence my suggestion that the Storm Trooper regiment should be the ones that use the Drop Pods as they were published at the same time and we know that they are the peak of human military training, equipment and deployment techniques.\n\n\"Only the insane have the strength enough to prosper. Only those who prosper may truly judge what is sane.\"I would say that the grav plates would be the simplest answer in all cases. I haven't seen anything in 40k that suggests that the Imperium uses liquid immersion to counter acceleration, but we do know that they have artificial gravity and that it's used to counter the dramatic accelerations of their starships, so I'm inclined to believe that a grav plate in the floor along with a cocoon harness (not a liquid immersion apparatus - something more like a crash cage in a race car) would be most fitting for the setting.\n\nThe 'cocoon' doesn't have to be an individual, or even optional feature as you all seem to be supposing it is, too.\n\nI'm saying, it could actually be a part of the pod, fully integrated, as in a drop-pod designed specifically with regular humans in mind, hence it incorporates all the extra safety measures needed. Must we always assume that things printed in the codices are the ONLY examples of those machines in existence? When we all play the RPG, that takes the much more sensible angle that there are different makes and models of almost everything (best case example being weapons, there's not just 1 Lasgun that is the same for everyone everywhere). the most recent Codex talks about how it would be impossible for normal humans to use the Astartes style drop pods, for a huge number of reasons…\n\nKey Words: Astartes Style. The rogue traders are fairly obviously NOT astartes drop pods. They likely carry less, and ptobably dont have guns on them, and probably have less armor like most nonastartes things. All that could then be replaced with additional saftey features needed for mortal humansGood find on those stats! That's the sort of digging we need more of on these forums to bring debates to a sound conclusion. So suffice to say that Rogue Traders dont fit Astartes style drop pods to their ships, and thus don't get to deploy their troops quite so quickly.\n\nThat said, 2,400 kph is still pretty fast compared to bulk haulers, cargo landers and shuttles so i can see them still being preferable for inserting small, elite forces to lead planetary assaults.\n\nI think ideally you'll be wanting a light cruiser or cruiser for a planetary assault, outfitted with the following:\nBombardment cannon\n\nLaunch Bays\n\nTeleportarium\n\nDrop pod bays\n\nAuger/bridge with bonuses to planetary assaults, bombardment or strikecraft.\n\nCargo bays\n\nBarracks\n\nMaybe a lance for those precision strikes.\n\n\"Only the insane have the strength enough to prosper. Only those who prosper may truly judge what is sane.\"Also, I dont think the OP is looking for the ideal planetary assault ship. Likely he has come across the hull by some means and has decided to out fit it for such. Hull choice is not likely to change no matter what would be better, so lets move from thier. I like the idea of disruption cannons leaving a battlefield full of salvage, especially for a RT more concerned with profit than combat efficiencyYes and no.\n\nI'm saying that orbital defence structures are quite often fully contained mini-fortresses, with their own power generation facilities for the operation of the structure and its weapons systems (and the structure's other systems and defences, which sometimes include void shields). I'm also saying that it is independent of the city around it, so shooting willy nilly about the city isn't garaunteed to take them out with the rest of the city structures, as well as anything moving about within the city (civilian and military traffic). It's contained and independant from the city. Whereas a ship is more like the city itself, and as I said before, by its very nature requires that every portion of the ship be connected to every other portion. The gun-decks aren't on an entirely distinct set of power generators and conduits from the rest of the ship, which is not the case with a city and its defensive instalations. Which I never said couldn't be shut down by Disruption Cannons, I've been saying that it will take more accurate targeting than simply blanketing the city in random fire on the assumption that it's all on the same power grid.\n\nHow cavalier of you to think that it's no loss to simply blow up the planet with a Nova Cannon, too. If you're willing to just blow it up, was the entire point of a planetary invasion even worth it either"

I thought I'd share my perspective:\n\n(massive ME2 and ME1 spoilers, including ending spoilers)\n\nSpoiler:\n\nI still believe that the entirety of the ME2 crew will be available, as crew members, in ME3.\n\nFirst, I think the percentages of how many gamers had Soandso and Whoosit survive or die is an unimportant red herring, not to mention that 85-90% of the consumer base is a rather enormous percentage even if it did matter.\n\nSecond, let's analyze ME2. ME2 is a very different game from ME1. ME1 is a game of investigation and exploration. Shepard is basically a space detective, trying to figure out what the fuck is going on. There's a little bit of that in ME2, but it is mostly external to Shepard. The Illusive Man is the one that does most of the plot research and Shepard does all the field work.\n\nHowever, the mission is set from the get-go. Stop the Collectors. There is no bumbling around in the dark. From nearly an hour in you are told where you will eventually go. You are presented with the Omega 4 relay immediately and you know that's where you will eventually go. The climax (at least in part) is foreshadowed almost immediately.\n\nIt's actually a very slick and interesting way of presenting the main mission to the player.\n\nHowever, the main game, I would argue, has very little to do with that mission. The majority of the game is spent building your team. In ME1, your team kind of slaps itself together haphazardly. I honestly cannot tell you why Urdnot Wrex joined my team in ME1. I think I went a quest route in the Citadel where I kind of met him in the hall, said \"hey\" and then he was on my team.\n\nI think ME2 was structured from the get go to advance the plot and get away from most of those bonds. They kept a few that they felt would tie in well with the story (mostly Tali and to a lesser degree Garrus), but ultimately they wanted a tabula rasa (blank slate) because the thrust of ME2 is - primarily - designed to build yourself a team and to gain their loyalty. You are rewarded for gaining their loyalties and getting to know their particular strengths and weaknesses. If you do, you not only get new powers, but you also enable them all to survive the end.\n\nAnd the end proves their loyalty to you. In the beginning, you would expect Miranda's loyalty to lie squarely with Cerberus and the Illusive Man, but if you bring her to the very last battle (I assume the last cutscene includes the two people you bring into the last battle - I've only beaten the game once), she tells the Illusive Man to fuck off in support of Shepard.\n\nPersonally I see ME2 is the first of a half rather than the second part of a trilogy. ME1 is your introduction. ME2 is team building for the climax, which will probably have very little to none of it. ME3 will be more plot and quest driven toward repelling the reapers instead of having much to do with the mechanics of your team.\n\nI could be way off base here, but that's what I think they were going for.\n\nwhy would i want the same team anyway, fresh characters are always nice\n\nWhat? Are you serious? You'd prefer they dump our awesome team of Badasses, all for the sake of \"freshness?\" To Hell with fresh characters! I'd prefer if we kept as much of our old squad as possible, and were given maybe two or three new characters.\n\nBesides, it seems stupid to me to have to build up another team in what is going to be the final act. The final act should be about the overall threat of the Reapers, not about getting to know new squad members.\n\nAll of this is speculation. So how can you state that I am \"wrong.\" You can believe otherwise, but I think I've made a pretty strong, logical case otherwise. I may very well be wrong, but unless you have information I'm not privy too, your comments are as potentially wrong as mine. I disagree with you fully, but I won't \"say\" you are wrong. Maybe I'm just being pedantic and that's not how you meant the comment, though. I don't know.\n\nand that none of the ME2 squad will be available except for maybe Legion because death isn't the same for geth\n\nBut why (spoilers)...\n\nSpoiler:\n\nwould you conclude that any of them will die? The end of ME2 is distinct from, say, ME1 in that you are on your ship at the end with a full, loyal crew that will follow you anywhere. It seems odd to me to think BioWare would throw that crew away and start again fresh for a third time. There's a lot of loose ends presented in ME2, but none of them involve your crew which, to me, is more or less a done deal.\n\nBioware has made it clear through their party member use tracking that some will be more important than others in ME3\n\nDid they make a statement as to why were tracking party member use, or by \"made it clear\" do you mean that you've drawn your own conclusions from their tracking of party member use? I'm not being snarky, I am genuinely asking if they've made a statement on the matter, or how they've \"made it clear\" to you?\n\nwhy would i want the same team anyway, fresh characters are always nice\n\nI frankly don't agree. I don't want to play yet ANOTHER Mass Effect game where all I do is run around recruiting people. That is what 90% of Mass Effect 2 entails. I don't want to do that again. I don't want to be hammered by allusions of the past (like meeting ME1 characters in ME2) and I don't want to have to obtain a whole new crew again. The entirety of Mass Effect 2 is spent getting your crew together. Why on earth would they force us to do that AGAIN?\n\nWould the original Star Wars series have been as interesting or compelling if you had a brand new set of core characters in every movie? I don't believe so.\n\nI would sat cast and crew continuity is very important to a \"space opera\" as Mass Effect is generally billed as (and even advertises itself as).\n\nAm I the only person that thought that, perhaps, the shadow broker is the same person as the Illusive Man. Sometimes they seem to be in conflict with each other, but then again you spend 1/3 of Mass Effect 1 (if you do all the assignments) opposing Cerberus and the Illusive Man spends a substantial reserve of credits resurrecting Shepard, so he's not really against doing expensive things that potentially contradict his own ideals building buildingYou seem to be assuming that a new team would mean the entire game is about recruiting a new team.\n\nwhy do you assume that we are going to spend 90% of the game recruiting people? ME1 gave you 5/6 squadmates before you even became a Spectre. ME2 has a whole new cast of characters and reserves most of the old ones to a single scene, it works just fine because this is a 25-hour video game and I want new people. The core character is really just Shepard, as long as she's there and fighting Reapers, ME3 can do whatever it wants. I agree that ME3 will probably be more plot-driven like the original game.\n\ni conclude that squadmates will die because i have dead squadmates who are dead and i don't want to be gimped out of a full team in ME3 because of that. Legion is a possible exception because he could have just transferred his memories back to the geth network.\n\nI can't find the article, but I do remember Bioware said that they would alter the size of character roles in ME3 depending on how popular they were in ME2, and they specifically hinted that Legion may be significant in ME3.\n\nI still believe that the entirety of the ME2 crew will be available, as crew members, in ME3.\n\nSome of them have no reason to. Are you paying Zaeed? Samara's \"contract\" is up and she said she's off. Unless romanced, space pirate Jack has little reason to stick around. As much as I'd like to see Kasumi return, she's probably off thieving again (aside from DLC second tiering).\n\nI don't know why you'd expect ME3 to involve mostly recruiting again if there's new people. ME1 gave you 90% of your people by the time you left the citadel. ME2 gave you recruiting. ME3 will probably be more like the former than the latter - I expect you'll pick people up in the course of main missions, more like Liara. I doubt more than a few of the ME2 people will return in squad.\n\nAlso, the comment on loyalty reminds me of one of my few disappointments with ME2 from my expectations.\n\nSpoiler:\n\nI was really expecting the loyalty thing to involve a betrayal. There seemed to be tons of candidates and a theme of \"can you trust these lunatics?\" A bloodthirsty krogan, not one but two Cerberus operatives, a psycho convict, an assassin (for hire presumably, prior to knowing how intensely lightside Thane would be), etc. Miranda chooses you over TIM pretty much regardless of whether it's merited. I completely snubbed her one playthrough and was really hoping one of the main char deaths would be her pulling a gun on me at the bomb."

I bought it but never got around to playing beyond the first level, but it looked as slick as anything, and I still listen to the soundtrack on occasion.\n\nStill haven't played the original Homeworld, but Homeworld 2 was a lot of fun. Only RTS I've ever played where you keep the same set of units between levels, *and* (except in the case of forced jumps) automatically collect all resources on a level before moving on.\n\nIt's awesome sending a core of Ion Beam Frigates against an enemy Carrier, supplemented by bomber squadrons and a wing of fighters to fly cover for the whole operation.\n\nis this a proper map? i mean is it it authorised by the Serenity people.. will it be countered in future FF productions? like comics and such?\n\nDoes that matter? I don't understand the attitude that there's something wrong with a work of fiction if it isn't consistent with another work of fiction. It's all equally made-up anyway. And it's not as if the FF-verse is particularly consistent within itself, especially where cosmology and physics are concerned. The map is an imaginative and beautiful interpretation of something that's totally imaginary to begin with, and it's a whole lot more self-consistent than its source material. Who cares whether it's \"proper\" or not? All that should matter about something fictional is whether it's well-done and enjoyable. It's not like you're studying for a test and have to make sure your texts are accurate.\n\nThe only \"future productions\" likely to exist are RPG updates and further comics. It's been stated that future RPG updates will be consistent with this map. As for the comics, if there are any more, it'll be up to their creators whether they want to acknowledge the maps, but I doubt it will become an issue, because the stories in the comics are likely to focus on characters and action, not cartography. As with everything in fiction, they should be free to contradict the maps if that's what the story requires.\n\n__________________ Christopher L.

      "text": "look, despite anything anyone might have to say, a lot of people, even me, can agree that the space combat in STO is pretty good.\n\nSince that seems to be the one thing the developers really got right why don't we push to have them expand on it?\n\nInstead of having a single ship go against a fleet of enemy vessels, we just have battles between one or two, scaled up for fleet actions.\n\nIn this vein, space battles can actually be tough, and by tough, I mean tough. To aid this there should be a bevy of new starship functions. For example, electronic warfare, finer system energy control with more systems, specific firing port selections, faster ships, maybe raise the battle range to 15 km, add top and bottom to shields (I know I have a tendency to strafe my opponent's belly), more system modifications and selectability, actual crew assignments to specific technologies and tasks, maybe even the ability to partition out what the standard, non-BO crew members are to do in a given situation, the ability to force power into specific impulse thrusters, special maneuvers, etc., etc., etc.\n\nIf we're going to be WWII battleships in space we might as well have the actual capabilities of a real future battleship. If I could have a real serious, ba**s deep slugout with another ship where I feel like everything that goes on in my ship is my decision and my every decision will determine the outcome of the battle then I'd be willing to wait a lot longer for other, less war-like elements to be brought into the game.\n\nI realize that this would mean each space battle would be way more serious, way more intense, longer, and more exhausting, but I think this is a good thing. Ship-to-ship battle was always a serious matter, is a serious matter, and should be treated as such. Instead of having a hundred ship battles a day, maybe we should have 10 really awesome ones."

      "text": "Are any competitive canon FRR units being organized? I'm really looking forward to organized community warfare, but from what I am seeing thus far there isn't much canon/RP wise going on for the FRR compared to other factions. I know that 20 years isn't a lot of time to generate classic units that people often try to recreate, but there are units with a fair amount of lore and I hate to see other FRR players with a similar mind set go unsatisfied.\n\nIf you are organizing a canon unit, please post a link/app/contact info below so everyone can have a 1 stop shop.I've seen other factions with canon based units (like the 1st Robinson Rangers here:\n\nI understand it won't have in-game implications beyond our wins/losses for the faction, but beyond competitive game play I was hoping to team up with other RP/Canon enthusiasts\n\nFaction units can be joined as long as the faction player meets the requirements. These requirements involve gathering a certain amount of loyalty points from fighting battles for your faction. As you gain loyalty points, you unlock new military ranks, new skins, and access to special faction units that you can join. Over time, your loyalty points will degrade, but you can never lose the things you've already gained, you just go \"inactive\" or something, I forget the exact term. It may be \"Honorary\", so if you reach the rank of Captain, yet go inactive for a few months, when you come back you'd be an \"Honorary Captain\" and have to regain lost Loyalty Points before you could progress to the next rank. Players will have no control over faction units, they are just there for fluff and skins.\n\nThe people out there forming \"canon units\", they have trouble ahead for them. For a larger nation like the FedSuns, there is a lot more history, and a LOT more units to chose from. The FRR only has 15 mech regiments. The Drakons (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th), the Freemen (1st, 2nd, 3rd), the Hussars (1st, 2nd, 3rd), the Kavalleri (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th), and the Gunzberg Eagles. There isn't much, if any, depth to these units, like there is in a lot of the other factions. This limited availability means that there will likely be very few, if any, canon FRR units that aren't reserved by the game.\n\nFor those trying to form as the famous faction units, this is where they will run in to trouble, because they cannot claim to actually be that unit once the game starts. They will have no ability to restrict membership, and have no authority to give orders to other people in the unit. Their only option, if they want player control, is to form as a mercenary unit. This runs into the issue of the name already being claimed within the game by the faction. To get around this, some people trying to form a \"canon unit\" are actually forming sub-units, using the names found below the regimental level. There are also mercenary units who are doing this with the sub-units of famous merc groups (like the Wolf's Dragoons or Northwind Highlanders).\n\nFurther, just because a group isn't forming as a \"canon faction unit\" does NOT mean that they aren't interested in RP or lore. That is a very bad assumption to make.\n\nI'm not sure it's really spelled out clearly in one place, that's just what I've learned from all the various sorces and dev posts.\n\nTo actually answer your initial question, no, there really aren't any groups forming around the FRR faction units. We were origionally going to be the 3rd Drakons, but decided we'd be better off starting fresh, so we didn't have to deal with the headaches.\n\nAt one point in time, there was a \"Gunzberg Eagles\" group, who I believe were German, but I haven't heard/seen them in many months. They were definitely not active. Same goes for the 1st Tyr, if they were real or not, I have no idea, but they popped up for a couple posts, then disappeared. 1st Tyr really isn't canon anyway, since they disbanded in '34 and didn't reform till '62.\n\nAnd... that's it. I haven't seen anyone else out there with an FRR focus.\n\nDoes it REALLY matter that the unit you want to establish is already in the lore?\n\nPart of the reason I'm drawn to the FRR is the lack of established lore. It's a chance for the players to create their own fiction behind MW:O's FRR, and with so many players, something wonderful could come out of it.\n\nWho knows, maybe the devs will be smart and give us the chance to rewrite the canon history, by fighting off the Clanners if/when they invade through some tough gaming. That'd be the pinnacle of meta-gaming experience for me. We've got a chance to really shape what the FRR means for us players, without the burden of all that canon weighing us down and constricting us.\n\nThe only Assault weight regiment after the dissolution of the 1st Tyr, the Gunzburg Eagles was destroyed during the Clan Invasion but ultimately rebuilt after the integration into the Ghost Bear Touman."

I am always referring to 1 vs 1 combat situations. Now all the Tier 1 battleships have a long history and everone knows them. But since I talk about battleships the Scorpion was left out when all other races got their weapons on them. But lets have a look at those first: - Apocalypse: Amarr laser boat with descent firepower - Typhoon: Minmatar projectile cannon boat with descent firepower - Dominix: Gallente mini-carrier with a holy lot firepower - and finally the Scorpion: ECM boat with battleship hull and a fully dull weapon/high-slot layout, 4 turret, 4 missiles and 6 together with no real use. You can now try to put the 6 high slot to use by trying a turret / missile combo but you know that combos are not a solution here as none of the weapons get a buff of some kind. Making it a turret boat just lacks firepower, as with missiles. You may have an advantage with your ecm onboard but you cannot do much damage if you do so. Try it out for yourself if you have to flame: Apocalypse vs Scorpion: Apocalypse wins Dominix vs Scorpion: Dominix wins Typhoon vs Scorpion: Typhoon wins Aren't Caldari crippled enough for gods sake? I am not suggesting to make the Scorpion an ubar-wtfpwnmobile but to increase her firepower to be inline with the other races and that some people fear her even more. So either make her a turret or a missile boat but give her the firepower that the other three races have.\n\nOriginally by:elitatwo Apocalypse vs Scorpion: Stalemate: Apoc is perma-jammed and Scorp can't break Apoc's tank Dominix vs Scorpion: Stalemate: Domi is perma-jammed and Scorp can't break Domi's tank. Domi loses all drones to Scorpion's drones and smartbombs Typhoon vs Scorpion: Stalemate: Typhoon is perma-jammed and Scorp can't break Typhoon's tank, but then Typhoon starts to break up because it's Minmatar and was actually held together by duct tape, though the Scorpions mediocre firepower had little to do with the destruction of the Typhoon.\n\nFixed it =)\n\nSeriously though, the Scorp does what it is supposed to do, and it's my favourite ship. LEAVE IT ALONE!!!!\n\nScorpion jams....Its missiles are for ho'ing kms for something besides ewar and to help out the structure bashing if enemy really didn't want that pos and doesn't sc**** a defence fleet up. gets you on the mod km's...not sexy km's but km's all the same.\n\n1 v 1, jam and grind them, jsut like with falcon and fox. don't go for drone boats or stick around for fof running missile boats.\n\nPlus based on fit...you scorpioin will have rigs for ecm performance (scorp fits I see and run make ecm work as good as possible). No extenders, no em rig for that hole even. Its mids wil be propulsion and ecm, maybe tank (I ran armor tank scorps...to get the ecm in). Not a lot of tp going on an ecm spec scorpion. Means BC and below is working those missile calcs to offset cruise (or torp damage) much more. BS...will work the same calcs jsut not as well (BS like mach an exception, zippy for a big ship). All this adds up to poor dps and defence.\n\nNow you might say you aren't fitting your scorp for ecm. then you'd be doing something wrong tbh. Trying to make a scorpion a raven, jsut fly a raven.\n\nEdited by: Roblight on 11/03/2011 05:19:35 well if you actually compare the navy scorp to the other similar navy ships its dps isn't as awesome as you imagine. The only thing the navy scorp has to offer is the ability to wtf tank.\n\nThe navy scorp compared to the rest of the equivalent navy ships actually gets somewhat screwed. All the other navy ships ie (domi, geddon and phoon) get either another mid or low slot while keeping the same dps as their base weapon system or gain more if a low slot is added. While the navy scorp gains no additional mid or low slots but switches weapon systems over to the ravens but ends up having less dps than a raven because it doesn't have enough high slots to do it.\n\nSo the only thing the navy scorp gains is an extra high slot compared to a regular scorp bs,and this high slot is either used as utility or to put on a non bonused gun. The navy scorp gets less dps than a raven because the raven has 2 extra high slots for guns while the navy only gets that extra one meaning a raven gets more dps.\n\nNow this is probably because the navy scorp is the only ship to have its weapon system completely changed but I was hoping that it would at least break 1200 dps like all the other navy ships but sadly it doesn't happen unless you really want to sacrifice a DCU II for another BCU. Now I am not saying the navy scorp is terrible in any way but most of the time navy ships turn into ganking machines but all the navy scorp does is just become a tanking machine with some decent dps on the side\n\nbattleships have a long history and everone knows them. But since I talk about battleships the Scorpion was left out when all other races got their weapons on them. But lets have a look at those first: - Apocalypse:"

The orca pilot will either be doing far more UI operations per second than the hulk pilots, or the cans will be left in space till near full (bad either way).\n\nQuote:So, no prize for figuring out which you are.\n\n\"Tauranon\" wrote:\n\nits a fleet ship.\n\nNot any more, apparently.\n\n\"Tauranon\" wrote:\n\nThe whole idea of having half of the function of the fleet ship failing at this point in time, and not even actually having the feature on a development path with a delivery date seems fairly anti-multiplayer on an MMO ?\n\nAccording to one person at CCP the previous fleet functionality was unintentional.

It's pretty standard for CCP and not exactly rare in the software industry as a whole.\n\nYou have to consider what would drive CCP to improve in this respect, given that both minor and major shortfalls of competence like this are fairly routine and do not have a great impact on their profitability or the continuation of their customer contracts. The fact is we're all pretty used to CCP's historical performance to the point that we expect each patch to come with an overruninning downtime, a mass of unintentional changes, a boatload of bugs and lot of touted functionality missing.\n\nThis is the product to which we willing subscribe. Complaining about it when they deliver a predictable performance that matches (or, more recently, improves upon) their historical one just seems a little daft.\n\nIn related news, the messed up broadcast system in this patch actually made fleet PvP much more oldschool. Destination posted in the fleet window, busy comms, etc. I didn't really mind it making my life as an FC a little tougher as it allowed me to indulge in some serious nostalgia.\n\nSo in summary: \"Adapt and overcome\" is the way of EVE and that applies as much to CCP's scattergun software engineering as it does to the emergent sandbox that it generates"

I see all kinds of viable stuff flying in space. Old-style nano skirmish gangs, tengu gangs, AF fleets, AHAC/T3s with guardians, canes, mixed tier-3 BCs, alpha fleets, black ops droppers.\n\nfrom what i hear, even the traditional the nullsec fuckery is more varied than it was Back In The Day when everybody was flying RR sniper BS and knocking the node over when we tried to bundle 200 guys through a gate or whatever the fuck we did back then.\n\nsome dudes are born bitter, others have bitterness thrust upon them. and some just really really want to be bitter to fit in.\n\nwhatever, balanced or not eve gameplay seems in pretty good shape tbhhhhh.\n\nImo the game is in a better state than it has ever been since 04 with the amount of fleet compositions, lag and the direction ccp is going. Of course there is always stuff that can be improved, even major things, but things are looking way up. For those that can play anywaysthere are no gallente ships on that list welp\n\nKinda surprised the Naga is on there but Talos isn't. Talos is a fucking ownmobileThe only issue I have with EVE right now is that Interceptors seem to have been made unneeded and unwanted in many nullsec fleets. Gallente and Matari Recons (and often a Loki) and Dessie Indterdictors seem to have all but made Interceptors unneeded/unwanted.\n\nObviously biased, as I was a dedicated fleet Inty pilot.....and (LolRP) a CVA Amarr-Only guy. Inties pop too easy, and have far too mcuh competition for Frigate-Tackle now, as much as I hate it, they really are not that needed vs. other options (unless really spacedollars poor).\n\nI dunno, they're not that easy to pop so long as you fit and fly them well (most interceptors don't though and just burn directly at you so obviously they gonna die.\n\nBut an interceptor isn't meant to be hard tackle anyway. It's meant for the initial grab but needs to quickly have a heavier tackle ship like a vaga, rapier, arazu take over. Either that or to provide moving warps for the rest of the fleet and scouting roles. I don't think there's anything particularly wrong with them since the Dram got nerfedExactly.\n\nI've been flying Maledictions for 6 years now. Have more than half my kills in them. Over 1,000 kills (lolworthy I'm sure to some alliances, but pretty tops in CVA). I'm a veteran scout, inty-tackler and Maled pilot.\n\nAnd I agree with my good friend Tyrus, when he says \"Inties are outdated\" in the role Ithey've always filled. Not because I suck or am zee Noobz. But because they are so weak, counterable and easy to kill by so many different things of all sizes, from the buffed AF's, to Faction Frigs, to Dessies/Dictors, to Battlecruisers and all manner of HAC's/Recon's/Cruisers.\n\nFrankly, as fragile as they are, one may as well fit two long-points, all speed mods, and rig um up with lock-time rigs and just tackle at 30km without guns and hope for the best some days.\n\nIt's telling when even Inty-friendly veteran FC's who oknow what you're good at say \"Yeah, we don't need those, don't you have a Lachesis or a Heretic?\"\n\nWhile they definitely look sexy; there are no extra tech 3 ships planned for now. Reasons for that are quite simple.\n\nFirst, you need a role for them that can fit in our balancing composition while not making existing vessels obsolete. That is a big problem we face with current Tech 3 cruisers, best example being the Tengu / Tech 3 command subsystems being better than tech 2 counterparts, while the others tech 3 cruisers / subsystems are quite subpar. Before we introduce new tech 3 ships, we really want to define a purpose for them that is unique and revamp existing ships to match. Ideally, each of their configuration should be useful, but it is not the case in practice when only a few have practical applications.\n\nSecond, frigates are not really the best hull to base a tech 3 ship hull from. That's because tech 3 ships are, by nature, expensive to acquire, which conflicts with the frailty of a frigate as a whole. Frigates are supposed to be expendable and relatively straightforward to set up, but this directly clashes with the complex nature of selecting and getting subsystems. Also, frigates have a lot of variations already - navy, pirate, tech 2, you name it, we have it. Thus, the chance that a tech 3 frigate would bring something new to the table without creating the problem explained in the first paragraph remains very low, and we would setting ourselves up for the same problems we face with tech 3 cruisers at the moment.\n\nBased on all of this, here is the ship priority plan for the time being:\n\n* Fix old hulls that are underpowered\n* If and when we need new shinies, create new tech 1 roles (tier 3 BCs) or, if needed, missing tech 2 variations\n* If we ever need new tech 3 hulls in the future, my vote would be to larger hulls, like battleships for the reasons explained above. Tech 3 battlecruisers are not a choice I would vouch for however, as they would conflict with tech 3 cruisers (same weapon system size) and without to say this ship class already is extremely popular, quite at the expense of the other hull sizes, so no need to aggravate the problem further.\n\nHope that clears things a bit.\n\nI also saw a bit where he said they will be rebalancing the rookie ships to give less-focused 'bit of everything' bonuses to allow noobs to taste the whole range of experiences a race has to offer (launchers on caldari ships presumably)\n\nI think the whole \"most people don't fly interceptors properly\" thing is overblown...Hang around in a standard fight verses any gang of +3 in a ceptor and you'll quickly get BBQ'ed, that's the problem...They used to be a ship pilots specialised there main in, now there disposable alt ships, thanks mostly to the nano nerf, medium autocannons and pulses.\n\nThat's a whole lot of wrong packed into one post. You basically said 'I can't fly my favorite ship the way I used too. Waah.' Note, they didn't really nerf ceptors all that hard, just a little on the speed; rather they actually buffed nearly every other sub-cruiser ship - so cry me a river, fly something else. Or fly better. As Orange also said above, we use 1-2 ceptors in every gang (we do small gang <20, not big fleets), and they are still incredibly useful and effective. The amount of harassment and nanofaggotry that they enable - when flown by capable pilots - is hilarious.\n\nYeah, they're not particularly useful in big fleets - tbh, they never were though ('I was there' notwithstanding, lol). And yeah, they've had their survivability slightly reduced - mostly because of buffs to other things which needed to be buffed (Faction frigs, AFs, Dessies, and now T1 frigs). They're still extremely effective at their core use though - scouting and initial tackle. They're cheap, fast as balls, and work well IF, like all things in Eve, they're fitted and flown correctly. Overheating, going 6k/s and pointing out to 35-40 (which with the overview being slow to update is more like 50) will fuckup any sniper or nano ship's day. Orbiting at 30km outside of heavy neut range, going balls out fast will still, barely out-run warriors (if you're doing it right) and piss off any straggling BS or BC. They're right on the money imho. They can be countered, appropriately, but they still work quite well."

I know the peons can receive some sort of monetary reward, but I was under the impression that the vast herds of serfs live hand to mouth and have no money?

There is no Imperial constitution stating that every planet needs to be grimdark, oppressive and miserable.\n\nLiving hand to mouth does not mean you have no money. It means you have no disposable income after having bought basic necessities and paid rent. But money still passes through your hands. Unless the planet is one big centrally planned economy, whoever employs you has no way of directly providing you with everything.

If SWTOR was going to put the entire space fight on rails, this is how it was supposed to be done.\n\nWhen you do a sweep by a massive frigate, your shields are hammered. It is easy to forget you're driving one of the most advanced FIGHTERS in your respective fleets. In the past it was easy to get comfortable in your small fortress, razing away cruisers without a care in the world. In reality, you're still piloting a small vessel that requires a minimal crew verses large ships that require dozens to just get it moving. I'm sure it takes a \"small\" group of a hundred or more to operate the armaments on some of the largest vessels.\n\nNow it feels more appropriate. Shuttles and ships are far less likely to park themselves right in front of you for a free kill. Such fighters are now more often caught trying to strafe YOU, or swinging around to get a better shot. This means you're taking down less fighters and spending more time taking on the massive cruisers and frigates that are hammering your shields.\n\nBlasting everything in sight is not enough. Your ship spends more time trying to find cover and exacting evasive maneuvers, taking you through tight spaces and around massive asteroids. Larger vehicles move around in a similar manner, forcing you to stay on target whilst avoiding environmental hazards. In some cases, a tactical approach is more necessary, and holding down the first mouse button is an early trip to the RETRY prompt.\n\nTaking down the target is often so difficult that attacking other targets become unnecessary. Finally, I say. FINALLY. There's tons of new recruits on multiple planets to shoot down feckin' fighters. Now they call upon the BEST of the BEST to tackle massive targets. Ones that would shred other, lesser pilots. When you walk away, your ship is often smoking, but you leave crippled fleets in your wake.\n\nYou have to fight tooth and nail often, meaning each mission is now a valiant struggle against the opposition. In other words, getting to that mission success is finally -glorious-. For a rails shooter, space is finally appropriate in difficulty."

      "text": "Sunday, January 20, 2013\n\nGanking 101: Scouting\n\nYou've probably heard it said among our gank fleet members that the scouts are the most important members of the fleet, aside from the fleet commander (and even then it's arguable). All true. Our scouts play several roles at the same time. They're more like spies, really: Stealthy, sometimes invisible, sometimes in disguise, gathering intelligence, and oh-so-innocent behind their positive sec status.\n\nOur scouts may not carry weapons, but they are deadly. Our enemies learn their names quickly, and they immediately tense upon seeing one enter local. But how does a New Order scout operate? This post will offer some basic lessons.\n\nFirst thing's first. A simple Ship Scanner I allows you to peer into the tank of any potential target. It has no skill prerequisites. If you fit a Passive Targeter I (requires Targeting I to be trained), your prey will not know he's being locked and scanned. Simply activate the Passive Targeter and click on a mining ship. Though the glow of the module activation will not last long, you're in the clear. You can repeatedly scan the ship without its knowledge.\n\nAnd you must scan the miner repeatedly, because each time you do, you get only partial results. You used to get doubled results, but no more. Simply note each tank module and run another scan to see if there are more. You should do at least 5 scans. Each one takes a second. Your fleet commander will determine if the target is too tanked. Tell him about shield and armor modules. You can ignore shield boosters and EM or Explosive hardeners, since they'll have no effect on what we do.\n\nTo find targets, you can go to the nearest ice field, or use your directional scanner to find stuff in the asteroid belts. The simplest way is to scan a cluster of distant asteroid belts and then find out which one the target is in by warping to one and scanning the rest. Don't get too hung up on the targets; focus on the belts. Targets themselves may be stored in a POS where you can't get to them.\n\nIf you're cloaked in a Covert Ops or Stealth Bomber, maneuver your ship to find a clear path between you and the target, so nothing will decloak you when you approach. Anything can decloak you, including asteroids, cans, wrecks, and drones. The decloak range is 2,000m. Setting \"Keep at Range\" at 5,000m will enable your ship to breeze at top speed toward the target...\n\n...and you'll automatically slow down quickly enough to not be decloaked, even by orbiting drones. At 5,000m, you're too far to provide a proper warp-in for the fleet. You'll want to be right next to the target just before the fleet initiates its final warp to you. It takes around 15 seconds to go from 5,000m to being directly atop the target. If the fleet HQ is in the same system, hit \"Approach\" when they undock. If they're in the next system, begin the approach at the FC's signal. If you're an FC, a good signal time is when you start dropping out of warp on the other side of the final gate. By the time you exit warp, jump through the gate, and get ready to do the fleet warp, the scout should be in position.\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nA cloaked ship is not necessary for scouting. Sometimes it doesn't even help that much, because they often get decloaked in the busy ice field, or they drop cloak to run the Ship Scanner. Yet our scouts are notorious, and they get camped by people who want to interfere with the ganks. Scouts should always report to the FC whenever any combat ships are in the belt. A good scout is one who knows how to frustrate the campers. Here's how.\n\nFirst, a scout should hit different systems, rather than the same system over and over. A scout should check asteroid belts, as these generally aren't (or can't be) camped. Leaving campers in a belt all day while you strike elsewhere leaves them feeling useless.\n\nBut if you want to hit a popular ice field despite the campers, there's a useful technique: Bookmarking targets.\n\nAny ship can fly right up to a target and create a bookmark. Enter the target's name as the bookmark and then leave. It's now possible for a fleet to warp to the target without having a scout in person to provide the warp-in. And without a scout, the campers have no one to camp. They'll have no idea where the next attack will come.\n\nAfter collecting a target bookmark or two, the scout returns to the HQ station, copies the target bookmark into the inventory, and trades it to the FC. If the aggression period isn't up, the scout can continue looking for targets.\n\nOnce the FC has the target bookmark in his or her own People & Places, the target(s) may be hit at any time. Using this method, a scout can even set up warp-ins in multiple systems at once, further frustrating campers who don't know which system is next in line for attack. This is also efficient because a scout can look for more targets, rather than sitting next to just one while waiting for it to be attacked.\n\n\"But what if the bookmarked target leaves in the meantime?\" you ask. After giving the FC the bookmarks, the scout returns (preferably cloaked, but not necessarily) to keep watch from a distance. If the miner has not left, the bookmark warp-in is still good. In a busy ice field, a scout can even sit next to a second target on the other end of the belt. If campers follow him, the scout tells the FC to hit the bookmarked target. If the campers don't follow him, the scout tells the FC to warp to him and hit the target he's sitting on. Either way, the campers lose and the gankers win.\n\nIn some cases, I've seen miners return to the same position over and over throughout the day, because they've got their mining position bookmarked. But it's best not to wait too long before hitting a bookmarked target. Even though in theory you're \"warping to zero\", you can land 2,500m or more from the spot--especially if you bounce off an asteroid. A miner who returns to his old mining location may therefore be slightly further away, and leave some unlucky gankers just out of range. In any case, a ganker should always remember to get closer to the target on landing.\n\nOf course, if there are no campers about, it's easier for a scout to just sit near the target. But if campers are following a scout around, the ability to make undetectable warp-ins with bookmarks is a useful thing indeed.\n\nAny mining barge or exhumer works. The idea of the ghillie suit is to mine while you scan. Skiffs & Procurers are a great choice because it costs more isk than miners are willing to spend to gank them. The speed of the ship doesn't matter when you can warp from point to point.\n\nSome more scout tips: The disgruntled miners suicide ganked several scouts. Have tank or a ship you can't care less to lose.\n\nWatch out for Ibises. They aren't lost noobs, they are dangerous ECM boats that can defeat a gank.\n\nTake your time to talk to the miners, educate them about the Code, taunt the campers.\n\nLoot the wrecks of the catalysts for profit. Salvage them and also the miners. Scouting is a profitable profession, perfect place for a newbie who can't afford catas. If you loot T1, yell at the noob who fitted them.\n\nYou can warp to rocks in the other end of the belt\n\nHave Concord on your overview, they can't be in 150km of the target.\n\nAlways talk to your fleet or they might get bored and go AFK. They don't see how busy you are, they just sit in the station doing nothing.\n\nLink the name of the target to the fleet chat along with the system name.\n\nI'd be scouting in a Venture. You can biomass and start over whenever the name gets known, and be out there in an hour or so - and you are fine to just fit it with passive targetter, ship scanner, prop mod, and a civilian miner or two for protective camoflage...\n\nScouting with a Venture in an ice belt is about as subtle as doing it with a Catalyst in any belt. You'll get the AFK miners because surprise surprise, they're AFK. You won't get the ones actually paying attention most of the time because why would a Venture be in an ice belt if not to scout?\n\n\"In a busy ice field, a scout can even sit next to a second target on the other end of the belt. If campers follow him, the scout tells the FC to hit the bookmarked target. If the campers don't follow him, the scout tells the FC to warp to him and hit the target he's sitting on. Either way, the campers lose and the gankers win.\"\n\nPlayed right, a scout that attracts attention can be just as useful as one that doesn't, we saw that firsthand on yesterdays ganks. A scout had a number of campers around him in one location while we warped to a bookmark that was being monitored by another, the tarps didn't know where we were going to hit and just wandered about in disarray. It was beautiful.\n\nI've noticed a couple of miners fitting ship scanners, so in a busy ice field it's reasonable to expect that some of the regulars will know what your fit is. If your barge or exhumer fit looks suspicious then it's a pretty good bet that the locals know why you're there and are communicating that."

I'm still a bit confused with the answer as you said No (in replying my question meaning - I can't continue with the rest of the steps, but the latter answer with dot points allows to continue with the steps). Perhaps I didn't ask the question clearly either.

You still have to do that, and then the engagement continues as normal.\n\nEdit: now that I have a computer instead of my phone, I'll expand:\n\nLet's say that you're the LS player and you only have an A-Wing ready. You've engaged 2 of the 3 DS objectives, but have not yet engaged The Emperor's Web.While the A-Wing's strike will not do any damage to The Emperor's Web in that example, there are a handful of other ways you could get damage through. For instance, Target of Opportunity would still deal damage to it. Also, Crossfire could be played to give the A-Wing a blast damage icon. With 2 copies of one of those and one copy of the other, the unopposed A-Wing would destroy The Emperor's Web in a single engagement (unlikely, but possible). Alternatively, you could use Battle of Hoth (upcoming fate card that deals one damage to or removes one damage from a target Hoth objective) to hit a Hoth objective your opponent controls for one more damage. But yes, barring any other tricks the A-Wing will only do the single unopposed damage and not even that if there is a surviving defender (though it will then have gotten to do its unit damage)."

After to be deceased of service in the federation lot of ships and spare parts still were available for civil market fleet, This makes that lot of Oberth class still continues in service in civil configuration for lot of years more\n\nA important mission for lot of civil companies was the prospecting uninhabited planets to exploit them. This mission requires a cheap, lightweight but strong and reliable ship able to carry a small exploration teams as well a powerful detection system. Lot of deceased Oberth were bought for small and big companies to do this and else duties... and it begun to appear lot of variations.\n\nThe Starwatcher was a deep refit of the Oberth Class. A big hangar in the back part was one of the more visible modifications. That way the Starwatcher has a bigger fleet of small support ships than the original Oberth. But probably the most important modification was a huge sensor array able to x-ray a whole planet in very little time. For this porpoise was very useful the separated hull configuration because when the main sensor array was at full power it was very recommendable that all crew evacuate the secondary hull and move up to the upper one.\n\nOther important modifications were all the propulsion system focused in the endurance and low consumption. It has very complicated and sober sub-light engines that allows it to travel almost at light speed without need to use the warp engines. This feature proves to be a big advantage in fuel consumption during long exploration planet to planet trips. (They are not a substitute in sun to sun trips where warp speed is a need. But in planet to planet trips the warp speed probe it to be more energetic demanding)\n\nThe Starwatcher has a very weak armament (one laser, and one torpedo launcher) but it has a secret weapon. When the Sensor array is at full power it can burn all the electric system of any ship that is under the ray till more than 100km.\n\nThe Starwarcher is proving to be a very successful ship in rating cost/profit.... and the fleet is seriously thinking to take back again some old Oberth (refitted in Starwatchers) for some first contact explorations"

They all have the [HoloHistory] tag on them, or just search by my name: @drogyn1701.

      "text": "Okay, so we already have colony ships and transport ships so how about another type as well.\n\nI was playing 0.3.13 when I forgot completely about ship fuel and ended up having both my scout ships stuck out in the middle of nowhere just sitting around until my supply range reached them. Then I also thought how this would work in a military situation. So much of a wartime plan goes into ensuring adequate supplies and a lot of it boils down to convoys braving the elements and the enemy submarines to reach their comrades.\n\nSo my proposal is that we have a supply pod ship part, just like the colony pod and troop pods. A fleet containing ships with supply pods would have a little button on the fleet selection box which when pressed would instantly consume one of the supply ships and restock every ship and fleet in system with ammo and fuel. Of course each pod only contains so much, so refilling your golden armada is gonna take quite a few of them, and the ships themselves also have limited fuel themselves so you can't simply send them across the galaxy (unless you take a lot and periodically use a few of them every few jumps to keep the fleet fuelled)\n\nThat would be a helpful add on, I could see myself creating large supply ships with only supply pods on it, it would be a helpful tech to research I like it.\n\n_________________ ______________________________________________ \"People are stupid, they will believe in what they want to. But sometimes you must use people to achieve your goals no matter if it is for bad or good, for patriotism or treason\"-The BlackHoleEach pod would only contain about five points of supplies. When consumed the ship with the pod(s) would instantly disappear and those five points would be distributed evenly among the ships in the system. It would start on any ship that has zero fuel and give it one point of fuel. If every ship has at least one point of fuel it would then make sure every fleet has at least one point of ammo for every ammo-using ship in the fleet. Then any leftover points would be used to ensure every ship has two fuel, then two ammo etc. until every ship has full fuel and every fleet has full ammo.\n\nPriority for fuel would be given to ships with the largest capacities. If there are still points left over after everything has been restocked, then they would be converted to a negligable amount of trade or minerals. Obviously the supply ship itself would still have its own limited amount of fuel as well. In addition, its impossible to use just a few pods from a ship with many, the entire ship is always consumed.\n\nPerhaps to use this, there would be two tiny icons next to a supply ship's fuel amount, the first would just consume that ship, the other would consume either all the ships in the fleet or enough to supply every ship in the system. Supply ships cannot be used during transit, but they can be used if there was a combat in system that turn. When a supply ship consumed the effect is applied that turn so ships can move immediately.\n\nOh yeah, and supply ships cannot be used if the system is within supply range.\n\nEDIT: A supply pod should cost more than a troop pod, but less than a colony pod.\n\nI also think this would be better to abstract out. Just assume that the current fuel range limit already represents something like this.\n\nGeoff the Medio wrote:Why not just prevent the player from being able to send the ships out of supply range?\n\nIn either case I think an extra visual indicator that a ship is leaving supply range would be nice. Perhaps the fuel supply number could flash red, or more prominently the direction vector from the fleet to the system might change colour when the player mouses over or selects the out of range star. Otherwise I suspect we may find some new players getting frustrated unnecessarily if they keep accidentally sending lots of ships out of range.\n\nWhy not just prevent the player from being able to send the ships out of supply range?\n\nBecause the player can have good reasons to send out ships out of supply range. - colony ships don't need to go back, creating colonies out of the current fuel range is not that uncommon - military support might be needed somewhere out of fuel range - an aggressive explorer might be willing to strand ships to expand his known space\n\nWhy not just prevent the player from being able to send the ships out of supply range?\n\nBecause the player can have good reasons to send out ships out of supply range.\n\nAlso, it's impossible to do so. A ship could be \"in range\" one turn, and then the next turn an enemy could block a supply lines, making the ship no longer able to access supplies from the same location.\n\nWait a minute, how about this then. I just reviewed the 0.4 Design Pad and thought about this:\n\n0.4 Design Pad wrote: (to an extent, more ships need more ammo obviously). This way you can use a disposable Supply Ship as your \"one-way-shuttle.\" Simply build a ship with a supply pod, send it off to some desperate squadron in an enemy system, double-click a \"consume\" button next to the supply ship's fuel rating and your fleets in that system get 10 points of ammo distributed to them.\n\nThis way, the supply ship simply provides a faster way of distributing ammo that you would otherwise have to use fresh combat ships for. And it won't break the game's fuel/supply system....\n\nThe point of that excerpt is that we don't need keep each ship's ammo stockpile separate like we do for each ship's fuel supply, because the consequences of sharing ammo are much less than those of sharing fuel. In theory at least, players will probably not feel the need to micromanage by shuttling ships around in order to avoid ammo limits to the same degree they could with fuel. For ammo, the player can just send the ship back to a supplyable point and get resupplied there. (Whereas with fuel, sending the ship back to get restocked wouldn't let it continue travelling from its original furthest reachable distance with a refilled fuel tank.)\n\nThis is *not* a justification to intentionally break the supply system for ammo by actually making supply ship for that purpose. (And that is what you're proposing to do...)\n\nWell, from what I understand in that case. You're saying each fleet carries the same arbitrary amount of ammo. That sounds really strange to me, I was under the impression that a fleet's stock of ammo was directly linked to how much ammo the collected ships would need to expend in a typical series of battles.\n\nAll I really wanna say is don't shelve this idea straight away because I think it would be useful. Perhaps we can revisit it when v0.4 comes out and we see how much ammo ships carry and then use. Then we can adjust the idea.\n\nBesides, its not quite micromanagement. The supply ship needs about as much management as a troop ship or a colony ship, not to mention it functions very similarly, just with a different purpose.\n\nI was under the impression that a fleet's stock of ammo was directly linked to how much ammo the collected ships would need to expend in a typical series of battles.\n\nNot really.

      "text": "Ok, I need some feedback on this, and I can't shut up about it any longer. Here are my plans for multi player GSB, and they are going quite nicely in terms of being almost playable already…\n\nGSB is a single player game with a number of scenarios each of which has a normal, hard and expert AI fleet to fight against. You will probably play each scenario several times, trying to reconfigure your fleet each time to beat the opposition. You will also gradually unlock new races, so there will be the urge to beat every scenario with every race eventually.\n\nHowever, nothing beats going up against the brains of another player. The problems with a mutiplayer version are:\n\nThis isnt a real-time game, so you would sit there for ages waiting for the other guy to design his fleet.\n\nIndie games dont have big sales, so finding people to play against is hard.\n\nThe solution is PBEM (play by email) but WITHOUT the email. Basically it works like this:\n\nYou load up a scenario as usual, having selected your race, and probably already with a big bank of pre-designed ships from battles against the AI. You probably have an uber-fleet that kicks ass against the expert AI already. You then click the 'challenge' button. This takes you to a screen where you type in the username of the other GSB player (someone you know, who has the full game), and a taunt to tell them how their pathetic space fleet will be ground to dust by your mighty lasers. You click send.\n\nThat uploads a tiny data file onto my server, where it's stored in a database. The next time your friend launches the game, and clicks 'refresh challenges' he/she will see your challenge, with taunt in all its glory. He/she can then download that challenge file and play against your fleet in their own free time. Eventually, they should find a fleet that beats your fleet, and no doubt they will then challenge you back.\n\nObviously its possible to see how many of your challenges have been beaten, and to even track how many attempts it took. There are also tons of high score and metagame possibilities, as are the theoretical possibility of me posting 'open' challenges' which get sent to everyone.\n\nThis is tons of work, especially for a net-coding n00b, but it's in and working at the server side, I'm just tweaking client-side UI code to get it to work smoothly.\n\nThoughts?\n\n32 Responses to \"How the (sort-of) multiplayer will work\"\n\n1) how is this different from a \"scenario editor\"? One player defines the enemy fleet, the other player plays against that fleet like any AI fleet. The difference is the that the designer doesn't get carte blanche, they have a certain amount of resources to work with.\n\n2) any reason those scenarios couldn't be flat files that could be sent to whoever, however? If you wanted to have a managed file drop on your server for this purpose, great, but it wouldn't be strictly necessary.\n\nAh, the metagame possibilities would exceed a simple filedrop, certainly. But aside from that, just to allow simple 1-on-1 matches, any reason we couldn't just create a scenario and email the file to the opponent?\n\nThere is no vital technical reason why not, but having it centralised has a lot of advantages, because I can do some decent stats tracking and see what ships and weapons are unbalanced. If every player is using certain modules or combinations and ignoring other ones, I can tell this, and then re-balance the game.\nThat, and the fact that for the casual gamer, typing \"Die alien scum\" and clicking 'send' is way easier than saving out files, attaching them to emails etc.\n\nits implemented as a MySQL database on the server, and some php and the game talks directly to it using wininet. It talks to php which interfaces with the database, and wininet is used to shuffle the challenge files up and down from the server.\n\nCool; are you extracting stats from the challenge files into the DB, or just using the DB to track the files? It'd be interesting to be able to run SQL queries to see how frequently a given module is used, or what percentage of ship space (or money, or power) is used for engines or shields or weapons, etc.\n\nWhen the challenge is beaten, will the client upload the challenger's config? For one, it could be an auto-challenge-back to see if someone can beat the victorious fleet, for another I imagine it would be much easier when doing balance analysis if you could see both sides of the equation.\n\nFinally, will it be possible for you to analyze the actual battles, or would it suffice to include the initial random seed and both fleet files and re-simulate?\n\nThe sever just tracks the files, and some basic data like sender and recipient. I haven't yet got any server-side code to do stats analysis, but it will definitely happen, and I can always dump all the challenges to my dev machine and run some number crunching on it.\nSadly the games are not (at the moment) at all deterministic, so playing a battle twice *may* result in different outcomes.\nI'm not sure if that is worth the grief required to change it.\n\nEven if they're not deterministic you could actually run a battle between the two fleets if you had both files. I'm not sure how separated-out the rendering code is, but if you can leave that part out you could also have an auto-sim that could re-run a battle a few hundred times to see what the actual odds are in case you think a given victory was a fluke.\n\nBut determinism would really help the whole \"save a replay\" idea, I imagine.\n\nOn the server-side stats analysis, if you'd like a hand I have a fair bit of experience with php and mysql (and tons with other web/db platforms), as well as text-mining and xml (dunno what format your challenge files are in). Entirely free/volunteer, of course.\n\nIt would be really cool to have you send out uber-challenges that would require multiple people to design fleets. You could have one that required 2-3 people to design fleets that would all go up against some uber-fleet of your design. Or anyone could try to create an uber-challenge and you could get awards/achievements for your single fleet fending off multiple fleets.\n\nOne more question… Will there be \"environmental\" objects or effects? Planets or black holes that could change the course of battles or what fleets should be selected? (Maybe stars that might randomly go supernova?)\n\nIn our case there will also be real-time multiplayer, but for reasons mentioned there might not be many players online when you want to play. And essentially, playing against someone's \"ghost\" will be the same.\n\nBasically, every track will have lots of uploaded replays you can compete against.\n\n1. I think it's okay if there's some randomness to battle outcomes\n2. Multiplayer is a great idea and having a database with challenges is definitely the way to go.\n3. i would propose that you allow for the sending of challenges, but have all the challenges searchable and open to everyone.\n4. I think you should track each fleets wins/losses and espeically post the top 10 or whatever fleets for people to challenge (I assume that if a player downloads a fleet and loses 5 and wins 1 that you can track this as well).\n5. Great feature which gives the game some legs.\n\nJust out of interest, are the economics of supporting this feature viable?\n\nI looked into something similar but hosting costs and subscription rates sort of made it less appealing to a gaming audience (and to me). I've noticed some online gaming communities which use advertising revenue but that's probably not too healthy at the moment.\n\nI am somewhat worried that watching battles over and over will quickly become a boring task, especially if there are no rewards other than beating the opposing fleet. Of course, they look absolutely stunning, but since theres no interaction involved, everything might seem the same after a few hundred battles.\n\n1. This service can be easily implemented and hosted on Google App Engine and would cost you nothing assuming you don't get more than 5 million hits per month. [ But you will have to code it either in Python or Java. :( ]\n\n2. For every fleet setting stored in your server DB, you can also provide a URL, something like  which can be entered in your game and the game loads that particular setting. This way you can also maintain fleet setting rank list and related stuff :)\nAnd this will also allow a user to use same saved configuration with multiple friends without sending setting over and over again.\n\ni also was thinking about a point system where fleets get a score based on their offensive defensive capability.\n\nwith this in place it could be used as a way of matching various fleets against each other .\n\nthis may not be doable or even used by the player base.\nA way to watch these battles would be really cool ala spectator mode. and even cooler would be to implement a screen saver that can monitor different battles.\n\nof course im using the point system as a way of implementing real time play.\nthe points is used to have a pre setup fleet so you enter battle and go at it .\n\ni envision several scenarios where you could have a mega fleet with really big points vs several smaller fleets equaling or maybe even surpassing the big fleets points regardless you would have several player vs one player and it would take the team work of the others to defeat the large fleet.\n\neither way real time play with a spectator system would be really cool and hopefully im not fantasizing to far out in left feild\n\nSending static challenges doesn't sound look fun at all to me, unfortunately. I imagined the multiplayer being a lot like the Total War series', and waiting a bit for other players to design their army there is not an issue. Even if it's not real time, the fun would be in designing a fleet without knowing what your opponent is going to do. Presumably no fleet is all-powerful so you'll be second-guessing what tricks the other player will do. And then there'd be the excitement of nervously watching the battle play out in real time and commenting on it to your opponent (\"Damn! I should've used more frigates.\", \"I can't believe your ship A got my ship B!\").\n\nAs for the 2nd problem, I suppose we'd just have to organise matches in advance with friends or in the forum? But swapping prepared fleets for other people to crack seems more like the GSB equivalent of level editing than multiplayer.\n\nNot sure if this has been mentioned but I would like to be able to go to a site (Gratuitous Space battles) and see a list of submitted challenges. When you win you upload your \"cheapest?\" solution and this is recorded for others to improve upon. Similar to Armadillo Run method…..\n\nHi Cliffski,\nWhat are the server loads likely to be on this, looking at this game possibly being your most 'mainstream'(and successfull) to date? Seperate server/backup server needed?\nre the 'open' comments on challanges, is it a free-for-all or will there be some kind of hierarchy in general for battle match ups?\n\nI'm hoping that the server load will not be too bad. A challenge file is only about 3 or 4k, and unless I sell 10,000 copies and have each of them issuing and retrieving 10 challenges a day or more, I can't really see it being an issue. I have a dedicated server running positech, and it is woefully under-used right now, so I'm not anticipating mega-server overload.\nFamous last words eh? :D\n\nI like Mike's idea. Because of the rarity, one isn't likely to have more than one friend (if that) with this game. Being able to get a list of all challenges out there, trying them out, and submitting your own challenges with score tracking sounds like fun.\n\nApart from a 1 to 1 fight with a specific player:\nHow about you create a \"roster\" list.\n\n-you initially put a number of levels or variations of oposing fleets on the server,\nand the player can download them and play against them.\n\n-If the player beats tis oponent-fleet, the time and \"special points\"\nare recoded and send to the server.\n\n-now the player is put into a roster-list, and can see his position, and\nhow much he moved up the roster.\n\n-the fleet of the best player is then stored as the best fleet of this \"level\"\nand gets rewarded as \"fleet-master\".\nPeople can then download this one, and try to beat it, or at least move up the roster-list\n\n—-\n\nIts a nice way to let multiple players participate, without the need\nto look for a specific player\n(wich is always a problem in smaller multiplayer-games)"

It basically tests to see if you can build a powerful fleet without just throwing the best armour and shields at everything and steam rolling.\n\nThere is a list to show you what is limited in that specific battle so you just have to notice, \"Only three reflective shields allowed. I need some more ships with different shields. No heavy armour, time to pull out the lightweight ships.\"\n\nThe supply limit battles are also very few and usually a lot later down the list. You could always do challenges against other players if you want to be unrestricted on which level you do. (Though some players do use supply limits. I have not seen it often but they do sometimes.)\n\nIt isn't really trial and error unless you mindlessly throw parts at your ships. Just observe what you cannot use at all, usually some form of heavy armour or a type of weapon, avoid those and build multiple types of ships around that particular challenge.

Note how the effect on phasers has a chance to disable a subsytem, although i would love phasers that disabled the hull of a ship.

All I have to say is: Meet da Lootaz.\n\ni've had nid players believe there's no way that i can beat their genestealers in CC, until they charged through cover and found themselves at initiative 1.\n\ni've had people think that their transports are safe, because ork rokkits never hit.\n\nI've had people think their mighty daemon prince is more than a match for a unit of grots, and introduced them to grabba sticks and massed attacks.\n\nI've had people decide that burnas are less of a threat in a vehicle than out of one, and subsequently re-educated them as each burna hit more of his spread-out troops than they would from any point on a vehicle, then charged and wiped them out.\n\nI've had people think sending a full landraider at a deffrolla wagon full of burnas was a good idea.\n\nI've had someone think that his dreadknight would be more than a match for killa kans. 4 turns of combat later, he changed his mind.\n\nI've had people think that their model is safe from my trukkmobs simply because it is 20\" away. love RPJ!\n\nand last but not least, i've had players who think my kustom-force-field isn't that bad to face. It is.\n\nMy Chaos Beakie friend once thought that Chaos beakies have the premier CC Deathstar unit: his unit of Berserkers w/Abbadon. (This was before the dawn of Draigo and ridiculousness of Ward). Saying that the Orks had no real close combat unit capable of dealing with his deathstar, little did he know the power of a full unit of diversified Nobz and Warboss would bring more than half his army down with minimal losses. They took down the combined charge of Abbadon+Zerker retinue, summoned lesser daemons AND a full squad of plague Beakies w/powerfist. He promptly gave up afterward and called the Nobz a haxxor unit .\n\nAnother misconception is that AV14 is safe from ork mobz. My tin'ead-playing friend quickly lost confidence in his Monoliths after 2 howling mobz of ork boyz charged in with several S9 PK attacks that immobilized them to make it easy pickings for my Deff Dreadz that closed in.\n\nBut so far out of everything it seems that all of the people I play with are most astonished at the ork upgrades for our vehicles, especially the 5-point grot riggers and RPJ which in conjunction with a nearby KFF makes them tear their hair in frustration....ah good times...good times..\n\n--------------------\n\nMy advice to you is to get married, if you have a good wife you'll be happy; if you get a bad one you'll become a philosopher.\n\nI've had someone think that his dreadknight would be more than a match for killa kans.\n\nDid he forget to roll 2d6 armor pen? Everybody always forgets that freaking thing is an MC! And the doomfists (default wargear) count as DCCW's. So he's str 10, + 2d6 armor pen (every hit is a pen vs a kan). If he upgraded it to a sword, he gets to reroll both misses, and armor pen rolls (or wounds)! It's a lot more of a slouch if you play it at str 6, and without the MC 2d6 armor pen.\n\nI'd say that ork shooting is always underestimated by a huge amount. I've wiped out half a squad of terminators with some trukk boyz before...in the shooting phase!\n\n--------------------\n\nShoota Boyz in a Battlewagon are insanity. BS of 2 is amazing! You can't miss with 120 shots!I have also encountered this one. Some people seem to the the WAAAGH is an ability of the warboss, and I don't really know why. There is also a lot of confusion about Ghazghul's special waaagh, but I'll let that slide because he's a special character. Another one I've heard though is that the waaagh allows your units to automatically rally, as if they were beakies. That's a misconception that I wish was true!Finally, one I've found is that people often overestimate the power of lootas. They imagine what carnage those guns could cause in the hands of their Beakies and instantly target the lootas to die. We of course can use this to our advantageYou know, I've been playing orks for years and misread that one myself\n\n\"I just print out cossack's posts on plasticard, and slowly fashion them into deff dread's over time, and then kill things with them.\" - greggles \"yey my forum hero is back, welcome back cossack! been boring around here without you.\" - Big Lone \"And Cossack is the NICE one here!\" - Shabbadoo \"I gotta agree with Cossack. Go back to your friends, and tell them that Orkz are indeed broken, but that you'll continue to play them because they're absolute beasts, the likes of which have not been seen in years. Then tell them how delicious their tears are and that you'll be using them to fuel and lubricate the emerald warmachine that is your WAAAGH!\" - Boss Gobbstompa\n\nI had someone say that lootas are the worst units in the codex, which is obviously sluggas in trukks... (kidding, slugga-trukks are awesome, long as there's more than one )\n\nbut in seriousness... *re-engages serious face*\n\ni had a grey knight player say it was suicide charging his unit of paladins with my grots. first thing they did was fail a psychic test, then they mostly ballsed-up their rolls and killed 3 grots, and they lost 2 wounds in return. i passed the check, and won the game because he was stuck there & couldn't reach the objective in time.\n\nI've also had grey knight players (there's a lot of them at my gaming store... ...the bandwagon must be heaving...) say there's no way any unit can stand against their death-cult assassins (that what they're called?). both times, i've not only survived the charge, but won the combat and wiped them out. once with tzeench possessed who rolled power-weapons, and once with nobz and a warboss vs 9 assassins and a special character who (naturally) boosts all their stuff somehow.\n\ni still love when people say 'orks can't shoot' it's like saying the rain's inaccurate, because most of it misses you - you're still blooming soaked though!\n\na common misconception overall is that ordnance can't fire if you move - it's only indirect fire (barrage) that neccesitates a stationary firing position.\n\nanother is that if a SAG mek explodes himself, vehicles are penetrated in the blast - far as it reads, it seems models are removed entirely - the '6,6' result is like a S:D shot, the '1,1' is more like a vortex explosion (which makes sense, considering the powers involved).\n\nOrks can't shoot -Enemy proceeds to be shot off objective as the opponent all but gives up the shooting phase thinking mine couldn't amount to much. -Is astonished by the sheer number of Dice I roll during the shooting phases and gets scared regardless of what I actually accomplish.\n\nOrks can't handle heavy Armor, and our best unit for anti-armor (tankbustas) suck -I race trukk mobs out with a PK next to their tank and rip it to pieces -I field a small tankbusta mob that the enemy forgets about until I open up with multiple rockets -I run squads of TL Rokkit armed buggies around the field blowing shit up. -Tankbustas well they do suck considering how many points we pay for them. I won't argue that point, but I still use them. -three batteries of three ork cannons each, I haven't tried this one yet but I have a feeling I might be on to something with it.\n\nOrks aren't good combat anymore -Eats genestealers with standard shoota boys in CC -Smashes beakie combat squads apart with slugga boys -Laughes when Dreadnoughts get into CC with units without a PF (was seeing a lot more of those before I stopped playing regularly)\n\nOrks only have and are good at 'plan A' also known as get'em, and need to get into close combat -Shot the crap out of one of those lone wolf character death seekers out of the space wolf book instead of assaulting him and letting him use his 100pts of CC wargear on me. Oh the look on my friend's face was priceless when he tried to taunt me into charging, how he grumbled and called my warboss names. -sits back and smiles at people when they realize that they have to give up their gun lines to come shift me out of ruins/buildings because with the saves I'm getting I've the numbers to soak up the casualties all game long without blinking an eye. -grins like a demon when my opponent adjusts their plans to either avoid or go after a particular unit, knowing that I placed the unit with the specific intention of getting my opponent to do exactly that, either avoid or go after said unit... I love it when it's a trap either way.\n\nI think that's most of the common ones and some of the things I've done to people to teach them otherwise.Yeah, this one is also common with me. Many people are surprised when they figure they can't bait the tankbustas from their other vehicles using a speeder. Truth is all you need to do is shoot at any vehicle, even if it's out of range and attempt to charge a vehicle. You CAN move away from vehicles in movement phase. Had bout 4 people asking me this. Can't believe I forgot.\n\n1. Gretchin suck. 2. Orks are WAAAY better in close combat than they are at shooting. 3. Orks are AWESOME in close combat. 4. Gotta have a KFF. 5. Looted Wagons with boomguns suck. 6. Battlewagons with killkannons suck. 7. You gotta have a Nob w/PK in EVERY unit that can have one. 8. Orks are not so good versus Mech armies.\n\nMostly this thread has a gaming emphasis, which is cool, as it's the right section for it, but there's also a very large proportion of Non-Ork players that have some pretty massive misconceptions about Ork fluff too (it's also pretty rife with a lot of Ork players as well). I have a thread in the FBH which goes into some of these in larger detail. It can be found here. I'm hoping to update with another article today.\n\nHere's a list of the few big misconceptions that I've already covered:\n\n1. Orks are stupid 2. Ork language is just silly phonetic English 3. Ork skin has to be green 4. Sporing is Ork-centric 5. Not knowing much, if anything, about sporing 6. That subconscious stored knowledge (such as that of a Mek) comprises the entirety of their knowledge and excludes the concepts of practice and learning 7. That \"current\" Ork fluff is modern and retcons much of the rogue trader era (one of the bigger misconceptions) 8. Pretty much everything about Ork Resonance 9. *Ork weapons only work because they think they do* (the biggest misconception) 10. That Orks are the only Orkoids to use resonance 11. That Orks are always funny and silly and thus can't be taken seriously 12. That there are only 6 Clans 13. That you can't have Mono-clan tribes 14. That all Freebootas are pirates 15. Orks cannot be affected by Genestealer infections or Chaos\n\nThere's a few more mentioned in the thread, and I'm not done with the series just yet.\n\nThis one I have found to be largely true. How do you deal with spammed msu transports? I find that i simply never have enough anti-tank to do it. . .--------------------\n\nBashing stuff in the grim future of the 41st millenium since 1999... That's nearly 39000 years of experience !Beakies and guardsmen, with their melta everywhere can do it fine. The problem is with armies that don't have access to enough melta or equivilent anti-tank weaponary. fish'ead have Str10 ap1, that can also do it well. 'Crons have their tricks (just don't be relying on gauss). 'nids find themselves completely hosed on this alone.\n\nQUOTE (Master Mek GuzMek @ Apr 7 2012, 04:51 AM)\n\nIve been told that shootas are no match for bolters\n\nGuzmek\n\nShootas are great. The problem is that rokkit's are no match for meltas. . ."

      "text": "In my recruiting efforts for both my alliance and my corp I've found there are some that are dead set on being NRDS. Figured we could all have a rousing debate on it, to give a break from the epeen waving1) What if the guy is an acquaintance of a friend of yours? 2) Do you live in an apt with roommates where strangers would be standing around?\n\nSo in clarification of that, I believe this is how it should be:\n\nNRDS: If he broke in, ask him who the hell he is, and why he's here. If he's hostile, grab anything and beat his skull in (as long as he's facing you, cause if you attack his back, its considered against the law in real life anyways :P)\n\nIf none of the above, chill out, have a smoke, coffee, drink, w/e an talk about your awesome DVD Collection ;P.\n\nNBSI: Pepper his body with bullets then teabag his body? Only downside to this is:\n\nA) You have to get rid of a dead boy =\\... B) You have to explain why your nuts are covered in blood =\\... C) All that legal hoo-ha later on =\\...\n\nThank god Eve Online isn't like real life eh? So none of our parallels work at :P.\n\nOriginally by:Hilly22222NRDS is merely NBSI with less targets and a severe disadvantage in the first stages of a fight with neutrals. It gives some people a degree of self-satisfaction but it just sucks most of the time.\n\nNBSI is the \"fire first and ask questions when you want to\" and is the best way to operate imo\n\nlook at alliances like HELM alliance to see how NRDS sucks balls\n\nYeh. I have memories of roaming with CVA when I was a newbie and we'd run into neutrals, and have to stop and wait before engaging while the FC put their names through their KOS checker or whatever. NBSI is much more fun since you don't have to pass up juicy kills and it's safer to just assume hostile and pewpew too.\n\nThis is eve not life.\n\nOriginally by:Sylen1) What if the guy is an acquaintance of a friend of yours?\n\nRead the post.\n\nOriginally by:damgood85a strange man you don't know\n\nOriginally by:Sylen2) Do you live in an apt with roommates where strangers would be standing around?\n\nI said your house, not yours and your roommates.\n\nOriginally by:SylenIts my house, I have the right to leave my doors open. Strange men do not have the right to wander in.\n\nOriginally by:BrummbullI agree with this. NRDS for all its flaws is probably the most conducive for a newbie to try out 0.0, because while not shooting Neutrals is a big annoyance to people who have been in 0.0 a long time, for a newbie its still second nature. And in NRDS space there is -still- never a shortage of actual Reds to work out the practicalities of 0.0 PvPYou forgot what happens very often:\n\nNRDS = you find a guy that is walking around you home, he smile and greets so you ignore him, he walk behind you and backstab you while you were doing something else, then, and only after that, you call your friends and put him in a black list from coming in your \"common\" house.\n\nNBSI is a convoluted Rules of engagement that's used for scrapheap comedy Ganknights, it stands for: Not Blackbird/bellicose Shoot it. It's often used to supersede other standings such as \"**** my bluelist is massive\" and \"I wish they updated the -10s\"\n\nMake sure to stock up on bellicoses when you join NBSI alliances, as they will often fall prey on those hapless victims who don't know this fine difference.\n\nwell that's about what i just cant get in NRDS. how can you live with all those neutrals living near you ?\n\nI mean any last one of them can just try to blow you to pieces.\n\nCan either see how it makes easier for noobs to acoodate, since 1) they live in an artificial danger at all times 2) system is more complicated -> check if guy is on kos list or not , put every one hostile on negative standing etc etc.\n\nNBSI is just so much simpler, you have 2 friends the green and the blues everyone else is hostile :D\n\nFor all i can figure NRDS is more like, just close your eyes and hope the otherone wont shoot.\n\nFor any practical comparison to real life please refer to a wild wild west real life mkayyyy ?\n\nwell eve is all but civilised, even in empire you get suicide ganks, wars , and factional warfare.\n\nIf you feel in low-sec or 0.0 like in a cozy, warm, friendly neighberhood, you just might be in the wrong game.\n\nQuote: EVE is a dark and harsh world, you're supposed to feel a bit worried and slightly angry when you log in, you're not supposed to feel like you're logging in to a happy, happy, fluffy, fluffy lala land filled with fun and adventures, that's what hello kitty online is for.\n\nEdited by: Konoch on 02/02/2010 02:04:48 NRDS will not exist within two weeks. Please ignore the notion and move swiftly to NBSI. As it stands the only significant NRDS faction is about to be vaporized and a beacon for RP across every MMO will fall with it. While i understand -A-'s motives in this situation it makes me sick to know that the only rpers ever to hold such a significant position are about to be wiped off the map likely for good.\n\nPip if you're reading this i strongly suggest you bug the **** out and i mean right now.\n\nIt is very simple. Everyone likes killing everyone else no matter the reason Null Sec is simply the killing fields on which no one is safe or will ever be safe. Doesn't matter how many guns you bring you'll never get in and survive unless you join the clique factions. Which honestly ****es me off. To that end i'll be shooting damn near anything and everything i think regardless of its alignment because that's just the kind of psychotic dumb ass *****es we got controlling the best parts of space.\n\nAs long as no one is willing to show any kind of restraint whatsoever and talk NRDS holds no place in eve. It cant. What is happening in providence is full proof of that. -A- can say whatever the **** it wants but the fact is what happened in DG would have been enough of a lesson for damn near any faction save BoB AKA IT alliance or GoonSwarm. Still they continue forward. Worse they attempted an RP coup de tat within the area with their so called peace proposal.The homicidal maniacs are what live out in null and most of low. Until true law reigns there it will remain that way. Not a single pod pilot has the balls to attempt to bring the wild lands under control hell probably not even me. There in the end is no debate. NRDS is not worth the trouble so long as people are unwilling to enforce it. Only one faction had the power to even try and they are about to die. Change your philosophy while you can.\n\nQuote:Seriously, it seems like 95% of people in low/nullsec act like insane militant survivalists.\n\nTry? That's exactly what they are. They need to be podded repediately its a shame no one has the balls or the firepower to do so.'\n\nYou really have to be paranoid in order to survive, if you see someone jump in 'your' systerm, assume he is there to kill you and devour your corpse, theres several things you can compare life and eve with but in EvE no one has any morals so the second you let your guard down someone will kill you and sleep with your alt,..\n\nCVA ONLY works because no one wants providence, it is nice of them to actually have a NRDS for the carebears but for every carebear out there, theres 50 pirates so really if you think about it miners are the primary source of piracy and corruption,..\n\nIt works for SF. They totally kept Severance from building an outpost right under their noses during a protracted campaign against them. Totally. Those neutral freighters passing through the SF gatecamps couldn't possibly have been carrying the materials for said outpost.\n\nCompare Providence, one of the most densely packed regions of 0.0, with proper NBSI space. I was with a gang roaming through -A- space the other night and we EASILY went 10+ jumps without seeing a single. freaking. red.\n\nI'm totally happy to be an NRDS resident of Providence. At least we have people to chat with in local - and plenty of reds to shoot at because they always come roaming in Providence because their NBSI space is so bloody boring and devoid of targets.\n\nDrawback: come to providence as a red, you're going to get blobbed. :( Sadly we currently lack proper small gang skirmishes.\n\nThe way I see it, is that NBSI is just an easy position to take, if it isn't a friend kill it. Simple, not difficult to understand, do you even need to enforce it?\n\nNRDS on the other hand, is a tad more complex, needs some sort of enforcement policy, and repercussions. My question is, actually, how many Sov holding Alliances put forth an effort of NRDS? My hats off to CVA and 'any' others who have an NRDS policy, your taking a more complex and difficult approach to the game."

      "text": "Which Factions Would Be Most Likely To Align In Rebellion?\n\nSinperium\n\nI find the intro movie really fascinating and it's the first time any sort of common bond between differing factions is specifically suggested.\n\nAlong that line, which factions in Rebellion as we understand it would most likely align together and which would be least likely?\n\nAny thoughts and anything in what you have seen so far to back it up?\n\nFor example, it's very clear that each particular factions Rebels and Loyalists are opposed to one another--but hpw does say the Advent Loyalists hatred of the Advent Rebels compare to their hatred of the TEC?\n\nHow do they feel about the TEC rebels?\n\nIt's known the TEC have an anger towards the Vasari for their invasions but they also are repelled by the Advent's \"decadent practices\". Which hatred is greater? Are they equal?\n\nI had come to the same conclusion as Volt_Cruelerz since I read the lore of the Rebellion factions.\n\nThe TEC Rebels basically hate all aliens and want them dead, this makes alliances with either Advent or Vasari impossible, and alliances with TEC Loyalists unlikely as the loyalists would rather sit behind their walls in peace and would not cooperate to offensive campaigns on the Rebel's part.\n\nThe TEC Loyalists, on their part, want the war to end. Right now their strategy is to bunker down and wait until it blows over. If they were to be offered an alliance with the alien races, they would be inclined to accept as it would end hostilities.\n\nThe Vasari Loyalists, while they may be likely to accept alliances, it is in nobody's interest to ally with them as they intend to strip entire star systems clear of any resources and then GTFO. 50 / 50 chance that they would turn on their allies to steal their resources too, or just leave when things get too hot and you need their support.\n\nThe Vasari Rebels however, believe that their salvation lies in the other species and are actively seeking to form alliances with all parties. Obviously alliances with the VL would not work as they'd strip resources from them and their allies and then leave. TR would not be a good candidate either since they want all aliens dead.\n\nThe Advent Loyalists are still hellbent on the destruction of the TEC at any cost, and the conversion of all factions into the Unity. A temporary alliance with the Vasari may be possible in order to concentrate and exterminate the TEC but such an alliance would be risky and short lived, since when the TEC are gone the AL would most likely turn on the Vasari to try to force them into the Unity.\n\nThe Advent Rebels want to ensure the restoration and survival of the Unity. Basically, they want to secure the Unity's place in a balanced galaxy. Forcing others into the Unity would cause corruption, so there will be very few forceful conversion from them. Going to war with others would be controversial to the goal of preservation of the Unity since their defeat would mean the end of the Unity. Based on their defensive tech, it is safe to guess that they would be contempt with settling down in their corner of the galaxy and share it with the other two rather than try to take it all and risk being wiped out or corrupting the Unity in the process. With the abandonment of the desire for revenge, alliances with the TEC Loyalists, who also seek peace, are highly probably. Once these two have allied, accepting the Vasari Rebels' offer for cooperation would be logical, as it would bolster the strength of their alliance against the other factions and increases the chances for galactic peace.\n\nSo basically, the TEC loyalists, the the Advent Rebels and Vasari Rebels would form an alliance to finish off the other threee factions.\n\nThe TEC Rebels, Advent Loyalists and Vasari Loyalists would be unable to form their own alliance since they seek destruction of one another. The Trinity alliance would destroy them one at a time, since their combined forces would easily overcome any of the three's lone forces.\n\nAssuming this happens and they then survive the coming of whatever it is that's chasing the Vasari, they may not remain as an alliance since they would no longer have a common enemy, but I believe that they would at least have peace. None of them desire war. The Advent would continue to develop their culture and technology and accept willing disciples of other factions who now wish to join the Unity of their own accord. The Vasari would finally get to settle down and begin to rebuild their race, 10 000 years of exodus can leave you in quite a sorry state. The TEC would become once again the economic empire it once was, allowing trade with Advent technology, now become available to them and provide aid for the Vasari to rebuild their civilization.\n\n....then the Reapers show up and find out, as they run into star bases and Titans and massive fleets of ships larger than themselves, that they are horribly, monstrously outgunned.\n\nYou people are so overthinking this...the game files give you the answer to your question...\n\nThus far, the game files, the lore, and the intro movie point to only one plausible possibility of cooperation, and that is Advent and TL working under the Vasari to deal with this unknown threat...it ain't an alliance to wipe out \"the other side\" and it isn't a friendship by any means...\n\nIn general, everyone hates everyone...the VR tolerate the other races out of practicality...there is no TL/AR thing going on, and there is no \"uber alliance\" to deal with the other factions...also half the time people use the word \"alliance\" on this thread, they probably should have used the word \"armistice\"...\n\nAs an example, the TL are not going to \"ally\" with the AR...they might sign an armistice and move on to other things but they ain't going to be working together and they sure as hell don't like each other...\n\nExcept that we know that the VR make nice with the other two races. They have access to the supply chains of the TEC and shield tech from the Advent. You are right however that the alliance wouldn't try to wipe out the other factions.\n\nThe Vasari, TL, and AR have no need for war. The VL don't care what happens to everyone else. They just want to run. As for the TL and AR, they have no need for continued conflict with each other. The TEC are still probably disgusted by the cultural practices of the Advent. In fact, the AR are probably worse than before because they are all about purifying the Unity and will sacrifice their own people at will. The VR are still slavers as well. It's not like people are going to like each other, but it would be an alliance, even if a fragile one.\n\nLet's say that the chasers catch up and the three ultimately defeat it. I really doubt that they would resume fighting as soon as the war ended. They'd just want the death to stop and by that time, there would probably be countless times where members of each race would have made desperate attempts to save their allies. At first, it would simply be out of practicality, but over time, a feeling of cohesion would begin to exist. Sure, they still won't like the cultures of the others, but if they're the guys keeping you alive, they can't bethat bad. Over time, this would likely lead to relatively peaceful relations between the factions.\n\nI'm not saying that they'll be friends, but they will be allies. An alliance doesn't mean a pact. It just means that they're on the same side.\n\nThe goal of the alliance is not directly to take out \"the other side\". They are already at war with the \"other side\".\n\nThe goal of the alliance is to have peace and to be ready when the Vasari's doom gets there.\n\nHowever, the TR, AL and VL are getting in the way of that peace, they won't stop attacking, except the factions they had been attacking just tripled in strength via alliance. In order to have peace, the others MUST and WILL be eliminated, it is inevitable.\n\nThey will be forced to cooperate in order to reach their goals, or else nothing will change. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.\n\nAt first, it would simply be out of practicality, but over time, a feeling of cohesion would begin to exist. Sure, they still won't like the cultures of the others, but if they're the guys keeping you alive, they can't be that bad. Over time, this would likely lead to relatively peaceful relations between the factionsTrue for the VL. Seeing the superior forces of an alliance, they would likely choose to leave with what resources they already have.\n\nAs for the AL joining the AR in peace, and the TR doing the same with the TL, it would be a difficult and risky decision. While at peace, both AL and TR groups would still harness hostilities against the other species which could easily create terrorist groups trying to wipe out the others, which could degenerate into civil war and start the whole thing over again.\n\nI'm not saying the Trinity alliance would gladly wipe out the others, but if they do not cease their attacks, it will bring about constant disruption of the preparations for whatever it is that's coming after the Vasari and a strain of the resources alloted to this effect."

When it is done, the mech can destroy buildings with usually one hit, and enemy mechs with a few hits.\n\nUltimate Long-range mech\nTake a Daishi, strip it, and put a Clan Gauss in each side of the torso, one in the center, and one light Gauss on each arm. Put a light laser in each arm, as you never want to get caught with no ammo remaining for your Gausses. Fill the armor as far as you can,\n\nRecommended mech\nUse a Daishi with 6 ER Large Lasers (Group 1); 2 Clan LBX-AC20s (Group 2); Components: LAMS; speed is 51 kph. The rest is armor. Try to fill up the torsos and arms and put the least amount of armor on the legs."

      "text": "So, I've played MW2, 3, Pirates Moon, 4, Black Knight, and Mercenaries. I've even got some of the miniatures kicking around somewhere from the table-top game. Despite my love and long history for mechwarrior, I never learned much about the lore.\n\nCould you help me match each mech to the faction(s) that primarily manufactured and used them?\n\n-Atlas\nHouse Steiner manufactures the majority of Atlases on Hesperus II, while House Kurita and Davion have smaller plants building it.\n\n-Awesome\nGenerally a Marik design, however, the FWL exported a lot of weapons to the LC and DC in the 3050s and 3060s to fight the Clans, so they become pretty common there later. Right now, the ones outside Marik space are usually salvaged.\n\n-Cataphract\nA Liao design initially, but Davion manufactures them while they control Tikonov.\n\n-Catapult\nMostly Liao, though House Kurita uses them too (the -K variant with the PPCs is their design)\n\n-Centurion\nOriginally a Marik design, but that factory went boom in the Succession Wars and so nobody built any new Centurions until the FS had a plant opened in 3012. Originally it was designed to team up with the Trebuchet, actually.\n\n-Cicada\nA Marik design. The plant is on Gibson, though, so once WoB comes a knockin' it kinda becomes theirs.\n\n-Commando\nA signature Lyran machine, like the Zeus or Banshee.\n\n-Dragon\nSo Kurita, it hurts. Well, the variant with the PPC does. The AC/5 version just kinda stings a bit.\n\n-Hunchback\nMarik, Steiner, Kurita and Periphery States all build the Hunchback. It's a very common machine and you'll find them just about anywhere.\n\n-Jenner\nOne of Kurita's three favorite mechs (the others being the Panther and Dragon).\n\n-Raven\nThe Liaoest Liao design that ever Liaoed.\n\n-Stalker\nStalkers are one of those \"all over\" designs. It's built by Steiner and Marik, and it's been exported all over the Sphere. At one point it was the most common Assault Mech in the Inner Sphere.\n\n-Trebuchet\nHouse Marik has no less than three companies building Trebuchets, and they export them to just about everyone at this point in time.\n\nAs far as FRR mechs go, they don't really build their own unique designs right now, but they do have free trade with the DC and LC so they can use mechs from both factions freely.\n\nThanks everyone who helped me piece this together. I was trying to get a feel for the style of each faction (because I don't really empathize with any of the factions that I remember) so that I could be historically accurate, and pilot the mechs I love. So far Marik seems to be the best fit for me.\n\nMost likely third-hand salvage at this pointy. Marik had a PPC shortage and didn't want to spare them until the Clan Invasion deal for arms sales helped them with that problem. They start showing up more once the FWL opens arms trade, but not yet. Still, it could be captured via salvage in a fight with Liao, then that unit fights Davion, who salvage it again. Gonna be a pretty rare sight there, though any faction can likely field one or two of ANYTHING just because of the salvage factor.\n\nTo use a TCG metaphor, a mech built in only one House is common there. It's going to be uncommon for anyone they sell to. The Houses that have borders will have it be rare there, while other Houses that don't border them would have it be ultra-rare.\n\nA Panther taken by a FedSun pilot, who was then stationed in the Capellan March, who lost it to a Cappie, who in turn sold it to a Marik based mercenary, who abandoned it on a rock out in the Periphery, and was then salvaged and refitted by ComStar. Ultra rare with holographic casing.\n\nSome variants are more common in one House army than another, for example the Raven RVN-3L (the \"stock\" model) is most definitely a Liao 'Mech, but the Federated Suns captured a number of them in the Fourth Succession War, and not having the technology to replace the electronics warfare suite, simply replaced it with a large laser (the RVN-2X), thus, 3L's are almost exclusively Liao, and 2X's are rarely found outside Davion forces.\n\nLC: Heavy/Assault. Slow, thick armor designs. Comes from a general defensive doctrine in warfare\nFS: Medium/Heavy. Has love for autocannons.\nCC:Light/Medium. Masters of electronic warfare\nDC:Light/Heavy.Jenner/panther/dragon. Mechs tend to be stand alone designs (They aren't meant to be paired with another design)\nFWL: No focus in mech weight that i see. Loves missiles"

      "text": "What are the typical scams we should be aware of ?\n\nI know that CCP made it a rule that scaming ofthers was part of the game, and some people make a great deal of efforts to always come with news ideas.\n\nCan someone list typical \"scams\" you can think of ? So we can compile a list for everyone not to get fooled ?\n\nHere is an example : People often advertise for \" Navy Issue\" and high discounted prices (or even sometimes at regular price). But you should read TWICE the contract, because they basicaly put inside a regular ship in there.\n\n6 answers\n\n1) Mis-quoting selling items on contract, like in the question, this usually happens with faction items, like ships or MWD's and BPC's listed as BPO's. Be cautious read through the description carefully for BP's right click and show info, if it has number of runs field its a BPC not an Original.\n\n2.) the Isk game, one of the most obvious scam is this one. someone giving away free isk, or if you send them 100,000 they will send you 100,000,000. This is BS, and if it isn't a Hoaks it is likely someone who has hacked an account selling off the assets of someone else as payback or being mallicious, you don't get a free lunch (unless it's a corp mate or someone you know being generous and footing the tab).\n\n3.) Courier contract scams.\na) the collateral scam, someone puts up a contract with a high collateral, and when you accept it's a piece of pyrite. 3 guesses what happens next, they keep your money.\nb) sometimes connected to a, the end station is in 0.0, and when you arrive you can not dock, and so cannot forfil the contract, they keep your collateral, and in all likely hood blow up your ship.\nc) It's a huge cargo (700,000m3 +) you have to go through low sec to get to destination, pirates are waiting for your shiney freighter.\nd) Any combination of the above.\n\n4.) Major Lowball - This isn't really a scam, more sellers or buyers error, totally legitimate, however I bet it leaves leave you feeling cheated. something worth 250,000,000 is on buy order for 250,000 or you are looking to buy something for 250,000 and pay 250,000,000 instead. Bottom line its easy to do and most common, and can easily be avoided (as all of these can) by common sense and taking the time to read the price/description carefully, also if you are the one putting up a contract you could be loosing a lot of money as someone gets a bargain, someone I know got a moros for 1.2M rather than 1.2Billion because the contractor couldn't type the right number of zero's.\n\nThese are the most prolific ones I have come across, if someone else has others be good to hear them, there are some I'm fairly sure are scams, but can't be 100% so won't post them up.\n\nThanks for reply, maked as \"good reply\". Maybe we could edit and add up other ways people mentioned afterward (so it's easier to read ?)^^\n\nAdding a question : had a guy who mailed me in dodixie last night, about navy issue Battleship (like 100 millions cheaper than current market). 2 months old alt, didn't want to make contract because it wasn't working and had a petition about it… insisted on direct trade.\n\nI actually been up to the trade, and item in window was a megathron navy issue (right clic > show info was ok)… but I got suspicious and cancelled trade.\n\nOn a direct Trade, nothing is a problem as long as you do not click accept before he does. He was probably going to do the UO scam aragaer mentions below. You will see if he does have a yellow tick next to the direct trade if so you are safe as long as you don't have major lag or he has lightning reactions to tick untrade, and change stuff, and tick trade again before you notice the swap and click untrade. If you are in doubt, as for a contract trade and tell him you will front the 10,000 contract fee.\n\nThen there's the Charon/Carbon scam. A Multiple Items contract is created to sell a Charon and a few cheap modules. What is actually in the list of items rather than 1 unit of Charon is 1 unit of Carbon. Given that a sadly high percentage of players have sickeningly bad spelling skills (then/than, loose/lose, etc) I'm sure this one is probably fairly successful.\n\nSometimes also you read too fast, and many players aren't english speaking coutry natives…\n\nRemember that :Someone announces in local that they are selling/giving away any amount of ore (but usually a big one so you need an industrial or freighter).\nThey then tell you to come to the asteroid belt to pick the ore up, but will \"forget\" to contract it to you.\nWhen you have gotten your industrial/freighter you will notice that their ship is not a mining ship, but a pvp one.\nWhen you pick up the ore, you will be marked for aggression, and the player owning the ore will destroy your ship and (sometimes) your pod.\n\nThe player scamming you will not really take your money, but take any modules and cargo that survived the explosion, and force you to buy a new ship and new fittings.\n\nThere are some variations on scams with mis-quoting items on contract.\n\nSeller's bio shows several contracts for a certain item - for example several CNRs. Of those contracts few are real CNRs, while the rest are usual Ravens. The price is the same for all, but you can notice that contracts for real CNRs are closed the same moment as they were issued.\n\nA harder to notice way of replacing a cheaper item with more expensive one. For example selling CN kinetic shield hardener in a contract named CN invulnerability field.\n\nThe extra/missing 0's in the contract price are easier to notice since there is a textual description of that price. However it's harder to notice missing 0's in quantities. So you'll see scammers selling \"cheap\" minerals or missiles.\n\nYet another way of hiding cheap item among expensive ones - contracts of fitted ships or sets of modules. You might see 5 expensive \"real\" items, but the most expensive one replaced with cheaper one. An example here would be a \"set\" of faction implants with one implant replaced with a non-faction one.\n\nA way to make an item seem cheaper then it is in reality - let's assume a certain faction item costs N isk. An auction for that item is created with starting price significantly lower then N. But the very first bet is placed already and it is way higher then N. The possible buyer can see rather low \"starting bid\" and hurry up to place his own bid. At this moment scammer won - he is getting lots of isk, no matter who will actually win that auction.\n\nThere was also a variation of \"send me X, get 2X\" scam which is no longer possible since it required freeform contracts.\n\nAh, yet another scam that came from UO I think. This uses direct station trading. Scammer first shows you the rare item, then closes the trade window and asks you for some extra money or something. In any case when you open the trade screen again you're getting a cheaper version. Good thing here is if you're prepared, you can actually do the opposite way by placing a lot less isk on your second trade - since scammer tries to confirm the trade as fast as possible, he might not notice that you're cheating him now.\n\nWhat saddens me about scams is that while it is a perfectly possible way of earning isk, it could also be used as a way to transfer isk between RMTers. The \"Oh, I've lost my isk to that dude\" will hide any suspicious money transfer. Especially if it was petitioned.\n\nOne friend had a strange one with direct trades : bought whatever caldari battleship from a guy, was supposed to be something like 100 millions.\n\nStrangely enough (my friend was tired and not very sharp that night :D), the guy set up a different price for the item, something like 256 365 123, 12 ISK. That made my friends wallet drop to an EXACT 100 000 000 ISK.\n\nI always wondered if there was some kinda cheat behind this. What are the odds of a trade scammer to scam you from such a precise total that would let you reach 100 millions in your wallet ?\n\nHe did not have a full API key, that's also what I thought. And even so, why would someone bother making this ? He could have ripped him of from 400 millions, why make it such a strange total to lower him to a 100 millions wallet ?\n\nyou want your victim to click \"ok\" asap, typing a long and complicated number doesn't sound too logical…\n\nOne common scam that seems to happen a lot in high population systems starts with the scammer spamming local with posts like: \"Leaving game, giving away all my ISK, send me any ISK amount and I'll send you double the amount back.\" Gullible players send ISK to the scammer, which had no intention of ever quitting the game or sending any ISK back.\n\nSeen this one, I have also seen it used with a patsy who is in reality an alt saying how it's legit and how much he got in local…\n\nI've also seen them actually double the isk when someone sends them 100,000 ISK sort of testing the waters, they think it's real so send 100M or something and surprisingly 200M doesn't come back… Wonder why.\n\nI saw something in Jita once where a guy made a bunch of shuttles and insured them. Next, he put them outside a station one at at time and abandoned the ship. When someone saw a vacant shuttle, they boarded it. At that point he shot the shuttle, added a ship to his kill log and got the insurance for the destroyed shuttle. Haha."

The number next to the bonus ship icons on your galaxy layout in the lobby indicates the number of wormholes which are on that planet. For starters, I suggest picking a planet with only 2 or 3 wormholes. Defending can be tricky when faced with many wormholes.\n\nMore ! - How do you best defend against spire devourer ships ? - How again can you \"manually\" alter the galaxy setup, i.e. move systems ?\n\n1) Maws, right? One possibility: you can try to pop them ASAP with Bomber starships or Plasma Siege starships. 2) Alt-right click on the galaxy map and switch to \"Galaxy Layout ->My Layout\". Shift-left-click and drag the planets.\n\nSome units are immune to repair; it should say so in their tooltip. For example, Spirecraft Shield Bearers are immune to repair. Other units are so expensive to repair that engineers won't automatically repair them. There is nothing you can do about the first issue, but you can get around the second by increasing the CTRLS setting for the repair threshold called something like \"Engineers do not assist large projects\". There is a text box you can put a number in. The larger the number, the larger the ship/structure your engineers will repair automatically. A value of 0 tells them to repair anything. Use with caution.\n\nwelcome to the forums =) Don't worry about posting After Action Reports of low difficulty games, there are still plenty of people who enjoy reading them (including me). Plus it's a great way to ask more experienced players for advice, in case you get stuck =) As for the color issue... I wouldn't know why it has been programmed the way it is, so I'll leave that one up to the devsThere's currently a discussion about a more obvious 'this is the wormhole you're going to be attacked from' visual.

Excellent for finding minefields and the like. The other time you typically want them is for their sniper flare abilities to protect your fleet if you're getting hammered by the AI with those ship types. The other aspect is very cheap to upgrade to level 2 if you've used up all your fleet-ships doing picketing and don't want to spend the K on III ships yet.\n\nQuote\n\n-\n\nHold down CTRL and they'll pop up on top of the local defenders.\n\nQuote\n\n- when constructing engineers using shift-v, they auto-assist/fly once ready. when building cleanup or rebuild-drones using shift-v (or normal v) they dont enter auto-roaming mode. bug ?\n\nI've never seen this happen unless there was nothing in need of repair. Cleanups really do nothing, they need a review, rebuilders are pretty much all you need. But if there's nothing for them to FRD repair, they won't typically get moving. They don't repair ships, btw, they repair destroyed turrets, minefields, stuff like that. Anything that leaves scrap behind. They get it back to 50% built and then they have to reconstruct themselves to be operational."

Haven't seen anything else wrong so far on the superfluous side, but I'd like to see the tables be made more user-friendly later on, even if 99% of the people who'd look at the tables would be hardcore number crunchers. :pD.\n\nBasically the Golem loses health such that after the self attrition time, the Golem would have 0 HP left if it started at 100% and was not repaired during the time at all. However Golems also have a minimum of 1 hp, so they don't die because you forgot to turn them off and outside of repair, until a single AI ship hit thems. Even AI ships that have a 0 multiply versus the hull type, still do 1 damage to it an pop it. (As I discovered watching Dysons kill a AstroTrain, they take forever as they have a 0 multiplier versus it hull type, but those 1 do add up.)\n\nSelf attrition damage is also not like normal damage, so if you have a Mobile repair station/engineer/Fortress and assist large projects set high enough( I think you need that ), they will remain more or less topped off if you have the resources to spare.\n\nAs for the three types in the data files. You have the EXO wave Golems that attack, the Golumite AI and the Human Golems. I suggest that you use the Human Golems stats and make a section that notes how they are different for both of those, if they are, but I think the main difference is a lot less HP and that is about it.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to make this clear, Human ones are not immune to repair, I don't know about the AI ones however as I have only seem them in EXO waves flying at me, and I am too busy trying to kill the group of 3 or 4 with there little Hunter Killer buddies to see if they are immune to repair or not.\n\nWas more looking for the number of targets each ship boosts. I know it's capped but no clue how many.\n\nI honestly don't know; I didn't set it up.

(Props to Darius McClever)\n\nThis allows them to travel fast enough to catch nano cruisers and whatnot while not running their cap dry with a MWD at the risk of being shut down by a scram. They also have the ability to tank a bit, but they won't be as fast as an inty.\n\nECM!\n\nNO MORE CHANCE BASED ABILITY TO STOP YOUR ENEMY FROM DOING EVERYTHING!\n\nThe Solution: Make each ECM have a set jam strength (depending on whether it's racial or multispec) and each ship a set sensor strength. We already have this, but instead, now the ship WILL be jammed if the total jam strength applied to it goes higher than its total sensor strength, but WILL NOT be jammed if it is too low. Make sure to re-work the jam strength and sensor strength numbers so this isn't too overpowered/underpowered. NOTE: Ideally, they would be re-worked so it takes one max-skilled falcon to permajam a frig-cruiser, and two or more for BCs and battleships.\n\nNow it won't be as \"HAHAHA you're in hull, oh **** I've been jammed for 20secs by a single ECM drone, now he's going to kill me.\"\n\n-------\n\nThat's all I could think of on the spot. Thoughts? Suggestions? Improvements?\n\nOriginally by:Ninetails o'Cat1. No. The Sacrilege is intended to be a short range active tanking boat IIRC, and losing the armour resist bonus is far too big a sacrifice for that.\n\n2. Maybe, I'd rather have an armour amount bonus, but I'm strange like that. Or even a Hybrid ROF bonus.\n\n3. See the many, many threads about this.\n\n4. Meh, maybe\n\n5. No, just lose some of the drones and it will be far more reasonable.\n\n6. Just move a high to a mid, no turret changes.\n\n7. AFs don't fit an afterburner because of fitting constraints, but more normally because they are thought to preform better with a AB/warp scram combination.\n\n8. Hell no, that's how it used to work, and it was worse than now.\n\nI don't find the Sac to be too great of an active tanker. Slapping reps on it means less damage mods, giving it similar damage to the Myrmi, which has a better active tank.\n\nAbout the rockets, yes, I know, there are other threads. But if my list of fixable things didn't have such a major issue, I'd also be getting flamed, no?\n\nAs for the Dramiel, losing some drones would not fit in with the whole RP thing. Angel ships are a cross between Minmatar and Gallente - Minmatar with speed and ACs, and Gallente with larger-than-normal drone bays. If the Dramiel has no drones, then players theoretically shouldn't have a reason to train Gallente frigate.\n\nAnd finally, on ECM... D'oh, you're right, good point. Have you any other solutions while I mull it over?\n\n@ Darius: It's not because the Dramiel is \"impossible\" to kill, it's just because it's so much mmore powerful than the other frigates.\n\nPeople \"flying\" active Brutixes doesn't necessarily mean it's a good idea. Youtube isn't working for me atm, so I can't verify anything about those videos. Obviously, a rep Brutix is going to kill some things, but does that mean it's on par with other BCs? Not necessarily.\n\nAnd yeah, I forgot about that proposed AB bonus. I suppose it would be cool if they implemented that."

Like the wardec shield \"system\" , apparently a blatant abuse of mechanics according to some \"pirates\".\n\nNo, you're confusing two rather different things here.\n\nThe problem with allowing decshields is that it renders certain highsec property completely safe that shouldn't be safe GGv most notably POSes GGv which means that, through poorly thought-through (and completely unnecessary) policy, they've broken a couple of rather important gameplay mechanics and as a result broken a part of the industrial economy.\n\nPirates don't give a crap about wardecs; proper industrialists do.GG#If you're not willing to fight for what you have in GkmvGkm you don't deserve it, and you will lose it.GG%\n\nMercenaries don't care about POSes GGv their employers (who wanted that POS killed) do.

You'll love care and bears, you'll adapt to society better. Work brings mind in order. People may only volunteer to enter corfac to repay debts to society. Otherwise they never get sec status back.\n\nThat is essentially the same as running missions or killing NPC pirates to lift sec status. The issue is that clever players have figured out how to raise their sec status quicker than CCP originally intended for it to rise.\n\nIMO, outlaws (-5 sec & lower) should be freely pod-killable with no repercussions from Concord. While this won't \"fix the problem\", the constant stream of high-ISK-value clone losses and/or SP losses might discourage the behavior... assuming one of us \"carebears\" has the balls to lock & shoot a pod.\n\nI thought anyone -5 and below was pod-killable without concord intervention, or has this changed?\n\nPosted - 2011.12.17 01:44:00 -\n[45] - Quote\nMy idea is that suicide ganks on NPC corp characters should grant a significantly lower sec status hit than suicide ganks on player corp members. Mining while in an NPC corp makes you immune to wardecs, the 11% tax doesn't apply to you - NPC corps should not be \"shelters.\"\n\nI honestly don't understand why this is such a debate... It's not as if there are massive gank squadrons flying around ganking every hulk or freighter on undock. We are all playing the same game right?! Every ship I undock I know is at risk of being lost.\n\nGood point. But it does bring up the question is it normal gameplay or just CCP sanctioned griefing?\n\nThe fact that it is CCP santioned means it is not griefing, and thus it is normal gameplay.\n\nGenerals4 wrote:After reading the thread on why people suicide gank, the obvious answer...\"because they can\"...doesnt really address the question.\n\nApparently there are advantages and disadvantages involved in doing so.\n\nThe question here is, currently with present day EVE mechanics, do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages? And if so how can it be better balanced so as to discourage it.\n\nYour thoughts/ideas?\n\nSo, just in case you were really looking for an answer, here goes:\n\nThere are a few key groups of players that suicide gank and they are focused around various ideologies; here's a quick breakdown of what I think those are, and an in depth review of the most important ones:\n\n[in no particular order of importance]\n\n1. Players who do it for profit. Pirates essentially. 2. Players who do it for \"the lulz\". Because they can. 3. Players who are attempting to control resources with no other tool to do so. (killing NPC Corp miners in high sec ice belts for example) 4. Players who are trying to disrupt RMT and botting operations.\n\nHmm, that was a lot shorter than I thought.\n\nLet's address the most trivial reasons first (in order of magnitude/importance, least to greatest): Players who do it for fun- enough said. Some players just like to annoy other players \"because they can\". Players who attempt to disrupt RMT operations. Do they really think they're changing anything on a larger scale? I doubt it. Players who are attempting to control resources with no other recourse- this is the first \"real\" reason here, but it's still less important overall than the best/final reason: PLAYER PROFIT.\n\nSome more detail on why players suicide gank for profit:\n\nBasically, it's CCP's fault that suicide ganking is as prevalent as it is. CCP has gone to *great* lengths to deter suicide ganking, with little real effect, and indeed it has only continued to grow in popularity. The reason why is simple: CCP is doing a terrible job of making \"carebear\" wealth accessible to PVP centric players.\n\nPlayers, and specifically pirates, always go where the money is. \"Back in the day\", there was little suicide ganking (I can remember chasing Iteron Vs fitted with Local Expanders worth over a hundred million ISK in expanders alone lol!). The reason being is because the vast majority of the wealth was in 0.0 and before Warp To Zero (WTZ) was implemented, there was plenty of opportunity to attack ships while traveling. Oh, did I mention stupidity like Jump Bridges and Jump Freighters didn't exist either? If you wanted to haul massive amounts of resources anywhere you had to engage in huge freighter ops that took a lot of coordination and involved a lot of risk. Good times. Then CCP introduced WTZ and further streamlined (read: removed all need for) logistics.\n\nAll that the above changes managed to do was reduce the window of opportunity for players (and pirates in particular) to access other player's wealth via PVP. Currently, the only reasonably reliable way to do so now is through suicide ganking in high sec space. The killers will go where the money is. Since CCP insists on allowing all the hyper rich carebears to live out their entire existence in high sec, the hunters have to adapt. And adapt they have.\n\nCCP has *REPEATEDLY* nerfed the process by doing everything from decreasing Concord response times to adding in stupid pop-up windows to annoy and deter would-be high sec pirates. Clearly it hasn't worked.\n\nWant to actually decrease suicide ganking? Push the same ultra-concentrated wealth into an area where it's more readily accessible by PVP players and you'll see a rapid decrease in the number of suicide ganks. Otherwise, it will only continue to escalate.I'm a pirate in a pirate's body-Death is nothing, but to live defeated and inglorious is to die dailyVery well explained. Pitty that not a single bear will read it with an open mind because bad people are bad and how dare they play one of the pillar roles in this game.\n\nTo me high sec suiciding for profit is the truest form of piracy there is. Plundering the shipping lanes and all that.\n\nAnd suiciding random people is just damn fun when you can't be arsed playing long or can't make time. Or simply can't be arsed with the tedium in every other awsum, honorable form of PvP.\n\nAll that just doesn't fit into the little closed minds that just want to do their grind and expect everyone to act like little npcs and any act of interference with their game is griefing.\n\nOnto the other OP point, cons of suicide ganking...listening to dumb people explaining why it \"should be removed\" and even dumber people that go out of their way to call high sec pirates cowards. It can't be that they just do the job they want and don't give a crap about what YOUR ideals are.\n\n... a severe secloss after shooting a ship that got CONCORDed, because the bounty pod isn't free to shoot.\n\nIn my thread, where i asked to make pods with GCC legal targets, CCP SoundWave approved of that and wrote he will bring this into the game. It's not much of a change, but it helps people like me big time and it makes sense, too.\n\nSadly, there's no \"when\" to that, so i have to keep seccing up every time i shoot a pod with a high bounty that's not flashy ...Inappropriate signature removed.

It's merely a use of mechanics to make it harder to be griefed. Just like using aggression mechanics in a dodgy way is a mean to make griefing easier. What bugs me is that using mechanics in dodgy ways to increase griefing is right while the opposite is somehow a \"Gamebreaking exploit\". And sure if CCP classifies it as an exploit than it is , but seeing as how the dec shield lost that status it isn't anymore and the whining is just as justified as the whining about any pro-griefing use of certain mechanics. It doesn't mean the mechanics cannot be changed in a way or an other but all the whining sometimes comes off as pathetic in my opinion.-Death is nothing, but to live defeated and inglorious is to die daily"

      "text": "We had a discussion this weekend at Celesticon (Bay Area, California) about early jumping.\n\nThe broader version is with Helo / Gaeta in play, should you be jumping early, risking 3 population, as much as possible.\n\nOn Helo's turn, he gets a reroll. Gaeta gets a reroll on any turn. And of course, there is Strategic Planning (+2 to roll) and Calculations.\n\nIf it's Helo's turn (or any turn when Gaeta playing), with no Strategic planning, 54% chance of success, 1.7 loss of population avg. (8.5 in 5 jumps).\n\nIf it's Helo's turn AND you have Gaeta playing, 58% chance, 1.3 Pop avg, (6 in five jumps).\n\nAnd Strategic and it looks really good, 75%/.75/3.75 and both is 87.5%/.37/1.9.\n\nI still think Helo or Gaeta alone, no Strategic Planning, is not a great risk if you are not in an otherwise tight spot (swarmed by ships, short on cards, etc).\n\nOf course, the other risk factor is if a cylon is in play. Not so much for a Helo un-Strated roll, but if Gaeta is a Cylon and refuses a re-roll, if a promised Strategic never shows, etc. Of course, you DO jump either way. And with Gaeta, you are likely in Exodus and may not get to jump 3 as fast as you want!\n\nWell, to arrive at a general principle on the issue would be tough. Assuming all players are known to be human it sounds like the fleet is paying, over time, one population per jump to save one turn (roughly 1.5 lost each time vs. 0.5 if you were jumping on the next round). So the question becomes whether the skipped turn was likely to cost resources in excess of one population, and that obviously depends on board conditions.\n\nThe thing that complicates matters significantly is the question of loyalty though. If Gaeta or Helo are cylons, they're likely to reroll successes into failures, ditto the shifty player promising Calculations. In short, any decision to hang 3 of a resource on a single die roll is likely to invite shenanigans. If it's me doing it, fine; I know my own loyalty. But if there are multiple players of unknown loyalty being depended upon to help out with the plan, the statistical calculations of their loyalty need to be factored with the ones you provided above. It seems to me that those factors make the proposition less attractive as a general rule.\n\nI think the decision to jump early depends heavily on the status of the Cylon Fleet and the amount of distance you have already traveled. Pop is a tricky resource since, generally speaking, you cannot recover it at all. You can sometimes mitigate Pop loss with Political Leaders and Pilot trickery, but risking 3 Pop unnecessarily is a bit of a gamble. I feel that FTL should only be used at the -1 spot in the early game; even if there is a Cylon out there, Humans should still have plenty of cards to pass skill checks and its relatively easy to spot Cylon attempts to blow a skill check. Theres also plenty of players available to fix the ship, shoot down raiders, etc. (Though I guess by that logic then theres more players who could have a Strategic Planning too). Theres no need to risk a Cylon meddling with the -3 Pop attempt, especially if its Gaeta who has a much better chance of screwing you on FTL and still being able to reveal (since Helo can only use his ability on his turn, you'd have a full round in which to brig/airlock, before it gets back to him again).\nOnce you reach mid-game things change a bit and by then I think you should be using FTL at the -3 spot every time since the game is, imho, much more weighted toward a Cylon victory during the latter half. At that point the -3 spot is worth using even if Helo/Gaeta/SP isnt available since you have at least one Cylon actively working against you, cards are more valuable, theres a big Cylon Fleet outside, etc. We developed a relatively workable XO strategy of pounding the Engine Room and FTLing first chance to race for the end.\n\nThe trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it. -Terry Pratchett\n\nFor me, every turn taken is one more turn for the Cylons to hurt me (provided of course that I'm human) and I'm usually focusing on Distance rather than jumps, but I see the benefit in dropping two turns every \"spool up\". take exception to this reasoning. You have no guarantee of what ships will activate if you stay just like you have no idea what you'll roll if you leave. You're not avoiding gambling by replacing in your calculations the roughly 75% chance of losing 3 population to FTL and the roughly 45% chance of raiders activating with a 100% chance of each. You're just doing bad math.\n\nAs for your subsequent point though, about the folly of saying \"-3 pop doesn't kill us right now\" when it's likely to start the bleeding on something that'll wind up fatal later, I agree I've seen that mistake made more than once, and by players who should know better.\n\nI'm just saying that if the two of us were debating whether or not to jump early, even with you assuring me the math is on our side (to borrow from SGU: \"I've run the numbers\"), I'd still feel better knowing the plan was worth it with the assumption that the pop loss was certain.\n\nI'm assuming we'd be considering other factors like centurions, civvies, closeness to the end, etc.\n\nIf there was a suggestion to jump early with empty space because we have pop and the numbers look good, I might ask what color curtains do you want in your brig. <- This happened to me once; the argument was that if was pretty safe and that we should jump at the chance to deny the Cylons \"two free turns\"."

So far most of the people I have run across in eve are scumbags. They spend their days roaming space looking to ruin your day.\n\nThis sounds like the ramblings of someone who expects WoW-like behaviour (themepark mmo) in EVE-Online (darwinistic sandbox mmo), speaking from over half a decade of experience: People in EVE come in all types, there are scumbags running around, you can bet on it, just as in real life and just like in real life when something's too good to be true it usually is now all that being said the type of bonds you form with people you do connect with in EVE are strong, it will take a very long time to make these bonds as trust is a precious commodity in EVE but once made you can damn well expect them to cross the cyberspace barrier into the real world without much (if any) difficulty.\n\nEVE online itself isn't that extraordinary, it is the community and the player driven side of things which sets it apart and you like a game where after the initial grind (which can take 1-2 months if you know what you're doing, a -beep- lot longer if you don't) you can choose your path (indy,pvper,pve,trader,etc,etc) and if down the line you wanna switch to something else it is easy to (you need to cross train skills but speaking as someone who can fly most tech 3 cruisers, tier 3 battleships and a good portion of end-level industrial ships you can do it relatively easily to get your feet wet and if you want more you can go nuts) after which you can choose which player-driven route you go, is it lawless 0.0 space where the scumbags usually rule and tears are shed over systems and expensive ships lost, is it enigmatic wormhole space where predictability is never the name of the game and where one wormhole could open up your system to a whole lot of pain -shakes angry fist remember when the Narwhals last paid him a visit-, is it low sec, the veritable wild west of EVE (what with inferno things look to be picking up in it again with people having to resort to smaller, faster throwaway ships in pvp situations) or the PVE-centric (but with savy PVP action) high-sec areas where exploration, industry and \"questing\" are the name of the game.\n\nReport this post\n\nJust so you know, people in eve are not really all that helpful. Unless you want helped out of your effort, ships and money. Most of them are in fact scum of the universe.\n\nIt took me a while to figure out that those people aren't really scum. They're, in essence, roleplaying scum. A large part of EVE involves baiting people into doing stupid stuff so you can fight them or take their money. It's a core part of the game. All of the people that I had one on one interactions with were really nice and very helpful. However, if I was competing with them in any way (even if I was unaware at the time) then they instantly became smack-talking jerks. They have to. If they didn't find a way to make me mad then I'd probably realise I'd lose any engagement and just run away.\n\nI think this is a large part of what's good about the game. Where else can you completely become the mugger, con-artist, or back stabbing turn-coat to such an immersive degree? Everyone has a part of themselves that secretly wants to do bad things. What's wrong with having a place where you can role play those urges out and really explore them? It's why I think it's so important that EVE is openly lawless and does next to nothing to inhibit this behavior. Everyone who logs on should know before they start that EVE is a place to role play being a bad person. That doesn't mean the people that do this ARE bad people.\n\nSo, yes, if a newbie wanders into the wrong part of the galaxy there will be \"bad people\" hanging around waiting to shoot him and take his stuff. Yes, if a gullible person trusts a stranger in a sketchy deal they're probably going to lose even more stuff. Yes, the community gets a kick out of newbies falling for the same cons and baits over and over again. However, the community also gets that these things must remain IN-GAME! The Chairman of the Council of Stellar Management was booted out of office and temp banned largely because of community outcry over some careless comments where he, at EVE Fanfest, encouraged players to grief an allegedly depressed/suicidal player's toon. That's crossing the line. That's not roleplaying anymore.\n\nIn his defense, the chairman was incredibly drunk and apologized profusely the next day. But it does point out a distinction that simply isn't there in other MMOs. You can pretend to be a bad person in EVE and do bad things. The behavior is encouraged because it makes the EVE universe an edgier, more dangerous place. It also reveals that PvP in EVE is more about getting other people to make bad decisions than it is about you making good decisions did did\n\n\n\nIs me.\n\nIs that alpha fleet?

However, the Heavy Plasma Torpedoes just slice effortlessly through my shields and the ship explodes - again and again and again ......\n\nHow are we supposed to complete the Mission?\n\nI am a Captain 30, my ship is similar to the Defiant and the enemy is a Reman D'Deridex.\n\nEvidently Worf is a much better Captain than me.\n\nThe Mission is supposed to be for a Captain 30. Am I supposed to go away and explore some uncharted systems to gain a few more levels?\n\nD'Deridexes are a pain in the rear, particularly at lower levels. The number one tip I can give you: Get polarized hull I. Activate it when he kicks the tractor beam on, because I've found that almost always is when he fires several Heavy Plasmas in a row.\n\nI'm afraid your ship isn't that tough defensively - Escorts are probably the most fragile; they make it up in being the most damaging.\n\nTrying to attack the sides might also help. If all else fails, ask a friend to do the mission with you (make sure you're the team leader and he balances his level with yours)\n\nDon't stay in the forward arc, stay to the D'Deridex's flanks, then he has no tractor beam, no plasma torpedoes.\n\nWhat the above poster said, Polarize Hull and also Attack Pattern Omega are also really helpful for getting out of the tractor beams, and thats really when the trouble starts, because once you are tractored, the torpedoes come a 'flyin.\n\nalso try and avoid using fire at will (if you have it on a boff) until he fires the heavy torps. be careful here cos he often fires of a single to fool you and then the next cycle (while your faw is still in cooldown) throws out the 5 in a row that are killers.\n\nGenerally speaking, ship type determines more than captain type in regards to overall tanking. Cruisers are fantastic at tanking, Escorts have a really hard time, and sci can tank well if they want, or they can load up with utility spells.\n\nThat said, Engineering captains are better at tanking than non-engineering captains flying the same ship, no matter what type of ship. Tactical captains are better at doing damage than non-tactical captains flying the same ship, and sci...uh...gets subnucleonic beam."

      "text": "Discussion: Slicing\n\nthere is quite a fuzz (more like alot of whine) going over slicing crew skill (proffesion that \"crafts\" boxes with credits) and its nerf these days. Being someone who did not roll Slicing in a first place, I'd like to know your oppinion regarding this crew skill. Is it really that of a issue? I saw at least 6 whine topics on official forum each dealing with serious nerf. IMO its just another proffesion, players just like the \"no work-big reward\" factor (and like to whine about stuff they dont like). Hit me\n\nRaising a standard crafting skill is a significant credit sink - to the point where I couldn't even afford my speeder training at level 25 because I was keeping my crafting paced with my level. Slicing on the other hand (I took it on an alt who has just been doing pvp so I would send 2 companions out during matches) was making people hundreds of thousands of credits net of the mission cost. I had 150k on my alt with 300+ skill and she is level 22. That's just not right. A bit of profit is fine, but slicing's main perk is supposed to be mission discoveries, cybertech patterns, and augments which come from nowhere else. I find the whining pretty unfounded; people are just mad either because they had their easy money flow taken away or because they didn't exploit it before it was nerfed\n\nI have slicing on one character and I'm fine with it either way. I like it a little more as it is now, I keep telling myself I'd rather have it more in the middleground between the two versions, but I don't actually believe that myself. In a way, it was the same as any other profession in that time = results, but it was unclear if the cash available from slicing would ever have had a significant impact on the economy. If you've put any decent time in the game you'll notice that everything is a credit sink, and time spent playing is a way to get credits to fuel that sink.\n\nOverall I think the rewards from slicing may have been just a little bit high, but probably not too much so considering that cash is the primary reward for having the skill. Now if I was to make the skill from scratch I'd probably make augments the primary mission type, and schematics the longer more expensive mission type, with cash boxes as rewards from criticals rather than vice-versa.\n\nPreviously slicing made solid money every time you sent a companion out on a slicing mission (assuming you picked rich or bountiful cash boxes). Slicing still makes some money, just not as much as it used to, in fact it barely breaks even until you crit and get a nice payout. The primary benefit to the lowered rewards is that I don't feel beholden to log over to that character on every 30 minutes because I have to have slicing missions queued up or else I'm losing money. Another nice bonus is that slicing still directly rewards you with cash while you are out adventuring and come across a slicing node, now you are rewarded for playing the game rather than logging in and queueing missions.\n\nThe Slicing nerf came in the form of missions, not the dropboxes and stuff we slice as we mission. So, for me (level 15), it hasn't made any difference at all. In fact I think they've upped the number of dropboxes (or whatever they're called). I see the stars on my map all the time and hightail it over to Slice it. I currently have 23K and have spent 5K on upping my storage space. So, at level 15, I've made 28K with missions and Slicing.\n\nI got 400 slicing. Yes, it seems that the critical factor has been nerfed, but i still EARN 5-600 credits pr box.. say 1400 to do the mission and i get 2000 in the box..\nI get a few criticals and get mission and a box containing up to 10k. So its still a money maker, just slower. But a 50 i have 5 companions out at a time, so no stressing =D\n\nI haven't actually done the math, but the way I see it is if (slicing credits earned - cost of mission < another profession's average GTN value of items gained - cost of mission) there's a problem. The value of items on the GTN will increase as more people get to higher levels and the market is flooded with more and more credits. If they're striving for equality at this point slicing will be entirely pointless as this game ages (unless they constantly update it).\n\nI feel like I've been doing very good with slicing, but I suspect if I had a different gather profession on that character instead and sold everything I've gotten I would do similarly well.\n\nExactly, the value of Slicing is heavily dependent on the cost of items on the GTN. A character with Slicing and a crafting skill does not have the ability to gather all of their own mats, and is thus dependent on purchasing them.Slicing will continue to be a thorn in Bioware's side, and I believe it was a very bad design decision. A fixed income profession will never be able to be completely balanced with the market-based incomes of other professions.\n\nIf a player has a easy way of getting credits then hallelujah! Before the game was officially released I was already getting \"gold\" spammers during pre-release. Maybe this will reduce the # of \"businesses\" that try to make real $ trying to sell in game credits.\n\nit seems to be at a proper lvl right now. As it was before, I had 30k creds by lvl 20 and was spending willy nilly on whatever i saw, if I wanted advanced lvl crafting mats, I just shouted out to the poor shlub who was spending 1000 credits per mission in underworld trading payed him pocket change, and he was glad for it.\n\nbefore it wasn't really a choice, you skipped mission skills, took slicing, and bought what you wanted. Now hopefully the bonus gather mission drops will be the real value of slicing.\n\nthe easier it is to get Credits, the more you encourage gold farmers, as they spend even less time and effort gathering their wares. The easier it is to make money, the more money it takes to buy anything, the more money you need to make, the larger market the farmers have.\n\nThe only way to combat gold farmers is aggressive bans against not the sellers themselves but the accounts they do business with.\n\nI don't really understand all the whining about this either. Slicing isn't the only mission crew skill that gives lockboxes (or should I say credit boxes) and the main things about it (at least for me) are the augments and mission discoveries/tech schematics.\n\nThat being said, I didn't have Slicing before the nerf so I'm not swimming in sliced credits... =P\n\nPicked up Slicing on my first alt though, other crew skills on him being Cybertech and Scavenging. On main I took Biochem+Bioanalysis+Diplomacy and been struggling with Diplomacy as it seems pretty much the opposite of pre-nerf Slicing: spending way too much credits on the missions with not much in return. But eventually I plan on sticking with these skills on the two chars and buy the blue/purple materials needed for the better Cybertech crafts from GTN (or make another alt for Underworld trading hehe)Or have scavenging on both characters and have even more mats!\n\nNo matter how you look at it slicing will always have to be compared against other gathering professions on the basis of what the items are worth on the auction house.\n\nBesides, it was way too \"op\" ...Having +200k credits at lvl 20 is just wrong, atleast if its your first char.\n\nThe thing is, that will be entirely possible for all the other professions to do once the economy gets going. Just like in WoW where you could farm low level mats and sell them on the AH to 60s/70s/80s/85s who were willing to pay a disproportionate amount of gold for them, here you can do the same and probably even more efficiently because you can do it all from the safety of the Fleet.\n\nExcept there is risk involved in selling things on the AH versus simply opening a box for credits. \"entirely possible\" is not \"Guaranteed\", which is what pre-nerf slicing was.\n\nSlicing is still the sole source of augments. Why does this keep getting glossed over? It's still profitable with world spawned lockboxes which involves actual gameplay instead of credits per hour per companion while you pvp or afk\n\nI'm not saying anything about its profitability. Every one of my points has been about balance. Credits in lockboxes are fixed. Market prices are not fixed. There is an inherent problem in trying to balance the two. A low population server will have fewer credits in the economy, thus driving the relative value of lockboxes up. A server with high population will have the opposite issue. There is no way to predict right now what end-game Market prices will be at as the game progresses, so there is no way of knowing whether the current state of lockboxes is in fact balanced or not. The entire system hinges on problematic balance.\n\nSince the nerf, i lose credits, unless it crits and i tend to get 1 crit slicing every 10 or so missions, if its a standard success, if i spent 1400cr on the mission, i tend to get between 1000-1200cr, so it really isn't worthwhile getting now unless its for those recipes.......for the cybertech skill which no one is taking, since there is absolutely no droid parts or ship parts or anything on the GTN.\n\ntaking scavenging, archeology and bio-analysis is not worthwhile either, players just do not want to pay anything more then nothing for materials....players can be cheapskates sometimes.\n\nEitherway, since the slicing, my 400k has gone down to 250k due to upgrading my modules and companion gear, if the slicing nerf isn't reversed, i see myself going broke real soon, or unless bioware severely lower the skill prices, cause 10k per skill is over the top for my liking.\n\nIf you're going broke then stop spending money frivolously, thats what every non-slicer has had to do from the start. I find that skill costs and the like keep going up, but I make money hand over fist while adventuring. I find that my level 35 character makes money faster than my lower level character ever did chain sending out his companions on slicing missions (the good ones, like rich 5).\n\nlol..going broke...like every non-slicer had to deal with already? I couldn't afford my speeder at 25 and I had to stop training skills I didn't use much in the 40's due to the expense of a regular crafting profession\n\nAnyone complaining about the infamous slicing nerf, is a dolt. It was way out of line with the other skills by way of making credits. You had people at level 25-30 with a couple hundred thousand in creds. That's a problem. Bioware fixed it. Don't spend like you're N-rich, and you'll easily have your lvl 25 speeder.\n\nI thought i'd do a little trial of it and record the missions i sent my droid on. I did 12 missions in a row, recording the amount it costs with the amount rewarded. One of the missions came back a failure, but i counted that because it's important. (these were all for lockboxes)\n\nSince it was THAT, that was causing me to lose money, but i guess my level 33 JEdi Guardian can try to hold out with level 27 gear......yep, my repairs are going to be a biatch.\n\nEvery mission box for me is a loss in profit, i would be happy with 50cr per box, but its always atleast -50 and at most -250 credits.....i guess no crew skills, since they are now a waste of time and inventory space, since no crafters want to pay for materials, it seems they can charge stupidly high prices for their stuff, yet we have sell low......yeah, thats fair.\n\nI took slicing on my character the day the \"nerf\" happened. I took it mainly due to all the lockboxes I saw lying around when I was questing on my first toon, so when I rerolled on my the server my friends were playing on I thought why not. That being said I find that the skill is on par with all the others. Missions give out maybe a few more credits than what you paid to send them on, but more often than not I have noticed that I get back just under what I paid for the mission. But, this is where all the lockboxes on the planets come into play.\n\nOn Balmorra (the last planet I was on) I was getting anywhere from 100 to 250 a lockbox that I would get from just walking around. This would cover the loss I just recieved from my mission or just add money to what ever I made. I haven't sold anything that I have gotten from my crits yet, but just from running around and opening up these boxes I am sitting on 50k+ and I am lvl 23 almost 24.\n\nIf people are spending credits on buying gear, I am puzzled as to why. Running flashpoints gets gear that you can mod, so while it might look old you can give it better mods when you progress planet wise using comendation badges on mods from the planet vendors. When I got done clearing all the missions (regular/heroic/bonus) on Balmorra I was sitting on 60+ badges. More than enough to upgrade any gear that didn't get replaced while questing, for both me and my companion.\n\nAll the other gathering professions at the moment you would NEVER send your companions on a mission to get materials or level the skill, as the return/cost ratio is just absurd and totally not worth it, it's there for times when you're missing 2-3 pieces of a given material and don't want to go in the world finding them, but as soon as people start selling materials on the GTN even that isn't going to be viable because the prices there are most likely going to be lower.\n\nSlicing on the other hand, you can send your companions on a mission, get your skill and profit from that the majority of the time AND you're still gathering the lockboxes scattered around in the world. It's just badly designed.\n\nIt wasn't about gaining skill. My skill was far, far beyond whatever foliage or creatures were on the planet I was on. Past Balmorra I don't think I ever saw anything that didn't con grey for bioanalysis. However, without doing bio missions I would never have kept my biochem at pace with my level. I also simply did not encounter enough materials in the wild to continually produce and RE the premium and prototype items so I could reach the artifact quality items. Add to this the fact that the tiers overlap, with items requiring things like grade 4 sample and grade 5 compounds at the same time.\n\nHere's some empirical data(I wish I could tell you the source but it's a second-hand link. However, my gratitude goes to the person that put this together).\n\nMy feeling on slicing is that missions are a decent way to level up and break even (or a little better) but they''re not really a good source of cash after that. I think slicing will still feel like a good choice for people who still spend a lot of their time \"out and about\" maybe doing lots of Ilum dailies or other quests. For people who will mostly stay on fleet at 50 and run FPs or Ops it may start to feel like a wasted opportunity.\n\nIf that spread sheet is correct, it's really not that bad off. Each mission is still averaging above the cost of the mission. Having 5 companions running out and making 400-500 credits every 20 minutes (even 200-300 every 15) or so is pretty good coin.\nAlso it appears as though the some of the lower level ones have a better credit per minute amount.\n\ndrinkdeep said:If that spread sheet is correct, it's really not that bad off.\n\nActually my impression of those numbers were that Slicing is pretty much pointless as a mission skill now. It's good that it breaks even (or makes a very small profit) while levelling the skill but, personally, now I'm at 400 I get so little benefit from sending companions on Slicing missions that I simply won't do it. I'm doing Ilum dailies and still spending time running around the world so it's a decent gathering skill for turning time into money and that's all.\n\nI'm really thinking of dropping it for a mission skill that benefits my main craft.\n\nAs I say, I think it's still a pretty strong gathering skill. My worry is that they've killed it as a mission skill and that's potentially people's main interaction with it after 50. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing for it to be an unprofitable or meagrely profitable mission skill but I'll need to readjust from the way I had been using it.\n\nAsakawa I don't think anyone is going to (or trying to) convince you that it's worth it. You should just drop slicing ;) Also hardly any of the missions broke even or less, most if not all were profitable so I'm not sure how you get that from that spreadsheet!\nImo it's still a decent mission skill in a few ways.\nPurple mission's and cybertech schematics (selling them), gathering boxes and (yes) even missions. 200-300 per companion per run is still pretty good. (Info from the spreadsheet)\nIm making plenty of creds, I'm sticking with it. It may not be over the top like it was before, but it's still making me creds.\n\nI'm not asking to be convinced of anything, just discussing the issues that the change has brought up - for me at least.\n200-300 is not an interesting amount when you have over a million credits and can get a couple of hundred by killing a few mobs. As I said, that's probably okay and the way it needs to be so that people consider taking the appropriate skills but it does take the shine off it somewhat.\n\n(as an aside, I'm actually a little disappointed with Cybertech too (no summons on live! >.<) and seriously considering dropping all three skills in favour of more useful ones.)\n\nIn essence, the whine and cry about the reduction in slicing rewards proves a point to analogy very much like the following:\n\nYou give a child an ice cream. A very BIG vanilla ice cream cone and the child is absolutely loving it. You promised the child that when he/she finishes the ice cream, you have another waiting for them and it will be much tastier and taller. The child finishes the ice cream and the bigger reward allows them to have their hands out eagerly waiting for it.\nThen you decide that it's not fair for the other children and you reduce the size of that child's ice cream cone and the child is left with despair and is very upset.\n\nI think the idea behind it is that when you give something to someone that exceeds their expectations only to find out that it has been taken away to make it fair, that's when you start seeing the outcry of the community.\n\nSlicing helped me very much with my vehicle and at 400/400 I am about to drop it to grab Biochem. Slicing has served its purpose and my alts are soon to follow the footsteps."

Are they keeping thoseMERLIN: we can see how the loss of the shield resistance bonus poses a problem to this hull; we first wanted to get feedback on a possible medium-long range overhaul for that ship, but as people mentioned here, that's very difficult to achieve for a slow frigate or even for any kind of platform using small weapons in the first place. Back to the drawing board!\n\nCAPACITORS: also fair points regarding capacitors, in some cases (Punisher especially) we initially wanted capacitor to be the drawback of these frigates, but it may be quite difficult for them to do their jobs while being affected by neuts. We'll iterate on that.\n\nTORMENTOR: the point of this ship is to give a more all rounded, comfortable hull to use for engagements than the Punisher, which explains the range and quite significantly increased fittings. This is still up for constructive discussion as well.\n\nONLY 5 SHIPS?!: unfortunately for Inferno, yes. We initially wanted to revamp all frigates for this release, however problem is we are lacking Dev power at the moment (I am assigned to other projects as well, and Tallest is playing daddy with his twins) so yep that is lame, but sadly we will have to cope with that for now.\n\nMINING SHIPS & TORMENTOR CHANGES: the plan is to completely change mining ships into more interesting hulls, and possibly add a basic mining role to Rookie ships and/or bit more advanced one for a special ORE frigate. Since we can't do much more than 5 frigates for Inferno, that means the other mining frigates will stay that way until we overhaul them, hopefully to be touched soon after Inferno.\n\nAlso, some players have expressed issues understanding where we are going without having a more accurate picture of the other frigates, allow us to give you a glimpse of things to come.\n\nCOMBAT FRIGATES: have a balanced damage / resilience / speed ratio next to the other frigates. Includes the Tormentor, Punisher, Merlin, Incursus and Rifter.\n\nATTACK FRIGATES: in general faster than the other frigates, with good damage, suited for interception or just damage dealing, but less resilient than combat frigates. Includes the Executioner (turret ship), Bantam (turret ship), Atron (turret ship), Navitas (dedicated drone ship), Slasher (turret ship) and Burst (TBD, possibly drone ship if role doesn't conflict with Navitas)\n\nBOMBARDMENT FRIGATES: classification is mainly cosmetic, not much different role wise than Combat / Attack frigates. Mainly use missiles, speed / EHP between Attack and Combat frigates and depending on their individual purpose. Is made of the Inquisitor, Condor, Kestrel, Tristan and Breacher. Supposedly being split up by two versions, those that are close range based with high damage (rockets) and the others being more of a medium range platforms (and thus light missile based).\n\nSUPPORT FRIGATES: split in two, first, the purely scanning frigates - Magnate, Heron, Imicus, Probe - and EW frigates - Crucifier, Griffin, Imicus, Probe. All need a boost, but their role should not be changed much.\n\nRemember, theses classifications and frigate affiliations are still likely to change, and are mainly used to help us sort them out for now. These are just concept changes still, there will be other discussion threads for them specifically, so don't freak out\n\nIs Ytterbium unorganized or are they actually cutting the Maulus hull? It's the best-looking frigate in the game.\n\nThis is really, really poorly done. They're going to shoehorn the mining frigates into the existing categories so that each race gets a double: Amarr get two good combat frigates, Minmatar get two attack ships, Caldari get two bombers, Gallente get two attack ships. It's going to be a nightmare to balance, it will make it harder to discern role differences between ships, and (most importantly) it's going to confuse new players.\n\nThen halfway through that mess, Ytterbium says he wants to split the bomber category into long range and short range versions. Hey idiot, take the mining frigates you're turning into terrible confusing duplicates and make them paper-thin high-dps autocannon/pulse/blaster/rocket ships. Take all the bombardment ships and give them bonuses for artillery, beams, rails, or light missiles. They'll all still be shitty and we'll still only fly rifters, but then at least new players will be able to tell in what way all these frigates are shitty.\n\ne:\nThey should just cut the mining frigates and save themselves the headache of balancing such a mess. Save the hull models to be Alliance Tournament prizes or something, turn all existing blueprints into rifter BPs. That way each race would have:\nthe good frigate\nthe baby interceptor\nthe baby bomber\nthe baby ewar\nthe scanner\n\nOh man just look at that, you can actually see the role separation. Introduce a single ORE frigate (the baby Hulk) for those poor souls who don't yet know the drudgery of mining.\n\nWell holy shit god fucking forbid you be forced to fit a module to counter another moduleif you do the math it's actually not worth it if the sig isn't already good enough on most shipsWell if even near-perfect ECCM isn't worth fitting over all those other things then doesn't that kind of indicate that ECM actually isn't all that big a balance problem?\n\nWell if even near-perfect ECCM isn't worth fitting over all those other things then doesn't that kind of indicate that ECM actually isn't all that big a balance problem?\n\nsup. i said it before but obv you didn't listen.\n\non most ships it doesn't matter if you have eccm fit or not as you will still get jammed 90% of the time. there are a select few ships that have a good enough sensor strength that it makes a difference. there are fewer ships within this category that can afford to lose a mid/low and still fightBut it's the one EWAR everyone complains about more than all the rest combined, squared, and photocopied in triplicate. The countless fights ruined, ships destroyed, and egos crushed by endless waves of Falcons stand as a living testament to just how dishonorable EVE isThere is very little else more satisfying then catching some pubby trying elite peeveepee in a drag bubble, and then slowly whittling him down with a sabre and a falcon, offering to ransom him at the end, killing him and then mocking him for being stupidTitan pilots just got done saying similar things about their favorite past-time.\n\nTitan pilots just got done saying similar things about their favorite past-time.\n\nYou need to train saracasm detection to at least lvl 4Extenders and trimarks are also exceptions in the game as being the only modules/rigs to not suffer from stacking penalties.\n\nNot fully true. The same goes for shield regeneration and cap modules (being it batteries, rechargers or the PDU's and) and rigs, probably structure bulks won't stack either (not sure but it would fit the pattern of leaving \"hp-buffing\"-modules free of stacking penalties).Clearly a nerf to shield tanking and not the buff to passive targeters we are looking for"

      "text": "watching out for my money, so my first indication was to get the devastators squad, though they had more weapon choices ( i can fire 4 weapons) the predator has heavier armour and could survive much longer. i also fight against alot of tyranid, crons and chaos.\n\nso should i get devastators? or bust more money out to get a predator tank and if so, what variant?\n\nthanks alot guys\n\nWhoever Loves, go to Hell. I want to break Venus' ribs with a club and deform her hips. If she can break me tender heart, why can't i hit her over the head?\n\nGenerally, in their current incarnation, Devs are seen as too expensive for what they do.\n\nHowever, they are a lot more flexible than the predator.\n\nThe predator will take all the anti tank shots, meaning the rhino and dread may survive longer.\n\nIf youre going to be adding more rhinos/armour to the army, then the pred may be the best option, although a dakka pred is about 50/50 effective against the armies you say. useless vs necs, good v nids, and maybe vs chaos, depending if they take mech. The devs will always be able to kill stuff!\n\nAlso bear in mind that the dev boxed set will allow you to give your tacticals weapons other than missile launchers: TBH, against the armies you say, the ML should go in a dev squad, and plasma cans/hvb in tac squads.\n\ni also wanted to add, that i have razorback. i bought that recently cause i knew i was getting a devastator squad.\n\nso Xenith, you prescribe a vindicator instead? iv never used one, i understand the fire power that comes with it but i was also considering the whirlwind instead of a vindi. i hate army building\n\nwell if i took a devastator squad, i would equip it with\n2 heavy bolters\n1 plasma cannon\n1 mulitmelta\n\nfor the pred i would interchange it with either the\ntwin linked las cannons with the heavy bolters\nor\nautocannon with the side sponson las cannons\n\ni like the option of the devs cause against crons, it would be an instant kill wit the plasma cannons and taking out groups of tyranids. the two heavy bolters would be for the anit infantry work against the nids, and the multi-melta to provide any incoming guys, a close work killer if needed.\n\nas i said i bought a razor back last Thursday to accompany the devastators and i would inter change the twin linked hvy bolters to the las cannons and vice versa\n\nif i took the pred\nautocannon with side spons with las cannons, a heavy infantry killer with two las shots useful against zoanthropes and hive tyrants and crons,\n\nor an infantry killer with the twin linked las cannons and the side spons heavy bolter. good just for the nids\n\nbut now Xenith brought up the fact of using a vindicator, if so, i would use the razorback to make one of my tac squads.\nand price wise, i would rather get the whirlwind since it has some nice anti infantry work with the missiles.\n\nso yea uhgh\n\nif that was confusing im quite sorry, ill do a full army list tomorrow\n\nKeep the squad with all the same weapon, or pairs and combat squad them, or have 2 pairs that compliment eachother.\n\nWith devs, vs the armies you fight, 2x plasma cannon, and 2x ml may be best [combat squadded...], with the heavy bolters going into your tac squads.\n\nI dont definitely say do the vindi, I was just suggesting it as an option. Its very good anti infantry, good anti tank, scary , and the same price as a pred.\nAgain, its all about what you like the most.\n\nif you have the points for a dev squad, you could probably get away with a Razorback for your other tac squad (which you say you have already), then a vindicator. They are worth it, especially on 4x4 or 6x4 tables.\nI usually give them a dozer blade. That way, they can chill in some cover. Then, if they get a \"can't shoot\" on them, they back up behind the cover until they can shoot again.\nPoints wise, that would be 40-100 pts for the razorback, so 155-215 total. If you had the points for a dev squad, this should still be in your budget.\n\nNo bastard ever won a war by dying for his country.\nHe won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.\n-George S Patton Jr\n\nMixing weapons in a Dev squad is a BAD idea unless you are going 50/50 and split them into combat squads with each combat squad having identical weapons. (ie two Heavy Bolters in one and two Missile Launchers in the other)\n\nI generally agree with Ten, but as an OLD WOLF, I can say that having a Long Fang pack w/ 2xHB+2xPC and 2xLas+2xML is not a horrible choice. Ranges are commensurate & weapons can compliment each other well, (esp w/ the new blast rules).\n\nIn the 5th ed era and the current SM codex, saves are everywhere and Devs can combat squad. It's not horrible to have 4 different units w/ paired weapons on the table. If you're packing them all together, then it's likely they'll be taking cover saves anyway so 6 shots from the bolters & 2 templates from the Plas should force enough wounds to make them think about where to put them all.\n\nOf course, keeping the entire squad identical makes allocating your own wounds simpler and provides the redundancy you need.\n\nAnd if you're taking MM, just take 4, don't ever mix it up in the group with others.\n\nThoughts on the list: At 1000 points, only having 2 pieces of armor on the table isn't enough to over saturate them with armored targets. The predator with autocannon and heavy bolters would fit nicely into this list, just scrimp in some other places to the the 60 more points you need.\n\nOne thing that makes me nervous about this list is the chapter master who doesn't have a transport so he doesn't have a way to get into combat fast and the terminators don't really either unless they deep strike (which is dangerous). So for higher point levels (like 1500 points), consider getting a land raider crusaider to hold the chapter master and terminators.\n\nI've used devastators in my past marine list and I've never been very impressed with them. They cost a lot of points and aren't mobile. I wouldn't recommend them.\n\nWhy not make the termies assault termies w/ TH+SS, add the chapter master in w/ termie armor & deep strike together. They can make a run move to spread out after they arrive and avoid template fire while SS provide that sweet invul save."

      "text": "about the purchase of the refit ships. As I understand from the description, it states as follows:\n\n\"Purchasing the ship from the C-Store unlocks it for all Vice Admiral characters on the account.\" - extracted from C-Store info.\n\nMy interpretation of the above statement suggests that this will be account-wide. However, what I do not understand is why is this not the case?\n\nMy Tactical VA toon originally got the Defiant Refit from promoting to VA. And I decide to purchase the Galaxy Refit to give it a try, so I spent CP on purchasing it.\n\nNow, I log on to my Science VA, and I find that if I want to use the Galaxy Refit, I need to purchase it again? Now if this is meant to be account-wide after purchase, then this is broken and not working as intended.\n\nThis is a very upsetting development. I would like a Dev to address the following concerns:\n\n1) Are the Retrofitted ships purchases Account-wide as stated?\n\n2) Or are they only for the individual VA characters?\n\n3) Is this only for Emblem purchases or that it includes CP purchases as well?\n\nI'm not sure how many players have the same issues, but I, for one, am definitely not happy about it and would like to have some clarity.\n\nHow were you trying to \"use\" the Galaxy Retrofit on your Science VA? If it's anything like the TOS Enterprise (and I imagine it would be), you need to claim it in the C-Store for each character that can use it.\n\nIf you purchase a Retrofit Ship through the C-Store in this way, it will be automatically placed in your ship list; it will also unlock the Retrofit for your entire account. When an alternative character reaches Vice Admiral, they will be able to claim this C-Store purchased ship from the Ship Requisition NPC. This ship purchase WILL NOT appear under the 'Special Unlocks' tab.\n\nWould just be nice to have a set amount of level ups for a ship from 0-51 vs buying any ship in the C-Store.\n\nExample: Player likes one certain ship, say a T1 ship. As the player levels up, there is added stats and console slots, bridge officer slots, etc, for this player selected ship. This could be accomplished with a set amount of stats from Level 1 to 51, so for major rank promotions, the level increases would be in effect.\n\nI can see the C-Store for fluff items (uniforms, respecs, costume parts etc) but all ships should be avaliable to everone in the game without having to purchase them in the C-Store."

      "text": "I can understand from a balancing standpoint you don't want the 1 ship tanking 50 ships because its godly and whatnot but its countering most of your ability descriptions, aux power to structural 2 can easilly hit 76%, stack it with brace for impact for 55% and throw in a polarize hull or hazard systems for another 15ish and you get a whopping 51%, and thats if you use 3 engineering consoles for resists....\n\nso many abilities increase your resists by this % and that % but those %'s are almost irrelevant as you will easilly hit the 'soft cap\" of 45% and anything passed that barely gets you over 50, maybe 51%. so many abilities can hit that cap by themselves its pointless to even put what %'s they increase since it's irrelevant.\n\nwhats everyone elses thoughts on % resists and shields/armor and soft caps? both now and with the changes coming on tribble?ok so 10000 * (100 / (51 + 100)) = 6662.516556\n\nand 10000/6662.516556 = 50.0934357% damage taken, meaning 49.1ish% absorbed...so really its a big complex formula for getting roughly the same exact number as mitigating actual damage? I think what you were getting at and what the confusion is, is that the % shown on the ships defense screen is actually POST that formula and not PRE like most mmo's do(or used to do if it has suddenly changed in the last year).\n\nIf what is displayed is pre then that formula doesn't make sense because it already caps at 50% despite what you do, post makes more sense in how they get that number.\n\nWhich basically just sumes up my post the same question? why the cap around 50%? especially when it only takes 1 or 2 abilities or a couple pieces of equipment to get there? your not really trading off much to get that resistance defense on your hull and not have roughly the same offensive abilities you had before, seems like if you wanted to max your ship out for defense you should have a defensive advantage over someone who focused on offense an there really isn't much there because of how easy it is to hit such a low cap?\n\nI don't think you quite understood the formula the 'resistance' part is the tooltip bonuses not what your ship readout says, you seem to have used the final value that the ship readout says. ie this is the formula to arrive at what the readout says given your tooltip stats.\n\nIf you had 4 consoles that add +30% resist each, the number you'd plug into that equation is 120, which would result in a 55% (roughly) absorption. It's not capped at 50% as such, I think it's just hard to get over that.\n\nBut yes, the paperdoll/readout screen shows the post-calculation number, not the tooltip values that went into it. Ideally I think they should show both, but then, people might be even more confused."

      "text": "Superweapons off-switch\n\nThey need to go.\n\nBFroberg\n\nRight, so it may just be me - but I feel like the AI is drastically over-exploiting the super-weapon abilities. I'm very good at keeping the AI out of my space, which usually results in only my border-planets being probed, as such these planets are subject of relentless super-weapon strikes, and I have to keep rebuilding them as a result. More often than not, I can select it for rebuild and it'll be destroyed again a few seconds later.\n\nWith large games where you need to focus your efforts on one AI at a time, it can become incredibly frustrating.\n\nSince the super-weapons are ludicrously powerful to begin with, and the audio that triggers whenever one is used is annoying too - I would greatly appreciate the ability to disable the superweapon structures altogether.\n\nYour not alone, and I agree. Ive had to change my tactics because of these weapons. And yes, the announcement that ones being fired drives one crazy. I may have to mod this one out myself and remove the sound file associated with it.\n\nbtw, there is a discussion about this one in another thread. so its not unknown to the devs.\n\njust played thru Rebellion for my first time and I put the AI on Easy since its been awhile and i just wanted to get a feel for it. lol next thing i know; Im on tier 3 of researching and the Researching AI (pretty sure) is pounding me with Novaliths.\n\nPersonally, I would liek to see an option to turn off or make superweapons have diplomatic effect like using nukes in CIV, where the user of superweapons take a major diplomatic penalty for using them.\n\nI think the problem with Rebellion is that the AI's ability to build and use a fleet has been greatly reduced for whatever reason (I.e. it doesn't know how to use the new features yet). As a result it doesn't do much but build up its own planets, meaning it gets novaliths far faster than normal. It simply doesn't know any other effective way to attack. I'm sure it will be fixed later once all the features are in and they start returning the AI to competence.\n\nI was up two-three levels of research, had colonized Gateway (had to flee from my starting planet due to AI pressure..) and had begun to colonize the resource system to finance my empire.\n\nI was struggling just maintaining sufficient defence on the Gateway system - and before I even had enough labs to even think of starting research proper - the AI was sending Novialith shots from all its planets.\n\nMaybe I could've done differently, but the AI still seems Novialith heavy. I'm hoping its a bug like the others here say.\n\nAlso, if you're playing multi-star systems you're bound to have to focus on one enemy at a time when you're playing at Cruel or higher, lest they just walk over your fleet. I.e. it's likely that the other AI will be allowed to grow. If they have an entire star system of Novialiths, well, how can you even (with late game slow-down) manage to get at them before they've extinguished life entirely on all other planets. Barring starbases on all your planets, of course.\n\nYup, playing against 6 AI's all I hear is \"Superweapon activated on ?\" and while I'm mopping up 1 star system, the 4 other AI take 4-5 of my planets at a time. Not to mention the time when my own allied AI nukes planets with novalith a SECOND before I'm about to capture them.\n\nTwo Nova shots is enough to kill an asteroid with a shield, Preator, they can barely survive one shot with a shield and upgraded infrastructure.\n\nThe better counter is to use starbases with auxiliary government to prevent loss of the planet, though that doesn't stop the giant hits to your income from your population dying. The fact is that the level of Nova spam the Loyalist AI is doing right now is ridiculous, and is causing them not to invest in more sensible things, like fleets and defenses.\n\nAlso agreed. I just find them annoying now. One Novalith is one thing, but once a few of them are up it's just dumb. I had an enemy AI come at me with a few, so I just built one on every planet I could and let them spam him to death.\n\nAm I seriously the only one who has found a VERY effective counter to the nova-spam?\n\nA shield generator on each of your planets pretty much makes the novalith useless (unless they fire 10 at one asteroid, which they won't)\n\nThen, how would you counter it if you are Vasari or Advent? Both races dont have planetary shields and axillary government.\n\nAlso, countering a Nova spam isnt that fun to begin with. That, i think is the main problem. I think a limit for the number of super weapons buildable if the damage isnt reduced. Or reduce the damage if things were kept the way it is now.\n\nI do enjoy playing as Rebel in aggressively killing off their Novaliths. However the constant bombardment at my planets isnt fun at all, if it manage to kill of my planets each time it fires. I think i slight damage nerf has to be applied.\n\nI think it's a pretty complicated situation though as if you overnerf novalith, you'll get a problem of making Loyalist too weak. If it's left the way it is now, it will be incredibly annoying if you add Advent and Vasari in."

      "text": "I wonder if it will be possible to play a \"Runner\" who is performing freelance espionage for the Corporations themselves. That's the kind of flavor I could get behind. I like privateering a bit more than pirating.\n\nSounds like a Criminal Runner to me\n\nAnarchs like Noise Reilly work from their hatred for corporate corruption. Some might say they champion the oppressed and the downtrodden, but it's more likely that they're interested purely in the act of ripping apart corporate lies and spreading their viruses to hinder the corporate machine.\n\nCriminals like Gabriel Santiago are in it for the credits. They get paid for the secrets they uncover. Consummate professionals, these runners believe in taking as few risks as possible, and never the ones they consider unnecessary.\n\nShapers like Kate McCaffrey are considered idealistic naifs by many. They're not in the business to tear down corporations nor for personal gain. They run because they can. They take joy runs to see what they can make out of new combinations of hardware and software. Accordingly, their tech is usually among the most modded and sophisticated of any runner's.\n\nFrankly, you really need to understand the very nature of the game is asymmetric. It's not a limitation, it's the design of the game. The corp has hidden info and tries to protect assets and score points, while the runner can only succeed by cracking through corp defenses and stealing their points, having to often run blind into hidden cards and weigh risks. One side is bluffer, the other bluffee. Corp vs corp would be a solitaire race with no way to attack each other, and runners have no ways to inherently score points in their deck and their deck is all about interacting with the corp defenses, do runner v runner makes zero sense either.\n\nI suppose each side could play one of each deck and you could make rules on up on victory being a combo of stolen and advanced agendas somehow…but that's really more a weird 4 player variant. Each side is so fundamentally different and use different cards, it's not like a control vs weenie rush matchup I magic the gathering. It's like a complaint that d&d doesn't support dungeon master vs dungeon master. Think of the corp as dungeon master, laying traps and hiding their intent, and the runner as the clueless adventurer out looking for booty. It really ISN'T a limitation, it's the fundamental mechanics of the game and the asymmetry is the whole reason the game is awesome…\n\nHow does the fact that it's the design of the game not make it a limitation? I understand that by focusing on that one small aspect of the genre it allows them to get pretty in depth on that aspect. But in the process they cut off a lot of potential aspects that could also be a part of the game. Corp vs. Corp wouldn't have to be a \"solitaire race\" if the game was designed from the get-go to take that into considerationI should probably point out though that this really isn't the main problem with this game for me. The real problem with this game for me is the lack of multiplayer. I didn't really bring it up before because that is more an issue with my personal play-group than anything else. In fact my core play-group kind of boils down to 3 players, so any game that cuts off one of those players is not going to get a lot of play time. Heck, I think having some form of multi-player would actually help mitigate the Corp vs. Runner requirement. At the very least I suspect it would make that requirement a little onerous by spreading it over multiple players.\n\nAnyway, thank you all for your replies. I'll keep poking my head in every now and again since I do like some aspects of the game (the artwork, the universe, etc.). We'll see how things goThe thing is, you don't make a Runner deck. Similar to Decipher's Star Wars CCG, with it's Light/Dark side cards, in Netrunner every player is expected to have both a Runner and a Corp deck. Most games are actually a pair of games, each player playing each side.\n\nYou may not be comfortable with that, maybe because you don't want to have to collect both sides, or don't like the idea of ever playing the Corp, whatever. That's fine. But I think most people are taking exception to your describing it as a limitation - if you only want to play half the game, that's fine, but that doesn't really fit the definition of a limitation.\n\nyeah, the game wouldn't be the same at all. \"Limitation\" sounds like you are implying it would be better if it was as flexible as you describe. It would be a VERY different game if what you describe was possible. The magic of the asymetrical matchup would be totally different, and not the same game at all. The thing you are complaining about is what makes netrunner great. It really isnt a limitation, its a choice. Don't play if you only play multiplayer and things that can be totally symetrical. This isnt that game. Everything you are complaining about is WHY the game is awesome. try it, or don't, but don't diss it for not being a game its not trying to be…\n\nAll game design is about limitation. There is no game that is not without its limitations on you the player. This one is not more limiting than any other, it just has one you dislike, which is certainly your right. Thanks for sharing with us. Now that you know it is not the game for you, you won't mind of course if we politely move on to other topics that don't include why you don't like the game but feel the need to publicly post such dissatisfaction instead of just going to a forum for a game you do like.What else?\n\nWell, we know that there is a new type of card called an Identity card, and that they belong to factions too. It seems likely that your identity card functions as a leader for your deck in some way and additional Identity cards will come out for each faction as time goes on. It is unknown whether your Identity is public from the start or revealed during play.\n\nWe know that there is a card limit now, almost certainly 3x.\n\nThe type \"Fracter\" seems to be a new keyword to refer to Barrier icebreakers. In other FFG LCG's, they seem to like releasing cards later on that use these keywords.\n\nThe \"Noisy\" keyword appears to no longer exist, this is suspected to be one reason why the Barrier ice we've seen has been amped up considerably - because it no longer requires the use of a type of icebreaker with a built-in drawback. It might also be that Stealth cards will refer to the \"Fracter\" keyword directly to accomplish a similar effect to the old Noisy.\n\nTags are certainly in the game still, we've seen them mentioned on many cards. But, we have not seen anything about Trace or Link. This mechanic may have been simplified or removed. That is, we may just see \"give a tag\" subroutines instead of trace subroutines. Also, cards that in the old game gave a base link value may be replaced with ones that have you pay a set amount to avoid a trace, or pay a value related to the strength of the ice, etc… This is just conjecture though.\n\nI don't really get the logical leaps people are taking, that because a feature has not been seen in a handful of examples, it therefore risks being cut from the new release. In addition to the trace/link mechanic we haven't seen any fort upgrades and Sysops yet- are we to assume they have been cut as well?\n\nIn Memoriam: Lest we Forget their Brave Sacrifice, Citizens of Arkham!If \"Crypsis\" is any indication, it looks like they are moving away from dice rolls. think you might be remembering the attempt at a Shadowrun CCG.

Or suppose we encounter hostile aliens. How would space combat actually go?\n\nILike, I want to see a face-off with four ships all aiming at each other in a cross formation. Just for the hell of it!\n\nBeatnik said: Like, I want to see a face-off with four ships all aiming at each other in a cross formation. Just for the hell of it!\n\nDidn't they have a cross formation for fighter groups in Homeworld?\nThe only real problem in Homeworld in regards to the full usage of 3d space was the fact that you couldn't really physically position your ships however you liked. I remember in HW2, in the mission where you're attacking a Space Station held by the Vaygr, in which I sent my entire fleet far above the station in order to evade the brunt of the enemy defenses.\nHowever, when I issued the attack order, my ship just sort of descended \"down\" towards the target with their \"bottoms\" still facing \"down\", which made it seem a bit silly.\n\nChavez said: I'd say it's best seen as combat between submarines that are in plain sight of each other. A single hit will rip the ship apart.\n\nBut in space, you might not be in plain sight, and even if you see the enemy, he might not be at the same spot once your shots arrive at the target area.\nWhether or not the ships are ripped apart also obviously depends on the armour and the power of the weapons used.\n\nThe single most important thing in space battles would likely be intelligence. Whether that means spies within the enemy military or drones and listening posts, you would need to know within reasonable accuracy where and when the enemy would appear before even moving out.\nOf course, that would obviously be influenced by the orbit physics as mentioned in the article and obviously the locations of points of interest, mining facilities, colonies, planets or space stations. But even so, in a desperate war, you might always have enemies movin from completely unexpected directions only to surprise you even if there aren't many strategic targets there.\n\nAnd of course, stealth. Jamming the enemy sensors or hiding in asteroid belts while launching AI controlled drone fighters that double as missiles would be a splendid tactic.\nSo I'd imagine that if there were to be any space warfare, you'd end up with a small number of large baseships carrying a large number of drones to create a sphere of surveillance and offense/defense while trying to conceal themselves as best as possible, only emerging from hiding to strike the finishing blows with lasers or something.\n\nBeatnik said: IThe solar system is not completely a dish though. Only the sun and major planets operate on one plane, but comets and semi-planets (whatever you call those smaller planets since the reclassification of planets in 2006, Plutoids?) do not necessarily do so. If there was space warfare, i'd say that those types of objects would become relatively more important due to the minerals that they might hold which are perhaps rare on the planets and moons of the solar system, which are relatively uniform in their elemental make-up."

For people who have millions of credits and absolutely nothing else to spend them on, I'm sure it's all fine and dandy, but for casual players like myself, there's no way I'm going to drop hundreds of thousands of credits for all those perks for alts, lest my main goes broke, which is basically the only way possible for anyone that level to even unlock the perks in the first place.\n\nYeah I think they shot themselves in the foot with those legacy \"Perks\".

That is a Shield World, and obviously Forerunner tech, not a Covenant ship. It's blue, not purple-pinkish. And after at least three years (Halo Origins date) the covenant Loyalists would have been push extremely far back into Covenant space, due to the Human-Separatist fleets obliterating them at every turn.\n\nIt appears there's been some rumors about Cortana playing a much bigger role in Halo 4:\n\nquote 8bitfix.com\n\nThroughout the Halo series we've seen everyone's favorite artificial intelligence (AI), Cortana supporting the story along with Master Chief. She's also provided players with tactical options, making her a great companion while in combat.\n\nCortana was created to adapt, a feature not shared by other AI, though the ability to learn, think, and reason comes with a cost. An AI gifted with these features typically has a lifespan of about seven years, and as Cortana has explained, can eventually \"think herself to death\". Can the emotional depth of such a non-human character indicate a new step in Cortana's presentation? After all, we could see a strong bond between Cortana and Master Chief especially towards the conclusion of Halo 3.\n\n\"I can tell you Cortana's going to be a focal point of Halo 4, for sure.\" Said Frank O'Connor, 343's franchise development director. I think a lot of people are speculating on Cortana's age and the effects of age on an AI, there's this thing called Rampancy which is really just any AI thinking itself to death and Cortana's been around for a while and most AIs have a lifespan of seven years. Cortana's a little bit different in that she's been exposed to a lot more technology and information than other AIs via the Forerunner lore and mythos. But her state of mind, her relationship with the Chief, they're all going to be core elements of the story and the 'human drama' as it were in Halo,\" O'Connor added.\n\nCould we possibly assume that Cortana can take a \"physical\" form for the events of Halo 4? The fact that these types of AI live for a short time indicates more dramatic interaction between the lead characters. Who knows how much time has passed since Chief has been floating around in space? Halo 4 will be the start of a new trilogy, this time under the direction of 343 Industries. An ancient threat comes to wage terror on the universe and Master Chief and Cortana return to confront it.\n\nSo yeah, I'll be posting more of these when I find them, these little tid-bits.\n\nWell from what we could see it's a forrunner planet, seen in the teaser and the H3 ledgendary ending so there will be robots on it, and from halo ledgends there were glimpses shown of cortana going rampant. So in her rampancy and her inclusion of forerunner tech in her, could she take control of the (Shield world(?)) and its machines? could cortana be the main antagonist?+1\n\nChances are humans find you at some point since the warthog is confirmed to be in, so will there be (I was gonna say johnson but then I remembered :'( ) arbiters or some of the names ODST's? how about a Halsey appearence?

It used to be worse before they lowered Hybrids PG requirement space4sale\n\ndoes RA replace self-destructed ships? that would be ultimate faggotry level.\nI still remember days before big fight c-j, RA Wyvern jumped to cyno gen in c-j6 while BAND. was shooting at it. First thing he did was to press selfdestruct\n\nYes he will get reinbursement even doh he fucked up. he was playing from work *some real dedication there* and his boss came so he had to minimize eve and coudn't warp out..\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being excited while FC'ing and all that, but repeating a command every half second for an entire fight really is a bit much. If people didn't pick it up on the first two or so, they won't pick it up on the fiftieth and it really makes the playback painful to listen to.The key is the neuts. With supers running active hardeners you cut their HP to a 1/2 if you turn them off. I think an Erebus has like 135k Cap. With each Heavy Neut taking 600/cycle it doesn't take long to cap out a super whose buddies are bubbled 140km away. The problem you'll run into is in larger super fleets is there's enough cap/armor transfer power with the SCs that it gets substantially harder to cap out the primary.The super blob being on the field bears no relation to the type of ships used to kill the supercap. Good dictoring determines whether or not hostiles will be able to apply remote reps, and if they are able to en-mass, then you're likely not killing the super with just subcaps. Killing titans like this is rare, super-carriers are much more common. RA likely could have saved the Erebus if their triage carriers had arrived and started repping while the titan was still in high-armor.If the Titans landed that close, would they have had enough tracking to hit the tempests?\n\nas long as they are not closer than 20 km I dont see any issues for a titan to blap shield bses. shield bses is mostly focused on their primary aswell.... and prob not that good at keeping transvertial up. atleast if bses is getting webbed and shit...(by supers/support)\n\nthink penif was p much dead on, horrible return cyno spelled doom for the erebus. Without knowing what was going through red alliance fcs head I would assume he was worried about his cyno rapier getting killed too ealie and only like few supers accually jumping through/loading grid b4 cyno was down..thus risk getting futher split up/loosing more shit. but a carrier cyno would have solved all that.\n\ntake note that I wasnt there...so im just basing everything on what I saw in the videos.\n\n------------------------------------ \"God created the world in seven days, in a smaller, but no less impressive gesture, I destroyed HTA in 5\"\nGrath\n\nIf the Titans landed that close, would they have had enough tracking to hit the tempests?\n\nThe size of the titans alone will make sure they are spread enough to hit most of the BS rly.Its KE = 1/2 mv^2\n\nSquaring the velocity of the largest, fastest BS gives it lots of bamping power, the big one doesn't get launched like a bullet unless 3 or 4 bump machs hit it in the same spotToday we had a birthday roaming with some nulli friends. We visited NOL then KFIE, but Delve was quite dead. Finally we find a machariel on safe spot in 8WA, whose warped to station and landed on a bubble with a lot of thoraxes.\n\nSquaring the velocity of the largest, fastest BS gives it lots of bamping power, the big one doesn't get launched like a bullet unless 3 or 4 bump machs hit it in the same spot.\n\nI guess the mach pilots making it look easy is a complimentBecause the PG is scaled around fitting large artillery, which has some of the most atrocious PG requirements in the game.\n\nGlad someone took the time to post this. Also, between Missile launchers and LSE's, Caldari have the smallest PG fitting requirements in the game, your ship is not supposed to be able to fit the most powergrid hungry module in every slot without a fitting mod, it would remove the whole purpose of even having fitting requirements. Also for some retarded reason, torps need more grid than cruises (despite every other race needing more powergrid for their long range weapons than their short range weapons), so fitting a full rack of torps and heavy neuts should not be possible.\n\nYour lucky that fitting a full rack of torps is even doable without a powergrid upgrade.\n\nIt's all true as long as Titan is just haging in space without any power already applied, and thats just absrd since you can't just stop an object in space and leave it be. If you want it to say still you'd have to use some kind of energy to keep it there.\n\nWell shit, even if it isn't an AOE DD, but some kind of MASSIVE smartbomb, that has like a 20k range, must be activated, has a 5 second spool time and only fits on a cruiser (and not a covert ops cloaking cruiser) - and does like 100k damage\n\nAlternatively, a literal doomsday collision module - fits only on a battleship (by powergrid), must be activated which makes the ship bright fucking yellow or something, and has a multiplier to collision speed, so you do 100 damage for every m/s you are going when you collide. Also, it instantly pods the pilot of this allahuackbar ship (maybe by resetting you to an alpha clone or some shit).\n\nIt should be really, really fucking unappealing to do, should have ridiculously high requirements and cost, as well as penalties for using it.\n\nThe speed of a bumping Mach is around 6000mph, in a world of non perfect elastic collisions, it would of course be instantly destroyed on impact.\n\nLuckily it too has kinetic shield resist\n\nIn a world of Bungee metal alloys, physics laughs at us all.\n\nCollision damage is a great concept, but I think there'd have to be some temper for it. The way med clones work, etc, EVE would quickly turn into an Al Qaeda training camp simulation which would get boring quickly.\n\nEdit: Walking away during a post is bad form, and Grogoth basically already said this but with more abo ninja style."

You may need to restart the Steam client if the update doesn't initially appear.\n\nNOTE: VERSION 1.04 IS NOT SAVE GAME COMPATIBLE WITH PREVIOUS UPDATES.\n\nVersion 1.04 Change Log:\n\n[ Graphics ]\n\nAdded new loading screen image.\n\nFixed some button highlight bugs in the create mission system.\n\nUpdated UI not to display game speed Infocards in multiplayer matches.\n\nIf you verify integrity of game cache within Steam, the 1.04 update will apply. We're working with Valve to determine why the game doesn't want to auto-update normally.\n\nCan you make this bug a feature? I'd really like the option to elect when to update as I like playing on the larger maps and can take several days to complete a good game as I don't have time to do it all at once. For your customers who don't follow the forums very often, it is very frustrating to have put hours in a game that is getting really good and then have it not work because of an upgrade.\n\nThat said, I really like the new changes and agree with the suggestion for the VR to have to buy an upgrade for each starbase than can warp.\n\nWell thank you for sending out an email to let me know Rebellion has been updated, if it wasn't for the email I wouldn't have know (Steam definately isn't picking up the update for me) and I have been waiting for this last update before continuing my modding efforts.\n\nThank you for the update Stardock, now its back to work for the modders!\n\nVasari are the the most advanced race why would the VR need more debuff other than the -25% dmg. Vasari are the master race not those pesky humans,\n\nBecause game balance trumps lore.\n\nBesides if we were playing by lore, the Vasari would have to have a fleet cap a fraction of the size of the other races. The Vasari are supposed to have the best tech by and large- But they are also supposed to have a very small military compared to the other factions who happen to be in their prime and not be a small group of refuges as the Vasari lore pegs them. That's pretty much the lore's reasoning for the Vasari's reliance on mobility & guerilla tactics: because they are vastly outnumbered and would lose if forced into a war of attrition.Oh wow!!! And here I was just getting ready to start a game... thank you for the heads up, this is a most welcome surprise!!!!!!.\n\nBetter to play with automatic Pirate raids off anyway- the automatic raids can unbalance the game by slowing just one player's early expansion early game and then late game just becoming automatic exp for someone's titan every raid that said person's opponents can't really do anything to stop.\n\nNot to mention the whole bidding system in general has a bunch of flaws and annoying aspects. Pirate missions are much better for gameplay.I totally agree... Personally I like the Pirates ramped up, because it does just what you said, lets me build up my cap ships and titans XP faster, and adds a little variety to the game. Yes, they are a nusiance, but a welcome one. I reciently posted a thread about getting nailed over and over by pirate raids.... finally figured it was the AI buying them to raid me... it was making me crazy... but was also one of the more memorable single player games in a while, because it was so unexpected, and such a nuscence. Hey, war is hell... lol... you have to expect the unexpected.\n\nI always keep mine turned on. But also when I make a custom map, I tend to give all the players more credits and resources to get started with (no, not just mine... lol... ) so they don't usually have a problem in the game early on, and the game gets started up faster... it tends to make that first boring half hour go a lot faster.. . Most of the time within 5 minutes all the players have a decient fleet started, and the pirates aren't really a major threat.... just a pain in the ass.\n\nOne question... if you turn the pirates off, how would this effect the TEC rebels being able to use them???\n\nI'll look at Pirates again for the next update. In terms of balancing, they are probably the most pesky. We'll continue to look at VR as well.\n\nYeah, I can see where balancing the pirates might be tough... from what I'm reading, the opinion on pirates seems split 50/50..... some folk like me like the ramped up, more agressive pirate faction... others turn theirs off and would rather not have them around.\n\nIf it's possible, perhaps you could think of adding a pirate difficulty level, the same as an AI player? This way people who don't like them could set them to easy, while others like me who do like them could set them to cruel??\n\nI know the pirates are just another faction, and written like players in many ways... is something like this do-able???"

When we're being casual gameplay is \"Try to stay in the same hex as the platoon waypoint.\" When things get a bit more srs bznz it's up to whoever is leading ops how they want to order things. That could be forty people playing follow the waypoint or four squads operating semi-independently to achieve an overall goal. While some people who lead ops more often than others there is no set \"leader\" - It's very much a do-ocracy. Anyone is welcome to lead squads, create events, or herd cats and the style and degree of tacticool changes depending on who is cat-herder in chief at the moment.\n\nIt was that bad. Right now it's really, really good, on par with the ScatMAX but with different applications.\n\nBasically - the VS max used to be worthless. The weapons lacked the accuracy to hit anything consistently at even moderate ranges and the damage output was fairly low. Now the weapons are much more accurate, allowing you to lay out accurate fire to at least 20m. The NC MAX can dish out tremendous amounts of alpha strike on anyone foolish enough to get close and that makes them excellent in very tight areas. The VS max has more sustained fire ability, and while you're not going to saw an entire infantry squad down like you can with a ScatMAX you can dominate infantry in close to midrange. VS MAXes are notably much better on the move.\n\nNC Maxes - Death to anything at 3m-15m, including other MAXes, but limited on the move or in the open\n\nVA Maxes - Can take down infantry very effectively at 10-25m and do well in areas where those ranges are common, but limited in extreme close quarters and long range fighting.\n\nClang, Neil Gaiman has funded a few projects, and there are innumerable smaller efforts that never come anywhere close to the massive media blitz that some things get. Didn't Giant in the Playground kickstart the printing of one of their books or something?\n\nI know, right? I've seen my brother turn a game around because he managed to sneak a couple of rangers into a good spot and seize an enemy mortar. It's really not one of those games where the first ten seconds define the whole match.\n\nThat is my brother and his friend. They're beasts, and the community is small enough that people would just drop the game rather than play against them. They weren't cheating - they just used a good understanding of infantry tactics and great teamwork.\n\nFrom what I can remember of his ramblings Vivec seemed to be unfixed in time. He might be dead in the 4th era, but simultaneously quite alive and active in the 2nd, in the sense that he perceives his entire existence as one moment without privileging any particular point in time as the \"Present\". A distinction between \"Life\" and \"Death\" wouldn't mean the same thing to someone who wasn't moving inevitably from one to the other. It'd be a bit more like a circle - There would be a moment before which you could not perceive, and a moment after which you could not perceive, but you wouldn't \"end\" because you're still alive at every other point in your perceptual timeline.\n\nOr.... I could be completely off base. Honestly Vivec's divinity is one of those things that I'm still not really clear on.\n\nI still have trouble accepting that there even are fixed life spans in Nirn. There is so much weirdness in this setting. Time can and does go bonkers on a regular basis, every kind of imaginable magic exists, most diseases and illnesses can be cured instantly by those sufficiently knowledgeable. Hell - IRL death is mostly the result of coming down with a bunch of illnesses at once because your body is too old to deal with them. If you can just throw a Cure Disease on yourself every morning you're not going to succumb to pneumonia any time soon. A sufficiently powerful wizard could create a constant effect restore health and stamina 1pt ring, enchant something else with +str, +fatigue, and +dexterity as a sort of power-assist mobility rig, and be up and going at 120 easily even if they have exactly the same physiology as a real human.\n\nJust having fatigue potions, which presumably reverse the effects of, say, sustained exercise, would be a huge boon to an elderly person - Doing anything is exhausting when you're older. If you could just mix some onions and a grape together, down it, and feel totally refreshed, even more so than when you dragged your tired old bones out of bed in the morning, you'd be able to stay very active and offset many of the diseases and maladies that stem largely from inactivity in old age.\n\nEven peasants can presumably make simple alchemical potions, and people of means would be able to access quite powerful ones on at least an occasional basis.\n\nThat does get into a question - Mechanically you can reverse any kind of physical damage with magic. So with magic could you, say, regenerate lungs damaged by tuberculosis by applying a cure disease effect and a restore endurance spell? Would a combination restore strength, restore dex, and restore endurance repair that was broken, set badly, and healed?\n\nThere seems to be... wildly varied sources on just how much magic is available to common people. In game almost everyone has at least a few spells and martially oriented people - soldiers, bandits, guards - seem to have some degree of magic at least half the time. Some sources depict magic as less common, other sources depict various sorcery as being used by the majority of soldiers in an army on an individual level. Presumably every farmer in the land would want to know a few spells if it could ease the birth of a calf or heal a blighted crop.\n\nEitherway - Even assuming the \"life span\" of a human is the same in Tamriel as on Earth, the availability of magics to counteract disease and many of the debilitating effects of age could allow people to live much, much longer than they do on earth before you even get into extending life-span directly."

      "text": "'s the idea. You use the crafting system and an extensive, insane, ridiculous number of mats across various levels to craft your very own ship from nacelles up to the bridge. Now obviously the ship you craft has to match one of the current in game models, so you won't be crafting a Warbird of Scimitar but more like your very own Qin Raptor or Vorcha-R. Really any model available in game could be crafted by a player, including ships currently only obtained through the Cash Shop or Emblems. Even more though, crafting your own ship from the ground up would also allow a wider range of customization, players would be allowed to move a console spot around or maybe even make changes to their bridge officer station layout finally permitting, just as an example, a Guramba with a Commander Tactical station and a Lieutenant Commander Engineering station.\n\nBut even more than that, there will be a random element to each component crafted that can cause such components to come out either commonly, uncommonly, rarely or very rarely with appropriate buffs to each one. For example, a very rare 'light warp core' could give an overall power efficiency bonus and, being a 'light warp core' would be useable on Bird of Prey and Raptor class vessels.\n\nOnto the questions!\n\nQ1. What do you mean by \"Really any model available in game could be crafted by a player, including ships currently only obtained through the Cash Shop or Emblems?\"\n\nUmm, merely that, given the power of futuristic computing and the thorough nature of futuristic scanning technology it's not unreasonable to assume working schematics for any ship in game would be available.\n\nQ2. What are you hiding?\n\nNothing, nothing I swear!\n\nQ3. \"Any model available in game can be crafted by a player...\" Wait, no, you couldn't mean \"Any model available in game can be crafted by ANY player.\" can you?\n\nMaybe I do!\n\nQ4. So you'd let the spineless dogs of the Federation craft Klingon ships!\n\nUmmm... that's not a question.\n\nQ5. Pretend it's a question and explain yourself!\n\nOkay, yes, that's right. I'd let ANY player craft ANY ship that's in game. That means a Gorn with a Deep Space Science vessel if he wants it, and that means a Vulcan with a Neghvar if that's what floats her boat. And why not? The technology is there, the resources are there and if the player base has the desire to make it happen, I say make it happen!\n\nQ6. Homogenization will be the DEATH of ALL THAT IS TREK!\n\nLets agree to disagree.\n\nQ7. But if everyone in Starfleet is flying around in a Bird of Prey then it won't be Starfleet anymore!\n\nFirst off, not everyone in Starfleet even WANTS to fly in a Bird of Prey. Secondly, you saw where I said there would be a significant cost in time and resources to craft this, I'm talking REALLY significant, like, as long as it takes you to grind up 500 emblems. So this won't be a common sight by any means. I anticipate most people will be crafting their existing ships from the ground up and min/maxing very rare ship component bonuses. And if it becomes desirable we can add an additional hurdle to crafting cross-faction ships, possibly some sort of PVP cost where rare and hard to replicate bits of technology are taken from the wreckage of felled Federation vessels.\n\nQ8. I will support NO attempts at homogenization, regardless of how awesome it may be otherwise.\n\nFine, have it your way. Assume there's an alternate proposal where a faction is restricted to crafting only their own ships.\n\nQ9. Oh, that I'm okay with.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nQ10. Well, I mean, I suppose it might create a problem with Gold farmers, they're already screwing around with the crafting economy by exploiting certain easy to farm anomalies.\n\nYeah, but crafting goes on despite that game element leading to unfortunate side effects.\n\nQ11. And then there are balance problems, I only play casually and really don't have the time to craft component after component in hopes of getting the five very rare ones necessary to craft a 'very rare' quality ship, will I still be competitive?\n\nThat's a good question. Obviously we run the risk of making the very rare ship powers too potent but that can be counter acted by putting diminishing returns on things like energy efficiency settings or power setting bonuses. Ideally, these would be no more effective than a set bonus or a long sought after bridge officer trait.\n\nQ12. Could we take current ship exclusive powers, like saucer separation or advanced transwarp, and make them something that can be crafted into other types of ships?\n\nThat's interesting... maybe. I suppose where it seems relevant and feasible sure. Like only some ships can conceivably benefit from saucer separation and the Defiant-R and Voqov Carrier are not on that list.\n\nQ13. And cloaking devices, we should be able to craft cloaking devices into ships?\n\nOh, that's a minefield I'm not sure I want to set foot in.\n\nQ14. This from the guy who's proposing even more homogenization?\n\nYou know, you're right, I might as well go in for it all. I can't think of an in-game reason why a ship, built from the ground up and to the exact specifications of a given officer, could not be built with a cloaking device. However, there's never been a Science Vessel with a cloaking device in game for good reason so, where serious game balance issues arise, arbitrary and completely unexplained restrictions against certain ship and ability combinations should be enforced.\n\nQ15. What about canon argument A, B, or C?\n\nAgainst Federation cloaking devices? Well, The Romulans are in no position to enforce canon argument A, the use of the Defiant in the Gamma Quadrant shows the Federation is at least flexible about argument B, and argument C may have held water 200 years ago in Kirk's time, but now it's just silly.\n\nQ16. Do you really believe that Cryptic has the manpower to be constantly rebalancing around user modified ships?"

      "text": "Galactic Reign: Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is the game about?\n\nGalactic Reign is a turn-based head-to-head game of tactical expansion and conquest. You and your opponent colonize planets, design ships, and build fleets as you fight for domination of the galaxy. When opposing fleets meet, the battle is rendered on the cloud, showing the result in a stunning cinematic movie.\n\nIn addition to player vs. player strategy, Galactic Reign features an extensive collection of single player missions that challenge you to use clever ship design to defeat enemy fleets.\n\nGalactic Reign is available on Windows 8 and Windows Phone, will I have to buy it multiple times to play on both devices?\n\nBuy once play anywhere. If you've already purchased Galactic Reign on another device, there is no need to purchase it again! You can download the trial and still have access to the additional content. Purchasing on other platforms will only unlock the ability to gain achievements on that platform.\n\nExamples: Double Defensive Warp will give a ship slightly more evasion and will jump back farther, but that is often not worth it. Double Target Hacking will make enemy ships prioritize the equipped ship even more than ships with one Target Hacking.\n\nWhat happens when enemy fleets try to move past each other?\n\nThe fleet that is larger (after ships are built) 'pins' the smaller fleet in place, blocking its movement. Even if the smaller fleet wins the fight, its movement is still denied.\n\nHow do ramming strikers work?\n\nRamming works the same as any other attack, except that a successful attack also destroys the ramming ship. Ramming attacks are affected by damage boosts, evasion, and other factors the same as any other weapon.\n\nHow was I attacked? I didn't see a fleet there.\n\nA player can place a destroyed fleet and immediately build into it. This allows a player to 'ambush' an opponent by placing a fleet on a colony that they think will be attacked and building lots of ships.\n\nDo a Zorn factory ship's special components affect the Drones it spawns?\n\nNo. Zorn drones are not affected by Damage Boost or any other special component equipped on the factory ship.\n\nWhat determines how my ships act in battle?\n\nShips choose a priority target based on their weapons and how much damage they expect to inflict. Ships with higher rates of fire will prefer smaller targets, for example. Also, because artillery and assault ships host more and have less health than other ships, they will usually be prioritized first. Ships move to their weapons range and fire, shooting anything else until their best target is in range. They will not, however, do fancy things like waiting for screening ships to be cleared or prioritize ships that present particular threats to them or other ships. They inflict as much damage as they can on the opposing fleet.\n\nThis fleet is unstoppable! What do I do?\n\nEvery fleet has a weakness. If there's a composition that you can't figure out, take a look through the Battle Academy. Most strategies are represented there. Failing that, ask on the forums.\n\nWhat does a rate-of-fire of 1.5 mean?\n\nRate of fire 'stacks' between ships of the same design. If you have one ship with a rate of fire of 1.5 then you're wasting that .5, but if you have 2 or more ships then the rate of fire multiplies as you might expect. 2 ships have an effective rate of fire of 3, etc. This is because a single ship cannot fire half a bullet, but a stack of identical ships will add all those halves up into full shots.\n\nCan a weapon's damage be reduced below 1?\n\nOnly by armor. Weapon Accelerators, for instance, never reduce a weapon's damage below 1.\n\nCan armor completely negate damage?\n\nNo. Armor has a minimal level of damage that it can reduce attacks to, which is .5 for 'built in' armor and .25 for Sundog armor components.\n\nHow fast do Zorn Battleships and Dreadnaughts launch Drones?\n\nIf you think of an individual weapon's having a rate-of-fire of 1 as taking a unit of time to fire, Zorn factory battleships and dreadnaughts take 15 of those units to fully deploy their compliment of drones. That's a long while, so it behooves the opponent to take these ships out long before they can launch all their drones.\n\nWhat happens to Zorn Drones at the end of a battle?\n\nThey fizzle and shut down, no matter what. Drones launched during a battle never have any effect on subsequent battles. If a battle ends with only drones remaining, both fleets are lost. During the next battle with those factory ships, a new set of drones is launched.\n\nAre light strikers useful beyond the early stages of the game?\n\nYes. Also, 'Very.' The smallest ship class remains important as a screening force against assault ships and due to their numbers and evasiveness, they are always an excellent response to late-game weapons with low rate of fire. There are many weapons in the game that completely dominate these ships, but if your opponent doesn't build enough of those, a surprise attack with a massive striker swarm can be devastating.\n\nWhen are shields better than armor and vice-versa?\n\nArmor is ideal against high rate-of-fire, low damage weapons. Note that because armor has a minimum damage, there is a wide range of weapons for which it is equally effective. For instance, a fully armored Sundog Dreadnaught essentially negates the damage from any type of Zorn Drone, so Hunter Drones will prove as effective as Assault Drones against it.\n\nShields, on the other hand, are equally good against everything, but exceptional against nothing. They provide a straight 15% health boost, so as long as the weapon hitting them isn't enough to destroy them in one shot even with the shields, the shields will be doing something.\n\nIf you're trying to decide between shields and either armor or hardened shields, just figure out what percent of a weapons damage the armor will negate. For example, Hardened Shields will reduce an Alkari Thermal Beam from 2 damage to 1, a 50% decrease and much more efficient than the 15% shield effect.\n\nWhen are weapon accelerators useful?\n\nAnytime you want to destroy lots of smaller targets with a weapon that would otherwise waste damage against them. For instance, Alkari Cruiser Gauss Cannons are great against destroyers with their rate of fire of 1.5. But the same ship armed with a Corona Beam and two Weapon Accelerators has the same rate of fire and does more damage. Of course, this takes both component slots and as a result you can't use fancy things like Defensive Warp. So there are pros and cons to both.\n\nHow does evasiveness and to-hit chance work?\n\nWhenever a ship fires a weapon, it has somewhere between a 100-5% chance of hitting its target. If there are no interfering factors, the chance to hit is 100%. Evasion, Cloaking, Ghost Signalers, Defensive Warping, specific weapon modifiers, and Scanners all have effect on this. All of these things stack and effect each other in a purely additive way. For instance, two Cloaking Devices gives a ship 160% evasion, making any attack against it use the minimum chance to hit of 5%. If the attacking ship has three Scanners, it has a 150% bonus, making the chance to hit 90% (160 evasion – 150 accuracy bonus = 10% miss chance).\n\nHow do multiple Dispersion Matrices work?\n\nUnlike Evasion, Dispersion Matrices are not additive. Damage passes through each one separately. So let's walk through what happens when a Singularity Warhead (2000 damage) hits a cruiser with two Dispersion Matrices (each negating 90% of the damage over 100).\n\nThe first Matrix lets through 100 damage (because they always do) and then negates 90% of the rest of the damage. In this case, we're talking about 1900 damage, so the Dispersion Matrix cuts that down to 190. So the attack is now dealing 290 damage (100 that always gets through + 10% of the remaining damage).\n\nThe attack hits the second Matrix and the same thing happens. 100 damage goes through. The remainder (190) is cut down by 90%, leaving it at 19. So the total amount of damage dealt by that Singularity Warhead is 119.\n\nWhat is a capital ship?\n\nCapital Ship is a general term that encompasses Battleships and Dreadnaughts.\n\nHow is a weapon strong against 'assault ships'? Shouldn't it be equally good against other ships in that hull size?\n\nAssault ship weapons are always high damage, with a range of 10. They are also mounted on ships with relatively low health and high cost. Weapons that are good against assault ships are weapons with a range of 40 that deal enough damage to destroy these ships before they can get close enough to return fire.\n\nFor instance, Alkari Thresher Flak Cannons have a higher rate of fire than Javelin Missiles and as a result will kill strikers at a much higher rate. But because the flak cannons have a range of 10, the ships that are using them will almost certainly get wiped out in return if those strikers are assault or ramming strikers. Javelin Missiles in comparison will kill fewer ships, but will kill them before they can close range. This Range-40 'keep them away' approach is the defining characteristic of Javelin Missiles, Goliath Railguns, and Execution Beams.\n\nHow does the 'DO NOT RENDER VIDEOS' option work?\n\nWhen a player selects this, the cloud will not render battles for him. This means that Battle Academy results will return immediately, though without any video data to analyze. If both players in a multiplayer game check this option, then their turns will resolve immediately without any battle videos being rendered.\n\nThis is great news that I only have to buy it once and can play it on multiple devices. Also good to see that there is FINALLY a game that utilizes the ability to play between different modes of media. Thanks for the heads up, will direct others here in the future for questions!Was meant to pick it up last night but got busy. I'll be buying it tonight most likely, so I'd love to face off against you soon.\n\nWhat regions is it available in? For Windows Phone, no problems, I just hit download, but on my custom built Windows 8 PC and also on my brother's Surface RT, it states \"Sorry, this app won't work on your device\" Which is a case of, WTF?\n\nThe game should run just fine on Surface RT and Win8 systems. What video card are you using there? Also, you might want to try the troubleshooting steps outlined in this post regarding a similar issue.\n\nI think the game automatically detects if you are on wifi or your mobile network. On wifi it defaults to download, on mobile network it defaults to the pause button and then you manually press continue/skip to download or not download.\n\nI figured it might be a regional thing, as it doesn't show in the Windows Store. This is the same for my brothers Surface RT, his desktop, and mine. Shows up just fine for both of our Windows Phones, my HTC Titan, and his Nokia Lumia 820.\n\nI'm running with an Asus GTX 570, and my brother is running an MSI GTS 450, but given the same result is reflected on the RT, I figured it might be regional. Again, doesn't show in the Windows Store, the only place it shows is in the XBox Games app as a highlight/spotlight, but within the Windows Games hub it once more, doesn't show.\n\n\"Your days are numbered!\" said the chronologist.\n\nI can't see it in the Windows 8 store either, but I can see it if I open the Games app, however, I can't download Galactic Reign on my PC as it says that it doesn't work on my device. I'm rather annoyed by that... I like the game a lot, but not being able to download it on my PC is very frustrating...\n\n\"Your days are numbered!\" said the chronologist.\n\nFor Australians still unable to access the game from the Windows 8 store - we're sorry! It will be available at some point. Galactic Reign is hitting different regions' stores at different times, and Australia seems to be taking a little while longer than others. We apologize for any inconvenience!\n\nAgree with Pointblank, also any plans to make available a more precise \"time line\" of battles, so I know better what actually happens and what shipped killed which ship. In the videos that is not always completely clear... The servers must generate that data anyways...\n\nAnd it would be great if we could save ship designs for later battles...\n\nLooks like Dispersion Matrixes have been tweaked down to 70%, so the original FAQ should be modified accordingly. I've always wondered what is the speed of factory drones? Is it 20 or 30? Another thing is artillery and medium range weapon ships. Do they advance towards enemy at their speed even when have the enemy at their fireing range, or do they stop? It would be great if those would be added to the FAQ too..\n\n\"Your days are numbered!\" said the chronologist.\n\nThere's a problem related to Microsoft's multiplatform aggregation. Yea, this is related to Galactic Reign. I'm getting messages (probably) related to the game through XBL, since everything goes through Live now. I can't read the messages and the system tells me that I can \"use my Xbox\" to read the messages. But I don't have an xbox and I never will. So it says if I upgrade to Gold.. I can read them online. I think maybe that's a little... insane? MS wants me to upgrade to Gold just so I can have access to messages Live players send me? Well that's not happening. If anyone has access to higher ups who can address this concern for non-Xbox gamers, I think it deserves their attention. Unless.. I'm missing something, which I hope I am.\n\nI think what you're probably seeing is players sending Live messages (which do require a Gold account) instead of forum private messages. Since these forums are built for Xbox and Xbox Live, you can access your Live account and messages directly through the links at the top of the page. The forums also have their own messaging system, which you can see in the links just a bit below that."

Notepad is ugly but will work in a pinch.\n3) The file is huge but near the very end of the file you will see a value for your credits. The easiest way would be to do a text search for the amount of credits you know you have in your game, since there are several instances of the <credits> tag.\n\nIn my example, I knew I had 3616 credits so I searched for that value and found this 95% of the way down the file:\n\ncode:\n\n<credits>\n<value>3616.0</value>\n\n300,000 should be enough to set you up for life, but listen to your heart and then type in that amount.\n\ncode:\n\n<credits>\n<value>999999.0</value>\n\n4) Save file, exit text editor, launch game.\n\nThis game really is reminiscent of Escape Velocity, except there's no resource fork or hex editors.

Shouldn't they just retreat instead?Seashell Salesman fucked around with this message at Feb 16, 2012 around 07:54Esc yes in battle just auto resolves it instead of surrendering or whatever, and the ai is decent enough to grab some improbable victories.\n\nAlso, according to the manual, you're more likely to capture ships when their fleet was set to attack, less likely when they chose defend, and not supposed to happen if they chose retreat as long as they get a ship to retreat during the actual combat.\n\nAre there any frigates or fast destroyers the AI is actually good with especially? I love pew pewing in a tempest or vigilance but against any mildly tough enemies my AI wingmen just get confused and explode themselves eventually.\n\nThey seem to be able to handle themselves in medusas so maybe just a couple medusas backing me up?\n\nEither I'm really bad at this game or the battle autoresolve is funky. I had 3 frigates, a carrier and two broadsword wings vs. 4 pirate carriers and bunch of other crap. First I tried myself and lost with two pirate carriers left. Then I semiaccidentally bumped into them again after reload and decided to see what my second in command can do.\n\nHe lost one broadsword wing and almost everything else came out without a dent.\n\nAlso, the enemy AI seems to brainfart pretty badly every now and then. At the start of my game it was my two frigates vs two pirate frigates and talon wing. I dropped the talon wing and suddenly both frigates retreat despite being in flawless condition. Managed to capture one of them too.\n\nWait what? How'd you even manage to lose to pirate carriers, they don't have any real guns and provided your ships have shields they should be able to effortlessly weather the storm of Pilum LRMs that are speeding towards you. Assuming you are using harpoon missles you should be able to blow those suckers up really easily too.\n\nKeywords are the \"bunch of other crap\", which consist of the fighter wings and frigates. But I forgot their numbers and types. But in any case, that's beside the point. No matter how horrible player I am, the AI seems to work much more efficiently if the player isn't there.\n\nAlso, I just cheated money and lost two capital ships to one cruiser and \"bunch of other crap\".\n\nWith me in a tempest and 2 computer tempests I have had no trouble taking on pirate carrier groups etc. My favourite targets by far, though, are those mercenary falcons and hammerheads and whatnot. The computer can fly tempests but has absolutely no idea in a vigilance, despite them being basically the same ship?Its a bug where if they cant field their big ships because you outcap them, they are basically given to you.\n\nCoylter posted:\n\nIts a bug where if they cant field their big ships because you outcap them, they are basically given to you.\n\nYeah, even the most ardent self-preservationist is occasionally going to consider that surrender isn't a viable option. Fighting them on the beaches, etc. No quarter, etc. It shouldn't be automatic, and it maybe should be checked per ship in a fleet.\n\nWolf with a heavy blaster on the nose mount and maxed flux venting is an amazingly fun ship to pilot. But you can't deal damage and tank with the shield at the same time, so make sure you have some fighters keeping missiles/other fighters off your back while you snipe behind shields. or swap out the lasers for assault cannon it'd be so much more survivable.We're marooned on a small island in an endless sea, confined to a tiny spit of sand, unable to escape.\n\nBut tonight, on this small planet, we're gonna rock civilization.Give a 'carrier group rally' order wherever you want the carriers to hang out. Otherwise, they'll automatically join with the rest of the mobile elements..Set a fire support or carrier rally point away from where you expect the fighting to be. I also set light escorts for my carriers, and haven't lost one since making that habit.\n\nAnother thing that's been bugging me: Is there any way to adjust the leash length of the escort orders? I like having my little Lasher buddy follow me around and keep frigates off my back but he loves wandering off after his targets. It seems like he only rubber bands back after getting around halfway across the map.\n\nBrainbread posted:\n\nOutcapping them should just \"end\" the battle once all the fielded ships are dead, so that whats left of the fleet should get to retreat/regroup, let them fight again.\n\nJust because you blew up their advance fleet should not end the fight.\n\nIt definitely seems from the posts on the official forums that capturing all the points and killing what the enemy brings in is meant to end the fight. There are a couple missions where that is the gimmick you need to use to win.\n\nDo you know if there are any plans to offer bigger credit rewards, higher ship capture rates or some kind of redeeming factor for challenging battles? If I get into a battle where I'm not at a massive advantage and I lose a few units, then that entire battle was a loss from a financial perspective.\n\nOther than that I am loving the game, I just don't like how every one of my fights needs to be a windshield kill, lest I lose 15000+ credits in fighters and only win 8000 to offset that.\n\n\"Your toy soldiers are not pigmented to my scrupulous standards. As a result, you are not worthy of my time. Good day sir\"\n\nI kind of hate the fact that fighters are destroyed so easily, yet still cost the same as other ships. There needs to be some kind of game change where fighters, even if the whole wing is killed, can be rebuilt after the battle. Wasps are super useful but they constantly suicide themselves into the big ships after all the fighters are dead.\n\nMicromanaging my fighters seems counter-intuitive. Maybe I should do that escort thing and just try to keep all my fighters in one big group of death.\n\nAlso yeah, ship balance needs a lot of work. Now that I'm in bigger fights it seems like you just can't even use fighters and frigates anymore. Even the super fast ones that used to do well are dead meat. Big ships have so much point defense potential that they can even eat up frigates easily.\n\n^^\nMy fighters tend to be great survivors - long as there's a carrier aroundThis is what I've equipped my Medusa with - a good all-rounder and sporting a somewhat stable flux.\n\nquote:\n\nThis is just a super simple mod that adds a Tri-Tachyon station, along with appropriate cargo and a resupply fleet (focused on energy and missile weapons, and the more advanced ships - also gets a supply of veteran and elite troops). Saw some folks requesting a corporation station, and realized how easy it would be with the modding system in place - so here it isThe Medusa can be amazing with just energy weapons. I've got mine kitted out with 2 Pulse Lasers (I think these are stock), 2 Tactical Lasers (on the mounts where the stock antimatter blasters are), and whatever the stock PD is. Get rid of the missiles, drop Auxiliary Thrusters on it, and then fill up the rest of the space with a ton of Vents and you've got a hell of a ship."

      "text": "Every lockbox so far has contained ships.\n2) The next lockbox involves time.\n3) The Korath is a timeship.\n\nUnless the Korath is a C-store ship and the Wells is a lockbox ship, the above seems to indicate the Korath will be in a lockbox. It's possible the former is in fact the situation, but based on recent statements to the effect that hardly anybody buys Klingon C-Store ships, it doesn't seem likely to me.\n\nIs there a third scenario I'm not seeing? I've been up for close to 20 hours, I could be loopy.\n\nNo lockbox ship has so far been split into a fed version or KDF version. They are 'neutral' faction ships not allied to either side.\n\nThat alone tells me the Wells and Korath are either a c-store ship or the 1000 day vet reward since they are faction-specific.\n\nSince there are two ships made that are timeships and that we have been hinted that an andorian ship and the Vesta were in the works... and taking into account the chronic biased approach to cstore ship releases by cryptic... then logic dictates that is most likely that:\n\nWells and Korath are the 1000 day vet rewards.\nAndorian or Vesta will be the next store ship.\nKDF gets nothing againNo lockbox ship has so far been split into a fed version or KDF version. They are 'neutral' faction ships not allied to either side.\n\nWhen opening the current lockboxes there are faction-specific ships-- Mirror Vor'cha is given when KDF, and Mirror Star Cruiser or Mirror Assault Cruiser awarded Fed side. Plus, a few other non-ship rewards have been faction split. Just because they haven't had the main draw ship (Orb Weaver in the latest case) being faction split doesn't mean they won't this time, seeing as they have the capability to do so.\n\nAs for being a vet reward, it sounds like it'd be a really cool and worthwhile thing given to Cryptic's loyal subscribers... Which leads me to believe that it won't be a vet reward, seeing as the last thing given was cute non-combat monkey and most the ones before that weren't that great. Plus, they're still figuring out how subscribers fit into the new F2P model, so it being limited to such a small portion of the player base when they could make more money by it being lockbox/C-Store doesn't seem likely to me. Maybe the Vet reward will be a variant of the ship which you don't have to lockbox-fish for or lacking the C-Store's console would be the best I'd expect if you're nearing that mark.\n\nWell, whatever happens. . .I refuse to invest time and zen into unlocking boxes. It's a gamble I'm not willing to take, especially since I'm not a power player who can grind endlessly. If there's a new C-store ship and it's something along the lines of a decent BoP/Raptor level ship, I might actually buy it. It has to be worth spending Zen on, I'm not some feddie with deep pockets willing to buy every bit of crap that Cryptic/PWE put out. It's why I'm still reluctant to buy the Fleet Hoh'sus, because it's the equivalent of spending 20 dollars on a ship that's only available to a single character. If it were account-wide, I'd be much less reluctant, because it's a solid improvement over the Hegh'ta and the B'rel in terms of straight-up combat performance."

However, the upgrades will allow you to finish the objectives (and bonus objectives) faster, thus allowing for more xp/credits per run as you destroy more things."

      "text": "Add scarcity to conq station utility.\n\nThe main problem with conquerable stations right now is not the conquering mechanics (though those certainly have room for improvement), but rather the utility the stations offer. Currently, the benefits one gets by owning a station do not dilute when shared. That means there is no incentive to be greedy and hog a station to yourself, other than to deny utility to others. Whether or not others have access has no impact on your own ability to reap benefits, and in fact sharing access helps to secure your own access by increasing the number of people who defend it.\n\nWhat needs to happen is for the benefits to dilute when ownership is shared. The most obvious way to do this that I can think of is to put a station-wide daily cap on how often each mission can be taken. So for example, Latos I-8 could be set to only allow 20 FCP to be manufactured every day (this number is just for purposes of example). If five people are sharing the station, they could each make four, or one of them could make twelve, and the others would only make two, etc. If the station were shared among 20 people, each person would only be able to make one FCP. Perhaps have a method (possibly through keys, but preferably a \"Station Control Panel\") to allow allocating turns.\n\nThis could be extended to the free repairs and reloads, by giving the station a fixed amount of money every day which is expended by each RR. Once it is empty, the station can no longer RR people. Perhaps there could be a way to deposit money into this account, so that larger groups (or small groups that need frequent repairs) could continue getting RR services once the free funds for the day are expired. The cost of RR should be higher than at normal stations, to contrast with the initial free period.\n\nThe state of the station's counters should persist across conquerings, or perhaps diminish (in the sense of having fewer resources after being captured). I think it would be best of the station replenishes itself gradually throughout the day, rather than all at once at the turn of the day, to prevent situations where somebody conquers a depleted station at 08:00 and has to wait 16 hours before it is useful.\n\nSomeday in the future when player owned stores can be hosted in a conq station (or maybe player-posted contract missions), there could be an option for station owners to collect a percentage of every transaction and split it among themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, the main idea here is to give an advantage to being a small group owning the station, to balance the fact that a larger group can hold a station more securely. Then it becomes a question of whether you prefer lower returns with lower risk of station loss, or higher returns at a higher risk of station loss. It also potentially makes trustworthiness of your cohorts more important, if there are no controls in place to restrict use of the facilities. By doing this, stations would be much more likely to be fought over, rather than simply shared among all the friendly people.\n\nObviously, the actual conquering mechanics need work as well. That is discussion for other threads. And again, the numbers I used were just examples. I have no idea what an appropriate number of FCP per day would be.\n\nImposing a hard daily limit is a bit contrived. Plus it would favor people in certain timezones who are hardly affected by the limit at the beginning of the day, opposed to people who at the end of the day would rarely ever see the missions available.\n\nRather than set a hard limit, it should be implemented as an inconvenience that increases in severity as the number of players/manufacturing increases. This could be implemented as some sort of queue, where each person has to wait their turn to be able to use the manufacturing facilities.\n\nOn second though, that wouldn't be all that easy to implement with the current system, so perhaps a better idea is to have a maintenance mission that must be taken every X manufacturing cycles (station-wide). Just one person would have to take the mission to deliver a variety of goods needed to keep the facilities running, which would then allow everyone with station access to do an additional X cumulative number of manufacturing missions. Then if no one takes the mission, the facility would be shut down for something like 3 hours.\n\nThat way, the burden of keeping the manufacturing facility up and running becomes greater as more people are using it.\n\nI will echo my comments in the previous thread. This should happen and in my view the manufacturing missions available at the conquerable stations should be highly resource-efficient alternatives to the current missions which should be moved to regular unconquerable stations.\n\nIt was stated that tridents are not guild only content, but with the current conquerable station implementation I do not see how this is true in any way. The only way a new player can hope to achieve a trident is to cooperate in some way with a guild to receive keys, or to conquer the stations as part of a team. It is a highly unrealistic proposition that a builder of a trident could complete the process without having to get involved in guild politics in some way shape or form.\n\nI think it is therefore more commensurate with the original developer goals to have the missions moved to regular stations and to implement this suggestion to have the conq stations act as substantial benefits to those who are able to attain them.\n\nThere is a difference between \"guild only content\" and \"content that pretty much requires group cooperation\". Building a trident is much easier with the help of a group, but they do not have to be in your guild.\n\nMeridian, note that I did say I prefer an implementation that replenishes gradually all day long, rather than all at once at the turn of the day. So depending on who all has access, there could be some timezone issues, but not as many. Also, since this would encourage smaller more trusting groups rather than sharing a station with every trustworthyish non-pirate in the game, it would be feasible for people to simply come to an agreement about who gets what resources, and kick out anybody who doesn't play nice.\n\nBut yeah, it is pretty contrived.\n\nI kind of like the idea of maintenance missions. The burden would need to scale exponentially though, because if it were linear it wouldn't discourage large alliances - you could just say \"every member has to deposit X resources as dues when you use the equipment\", and then adding new members would not increase the burden on existing members. If the per-user burden of keeping it running increased, however, it would work. And that makes sense if you think of it as diminishing returns as you operate the factory harder.\n\nSo (crude example), if the mission is run once per day, it might only require 1 coolant per run to keep the factory happy. If 10 missions get run, it might require 25 coolant per run. If 20 get run, it would require 100 coolant per run.\n\nIt could be handled like asteroid heat - each manufacturing run heats up the factory, and the hotter it is, the more coolant it requires to continue operating. Ceasing manufacturing would result in it slowly cooling down. People playing at less busy times would have an advantage unless the rather than slowly cooling, the heat remained constant for 24 hours."

      "text": "I think there is a bit of a problem with the STF missions. A lot of people will agree that the invisible borg torps are just overpowered. That is something like what I'm going to be getting in to, but not just that.\n\nI feel like, at least for the pre-50 level characters, Mirror Invasion is a really fun mission. Fighting larger amounts of average difficulty ships and then having a boss(Stadi) at the end was fun. The enemy ships fire constantly with average attacks. The damage can be overwhelming and kill people, but there was at least some back and forth. There was healing, picking proper targets, using AoE abilities etc... Stadi itself was fun because it was challenging, but not overpowered. His apparent combination of Beam Overload and Beam Fire At Will hurt, as does the torp skills. There were ways to counter and survive it. However... this is not what we can expect from STF missions.\n\nFor some reason, the STF missions were designed in a way that the enemy ships would rarely attack, but when they did... it was almost always one shot. On my Fleet Advanced Heavy Cruiser Retrofit I have 58k hull. I use 1 Neutronium Alloy and 3 Monotanium Alloy eng consoles. Even with full shields and hull, I get hit by a sphere for ~20-30k hull damage in elite. With 52-59% Kinetic resist, that shouldn't really happen. I know there are diminishing returns on consoles, but it is still more than not having them at all. I understand that Elite STF missions are supposed to be difficult, but I don't think raising damage on enemy attacks is the only way to go. I think their damage should be reduced and have their rate of fire increased. One shot = not fun. That brings up another point... Borg use plasma torpedoes. Plasma torps should be relatively low impact damage, they aren't quantums or photon torps. They are used for the Plasma DoT -after- the impact. They shouldn't do crazy impact damage -and- crazy DoT too. If one had to be chosen, it should be the one that the weapon was meant to be for, the DoT, which in my opinion is where it should be for elites.\n\nI just feel like back and forth combat is more fair/enjoyable than taking no damage for a while and then immediately one shot. This is not even including the fact that borg love to shoot invisible torps. The game is heavily DPS based as is. Yes, some people claim their support ships are awesome, which can help, but usually not as much as another high DPS ship in STF missions. Making the battles more balanced with damage can make it more enjoyable and open up more options for support builds. Just to be clear, I'm not saying lower the DPS of the enemy ships, I'm saying nerf them the way that tricobalts were nerfed. Fire faster but less damage per hit."

      "text": "Of course, even with the astronomican faltering, its failure might mean the Emperor's soul is freed and reborn, resulting in his \"second coming\"… Certainly there is plenty to point to that sort of result in the fiction. Great Crusade v2.0, anyone?\n\nI subscribe the the \"Abnettverse\" as do others in this thread. Less grim, plenty of dark. The best thing about 40k is that it is vast enough to set great stories in, without having to bump into any of the canon characters or events\n\nI just think that this wouldn't happen in the scope of a few decades or centuries, but over a timeframe somewhat similar to the many millennia you mentioned came before the original Imperium. That, and this reborn Imperium's power may well not be Terra. It may not even have an Emperor (or not this one), and it may have a distinctively different hierarchy with different factions using different equipment. In short, it might be as different from the Imperium we know as the Imperium is different to the original human empire(s) in the Dark Age of Technology.\n\nThis is what I would expect from whatever comes after 999.M41 - with all the build-up the galaxy needs to be different, not just \"another day in the Imperium\". Then again, any \"new Imperium\" probably should still hold some resemblance in certain aspects for recognition values? Different, yet familiar… If so, a comparison of the ideal might be the Legacy era in Star Wars, for those of you that read the comics.\n\nThere's certainly a lot of potential for creative minds.\n\nInquisitorAlexel said:\n\nTbh, both events don't sound like they really threatened the stability of the Imperium as a geographic entity, although that's of course just what *I* took away from reading about the respective eras. During the Age of Apostasy, entire regions were isolated due to warp storms - but as soon as communications were re-established, people played ball with Terra. A second Great Crusade wasn't necessary. Similarly, that Waaagh of the Beast doesn't sound like one big push but a huge number of simultaneous small incursions occurring across Imperial space, with no true strategy and with no central leadership, and no real goal. It was more like a force of nature compared to what Ghazghkull managed to put together for Armageddon.\n\nSure it could. And that would be terrible. \"The end-times were upon us, but we snatched victory from the jaws of defeat… Now what?\"\n\nIf you continue the timeline you've basically got 3 choices, none of them good:\n\n1. Status quo - nothing overly major happens. There's big battles, campaigns etc, but nothing that has the potential to really shake the setting. The problem with this is that it gets a bit boring and frustrating as people get fed up waiting for the big climax that never comes.\n\n2. Huzzah! Major conflict that threatens the Imperium but the forces of mankind emerge victorious! The problem with this is that it leaves the setting a bit redundant. Sure, you can throw in another big bad guy to threaten mankind etc, but enough of that and it just turns into problem 1 above. It's a bit like setting a LotR game after the one ring has been destroyed, it's just not as interesting without the threat of doom hanging over everything.\n\nOther games and settings have tried one or another of the above approaches over the years. There are also other problems with meta-plots (such as fluff-buildup driving away new customers, for example). As people have realised the problems it's led to them being far less popular than they used to be, with some settings just freezing their timelines to deal with it don't mind that they arn't advancing the timeline. It's good that it's set in a period where all the forces are active, there's doom on the horizon but they don't know what form it will take. It's a big Galaxy with plenty of stories within it that haven't been told yet.\n\nPeople invest a lot of time in 40K and if you have to make sweeping changes you are going to disenfrancise some loyal fans. Say they said the Imperial Fists had been destroyed or the Eldar wiped out finally. That's going to send a lot people elsewhere.\n\nAnd if you advance the storyline without anything really happening then what's the point?\n\nI think what they need to do that they haven't done so far is emphasise that the tide is turning against the Imperium, that it starting crack.\n\nFor instance a lot of their background developement comes from Forgeworlds line, who are working on 'The Fall of Opheus' with the Imperial defenders against the Necrons. It would do a hell of a lot to emphasis the threat of the Necrons if they actually won that. Doubt it will happen though. Or maybe a big push from tyranid hive fleet wiping out a section of the galaxy and taking some major (but previously not, or bearly, mentioned) Imperial worlds with it. How about the Tau and one of the Craftworlds form an alliance, sure the Eldar are in it for themselves, but it's in their interest to play along together now. What if Fulgrim is seen rampaging through part of the Galaxy with the head of Leman Russ?\n\nIn short, they don't need to advance the timeline but I don't think they are doing enough to put life into the setting as it is.\n\nI think what they need to do that they haven't done so far is emphasise that the tide is turning against the Imperium, that it starting crack.\n\nThe new 6E Rulebook's timeline does a lot to drive this point home, though - as do a number of White Dwarf articles that were released in the wake of the 13th Black Crusade. I'd agree that it was a mistake to have the latter \"resolved\" by a worldwide campaign, though, and by now it looks as if the studio is backpedaling on it, turning back the clock to a point where the big battle is just about to happen.\n\nSometimes I feel that too much focus rests on the \"outsourced\" material, especially the novels. This is where you find the status quo the most, as it tends to sport Big Damn Heroes saving the day rather than suffering from setbacks, thus kind of ruining what the studio material attempts to establish. People's impression of something depends hugely on what exactly they're looking at, which is doubly true for 40k where consistency between different sources tends to get lost.\n\nBasically the Imperium was declining all the Time while the Tyranids became the deathblow for it. Now in 6thE Chaos is playing a bigger part und Necrons become big player too. All the Odds are against the Imperium though the fluff is filled with tons of \"Acts of last Hope\" i. e. the Terminus Decree, Russ an Guilliman, etc.\n\nIf you take a look at the Novels you must always accept that they make heavy use of power-plot-armor and are mostly in favor of their main-race. This is what people pay for when they get em. But if you take a look at the Time-Line they are just single battles.\n\nAlso the Line \"Space Marine Battles\" portraits several of the largest Engagements in ther later millenias where the Space Marines are the Heros of the Day but suffer horrible losses that cripple entire chapters if not doom them. This is the decline of the Imperium that is fighting with its back to the wall, doing some of its greatest battles but in the end the attrition will bring down the imperium. The eternal defence, made of the men of the Imperial Guard will fail one day and even the astartes might not save the breach and what happens then is totaly up to fluff interpretation.\n\nThe 6th ed rulebook sets the tone of the Imperium in decline. But beyond that you just don't get the Impression.\n\nA good deal of this is because as FieserMoep says, the vast majority of modern setting BL books are written from the point of view of the Imperium and the hero has to save the day. It's exasperated because there will never be a book from the Tyranids perspective and unlikely to be one from the Necrons point of view so it's going to be hard to sell them as a legitimate threat when they are only going to turn up in books to be defeated There's not much they can do about that unless they learn how to write books where the heros victory is in the face of defeat or that they specifically go out of their way to illustrate that their one victory is surrounded by defeat. In a way it would help to go back to their origin story for inspiration, the Horus Heresy was a classic give and take with victory snatched from the jaws of deafeat at the last minute. The Imperium won but it was greatly weakend.\n\nThis is the reason I picked on Forgeworlds books. They do a lot to expand the setting and go into great length to descibe all forces involved but the Imperium doesn't nescesarily need to win.\n\nI don't think the worldwide campaigns are a bad idea, in fact I think there should be more of it. It's the execution that's at fault. The end result doesn't need to be a total victory one way or another. If each location had one world to fight over the end result could be to limit how many worlds the Imperium looses with the dramatic final battle being for an Important world that is effected by how many planets had been lost or taken by each side up to that point The real threath would be chaos, which would have wasted a lot of their great firepower assaulting the empire, and the tyranids that can boast gigantic armies. But still, one world can halt or stop them, as seen on Maccrage. I'm not saying, in any realistic way that this will certainly happen, I'm saying that nothing can make sure that one specie like mankind, with all their technology, power, capacity to populates its worlds and anything, it could easily get back on track with the right leader.\n\nBecause actually, the Imperium is on the brink of collapse because of its sheer importance; the Imperium is everywhere and all the galactic species are in war against it. When it won't be the case anymore, do you think all the xenos will continue to attack it without fighting each other? Mankind will become again a small power like it was before the Imperium, and then, they will have the choice to get back on track or getting killed slowly.\n\nDuring M15 they had functional STC and technological advancement continuing. M31 they had the Emporer the Primarchs and the Legions, as well as advancing (all be it far more slowly tech) M41? Stagnation and an empire that is barely holding together.\n\nThe short answer is that the 40k setting has an enormous amount of room chronologically and geographically for more stories to be told without advancing the official time line. This is one of its greatest strengths.\n\nAs an addendum to that, the over arching story is not the life and death of the setting, it's support for the numerous table top games, novels, rpgs, card games, board games, short stories, and computer games which drive its existence. To assume that the story moving forward and flopping or not moving forward and stagnating will kill the setting is probably hysterical and ultimately false. Regardless, its making assumptions about market viability that are super speculative mostly meaningless.\n\nIf the questions becomes one of personal vision/story/interpretation/preference rather than franchise survival we can all happily pitch in without pretending our opinionating is something it's not.\n\nAs to my opinion, I too find Abnett and even Mitchell to be more compelling storytellers for the setting than most of the others, but I also am devoted to the idea that there is no canon, that all material could be propaganda, misinformation, confused records, misreporting, or blatant falsehoods. This too is a great strength of the setting and allows it to absorb even the apocalyptically bad material produced by Ward without suffering a fatal injury. After all, who is to say that reports of the Grey Knights bathing in the blood of battle sisters is not Chaos propaganda, misheard tales of the secretive Chamber militant of the secretive Ordo Malleus of the secretive Inquisition, or maybe just a transcription error in the records. Such flexibility makes me so much happier than swallowing all the Ward-**** as fact.\n\nSo does the time line need to move forward? Nope.\n\nCan it? Sure.\n\nWill it kill the setting? Nah.\n\nMust it change it completely or be inadequate? Don't think that either.\n\nThe apocalyptic change here involves a great threat, but great threats liek the Horus Heresy et. al. did not destroy the setting, they added depth to it, they gave it history. Must this conflict's resolution end all conflict? I don't think so. The first Horus Heresy book has a line in which a certain famous Iron Fist tells a key Luna Wolf that \"there is no ending the crusade, once it has conquered the Space Marines will still have to fight to preserve what they have gained, in the future, there is only war.\" No reason that can't be the case even with an Imperium victory.\n\nA fundamental feature of 40k is that it allows cool armies to fight, as mentioned above. To maintain that you want to maintain all the armies existence. No problem. Here is a possible arrangement which allows for climax, without destroying all the factions.\n\nImperium - Have the Imperium survive, great epic (if not total) victory, climax achieved. Also, there, that faction exists (and by faction I mean lots of factions). And yeah, they still totally fight each other, so even if they are winning, a standoff (or dragged out victory with lots more battles for the setting) is possible.\n\nTyranids - Have the Tyranids get driven off, all but annihilated even. The Tyranids have a bounce-back mechanic, so wiping out all that exist now is totally irrelevant to them once again becoming a threat. Does this diminish the climax? Why should it? Does the end of WWI diminish the importance of WWII? We can always have more Tyranid fleets show up, or have fleets return after eating worlds somewhere safe and unnoticed. So, this faction exists too. Obviously if you want to end them as a major threat, that is in the cards too. Also, the Tyranids fight each other, so even if they have not been wiped out, a standoff is possible.\n\nNecrons - Totally have the bounce back mechanic of \"more wake up\" super easy to brign back as a threat after defeated, minor or major, as desired. faction preserved. Also, they fight each other, so even if they have not been wiped out, a standoff is possible.\n\nTau - Who cares, they are a side-show pocket empire amongst pocket empires. if youw ant them to be major fine, have their communism spread like wildfire and unite humans/more aliens and vastly expand their power base. If you want them gone, super easy to make that happen. if you want them dominant as a ruling class, have them science up a massive tech advantage. if you don't care, leave them a sideshow. Regardless, faction preserved. Also, they can totally fight each other (you were mind/pheremone controlling us? *zap*), so even if they have not been wiped out and are somehow winning, a standoff is possible.\n\nEldar - These guys are super overrated in galactic power struggles, they seriously throw their whole population as militia at other factions to have an army, not exactly a winning plan when your birthrate is nil and your population close to nil. Still, if you want them to matter you deus ex machina distant craft worlds returning etc. if you want them to keep their \"in decline\" theme going, don't change anything. Faction preserved. Also, they fight each other, so even if they have not been wiped out but are somehow winning, a standoff is possible.\n\nDarkEldar - Yeah, scavengers on the periphery in some out-of-the-way stronghold? No reason to mess with this really. Faction preserved. Also, they fight each other, so even if they have not been wiped out and are somehow winning, a standoff is possible.\n\nChaos – Totally also has a bounce back mechanic, you can wipe them out, drive them into the eye, slaughter them all, heck you can do away with the eye itself and Chaos is totally plausible as a returning entity. Almost any amount of victory can be accompanied by a continuing threat of Chaos major or minor in its role. Also they fight each other, so even if they have not been wiped out and are somehow winning, a standoff is possible.\n\nOrks – Also with the bounce back mechanic, also with the fighting each other. Also with their role being major or minor.\n\nAs far as victory for the Imperium changing it fundamentally I am not sure it would need to, driving off its many enemies might be a unifying moment, but the spoils of victory could be squabbled over. Even if the Imperium is re-energized it's still gargantuan, no amount of vanquished foes really ends their enormous logistical problems and constant brush wars. One can Deus Ex Machina an end to these things if one wants to, but why?\n\nAs to how the victory might come about I can conceive of amny plausible scenarios including the aforementioned propensity of every other faction to shoot each other in the back. The Imperium has enormous resources and large quantities of hero fodder, grinding that entire machine into motion can win by sheer numbers, honestly the only thing stopping even the Tyranids from being outnumbered by the force of man is organization. I am highly amused by the image of Tyranids being overwhelmed by waves of Guard (also can I just say that every calorie spent moving, thinking, fighting, shooting, etc. it bio matter expended, the Tyranids are not a perfect closed system, they need fuel and their own losses are still losses, even if they can recycle parts, what makes them work is getting to eat defenseless masses, a planet full of algae is a Tyranid gold mine, a defended planet is really not, espeically one with no eco-system left – 40 billion people on a hive world is still less bio-mass than the insects on our earth). Furthermore, the Necrons have a time bomb in the form of the current fluff's explanation of the C'tan as betrayed and basically enslaved. Let them get desperate and release too many shards on the battlefield and who knows if a freed and vengeful C'tan doesn't burn out half the Necron armies before succumbing? The Emperor returning obviously has all sorts of potential for Deus Ex Machina, as does his being reborn. The Imperium is honestly just one major STC discovery away from getting the upper hand (imagine a fully-functioning STC factory for TDA, or titans). But honestly, just having the Imperium pull it out in a big effort with lots of players and lots of close battles and lots of internecine conflict and eventually prevail is great fodder for extending the time line, letting us have our climax, and still letting the Imperium win, no need for the Deus Ex Machina at all really.\n\nReally the only feature that messes with the setting so much that it will fundamentally change to storyline would be the Golden Throne/Emperor Reborn/ Emperor Revivified/Emperor Dead/Astronomicon waning plot line, and that need not truly transform everything about the setting. If the Emperor gets off the Throne and starts running things again there is no reason to assume that he will be of the same mind he was 10000-12000 years before. One can easily replace Emperor entombed in Golden Throne with Emperor sits on Golden Throne and carry on. The psyker sacrifices could even keep fueling the Astronomicon, now operated remotely by a walking, talking Emperor who is totally busy trying to conform institutions that have become engrained for millenia to his will, or maybe he is damaged or paranoid after the betrayal and his vision is rather less beatific, or maybe whether he is whole in mind will be the parallel in M.42 to whether he is alive or dying in the previous ten millenia.\n\nTLDR: The time line need not move forward, but the themes and factions of 40k are totally preservable even if the time line moves forward, a climax is had, and details change."

Friendly assistants get owned too fast, then capital owes me.\n\nIt depend what kind of Capital ship it is. Pegasi are probably the easiest of the Capital Ships, because it doesn't bristle with guns, But since it has the highest level of engine upgrades of any ship, its shields recharge very quickly.\n\nIf it's a Nexus, don't try to get very close to them. outfit your side turrets with the longest range weapon possible, So you can circle around them and bombard them from afar, because they're too slow to get anywhere near you. Once one side is down on shields, divert all shield power to the front and afterburn your way towards it and dive bomb it with torpedoes. Rinse, repeat until nothing is left.\n\nDon't really bother with the fighter escort. Usually the friendlies will go for them first. also, get a wingman before your encounter, and try to get an expensive one so that they have good gear. Then you get one more meatshield assistant that you can also order around so that it doesn't try to take on the Capital Ship by itself. _________________ I eat syrofoam cups.\n\nI just learned something.... if you fight a Pegasus, and you are flying a Pegasus, and you have an AI controlled rear turret with a fully boosted Tachyon Cannon, you can hit afterburner and maintain a distance that allows your turret to hit him but leaves you out of his range. Then just run like crazy in a straight line, and eventually he will blow.\n\nI did take down a Retro Nexus using the technique I posted above, except I did it in a Pegasus instead of a Nexus, using the rear turret instead of the side turret. It took over an hour of intense micromanagement, with many, many coffee breaks, just to get it's shields down. I then dive bombed it with dual torpedoes.\n\nI attempted to try to take a Pegasus down in a Ulysses. I was going pretty well before it turned it's front towards me. You can guess what happened next.\n\nAnd I swore I changed my shield levels to the front. If not, we should be able to.\n\nI don't believe it, but I managed to down a capital ship for the first time with my humble Galaxy. Was armed with neutron guns in the fore and aft, had an Orion-piloting wingman and four mercs with me. For some reason I just kept at it, firing at it even though I'd reloaded a bunch of times already and was pretty sure I'd lose.\n\nI kept pummeling it with EMP torpedoes and neutron blasts as a few of the mercs exploded around me and... suddenly I knocked out its power supply and was aboard. A few dead pirates later and I could safely blow the ship up! Granted it was just a Pegasus, but I have to say that was pretty rewarding to finally take one down!\n\nAlso, I didn't know their cargo holds were so big; I got quite a haul afterward.\n\nDon't mean to brag or anything, but here's a 2 min. movie of me taking out a Pegasus, without the help of any hunters, and with out any damage to my ship. This is definitely the most cowardly way to do it, but it works about 40-50 % of the time. It's the \"Flyboy maneuver\"\n\nThere's an idea. You get a limb blown off, you get a robotic replacement for cheap, but it's not as good as a vat grown body part clone...\n\nAfter 600 years of development cybernetic limbs should be at least as good as natural... but cheaper artificial replacement shouldn't be fixed in Autodoc. It'll require some \"workshop\", CyberHospital or at least nanobots (like for ship's guns; with \"patched\" status - less efficiency). _________________ Genuine Lifelike IndividualJournalists are looking for sensations usual. Some \"scientists\" in XIX century thought that amount of horses in cities should be limited in future otherwise we'll be walking in horse s**t because \"cleaning services\" can't work fast enough... _________________ Genuine Lifelike Individual\n\nAgain, science fiction is a relative thing... I'm not sure I get your continued assurance that things follow through. Why is everyone speaking cigar-chomping English? Why does everyone wear slightly changed airforce garb? Why is everything named after 20th century stuff, and people are still referencing World War II like it was yesterday?\n\nIt's because we're not in the future, and we don't know how things will go.\n\nSo, this is a gameplay idea, not a magical prediction sphere. This is a game with Plutonium in asteroids, for heaven's sake.\n\nThe robo limb is the cheap replacement, left over from when they used them. Now they use vat-grown stuff, but because people can't afford it, they're often given the cheap, old replacements instead until they can afford it. See? Not so hard to come up with a reason, but the reasons don't matter. It's a gameplay idea."

If you are looking using a radar and you know that the enemy is stealthy but only has a short range AA flying high makes it harder to shoot you.\n\nActually, does anyone know what the optimal altitude is for spotting surface ships? I've had a few instances where I've had my aircraft radar turned on and still a ship manages to remain undetected until my plane was almost on top of it. Just earlier I was scouring the sea with 4 aircraft for a lone Skjold, all with active sensors on, and it wasn't until my aerial refueling tanker flew right over it that I managed to detect it.\n\nThe Skjold is a stealthy ship, so you have to get really close to see it. It depends a lot on the radar resolution, too, but most often I see it on IR or even Visual. Ironically, it's easier to hear (sonar) than see."

I can ping 'em till my fingers bleed, and still they won't notice me. Same about the periscope : I could shine a lighthouse bulb out of it, and they wouldn't notice. They've got no escort, no depth charges, no nothing. Should be a turkey shoot, right ? WRONG.\n\nOut of every salvo of 4 fishes I shoot at the leader, only one explodes, tops (I'm in a Salmon, can't shoot more than 4 in one sitting). I've tried many setups. 45° constant bearing. 20°. 60°. 5°. With PK and using constant bearings. Periscope ranging and sonar ranging. I could hit those cruisers with my eyes closed. Yet every damn time, \"torpedo was a dud, sir !\".\n\nNow, on to the question : is it supposed to be that way in 01/42 RFB 1.52 ? I know early war Mk. 14s were crummy and failed 95% of the time at a 90° angle, but surely some angles worked, right ? I tried many, many solutions in this pre-set configuration, and nothing gives me more than one lousy detonation out of 4 torps. What gives ? What's the magic angle ? Or is it supposed to be that way ? And if it is, at what date can I expect a modicum of gosh darned certainty that my torps are going to go BOOM instead of *clunk* ?\n\nETR3(SS)\n\n10-09-2009, 04:52 PM\n\nI'd say that sounds about right to me.

The magnetic exploder is fubar. You should find a way for them to have an unfortunate accident rendering them inoperative. Torpedoes hitting targets at a torpedo track angle of 90º will mostly be duds.\n\nThe unofficial scuttlebutt is to set the suckers on the surface, magnetic exploders somehow inoperative and plan for duds.\n\nYou didn't hear it from me.

I don't believe the glorious Navy would deliver faulty ordinance to its captains, do you ?\n\nBut is that all of them, always 12 feet ? I assumed it was a random 1-12 value. So I tried to compensate for that, however, setting them on 7 (so, in my mind, between 8 and 19 feet, good for an 18 feet draft) had them consistently zip right past the keel.\n\nIn any case, all right then.

So if you manage to get a torpedo to run right under a keel... it can magnetic detonate. Does the switch work pre '43 for M+I vs. I? There have been some SH games and/or mods where the switch didn't change the pistols... it was M+I till it got disabled via the date and then was just I.\n\nKobal2\n\n10-13-2009, 05:46Yup. I finally had a look around the RFB files, and the actual numbers until '43 are :\n\nSeems a bit on the high side - I might end up shaving 10% off them eventually. But for now, sticking to 20° shots seems to do the trick, although they're not easy to set up and get messed up easily if the target sees the torpedo wake and dodges... which they often do. Ah, dammit, MAN THE DECK GUN !\n\nAkula4745\n\n10-13-2009, 06:40 AM\n\nInteresting numbers... I knew the dud rate was pretty steep... but wow.\n\nFrederf\n\n10-13-2009, 04:42 PM\n\nDo MK14 have \"impact whiskers\" or does a grazing shot not hit the impact pistol? Are these dud rates versus the physical 3D angle of impact or are these based on AOB?\n\nKobal2\n\n10-14-2009, 11:06 AM\n\nNot sure what the first part means :oops: but the dud rates are for the physical angle of impact, not the AOB you're shooting from.\n\nSteamWake\n\n10-14-2009, 11:33 AM\n\nDo MK14 have \"impact whiskers\" or does a grazing shot not hit the impact pistol? Are these dud rates versus the physical 3D angle of impact or are these based on AOB?\n\nI believe they did have the 'whiskers' which is why a 90 degree impact often fails (but 100%?). The impact would crush the trigger causing the whiskers to not operate properly.\n\nKobal2\n\n10-17-2009, 01:18 PM\n\nThis just in : those numbers I gave ? They're apparently divided by 2 should you use slow torpedo speed instead of high. Which makes a lot of sense, considering the historical problem was due to old detonators getting crunched by high speed impacts they hadn't been rated for.\n\nFrederf\n\n10-17-2009, 03:17 PM\n\nI believe they did have the 'whiskers' which is why a 90 degree impact often fails (but 100%?). The impact would crush the trigger causing the whiskers to not operate properly.\n\nNo, they would have whiskers and a frontal piston detonator. The dud from frontal impact was due to the piston being crushed instead of moving normally.\n\nWhat I was getting at is that people need to realize is that even a torpedo striking directly into the side (90 deg track) of a ship still isn't a 90 degree shot...because the target's hull curves in the vertical direction unless you shoot at the waterline.\n\nThe dud values may seem high as a function of angle but realize that your \"80 deg\" shot is more like a \"60 deg\" shot considering the shape of the target isn't just a flat slab.\n\nmagic452\n\n10-18-2009, 12:44 AM\n\nGood point Frederf but is that modeled in the game or is the target just a flat slab in the game?\n\nMagic\n\nArclight\n\n10-18-2009, 12:30 PM\n\nIt's modeled; hitting a ship very low at the keel is more likely to have it just glance off because the angle is too shallow.\n\nI'm surprised it took so long for someone to post to set the torpedoes to slow speed, this subject has been beaten to death so many times. Figured it was common knowledge by now. :-? :lol:\n\nFrederf\n\n10-19-2009, 02:32 AM\n\nGood point Frederf but is that modeled in the game or is the target just a flat slab in the game?\n\nMagic\n\nWell I know that the ship hulls aren't just big boxes with right angles. Certainly we've all had glancing blows off the bottom of the keel before. What I wanted to know is if the dud chance was a function of the actual fire geometry interaction or if it was simply calculated based on: abs (ship course - torpedo course), which would be really lame."

I picked EPTW incase the battery was on cooldown and I want to save ET and someone dropped my weapons. But, really it's something to use if you don't need to run ETPS and won't bump heads w/Aux2Batt atm. You could also slot a 2nd ET if facing heavy VM.\n\nIt's not designed to be tanky, but just enough to apply high pressure AoE DPS w/Tet glider and Dem3 and CVS. You should be able to hit and run w/it while chaining the AoE DPS if you're not chased away. Since by in large the raiders and escorts for KDF are being left in the dust I'm trying to build it to fill that role as best I can.One of my chars is a tac on a fleet Qin raptor. This beast is wuite tanky but it's clearly not enough to resist to anything. In many instances I try to stay close to my team mates to get some extra heal if they notice that the escort in the team isn't in a good shape, and since my raptor is DSP oriented with a tac in it, pulling all the aggro isn't rare.\n\nThe fact is that tacs in cruisers are spending all their available time taking pleasure (if you know what I mean) watching their dps instead of healing those who can punch through ennemies. And the poor escorts have to find their way to survive, fly in escape mode pretty often because none of these genius had the idea to send an extra heal they probably don't have since their primary objective is to \"pull the aggro for themselves\" and to \"dps a lot\". When I say that in weeks I've NEVER recieved a heal from tacs on cruisers you can believe me. They must be too busy doing laughable \"dps\".\n\nI don't mind if they survive more honnestly, they will never pull the aggro away from my raptor and will never send extra heals they don't have to allow those who have real dps (and not slightly improved puny dps) to survive cantI'm talking about cruisers in general, not about a specific KDF cruiser anyway. 99% of tacs on cruisers are noobs anyway, they play for themselves only and don't care about the rest of the team, so it proves my point. The tac on cruiser is the kind of solo guy playing for himself onlyHmmm....first off, the Galor is not 'the fed genuine battlecruiser', as it is not a Fed ship at all. Fed and KDF characters have exactly the same access to the ship (which is to say, none without spending real money and getting lucky), and its stats aren't that different from an Excelsior or Regent in any event. Your understanding of where ships fit in the game seems lacking.\n\nSecond off, you assume Engineers in cruisers heal other ships. I have found that the ship type has no effect on which characters heal others, and ninety-five percent of those who could heal others do not do so. While the ship selection can make it easier to heal, the decision to heal is entirely the player's. My Tac in his K'tinga heals others quite regularly because I choose to set the ship up that way. I have been in a great number of STFs and Fleet missions, and few if any Engineers have healed anyone, regardless of their ships. People are generally too busy fighting their own ships and only concerned with what they are doing, and won't take time to be the healer unless the player is interested in that beforehand.\n\nIf a player wants to be the healer in a group, the Cruiser will give them the best ability to do that, regardless of their profession, and they will likely still do it in whatever ship they fly. If they don't want to be, then it doesn't matter what they are in. On the flip side, Tac captains will always do more damage than other professions in whatever ship they fly, just as Eng captains will heal more of their own damage than other professions. So, your argument would only be valid if you had said \"A Tac captain in a cruiser is a waste because they can't keep themselves alive as long as an Eng captain, and damage isn't as important to me as personal survivability\".\n\nThere are a few select Cruisers that run well on Tacticals, my main KDF runs a Galor and with the Universal Station as a Tactical Boff it works very well as both a heavy hitter and a tank, I can also buff allies with it as well which allows me to also preform the role of an Engineer 50% of the time while still doing the heavy damage.\n\nI normally only fun Tacs in Escorts/Raptors/Raiders but Kevaas is an exception. The Fleet Vorcha from it's stats looks ideal for a Tactical Officer with the high Tactical station.\n\ndiogene0, Tacticals in Cruisers on the Federation sides are as you say, the KDF side I find is more flexible, thanks to several factors including the higher turn rates, DHC's plus the +10 Power to weapons. I'm not saying every Cruiser is right for a Tactical but the Galor and from what it looks like the Fleet Vorcha seem to work wellAll of these ships are cruisers, which means that they have to survive in any case, even against an elite tac cube, the gate of infected space elite without any trick.\n\nIf you need an Engineer to do those things that's a statement about your abilities, or rather inabilities.\n\nSo speak for yourself, since quite a lot of us can do that with any captain in a well-built cruiser.\n\nOn top of that any Tac, or even Sci, captain in a Cruiser with the same or similar ranks in threat control will always out-threat you - leaving you following along, your special abilities largely unused as all of the tanking gets done by another ship.\n\nDon't mistake poorly built ships and bad players you meet in the PUG queue as the final word on what can be done in a CruiserSaved me the need to post. QFT.\n\n_______________ 4/4 Z-Store KDF Specific Bugs fixed! Thank you from the bottom of my wallet! I'm going to go buy some Zen points for a rainy day. Here's another batch about visualsNadion and EPS mean absolutely nothing in the face of Tac Damage buffs - it's not even remotely close and your idea of \"15 extra DPS\" is so far off the mark as to just come across as silly."

      "text": "After quite a bit of work done by the player community by the looks of things on the test server at the moment (as of 13 October 2008) the devs are going to simply ignore any and all issues related to blasters and just let them be collateral damage from the speed changes. GG CCP.\n\nMy prediction: blasters get ruined and stay that way for a year or more before getting fixed. Hell, the devs didn't even *touch* on the subject in the live dev blog.\n\nI sincerely hope that I'm wrong, but in light of CCP's past track record I don't think that I will be.\n\nUpdate 25 Nov 2008:\n\nAll the issues that I said would happen have happened, in spades. Not only are blasters generally crap on TQ now, but solo/small gang PVP has taken a huge turn for the worse with the web nerf. I have yet to find a single player that has said 'wow, I really like this web nerf.'\n\nI've completely stopped using the Hype, as well as the Thorax, Deimos and Brutix. I've used the Astarte and Megathron a couple of times, but this is rare. I've had to resort to the Kronos almost exclusively.\n\nSo far all of my 'predictions' have come true to the letter. My latest prediction: CCP ignores all the PVP player's threads and continues on with their campaign to ruin solo/small gang PVPlooked at it myself, 1. the acceleration time from 0 to 800 is twice as long as before, not just top speed. thats a HUGE difference... go ahead, go log on to SISI and have a feel for it. turn the thing on a BS and see how long it takes to close in on your target... =P\n\n2. errrr... I have no clue what you are talking about, never had that problem (but I have tracking computer always...)\n\nand no, the 5km range gun IS the issue when combined with the speed nerf.... you can not get into range in against any pvp fitted opponent to do dmg...\n\nin fact, any decent/competent pilot WILL kite your Blasterboat and shred it with something that has a longer range =P ... effectively, blasterboats will only work if you got a covet op drop a warp to zero right on target..(that or the target is being bumped by something)\n\n\"Okay here's what I'm noticing in regards to the MWD + Web nerf + Scram change. Nothing to do with the nano change.\n\nIt looks like any ship that uses close range turrets NEEDS to have a Scram fitted instead of a Warp Disruptor. Why? With the web nerf from 90% to 60% I'm noticing a lot of smaller ships are able to orbit within that 9km range and deactivate your MWD. Since most smaller ships can't/don't fit webs, this change with scrams effectively slows down any target larger than it by not allowing the use of a MWD. So if you want to try to get back to a gate, you're going to have to try and weather the damage or fit an AB, however ABs still are much too slow on a BS (example, I go 123 m/s on one of my Mega setups, with AB I go 327 m/s). So essentially this new scram mechanic is acting like another web by not allowing you any maneuverability.\n\nAlso in regards to the scram. This is a turret nerf as I've noticed most small ships can still orbit faster than your turrets can track, even while they're webbed. Coupled with a tracking disruptor this ship is basically immune to most blaster turrets (still testing). So it looks like CCP just swapped missiles not hitting faster targets for turrets not hitting faster targets. An example of this is a Hawk can fit 1 scram, 1 web, 1 MWD and while being webbed by my deimos it's still orbiting somewhere in the 1000+m/s range at 8km. My guns can track for the most part, just barely, but that's without a tracking disruptor on me. And if you don't have any Null ammo you're completely screwed since it can get out of your range pretty fast. The only saving grace I saw was that I could still use my Warrior IIs to kill the target, but other than that my HAC was completely uselss without a Warp Scrambler to shut off the other ship's MWD and slow it down enough to really do something.\n\nAnyways, this is just something I've noticed. With the whole Warp Scram change, it's basically making Warp Disruptors useless for close range ships, or most ships in general. I say this because let's say you warp 20km from your target. Well, your target can still MWD off, get out of range from your point, and warp off. It's much harder to chase them down using a MWD that's only giving 500% boost across the board per module, and if you're using an AB then you can forget about it. So let's say you're using a MWD with Disruptor and they have a Scram. Well they can MWD in range, use their Scram, deactivate your MWD and now your Disruptor is just a wasted slot, you should have fitted a Scram to turn off their MWD because your web isn't effective enough. But if you're using a Scram then you better hope you warp in range to get a point otherwise they can just run away as well.\n\nSo maybe Disruptors aren't the ones really becoming useless, maybe it's the webs huh? Warp 20km or so, point, MWD to use your Scram, that's 3 points on the target, AND they can't MWD out of range.\n\nEDIT: The way I see it, this change to MWDs, Scrams, and Webs is nerfing effective ganking especially in larger ships.\"That's if we're talking large fights though. If you look at it on a smaller scale it's a problem.\n\n acceleration accelerationNot when I have a 9km scram on me and am doing 10m/sec with no MWD I'm not. And just forget about the afterburner concept. Try using one on SISI and you'll understand.\n\nOriginally by:Theron GyrowOriginally by:Typhado3Heh. Who said you had to play the game to win, hey?\n\n/me salutes you for your doomed cavalry charge at the artillery.\n\nProblem is that the good ships and the crap ships cost the same ISK (ie time to grind income).... Hence why Caldari Drakes are so popular...not everyone likes spending more of their time grinding ISK to lose more poorly balanced ships just because they like the style involved. Too many people like winning rather than playing :D\n\nOriginally by:Zephyr RengateQuick question, can a BS still use a MWD to burn back to the gate if caught in a camp?\n\nI believe its going to die horribly ...not that there would be any reason to jump a BS solo through gate anyways with all jump bridges and carriers and jump freighters around ...unless you are the one trying to have some fun without a huge blob, but that doesnt seem to be supported by CCP at all\n\nOriginally by:Kagura NikonWith T1 guns and Min BS4 I hopped in a Tempest and went 1v1 vs a Mega, then a Hype. With the 5th mid and a 9km T2 2 point scram I was able to counter web both BS and shut off their MWDS, dictate range and tracking and kill them.\n\nThe slight change in the Minmatar BS mass is a non factor. BS are so slow that the overall speed differential between the Min and Gal BS is extremely small. It's not like the difference beween my Ishtar and my Vagabond for instance.\n\nSo yes, the Hype is DEFINITELY WORSE now. Stop posting unless you've actually tested the ships in question, AND have tested each one from both sides at least 3-4 timesThis. Before HICs, Remote boosted Lachs were the premier tackle for gate camps. They'll now be insta-death to MWDs, replacing Rapiers, or at least in combination with Rapiers."

Now here is my question, if you get access to your officers abilities in space by putting them in stations, why is it i can use my BO's unlocked abilities in space who aren't even in a station at all and why can i assign a lt engineer into an ensign slot but not my lt tac or science officer into an ensign slot as well?\n\nPlease help lol\n\nYou are misunderstanding how Bridge Stations work. Bridge Stations have 2 attributes the class/career of the Bridge officer that is allowed to be assigned to it and a rank. Allowable Bridge Officers (BOFFs) will be Tactical, Engineering, Science or Universal. If the allowed BOFF are career specific, you can only assign a BOFF of that career to that station; i.e. you can only assign an Engineering BOFF to an Engineering Bridge Station. Rank does not matter in this regard. You can assign any Bridge Officer to a Universal Station.\n\nRank of the Station comes into play when determining which abilities of the assigned BOFF can be used. The Rank of a Station is the highest ranked abilities of the BOFF that can be used. So if you assign a Commander rank BOFF to a Lieutenant Rank Bridge Station, you will only be able to used the Ensign and Lieutenant rank abilities of the BOFF. Likewise, you can slot an Ensign ranked BOFF into a Commander Rank station, but you'll only be able to use the Ensign rank abilitiy of the BOFF So the rule of thumb is that the higher of the Rank of the Station or the Rank of the Bridge Officer determined the most powerful ability of the Bridge Officer assigned to the station.\n\nExtra Commissioned Bridge Officers (i.e. BOFF on the left side of the Stations window) which are not assigned to a Bridge Station don't have any affect in space. However you can change Station assignments anytime you are not in combat."

Look at Phaser they stun human players for half the time compared to comps.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by lordmalak1\n\nSay what ?\nHuman opponents are the hardest enemies to defeat in the game. There's nothing in the PvE game that requires gear that can't be crafted or dropped from FE missions. Just getting slaughtered in a PvP match shouldn't be considered sufficient enough to earn access to the best gear in the game (I'm assuming will be better than anything currently available in-game). If you're not going to play PvP then why would you want gear that's ineffective against PvE opponents and require you to refit/change ships if you decide to play a PvE battle ? And if you've earned gear suitable to battle the hardest enemies in the game why would you accept them being less than optimal against inferior enemies compared to inferior gear ?\n\nIf the reputation system gave people no PvP credits or so few when losing and they have hard time being on wining side (unlucky with bad teams) or they are below average they will never have a chance to get better gear unless they exploit the system with other exploiters.\n\nThis PvP system would be a system that is designed for PvP because it is a PvP reputation system. The gear can still be used in PvE but would not be as good. If the gear is good in PvP then those who PvP would use it. Their is already gear that is better against specific opponents like against Borg or Tholians the same would be for PvP why is that so bad?"

SNB+VM is only ONE thing that science can do, granted its the OP flavor of the week but still.\n\neasy way to fix this is\n\n1) Totally get rid of Pulse Feedback as a skill, there is no reason beams should be the only weapon that cant be used in PvP, instead keep it as a 'proc' on a science ship or on any ship piloted by a Science captain, and even then have it only trigger like one pulse every few fires.\n\n2) remove those tractor skills and put them into engineering, make tractor beam itself a universal skill on all ships, i cant think of many ships that fly around without the use of this important tool.\n\n3) Keep SNB as it is but make the ship immune to VM or any form of 'hold' that isnt a tractor beam.\n\n4) after being hit with VM, make the target immune to it for a duration of 30 seconds. If the target uses Science team to get rid of it this still applies.\n\nThe problem is mostly, if you have uni slots your GOING to have one tac officer and the rest is going to be Science officers.

I'd prefer it that way because it gives you something definite. Offroading always sucks at the same level so I don't have to reevalute the situation with every new tech I get. I won't have to check my enemies techs every other turn to see if starlanes still act as choke points or if they are more or less worthless already. The main idea behind starlanes was to create some sort of \"terrain\", do we want to remove that in mid- to late game?We went over the fact that starlanes would be permanent in the very early days of freeorion...i think mainly because we wanted to give terrain and shape to the galaxy. Think of starlanes as like mountains and deserts in Civ, they're always there, so live with it. (note I said \"Civ\" and not Civ 2 or 3....you can change terrain in those versions a la engineers and workers)If starlanes connect only neighbouring stars, that would considerably decrease their importance as terrain, since it is easier to go to neighbouring stars anyway. I think both the length of starlanes should be bell-curved.\n\nMaybe also the number of starlanes per system - this way it would both be easier on the AI maybe? What do the AI guys think?

Can they span the entire galaxy or do they connect to the nearest stars first and then the next nearest, and so on.\n\nI think we can make this a configuration option. MOO3 has a similar option where you specify starlane length and the number of them.\n\nNightFish wrote:\n\nIs the number of Starlanes per system completely random, meaning that a system with only one starlane can occur everywhere and not just in the outer rim?\n\nIf you can think of any other things we need to know about starlanes, feel free to add them.\n\nI think the answer to this depends on your first question. If we have starlanes only connecting close planets, then one would assume that you'd have only outer rim systems with one starlane. If they're fairly random, then I don't see why we couldn't have \"dead end\" systems in the core. I personally favor this second idea.\n\nWe definitely should limit the maximum length of a starlane, though.

I thought this was too much work to see exactly the geography of the galaxy and I'm glad we decided to go with 2D for FO.\n\nAbout the A to B, whilst intersecting C.......good question. Here are some thoughts:\n\n- We can simply not allow this to happen during universe creation. We do a check to ensure that each starlane intersects with two and only two systems.\n\n- We represent said starlanes as beziers, and curve them around the systems in question (not recommdended)\n\n- We can represent these starlanes as a line that darkens or lightens based on how close it is to the intersected planet. Example: suppose A connects to B, but the starlane must be drawn so that it goes through C.\n\nPlease excuse this crude drawing\n\nCode:\n\nA------------------C-----------------B ^ ^ ^ ^ | | | | -> Line starts | | Line ends <- out white | | up white | | again As the line <- | approaches -> As the line system B, it moves away from begins to fade system B, it to a semi- gradually gets transparent more opaque."

      "text": "Quote: You can find them in the Core rule books. Not sure if they have a free download for the construction rules.\n\nThere are no construction rule free (legal) downloads. You can download .pdf copies of the core books, including Tech Manual (construction rules for many vehicle types), from various online RPG retailers.\n\nI can provide a summary here, though. Construction is based on BattleMech rules, with the following exceptions:\n\nYou only can use \"IndustrialMech (IM) Internal Structures,\" not endosteel or other fancy structures. IM structures are 20% of the IM's mass. A 100-ton 'Mech thus has a 20-ton structure. IMs can be quad mechs, but not omnis.\n\nIndustrialMech movement and engine rating are found the same way as BattleMechs, with the following engine options: standard fusion, internal combustion, fuel cell, and fission. XL, light, and compact fusion are not available. Internal combustion engines are twice as heavy as a standard fusion engine (SFE) of the same rating; fuel cell engines are 20% heavier than a SFE of the same rating, round up to the nearest half ton; and fission engines are 75% heavier than a SFE of the same rating, round up to the nearest tonnage. ICEs come with 600km of fuel by default, and fuel cells have 450km by default.\n\nIndustrialMechs need gyros like BattleMechs. They may only use standard gyroscopes.\n\nIndustrialMechs may have jump jets, but only if they're fission or fusion powered.\n\nIndustrialMech basic cockpits are 3 tons. They are simpler than BattleMech cockpits, suffering a +1 to all attack rolls and lacking ejection seats. Those shortcomings may be fixed with \"Advanced Fire Control\" (a 0-ton, cost-increasing item) and an ejection seat (0.5 tons, 1 crit). Without Advanced Fire Control, IMs cannot use a lot of fancy electronics (Artemis, C3, etc.)\n\nIndustrialMechs, by default, are creatures of the air and ground. They die in vacuums and underwater. (I think they can wade in depth 1 water, but don't quote me.) Some people like IMs in vacuum, so they can get Environmental Sealing. It is 10% of the IM's mass, rounded up to the nearest full ton. It requires 8 crits at 1 crit per location (each arm, each leg, each torso, and the head, which makes it impossible to mount an ejection seat and environmental sealing together.)\n\nIMs may not use standard Triple Strength Myomers; there is an \"industrial TSM.\" It is 0 tons and 12 crits.\n\nIMs build up heat EXACTLY like BattleMechs EXCEPT - and this is the only exception - that they do not build up heat from walking or running. This means missile weapons and ballistic weapons build up heat on IMs, just like BattleMechs. On the flip side, IMs do use a heat scale - they don't have to be heat-neutral. If you give an industrialmech a PPC and 3 heat sinks, it's quite legal, just dumb. You could even put a PPC on an ICE IndustrialMech with 0 heat sinks, but it would never cool off. (Speaking of that, ICEs and, as I recall, fuel cells do add some new \"fuel explosion\" risks to the heat scale.)\n\nIndustrialMechs may built with only single strength heat sinks. Internal combustion engines come with 0 free heat sinks; fuel cells have 1 free heat sink; fission engines have 5 free heat sinks; and fusion engines have 10 free heat sinks. As with BattleMechs, you can \"hide\" some heat sinks in the engine, at 1 per 25 rating points regardless of engine type. If you built an IM with a 240-rated fuel cell engine (1 free heat sink) and added 10 extra single heat sinks (11 total), you would put 9 in the engine and would have to find critical slots for the other 2.\n\nIndustrialMechs may use one of 3 types of armor: Heavy Industrial, Industrial, and Commercial. IndustrialMechs have the same armor limits as BattleMechs, in terms of points. The three armor types:\n\n\"Heavy Industrial\" is a fancy way of saying, \"standard 16 points/ton BattleMech armor.\"\n\nFor industrial armor, you pick the tons you want, multiply by 16, and before you get happy and write that down you multiply the points by 0.67, rounded down to the nearest whole number. So if you gave your IndustrialMech 3.5 tons of armor, you'd end up with 3.5 x 16 x 0.67 = 37 points. This means a 100-ton bipedal IM may mount way over 19 tons of armor to get the maximum 307 points of protection.\n\nCommercial armor, on the other hand, gives 24 points per ton. Before you go, \"Yay! Yippee skippy! Commercial armor is da bomb!\", be aware that commercial armor grants any attack of 5 points or more a critical hit roll. So if you build a 100-ton biped IndustrialMech with 300 points of commercial armor (for only 12.5 tons!) with 32 and 45 points on its torso locations, then, no, it will not laugh off a burst from a RAC/5. Each shot that hits has a critical hit opportunity. An Ontos's horde-o-medium lasers is also a critical hit chance.\n\n(Also, this isn't a construction rule, but IndustrialMechs are more prone to critical hits than BattleMechs. Each successful critical hit roll gets a +1 or +2 bonus [I ferget], meaning it's a lot easier to get \"limb amputated\" or triple crits than a BattleMech.)\n\nAdd Equipment: this is pretty much like BattleMechs. Sorry, I ain't going to repeat all the spiffy IndustrialMech chainsaw and drill and kitchensink attachments. Note ICE and fuel cell engines require power amplifiers like vehicles: 10% of the weight of energy weapons, rounded up to the nearest half-ton. If you put a PPC on an ICE-powered IndustrialMech, it'll need a 1-ton power amplifier.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to let me know.\n\n-------------------- Mike Miller, Materials Engineer\n\nDisclaimer: Anything stated in this post is unofficial and non-canon unless directly quoted from a published book. Random internet musings of a BattleTech writer are not canon.\n\nAppreciated. Been curious about the IM's ever since they started appearing in MWDA, want to see what variants one can cook up with them.\n\nCommercialHmm... A TargetMech, used to provide missile boats with moving target practice?\n\nQuote: CommercialQuote: What are the rules around having tracks mounted in the legs of a 'Mech? Just spotted the option in SSW, but have no idea what it translates to in game terms (apart from using crits and tonnage).\n\nThe foot tracks are useless in combat except when you have severe gyro or leg actuator damage. They're more suited for tight quarters maneuvering (e.g., mines) where the 'Mech doesn't want to swing its legs to avoid kicking something.\n\nTechManual pg249:\n\nIntroduced: 2440 (Draconis Combine) Tracks are an oddball piece of equipment only found on specialized IndustrialMechs such as MiningMechs and TunnelMechs. Essentially a set of powered, foot-mounted tread-skates, this equipment was developed to enable such units to move better in the tight confi nes of narrow tunnels, where a typical IndustrialMech's legs often cannot manage the full range of motion necessary for safe walking. Though their utility is limited, in some select instances—such as extreme actuator or gyro damage—tracks can get an otherwise crippled 'Mech back to safety in good time. Still, these systems are maintenance-intensive, and limited in speed by their small size. Too fragile for combat, they are almost never seen on BattleMechs. Even among their intended users, tracks are often shunned, with owners often stripping them (or their mechanisms) out in favor of other equipment.\n\nTech Base: Inner Sphere and Clan Unit Restrictions: Only BattleMechs and IndustrialMechs may mount tracks. Construction Rules: 'Mech-based tracks weigh 10 percent as much as the unit on which they are mounted (rounded up to the nearest half-ton). Tracks take up 1 critical slot in each of the 'Mech's legs, so a humanoid 'Mech equipped with tracks requires 2 slots in total, while a quadruped requires 4.\n\npg143 Total Warfare\n\nTRACKS During the Movement Phase, the controlling player of a 'Mech equipped with tracks must declare what movement mode the ´Mech will use throughout the turn—foot or tracked. These modes cannot be combined. Tracks provide Track MP equal to the 'Mech's Walking MP, but do not provide a corresponding Running MP. Actuator critical hits do not reduce tracked movement, but a critical hit on a track—or the loss of a leg containing a track—reduces the Track MP by half for a humanoid chassis (or by a quarter for quad chassis designs). While moving in tracked mode, leg actuator and gyro critical hits do not require a Piloting Skill Roll, though Piloting Skill Rolls for suff ering 20 points of damage or sustaining kick, charge or push attacks are still required and should be modifi ed appropriately for component damage.\n\nWhile using tracked movement, 'Mechs receive all the MP bonuses (including the +1 MP for paved surface movement) and terrain restrictions (including those for heavy woods and Depth 1+ water, not changing more than one level in a hex and so on) that apply to tracked vehicles. Tracked movement generates heat as normal for a walking 'Mech (as with walking, ICE-equipped 'Mechs generate no heat), but TSM movement modifi ers do not apply for a 'Mech using tracked movement. If a 'Mech is using tracked movement in the turn when its gyro is destroyed, it does not automatically fall. In addition, it can continue to use tracked movement provided it starts a Movement Phase on its feet. 'Mechs mounting tracks are more vulnerable to anti-'Mech infantry. Any leg attacks receive a –2 to-hit modifi er"

      "text": "We absolutely appreciate any and all support via buying the game, making a private investment, etc.. :)\n\nSome of the things that you can currently do in StarMade:\n\nExplore: Infinite space in all directions using the X/Y/Z axis you can travel from 0,0,0 to 1000,2000,3000 and so on, but infinitely!!!\n\nDesign: Design the ship of your dreams, from famous ships featured in movies, book lore and other sci-fi/fantasy cannon. Or design something from your own imagination, connecting modules of ships together and challenging your efficiency and design skills. Do you create a ship that kills and destroys everything or a peaceful trading ship that is really just a smugglers ship in disguise?!\n\nCustomize: Create customized weapons, harvesting, repair, shield and other modules by grouping them into geometrical patterns to increase their abilities! With more modules being dreamed up by the StarMade team EVERY DAY, the possibilities are endless!\n\nMultiplayer: StarMade was designed around multiplayer to begin with. Share control of your super massive ship, design a station with friends or conqueor the universe INCLUDING your pals, one sector at a time!!\n\nMultiplatform: This game runs with Java and is OPTIMIZED to run as efficiently as possible, while we may experience some bugs and bumps in alpha and beta, we are more focused on gameplay and engine optimization.\n\nThere are many more features and we will do our best to create a better website, with fully imaged tutorials, videos and other goodies ( including contests and giveaways! ).\n\nThe best support we can get at this time is the word of mouth, get more people to not only play StarMade but follow us on twitter, indieDB and become involved with our community. Remember, you guys will be the core players that helped us launch this awesome game, and we will remember you.\n\nSoft Borders\n\nThis basically means, that sectors won't load in right when you change it, but you will be always surrounded by preloading sectors. You will be able to see the objects (even moving ones) of adjacent sectors from your position. This feature will mark a milestone for the engine's core.\n\nAfter lots of hours of work, the new version is finally in a releasable state. There might still be some bugs from the countless performance improvements and optimizations, which I might not have accounted for, so please send in reports whenever your game crashes, or you see something odd.\n\nHowever, it's very complex and complicated to implement. Here are some of the problems I had to solve:\n\nEvery player effectively now loads 27 (3x3x3) sectors.\n\nThis means a lot more memory used per player on the server (not a client problem).\n\na lot more sectors and objects have to be able to load in at the same time.\n\na lot more data has to be transferred to clients, since the simultaneous \"available\" objects by player is much bigger. Most of the data is only one time data (e.g. not moving objects don't need updates, and the number of moving objects won't increase from this).\n\nevery object loaded has be updated, which will beat on the performance.\n\nClean up functions: the clean up has to be done a lot more often since more sectors get inactive at once.\n\nObject positions have to be calculated relatively\n\nAs floating point (even double precision ) values are by far not big enough for the StarMade Universe, the sectors are used to represent a relative system. This means every sector is handled around the absolute zero, which allows for the virtual infinity of the universe. The function that has to be the most robust for the new system is to calculate the positions of objects in the surrounding sectors on the clients. For the server the relative positions don't play any role, since each sector has their own context.\n\nrelative positions also influence sector requests by the client.\n\nPhysics dilemma: To keep StarMade as modular and extensible, the sector system described above is used. Every sector is using it's own physics context to handle scalability and number limits (float/double problem).\n\nThere has to be a function for secure transitions of objects from one in the next physics context. This is one of the most complex procedures (although it sounds easy at first): Bigger Objects can intersect the sector border: what sector does it belong to? The sector that has the bigger part of it of course. But now what happens if another object in the sector which the big object doesn't belong to collides with it? ... I basically have implement some kind of \"bubble\" which is formed around near objects to make sure they are in the same physics context.\n\nWe've been tirelessly testing and the newer versions of 0.080 that are out right now make multiplayer planet building possible! We've almost eliminated all the lag in multiplayer as well. Come join our US test server and check it out.\n\nWell if I can make an inference from the error, it's something to do with the vertex shaders, so it is obviously something with my graphics card because on Minecraft I can't use shader mods or anything or the game won't work.\n\nMy graphics card doesn't so GLSL shaders even knowing it's suppose to. I've been doing my research and found out why that might be though, I need to look at my multitexturing settings on OpenGL, problem is I'm retarded and don't know how to find the OpenGL settings on my computer. I'm quite new to fussing with graphics card settings and what not."

      "text": "After reading the Ghost-eye Deep Void Scanner on page 95 BFK, it states that they can actively scan an opponent and it is all but undetectable? So pretty much, every time someone else scans your ship you know you are being scanned (and you theirs)? But do you know where they are at? And what about deep void scanning, like scanning a solar system and the planets therein? Can pirates detect that \"ping\" you send out too?\n\nI probably should post this is the House Rule forum, but alas it should also be cursory stated in the rules somewhere. I just don't see it…… Tear :*(The point of the Ghost-Eye is that it is able to scan other objects without being detected while in Silent Running. The simplest way to look at standard Imperial focused auguries is that they use a synthetic aperture radar, which basically bombards an area with pulses of radio waves and processes the successful returns into a coherent image. Obviously it will be far more complicated and probably use. I dunno, strangelets or something. An active augury would be more of a spherical snapshot, like an electronic echolocation. In both cases, the key point is that you are emitting energy in order to get an image. Passive augury, on the other hand, would simply entail keeping an electronic ear out for vessels broadcasting their transponders (Ship name, current heading and speed at its' most simple) or scanning them.\n\ntl;dr: If you actively scan something, you are also sending a signal that indicates your current location."

      "text": "Honestly. I'm a socom kid and I find it extremly easy to kill people. Also stay away from the droids. The're cool as hell but there guns suck. Blaster is the best gun, good fire rate and easy to control. THE MORTAR GUN SUCKS!\n\nOriginally posted by thejeditraitor what's the best way to kill destroyer droids? they're hard to beat.\n\nBrute force, smack em with rockets. 1 takes down the shield another scraps him. The other reasonable way to deal with them is a good body shot while they first setup or are on the roll. They have horrible turn rates though so you could flank them like GlobalStrike said\n\nThat being said there are certain places which you can hold indefinitely with a single destroyer droidPress G to change your secondary weapon to Recon Droid. Right click to do your secondary attack and you willl then be in control of the recon droid. Fly it to where you want to do the orbital strike. Right click, You will hear beeping. A few seconds later, laser bolts will come out of the sky to the spot your droid was. If you want, you can switch back to your character (by scrolling the mouse wheel) right after you right click so you can actually watch the bombardment.\n\nStarfighters especially. Do *not* use the mouse except to pitch up or down or to fine-tune your aim. If you need to turn, use the W and D keys because they provide a much tighter turning arc than the mouse. In addition, there's no point in blazing around the map at full throttle. Starfighters always move forward unless you close throttle (S key) and put it into a hover, so using full throttle (W key) will usually just launch you off the map. Open it up only when you need to make a quick escape.\n\nPersonally, I find first-person/in cockpit view the easiest way to pilot vehicles and starships, except the Snowspeeder when you need to keep an eye on your tow cable.\n\nNearly all of the rocket launchers can 'lock on' to large targets like vehicles and spacecraft. Hold your crosshair over the target until a pair of red lines appear. If you don't, your shots will probably miss.\n\nIf you see a hovering \"gun\" hologram, you can use a pilot's fusion cutter to build a turret there. Fusion cutters can also repair busted droids, turrets, startships, and vehicles.\n\nnow, can anyone tell me the difference between concussion, EMP, and standard grenades? Especially on characters that have two types? Why do I care? They all seem to do damage and don't have any special status effects.\n\nand the clone jettrooper is very good at taking out groups of droids, but its ammo is very limited so keep your eyes out for ammo powerups dropped by fallen friends/foes (the black boxes w/a red highlight)\n\nIf you are sniping.... remember the AI is stupid.\nIf the AI you are trying to hit is far away and moving, dont worry too much about hitting him coz if you get close he will stop.\nThen just headshot away, and watch those kills rack up.\n\nStormtroopers (and others similar) will roll after the first shot... and then stand still. Generally different troops act slightly differently, but you learn quick enough and can pick them off.\n\nIf you are going on as a grunt, the Z key is your friend.\nZoom in, strafe and aim for the head. About 6 shots at most should finish them off.\n\nIf the crosshair is blue, then you are probably out of range, as soon as it goes red blast away. Usually they kinda of stop, or roll and stop, after thats its candy from a baby.\n\nA lot of people on-line are using auto-aim, which is a really bad idea. You can identify these people easily by watching their laser blasts - When a target stays across their line of sight, their shots will temporarily track the new target.\n\nIt is almost impossible to get good head shots when auto-aim is on. Attack these people mercilessly.\n\nOriginally posted by treemonster not actually a bug or an exploit. maybe not very honourable or balanced but...\n\nIt doesn't seem like an exploit to me. I mean why should one weapons system overheat a totally seperate system?\n\nIf you had a second person in it you'd be firing double firepower at the same time anyway (rather than alternating fire, which you could do as well if you wanted to).\n\nIn \" real life\" it would just be like a soldier dodging from one set of controls to another (easy to do in an AT-ST, harder to do in an AT-TE).\n\nAs to how to switch, on the PC just roll the mouse wheel up or down to switch positions.\n\nDroidekas are very easy to kill, just nail them while they are rolling or with shields down (vehicle guns or rockets work great) or just nail them with explosives or vehicle guns and one shot will take out their shields, second one blows them to bits. I suppose they would be hard to kill if you were just a lone infantry man with a blaster, but still. The only other place I engage them as in choke points (where multiples can be annoying). Just drop a grenade or two in front of them and run for cover. One for shield, one after the shield is down.\n\nto take out droidekas i get cover behind something so i can just see a bit of the sheild but it cant see me then when the shield goes down KA-BLOWWIE i blow it up, oh yeah and when a bot takes your starship if you jump and press enter if it has just taken off ypu steal it ( i think this also works in splitscreen with the other player but i may be wrong"

      "text": "´t use the word lunatic, that´s why I put it in quotation marks.\n\nSeriously guys look at how JamJamz talks about stuff in the game (ships) and trek in general and then this community directly do you really find that to be appropriate is this a person you really desire to have working on the game. He showed he has no respect for us as a community or trek in general.\n\nI never said size matters, I just don't think that the Ambassador should be able to compete with any of the other T5 ships. And return on time... who really uses the Excelsior refit? Really... I've seen a spattering of them, but they're certainly not popular.\n\nEven creating the Ambassador (as a refit, of course) as a T5 ship, to keep the majority of peace, we'd have to make it weak compared to other ships -- thus making it more or less worthless.\n\nIt \"should\" be in-game, sure. So should a lot of other things, things that are higher on the priority list, and will remain higher on the priority list.\n\nI personally don't like the Ambassador design, there's exactly nothing innovative about it, creating a refit design would be cool though, but then we're not making the Ambassador, and people don't like that.\n\nThere's nothing special about it that makes it worth pushing up on the priority list. It's simply a weak T5 ship, even after a refit. We could gimmick a console that does something cool on it... but then we'd have a poop-storm of people complaining that it doesn't look like the original one, it's a c-store gimmick, with a lame console, it's weak... blah blah blah.\nIf we make it strong, and useful... another poop-storm would erupt, likely a larger one, complaining that it's too strong, it's an old ship that shouldn't be more powerful than modern ships... blah blah blah.\n\nYou know it. I agree, it should be in the game, but there are other things that NEED to be put in the game before it, things that will actually affect a large portion of players, the Ambassador will never get a chance to do it.\n\nSo... no, the Ambassador will likely not be up on the list of things to do soon, higher priorities, you know... like content players will use\n\nIf you're so concerned about the Ambassador appearing weak, just make it as a skin for the Advanced Heavy Cruiser Retrofit -- that way people can fly their (in my opinion, inappropriately powerful) Excelsior OR Ambassador at T5 in 2409. Keep in mind there are now 20 different Tier 5 ships available to Federation captains.\n\nYour argument that other ships are higher priorities may have a bit more traction if the recent releases weren't for the two shuttle releases (Chaffee and Yellowstone) last month. Also, is it so impossible to get some ships that aren't in lock boxes or from C-Store? It's been done before -- the Captain's Yacht (Vet Reward), Dujhod Shuttle (Vet Reward), Toron Shuttle, Type 8 Shuttle, Delta Flyer (crafting mission), K'Tanco Battle Cruiser, Advanced Heavy Cruiser (before it went to C-Store exclusive), Advanced Research Vessel (before it went to C-Store exclusive), Federation Dreadnought Cruiser (referral reward before C-Store option), and Vor'cha Battle Cruiser Retrofit, not to mention the VA retrofits that were once available to everyone. The only ship that qualifies in the last year is the inferior versions of the Odyssey/Bortas ships, which were only available for a week.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by JamJamz\n\nI'm terribly confused, The Excelsior isn't as popular with the masses as you may think. Perhaps among forum goers, which are generally people that are a bit more passionate about eccentric aspects of the game than \"joe-schmoe-regular-player-dude\"\n\nI understand you're confused, but it actually has been historically a very popular ship in STO. However, the two major blows that affect its current usage was removing the Excelsior from being available for energy credits (and then charging 800 C-Points, which has a current cost of about 200,000 refined dilithium whereas other Tier 3 ships cost just 40,000 refined dilithium) and secondly, the release of the freebie Odyssey (which is the most popular in terms of usage, despite being inferior).\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by JamJamz\n\nIs the Ambassador really that special that it would be worth setting aside new things for? My vote is a big fat \"hells naw.\"\n\nA resounding yes! I know schedules change and priorities are altered all the time but if people sound impatient, it's because the EP said in June 2011 we'd have the Ambassador class by August 2011 and then in September CapnLogan said it'd be done by December.\n\nRemember... this is the universe with space Abe Lincoln.... Abe Lincoln... in space. .... The 14th President of the US... in space.\n\nThis is also the universe where some random person can launch a star ship tens of billions of light years away.... OH, and back again.\n\nThis is also the universe where there are societies on planets that are nearly indistinguishable from 1930s big-city America...\n\nLet's not forget that people can teleport just about anywhere, but still take elevators.\n\nWhen I watch Star Trek, the complete, utter, insanity that takes place makes me laugh. The insanity on the forums is very similar. It's always here for a good laugh.\n\nLots of people are nice though, this thread has it's pile of people that like the changes (you haven't seen anything yet!)... and those people I love more than the whiners, of course.\n\nI'm a one man team, I'm making ships that I like right now, the D'Kora being one of my favorites. Next up is a ship nobody has seen before... well... several, actually.\n\nAnd, no, it's not the Ambassador. I've got to make high tier ships before making low tier ships, sorry, that's just the way it is. Besides, that thing looks goofy.\n\nOh...\nOn another note, while I'm here... maybe the people who care more about ship stats than the looks (I have nothing for you.) can answer...\nWhat's so bad about having a variety of energy types for weapons on your ship? I did a few Elite STFs for the first time, and every time at least two people on the team went ape-s**t because of it... yet we completed the optional objectives fine, nobody died... Are they just mad that my ship looked prettier than theirs?\n\nWhat was the point of this? Yes, I do see we got much of what was on there, but why not finish the list? It was player feed back. A direction of where to go with ships was it not? I know it is WAY before your time though, but does that invalidate that? Government's don't start anew when officials are changed.\n\nCapLogan did an amazing job with the Venture/2409 look though, that personally I was happy with the Ambassador sliding ever further down the 'design' list. Then the Jem ship, then the Cardi ship, but there was the Odyssey that was a nice ship, that I currently fly. All the while still hoping that the Last Enterprise would finally make it in.\n\nWasn't it Al in one of the more recent STOked episodes that said the Excel was the most popular ship, due to fans high demand for it? I think when the Enterprise-F came out people were saying, 'wouldn't be a great wallpaper OR marketing point that ALL the Enterprise were in the game if the Ambassador FINALLY made it in the game?\n\nI just see it as people have given you guys examples of how we would spend our money, but get something different. Luckily, the 2409 ships were well received. I just can't believe I went from watching and being apart of one 'vocal minority' and coming here to feel the exact same way again.\n\nThe T5 Cruiser-space is already overpopulated. It will be incredibly hard to find a space for this ship that will A) be unique and B) Please players and make the ship desirable to the players that actually want this ship to begin with.\n\nVisually the ship does not stand out, specifically because of it's original design as a bridge between Excelsior and the Galaxy.\n\nThat's a good point. So, why not simply add the Ambassador Class as a ship-costume for the Envoy Class, which already shares the same general profile and positioning? Not all ships really need to be Tier 5.\n\nTechnology and when things were originally built argument was thrown to the wayside a long time ago with other old ships being put in game and T5's of ships being available that people thought wouldn't be a T5.\n\nSorta like how in the beginning, ship class choices were railroading us so if people saw a Galaxy they knew it was engineering, Intrepid was science, etc. Now we have the Odyssey which looks the same but can be used by all three classes.\n\nThere can no longer be \"logical\" Trek tech arguments anymore because Cryptic has been setting in-game precedence since closed beta.\n\nI'm not sure what you're getting at.\nIt's always been possible to use ships of one type or another by all classes.\n\nBesides, what's the alternative?\nShut off the brain and demand things that don't make any sense, like Ambassador should be the most maneuverable escort in this game?\n\nWe can't go by what the silent or quiet majority want... yet we have several in that vocal minority that are very outspoken. They appear in each thread, hammering away their points repeatedly - it's what stands out - it's what gains the attention...\n\n...and to some extent, begins to lead to stereotyping of those that are pro-Ambassador.\n\nSome folks try to see past that and deal with individuals that are pro-Ambassador on an individual or even small group basis.\n\nAt the same time, it also happens from the other perspective. Those that do not want exactly what this outspoken minority want are lumped in with the people that do not want the Ambassador at all. This is often picked up by others that may not have read a single thing the person said, but they saw the label, and it sticks.\n\nEverything ends up in the extremes... people that are not at those extremes, will often find themselves in arguments with everybody, lol.\n\nPerson A is pro-Ambassador, but they are not PRO-Ambassador - so they'll end up as CON-Ambassador to those PRO-Ambassador folks. Person B is con-Ambassador, but they are not CON-Ambassador - so they'll end up as PRO-Ambassador to those CON-Ambassador folks. Even some of the pro folks are not pro enough, so they'll end up con or CON to those that are more pro or PRO..\n\nThe Ambassador-class is a minefield. I honestly do not think JJz realized what he was walking into when he commented...\n\n...with his interaction though, what is he going to walk away with? Is he going to realize that it was really only a few very vocal folks that were ready to lynch him and that the majority of folks were just doing our typical middle of the road discussion? Even if he does realize that on an intellectual level, tries to maintain a professional attitude, etc, etc... he's still human.\n\nIt's very easy to end up despising users and not wanting to have anything to do with them...lol. Give me a room full of servers and a boss to filter the users...ayup...\n\nCertainly an excellent post, but totally besides the point I actually wanted to make.\nI wasn't talking about the silent majority.\nI have no idea what the silent majority wants (maybe they want the ship to go to the dumpster, or perhaps as an NPC freighter?) and thus would never presume to articulate that I know what they want.\nI was talking about the majority of those who I have been reading about speaking positively about the idea of an Ambassador in this game.\nAnd of this majority has IMO very different ideas what that ship might be like, but the constant based on my observation has been none of those people wanted seom kind of \"more dakka-dakka pwnship\" but something that's actually balanced.\nAnd yes I agree with you those that sceam the loudest (and the loudest pile of nonsense) will sometimes be the ones we should thank for destroying an idea.\nUnfortunately those people hide behind the anonymity of the internet so we can never confront them and ask them what they were thinking and how much damage they might do."

I've considered removing the advantage the Human player has of targetting enemy capital ships by modifying these abilities changing what is anti-capitalship.\n\nDefault aiUseTargetCondition not taking advantage of new or better conditions\n\nAntimatter costs canceling out 2nd or 3rd abilities from being cast\n\nUltimates never executed by the AI (Example Resurrection)\n\nAbilities never executed by the AI (Example Resource Focus)\n\nSingle Target Synchronized abilities\n\nI actually have a fix for this that's already in SotF. To make the AI and by extension the player more effective with this ability I changed it from ApplyTargettedBuffToSelf to ApplyBuffToTarget. The synchronizing still occurs but is cast via a callback from the affected target. I still have some more to change for the custom races in my mod.\n\nWhile not as many options as aiUseTime there are some useful aiUseTargetCondition's that might be put on abilities with the goal of improving the AI.\n\nOne condition that pops out is the isCapitalShipOrStarbase condition. This might be extremely useful for the AI on abilities like DetonateAntimatter or NanoDissasembler. This condition won't stop a player from manually targetting a frigate, but it will cause the AI to choose to target capitals or starbases.\n\nAnother possibility for DetonateAntimatter is the AntimatterExceedsAmount condition as this ability only causes damage when there is decent amount of antimatter reserve.\n\nThe main point will be review each Ability's aiUseTime and aiUseTargetCondition especially for those that are the Any types and see if any potential improvement can be made.\n\nAntimatter costs canceling out 2nd or 3rd abilities from being cast\n\nThis one bugs me a bit with the AI as typically AM reserves and cooldowns work out to the same ability being cast over and over when the better ability remains unused.\n\nA couple of options present them self to help resolve this.\n\nRebalance AM, ai use/target conditions and cooldowns to ensure both abilities have a change to fire if appropriate. For example the Guass Blast and Flak Burst end up with Flak Burst rarely being cast during extended battles as the AM is chewed up by Guass Blast. In this scenario FlakBurst could be rebalanced to have a lower AM cost than GuassBlast but an aiUseTime of OnlyWhenManyTargetsInRange. This may require some rebalance to effect of the ability but will create a more dynamic AI.\n\nConvert an AM using ability to a Passive. Again picking on the Kol..., The AdaptiveShield is a good opportunity for this type of conversion.\n\nThe onlyAutoCastWhenDamageTakenExceedsPerc could also be coupled with the rebalanced AM ai use/target conditions in the first bullet... For example AdaptiveShield could have a higher priority to fire based on AM, but only when it's exceeded a certain damage threshold.\n\nUltimates never executed by the AI (Example Resurrection)\n\nWhile resurrection is the biggest example I'd like the AI to have more opportunity to execute Ultimate abilities.\n\nFor resurrection I intend to change this into an ability the AI will use. Basically any capital ship will have Resurrection applied to it once. It won't recast on a ship that's already been resurrected so only newly built ships will get the affect. Human players can still control this BAU.\n\nFor other ultimate abilities I'm thinking about dramatically reducing their AM costs and increasing cooldowns as I want the AI to prioritize using them. As it currently stands the AI will never disable it's other abilities like Radiation Bomb to store AM for Missile Barrage. By decreasing AM below normal abilities all level 6 capitals become dangerous even in extended battles.\n\nI'll still look at the previous changes to help the AI make better decisions about when to cast ultimate abilities.\n\nAbilities never executed by the AI (Example Resource Focus)\n\nThis bugs me too and considering resource focus isn't that big of an impact I'm considering making it a passive ability and possibly reblancing it some to compensate.\n\nI guess I should add one more thing to the mix... Abilities that activate too much. Sorry, but the phase out hull on Vasari structures is going to get changed to an AM based ability. This one just bugs the shit out me trying to take down Vasari structures\n\nStar Bases\n\nThe AI never does anything cool with these!\n\nWhy? Because it put's all it's upgrade points into Weapons/Toughness/Strikecraft before it even thinks about a different upgrade type.\n\nThis results in fairly boring usage of Star bases by the AI...\n\nSolutions?\n\nDecrease the amount of upgrades available for Weapons/Toughness/Strikecraft\n\nIncrease the amount of upgrades allowed for a Star Base from 8 to ?\n\nAdd instant low level access for all star base upgrades\n\nDecrease the amount of upgrades available for Weapons/Toughness/Strikecraft\n\nIn essence this would simply make additional upgrades available for Trade, Block Colonize or other special abilities\n\nIncrease the amount of upgrades allowed for a Star Base from 8 to ?\n\nSimple enough increase from 8 to whatever. Downside is a lot more resources are needed to upgrade the starbase.\n\nAdd instant low level access for all star base upgrades\n\nThis one is intriguing. Essentially you could make up for the lack of dynamic behavior on the AI by forcing it to have upgrades that a human would most likely get anyway. Downside is the human gets these as well.\n\nGeneric Stuff\n\nSpamming of mines by Advent drone hosts\n\nOk, I actually fixed this in my mod by removing mines from the carrier and creating a separate mine host similar to the Vasari mine layer.\n\nm_weaponIndexForRange\n\nI can't recall on this one but if I change the m_weaponIndexForRange to 1 for the Vasari Starbase will that prevent the other weapons from firing until it's in range of the antimodule weapons. I want the Vasari starbase to engage all it's weapons instead of staying out of range with it's anti-module. If this does cause issues I'm going to rework weapon ranges to ships and star bases with multiple weapons to be more effective.ZR, Lavo, can you pastebin the dummy ship and/or research item you are using to trick the AI. I made 4 for the Atlantians and put them in the Entity.manifest and in the PlayerAtlantian.entity file: NotOnPage count 7 entityDefName \"FrigateOrionModuleConstructor\" entityDefName \"FrigatePsiTradeShip\" entityDefName \"FrigatePsiRefineryShip\" entityDefName \"AIDUMMYFRIG_ATL_RESOURCEBOOSTER\" entityDefName \"AIDUMMYFRIG_ATL_PHSMBEAMBOOSTER\" entityDefName \"AIDUMMYFRIG_ATL_PLSMWVBOOSTER\" entityDefName \"AIDUMMYFRIG_ATL_RnDSHLDBOOSTER\"\n\nWhen I start as the Atlantians and using the Rogue as AI, I get no dump. When I start as Rogue using Atlantian as AI, it dumps. Pastebin'd the 4 ships. They have 2 research prerequisites each to cover 8 areas of research which I want to trick the AI to pursue.\n\nInstead of putting in these dummy ships, should I instead create research items as \"FrigateAccess\" to go at the end of strings of research in the hope that the AI will research towards unlocking the dummyfrig and do I even need to bother putting the dummy frig in the PlayerAtlantian.entity file?We're not flying around blind, you can either look at the values used by the regular AI to guess their range or experiment yourself like Zombie and Lavo are doing. There's no reason to spam the technical forum when we can find out the answers for ourselves. Indeed some of the answers are in this thread alreadyBut that's wrong... You aren't \"rewriting\" a damned thing. All you're doing is adding in a bunch of research items. As you've rewritten all the races already, this in fact easier not harder. Hell, all you need is one single open frigate or capital ship slot in order to be able to make a single chain that spans every single tech item. I cannot confirm if NotOnPage does the trick, I don't think it does, though I'll test it at some point now that you mention it.\n\nZR, Lavo, can you pastebin the dummy ship and/or research item you are using to trick the AI.\n\nInstead of putting in these dummy ships, should I instead create research items as \"FrigateAccess\" to go at the end of strings of research in the hope that the AI will research towards unlocking the dummyfrig and do I even need to bother putting the dummy frig in the PlayerAtlantian.entity file?\n\nIf there's no dummy ship the AI will have no reason to research and thus everything will be uselessDo you have a screenshot of your tech trees or a fraps? Position 19,2... hmmYou don't have any open capital ship or structure slots? And in 6 hours, odds are the AI will have researched everything regardless.\n\nI think a structure slot will work as well, as they also move to get trade ports/culture centers/super weapons etc. fairly quickly as well.\n\nI actually use a tactical structure slot as one of the fillers for the Imperials and Rebels, due to a lack of ship slots, and it does work. Though I'm not sure if it's as effective as a ship, the trials I've run have been inconclusive. also have a couple other options I'm going to investigate after watching how the AI researches that won't require build menu slots. If they work I'll post back here.\n\nAdditionally ResearchSubject->priority seems to not be used as far as I can tell. Has anyone seen any behavior that contradicts this? I'm going to do a bit more playing here to seeWell... All this really proves is the AI is capable of full research given enough time.\n\nWhat the frigate solution does if influence the AI to start research specific techs much earlier. Without giving the AI a specific goal to reach for it falls back onto the random research rules that are already in place for the engine.\n\nBTW, I just tested your approach by removing the seed frigates which resulted in no extra non-random research benefits (i.e. BAU).'ve seen that the AI researches both; though mind you most of the time I have one of the \"chains\" set to the second research pre-req.\n\nAdditionally ResearchSubject->priority seems to not be used as far as I can tell. Has anyone seen any behavior that contradicts this? I'm going to do a bit more playing here to see.\n\nCan anyone test these new AI stuff to see if this really changes the game. I might have time to do it but I think we need hundreds of people to try to see if the changes would really improve the AI temporary till the rebellion comes out and hopefully they tinker with the AI in it.\n\nWell, the Atlantians in 7DS have the most massive tech tree of any race so I'll be doing 2 hour tests on our maps without quickstart to see just how much the AI as a researcher researches. Then I'll run another using unmodified tech tree for two hours with AI as researcher. Should see a marked improvement in the tweaked than untweaked using identical maps. Should really see it when AI is not researcher, but econ/turtle/hawk.\n\nSo after doing the shotgun approach I've scaled back and refined the implementation a little bit and like the results so far.\n\nWhat I have now is.\n\nArmor 3 levels\n\nHull 3 levels\n\nBlock Colonize (Was trying to get the AI to add this tech, bleh they like to upgrade weapons, hull and strikecraft 99%)\n\nCrystal 2 levels\n\nCargo Ship 3 levels\n\nSettlers (includes Arbitrate Tarrif)\n\nSo how did the AI fair.\n\n8-8 Hull 3 levels\n\n7-8 Armor 3 levels\n\n8-8 Missile 5 levels (All tried to get the superweapon, meaning they overbuilt 8 labs in a cramped game).\n\n3-8 researched block colonize\n\n7-8 Crystal 2 levels\n\n5-8 Cargo 1 level, 2-8 2 levels\n\n6-8 Settlers, 5-8 Arbitrate Tarrif\n\nThe AI also still built pretty impressive fleets for the most part. In my previous testing I think I had way too many pre-reqs to fulfill which did appear to limit the ability of the AI to upgrade fleet supply and produce ships.\n\nI'll also note the AI did ignore several of the suggested research I wanted it to do, but this could have been due to the AI type or general AI logic as it also ignore other TECHS like Hoshikos and Cielo's.\n\nIn regards to pacts, the AI seemed INTENT on increasing relationships with the WRONG ally. If Pink had their relationship up to 20 on RED, then RED made sure to send it's envoy's to anyone but PINK. This resulted in extremely low pact utilization now that the same relationship is required on both sides. Does this dual relationship system make sense? I can see a target threshold to accept a pact, but making it the same relationship just doesn't seem to work.\n\nIf you want an AI to research a path in your tree link it that races superweapon. The AI gets a massive boner trying to get it's superweapon access\n\nI actually think the AI could be more effective if it didn't rush to 8 research labs so quickly and instead focused more on lower hanging fruit and fleet. I personally think this is another reason the AI got easier after the last round of Diplomacy changes for the pact system and enabling super weapons for the AI.\n\nI actually think the AI could be more effective if it didn't rush to 8 research labs so quickly and instead focused more on lower hanging fruit and fleet. I personally think this is another reason the AI got easier after the last round of Diplomacy changes for the pact system and enabling super weapons for the AI.\n\nI agree with this. Your bit on the supply/ship stuff is quite useful Zombie, I'll do tests on that if I get the time as well.\n\nNormal Researcher AI Atlantians, with dummyships in, spent the better part of the time building 8 military labs, then built 1 civilian lab, pushed for the same damn ship unlocking item it has 5 times before (unlocks the atlantian buildable ships), poorly researched weapons, barely researched civilian items -ignored ice/volcanic research even though an Ice and Volcanic were next to homeworld.\n\nI'm so annoyed with the AI in general that I'm contemplating giving a race just 40 items to cover everything in the hope the damn AI will research right. lol.\n\nbtw, giving a research item a priority of 5 didn't crash the game, but didn't seem to do anything at all."

Its a sexy design.\n\nTo sum up the performance differences in a quick nutshell, one could basically say that the X form produces more turning power and thus improved manueverability, but is mechnically more complicated and operationally more complicated. A cruciform gets less turning power, but is simpler.\n\nCruciforms are pretty inuitive to operate, just at a glance, and in the situation where a computer goes down, or for whatever other reason, the ship needs to be steered manually on manual control it can be done pretty successfully.

      "text": "had this crazy idea for a mission, and it involves intentionally wiping a player in space. I was wondering what an effective way to execute this would be. The easy answer would be to have battleships spawn on all sides of the player, but then there are various space abilities like evasive maneuvers, etc that would allow the player to escape.\n\nSo my question is, how can I get it so the player can't escape combat and dies for sure in space?\n\nP.S. This isn't about griefing a player. This is about destroying the ship to advance the plot, as weird as that sounds. So don't take this to mean that I want advice griefing players with the Foundry. :p\n\nSurround them with enemies and put them inside a large box of invisible walls so they cannot escape the battle. Inside this area, place a smaller invisible box with the respawn point in it and a reach marker. However, reach markers seem to trigger off of entering its outer boundary, so if you spawn inside it may not activate. In that case, place an invisible box that covers the entire trapped area with an interact that says something like \"Abandon Ship!\" or \"Signal Our Surrender\".\n\nAlternatively you can forget the large invisible wall box, and just have the objective read \"Go down fighting!\". You should be able to set that text whether you use a reach marker or an activate to signal defeat. That way they'll know they have to fight and are expected to lose. However, there's a chance they could run away and pick off the enemy ships one by one.\n\nBattleships may not be the best choice to kill the player. If you put enough of them it will work (true of any ship type), but while battleships have a lot of hull, their up front damage output is not as high as a Frigate group (at least in my experience, testing my mission on Elite). More ships = more damage. It would probably be better to put a few battleships and cruisers for effect and then a ton of frigate groups. I would recommend using an overwhelming force. The less chance the player has to react, the less chance of them \"screwing things up\"."

Get further away from your target before sending your guys inside.\n\nI'm trying to deploy as close a possible, ~150m away, which is make sense because they are slow ! and target moves quickly.... well not that quickly, I damage it to the level it flying 26m/h.... but still marines are very slow to reach highly maneuverable Centaur.

      "text": "AI War - Hacking\n\nFrom ArcenWiki\n\nWhat is Hacking?\n\nHacking is a background value similar to AIP. It's cumbersome and isn't really meant for human consumption. However, what it does is keep track of how much hacking you've done to the AI. What you need to know is the more you hack, the more the AI gets cranky about it.\n\nHacking is caused by one of the following activities:\n\nPerforming a Ship-Hack against an ARS, allowing you a selection from the additional two possible ships that could be chosen there, instead of always getting the first one.\n\nPerforming a Knowledge Raid against an AI held system.\n\nUsing the SuperTerminal (which will not spawn in all games) to lower your AIP.\n\nHacking, in general, will have the AI spawn zombie defender ships in the local area of the hack. The more you've done, the more ships and the more options it gets as to how varied these spawns will act. This is done internally via a \"Wild-Mage Roll\", and can be reviewed by turning on the appropriate logging item in the CTRLS tab.\n\nSome options include:\n\nSpawning a set of Raid Starships with an Exo-Wave style goal (Hitting some key-component of your infrastructure)\n\nSpawning in a random place on that planet.\n\nSpawning on a connected AI World and attacking via a wormhole.\n\nSpawning Guardians.\n\nFiring a Tachyon Pulse to show all cloakers.\n\nThe list of possibilities here is large, and will probably grow with time as more options are included. Many options aren't listed or described in detail here simply because part of the 'fun' of hacking is to be forced to react to the new environment. You always have the option of digging around to find all the options if that's your choice.\n\nRough notes about hacking:\nEach Ship hack is exponentially more expensive, hacking wise, than the one before it. In most games you'll only want to hack two, perhaps three, ARSs. The third one will heavily challenge newer players. The fourth and fifth hack are purposely meant to be game-ending cataclysms to keep some enforced variety in the game play. Choose your targets well.\n\nEach Knowledge Raid is roughly equivalent to about two and a half of the first ARS Ship Hack, and about two-thirds of the Hacking the second Ship Hack will cause combined with the first. More than two planets worth of Knowledge stolen will be challenging without serious strategical thought. Also, if you only need 500 Knowledge or so, don't fully K-Raid it and you won't incur the full penalty. It is based on the amount of K that is stolen, not the number of planets you've stolen from.\n\nFor the SuperTerminal, removing 3 planets worth of AIP (60 points) is worth roughly as much as a full Knowledge Raid or the second Ship-Hack.\n\nAll of these activities add up together. So if you've Ship-Hacked twice and are now at about 1.5 K-Raids, your next K-Raid will be that much more difficult."

      "text": "Tweet While many of us haven't actively taken part in EVE Online's territorial warfare, news routinely surfaces of the massive alliance wars that take place in the game's lawless nullsec regions. As the number of players subscribed to EVE increases, so too does the size of the average nullsec fleet. Since there's no disadvantage to bringing additional pilots, each side in a heated war will try to bring as many people as it can physically get to attend. At a certain point, however, the server hardware strains under the weight of hundreds or thousands of players, and lag sets in. The point at which this happens has been rising over the years as CCP performs server upgrades, with previous expansions seeing fights as large as 500-1000 per side with quite manageable lag.\n\nA landmark battle is currently raging in the system of LXQ2-T, with thousands of pilots fighting for control of the system. The number of players in the system peaked at over 3,110 pilots, with alliances from the Northern Coalition political conglomeration facing off against the Russian power block from the drone regions. Lag began to set in at around the 2,400-player mark, with pilots facing several-minute delays on warp commands and module activations. Several pilots have launched live video streams of the event, though much of the action has ceased for the moment as the server begins to recover from a severe clash with the lag monster.\n\nYes but seeing how 1000 players would previously crash the node, this is a huge improvement. the 3k players had unacceptable 10 min lag, I completely agree, but lag started getting worse once the number started climbing over 2k. twice as many players could fight, where as before half of that would crash the node.\n\nfighting the lag is an ongoing process, since even if you did make it support 3k, sooner or later people would bring 4k :)\n\nThe technology today can easily handle commands from 3000 people. The one thing I hate in defense of eve is saying oh its the tech what do you expect.\n\nthe fact that the whole point of EveO is combat like this, sovereignty, and it is met with 10 min lag per command is a fatal flaw of the game. It oversteps itself and people just accept it. When they shouldn't.\n\n\"The technology today can easily handle commands from 3000 people. The one thing I hate in defense of eve is saying oh its the tech what do you expect. \"\n\nhow do you know that? I am very interested in large scale simulations. problem is there is a lot to simulate here. one player shoots another, this has to be delivered to all the other 3k clients. and nothing else can be done until this is finished. it is a linear process, which means it cannot be done on multiple cores.\n\nnow try to imagine when 3k people are shooting each-other. from the dev blogs I know ccp has some very fancy hardware so that leads me to think the problems are in the code. which seems to be correct since they just made a push to \"fix lag\", did a lot of bug testing, and as a result, twice as many players can kill eachother. I still think more can be done, and since they have a dedicated lag team more will be done, but eventually lag will never be fixed. you could let 5k people fight it out, and players would just bring 6k people and lag the server again. you could introduce mechanics which limit the number of players being able to fight, but that is against the very nature of eve.\n\n\"the fact that the whole point of EveO is combat like this, sovereignty,\" done two years in 0.0 with blobs, spies and drama and I am not going back. you will find a lot of people don't like 0.0 warfare and engage in other forms of pvp. Saying that its the main point of eve could not be more wrong.\n\nMost games simply can't handle large amounts of people. In Aion you had to turn off all player models to handle fort battles, and 10 minute lag + you might as well make it a turn-based game for all the strategy you could have, let alone all the players whose pc would melt under that many models onscreen.\n\nThey probably are going to need to start capping limits on systems because I can't imagine that to be any kind of fun play. You might as well just make one list of names fight another list of names.\n\n@Axler: \"one player shoots another, this has to be delivered to all the other 3k clients. and nothing else can be done until this is finished. \"\n\nWhy?\n\nSeriously, and I'm asking this as a developer who's spent a not inconsiderable amount of time pondering how he would write an MMO: why do events like this need to be processed in a linear order? Why can two events that don't have intersecting effects (e.g. player A shoots player B and player C shoots player D) not be processed concurrently? And if they can, why would handling 3,000 players be an issue for modern hardware (I'm sure CCP has a 32- or 64- core monster they can throw at a situation like this)?\n\nlets say we have 3k people. by stretching it a little, in the example you mentioned it could be done, because players A, B and C,D are not interacting. But you cant guarantee that they will not start interacting. If they start, it becomes linear again.\n\nand a lot of not interacting events are run on different processors in eve. while the fight is laging, you can go to planetary interaction, and work there with no lag, since that is on a different server. you can check the market, since that too is on a different server. two players in the next solar system are also fighting with no leg, since that system is on a different node.\n\nwhile this fight was going on, the lag was only present in that solar system. in other regions across eve, players were fighting like they normally do, with no lag, since different systems run on different cores (those with little traffic share a core).\n\nso in a way, while in the 3k player fight player A was shooting player B, player C was shooting player D on a different processors, but only because he was in a different solar system, and unable to interact with B and C.\n\nthe moment those players have the chance to interact with one another, the process becomes linear, because one action is dependant on the previous, and all players must be aware of all other players conditions, for healing pourpuses, or so that dead players cant keep shooting :)\n\nthat said, even in the same fight, perhaps certain things could be handled by different cores, but mostly the problem remains linear. if one player shoots another, before anyone else can shoot him, or he can shoot, the server must figure out how much damage he got and if he died. if it was done on different cores that player could keep on shooting, whilst being dead.\n\nanother interesting concept is that we never ever trust players PCs with anything. everything is done server side, because people might cheat. but if you could manage security enough, to trust players with the calculations, and only send back the results, you could speed things up a lot. because people have fast processors at home and could easily do their calculations very fast. the question would then become weather it would steel be faster, because you would need to encode data at client side, and decode it at server side, and that might take even longer then what is being done now. not to mention someone could crack your code and simply send the server anything he wanted, which would now, blindly believe him. seeing how it has not yet been done, it makes me think it is a bad idea :)\n\nIndeed, servers like http daemons and proxies can handle much more strenuous conditions than eve's servers. CCP needs to hire more linux kernel hackers.\n\nFor example, opentracker (used by most large BitTorrent trackers) can handle tens of thousands of requests per second. Right now, a single one of The Pirate Bay's tracker is handling 28000 requests/sec on your average hardware.\n\nthat server \"lags\", except you don't notice that lag as you don't care how often trackers update. your torrent client could be asking the server for information once every half an hour, but put that in gaming turns, and that's a shitload of lag.\n\nbut in a way I agree, since they have some top end hardware, the next bottleneck is the code. what happened today shows that, since by fixing some parts they doubled the number of people that can play with no lag. If you bring even more it lags out, but people will never stop bringing more.\n\npersonally I don't see what's so fascinating about big fleet battles, but some seem to enjoy it.\n\nHandling an HTTP request is a trivially easy task compared to simulating missile fire. It should not be surprising that computers can do thousands more trivially easy tasks per second than more difficult ones.\n\nSince you seem to know so much about the technology I invite you to explain exactly what they're doing wrong, and precisely what sort of measures they should be doing - with references to real-world applications of your suggestion/s showing them working in the wold."

I just finished doing this a second time leveling my FT to 50, I also did it with my Privateer.That ship in my opinion is the best ship value in the game.\n\nHonestly, don't worry about the refits until they sort out their role and cost, you will likely just end up upset you wasted all your MoVs. At the very least save them for when you are 50, PvPing, and can outfit them with the best mods.\n\nThere are plenty of other threads with more in depth information, but here are the cliff notes:\n\n- Choose ships based on personal play style, not your class. The best strategy for taking down NPCs is always to rig for DPS and armor, get within 100 yards and blast them. Anything else is just wasting your time.\n- You get more xp the lower level the ship you are captaining compared to the enemy, so getting the 40-49 ships just slows your progress.\n- The general consensus is to stop upgrading ships at the MC Postillionen(26), MC Stralsund(33), or MC Raa(39). All of them can get you to 50 without a whole lot of trouble.\n- The MC Raa has the highest close range DPS of any unrestricted ship, so there is no point in going past it.\n- This advice is for PvE only, PvP is entirely different and requires different ships with different outfittings."

      "text": "I´m putting this topic on, because I would like to start a discussion featuring ideas and deductions, that deals thoroughly with the operations and actions of RDA ESC 01 as well as other people on the world of Pandora. Everything included in one topic.\n\nI´m aware, that some technical, logistical and social ideas were mentioned in other topics, but would like to create a compendium regarding all these structures using our imagination and knowledge, without which this couldn´t happen. The topic will cover all the issues, from the basic principles of functional colony, logistics and technical issues, appearance of diffirent decks of HABMOBs and other sections, to the behavior of diffirent classes of workers, including health care, free time, administration and comunication.\n\nLets start then:\n\n1) According to the Survival guide, all the electrical energy on earth is produced by annihilation of matter and antimatter, from which we can deduce, that the same applies for the Hell´s Gate. My question is: what amount of antimatter is sufficient enough for the whole colony. One gram, two, maybe even more? Do they resupply the antimatter with every new arrival of ISVs, or do they have their own generators? (and how the mankind even optains the antimatter, that is another logical question).\n\n2) Again refering to the Survival guide, there is (or was) functional factory, which produced the weapons for SecOps and supplied spare parts for the vehicular fleet. I´m interested in the origin of their sources. I´ve never seen any mines, other than the one on Unobtanium (Unm), but making these components requires relatively broad variety of materials. Do they import the materials from Earth? Is it practical?\n\n3) In the movie, games and books we´re seeing wide array of machines, and I want to know on what fuels ´em. According to many factors I doubt they´re fueled by fossil fuels (mainly because petroleum will be rare by the time of the 22. century, unless RDA finds the oilfields directly on Pandora). So are they fueled by hydrogen, or some other fuel?\n\nI thank everybody who participates in advance. I´ll be watching and updating this topic regularly, and will be glad if you´ll post some questions or theories on your own.\n\nI thank you very much and looking forward on cooperation.\n\nImperius Dictatio\n\n05-23-2010, 10:20 PM\n\n1. I found the Antimatter deal pretty stupid. Do you have any idea how much energy goes into making Anti-Matter? Instead of using the insane amounts of energy that goes into AM production they could have simply plugged themselves into whatever energy source they'd been using for making the AM and solved the whole movies energy issue. AM is only good for Space Travel,Weapons and oddly enough medical scanning tech.\n\n2.Possible. It's likely that they have smaller mines they tap into. Either that or they get materials for the Unobtanium mines that happen to be leftover. From what I can tell the only stuff they'd have to import from earth would be the really technical stuff.\n\n3. Batteries more then likely. Unobtanium is a room temp super conductor. Of course aircraft may use gas or something.\n\nSnowRider\n\n05-23-2010, 11:23 PM\n\n1) The only way that they could make antimatter work as an energy source is by using the Unobtanium in some way to make the process (i.e., energy) used in manufacturing the antimatter much, much more efficient. Otherwise, it is just as the other poster said, there's way too much energy needed to manufacture and store antimatter for it to be viable as an energy source.\n\nSo, they must use Unobtanium in some way to cut down on those costs.\n\nNow as far as the Hell's Gate colony is concerned, they wouldn't need very much antimatter to run it, but they'd need a constant source and/or resupply of antimatter otherwise they'd run out of what they have really, really quickly.\n\nAs for both the colony and Earth, there are probably other energy sources (e.g., deuterium and/or nuclear fusion) that they can use, but those probably don't provide as much bang for the buck as the matter-antimatter energy source.\n\n2) My guess is they import some of the stuff they need from Earth and manufacture the rest on site at the Hell's Gate factory. That would be much more efficient (every kilogram you don't have to ship from Earth to Pandora is one less kilogram you need to expend energy on to get from Earth to Pandora) but the down side is that the stuff they do manufacture on Pandora is probably fairly basic (i.e., rugged and simple) and not quite up to the quality that you would find in a factory or manufacturing plant on Earth.\n\n3) Either hydrogen or some combination of fuel cells and fusion (if the process of nuclear fusion could be miniaturized to the scale of a Samson or AMP suit. Recall that when the Colonel fires up his AMP suit for the first time, you can clearly see blue flames/exhaust emerging from the back of the suit. This suggests a fuel cell of some sort for that particular application, but there may be others.\n\nI too am curious about this subject and I wonder if we'll be seeing more of the logistics of operating and maintaining Hell's Gate as a plot point and/or a point of discussion in the sequel(s).\n\nTime will tell.\n\nScottWashburn\n\n06-25-2010, 12:46 PM\n\nAs noted above, anti-matter is not an energy SOURCE. We can make anti-matter today in tiny amounts but it takes huge amounts of energy to produce. And even if you assume some super-efficient method of making it in the future, you still cannot get any more energy out of it than you put into it. The Laws of Thermodynamics are without pity :) Anti-matter is an incredible means of STORING energy and is ideal for powering a starship. Trying to use it for anything else would be riduclously expensive and also horribly dangerous. Using it to power a combat vehicle would be like putting an enormous bomb in the midst of your own troops with a \"Kill Us!\" sign on it.\n\nBut I, too, am very interested in the logistics of Hell's Gate. I deal with this quite a bit in my fan fiction \"Aftermath\". Due to the expense of shipping things from Earth to Alpha Centauri it would make sense to make the base as self-sufficient as possible. It certainly makes no sense to ship gasoline or other fossil fuels to Pandora to run the helicopters and mining equipment. In the movie we do see some sort of faintly smokey exhausts coming out of the vehicles so they are definitely burning something. I would guess some sort of bio-fuel. There is probably a fuel plant at Hell's Gate that uses some genetically engineered bacteria to turn Pandoran plants into fuel. We're experimenting with stuff like that on Earth right now so it is certainly possible.\n\nMore later.\n\nScottWashburn\n\n07-01-2010, 02:37 PM\n\nOkay, it's later :)\n\nAs noted in my last post, I think there must be a fuel plant on Pandora to provide fuel for all those helicopters, bulldozers, digging machines and AMP suits. Fuel would be used in large amounts and shipping it in bulk from Earth would make no sense. But what about ammunition? Bullets and missiles for all those gunships. One of those Scorpion gunships carries over 200 missiles. Are they produced on Pandora or shipped from Earth? I'm guessing that they are shipped from Earth. As expensive as that might seem, I think it would still be cheaper than shipping the multiple factories needed to produce them to Pandora. At least for the missiles. Ammunition for the guns might be a possibility since they are relatively simple items. But the missiles have dozens of different components, each of which would have to be produced and then assembled. Shipping the factories needed for all that from Earth might be more than the RDA big-wigs would be willing to do. After all, they aren't on Pandora to fight a war. They would want to avoid conflict as much as possible. In a case like this there's just no profit from a war. So, I'm betting that all the heavy ordnance is shipped from Earth. This means that unless there is an enormous stockpile of it at Hell's Gate (unlikely) then even if Quartich had won the battle he might have found himself in serious trouble if the Na'vi weren't demoralized by the destruction of the Tree of Souls (It might make them really angry instead). If they had the will to pursue a long-term conflict, and resupply for Quaritch is six years away, they might possible be able to just wear out the Sky People.\n\nImperius Dictatio\n\n07-01-2010, 03:03 PM\n\nI remember hearing somewhere that the Hells Gate Facility has several autofactories to churn out a lot of their gear.\n\nScottWashburn\n\n07-01-2010, 06:46 PM\n\nOf course that's the unknown factor: what is production technology in 2154? If you can build versatile, adaptable factories that can produce almost anything you can supply it with the specs and raw materials for then that changes everything.\n\nSnowRider\n\n07-01-2010, 07:09 PM\n\nMy guess is the Hell's Gate facility is designed to be as self-sufficient as possible, as many others here have suggested.\n\nHowever, it can't be completely self-sufficient. It's at the end of a long supply chain back to Earth. The one thing, the one weakness Hell's Gate has is people and that is probably the primary purpose of the supply chain: getting fresh, new people to Hell's Gate and returning to Earth with Unobtanium and people who are rotating back to Earth at the end of their tours at Hell's Gate.\n\nWithout people to run the factories, maintain the equipment, keep everything running, etc. Hell's Gate falls apart pretty quickly.\n\nI am quite certain that its designers intended for Hell's Gate to be able to keep itself up and running in case something happens to the ISV train to and from Earth, but I don't think it can keep itself going indefinitely. If it has a full complement of people staffing it, sure it could maintain itself for a while, possibly for years, though I doubt it.\n\nAnd at the end of the movie, there are supposedly only a few scientists and technicians left behind after all the other humans leave Pandora.\n\nGranted, their energy needs, the demand on supplies, how much resources they will consume, etc. will be much, much smaller with only a few people, but it is my belief that sooner or later, Hell's Gate will start to fall apart.\n\nMax, Norm, and the others will have to deal with equipment breakdowns, critical machinery and systems wearing out and needing to be replaced, system failures, etc. the cumulative effect of which will keep getting bigger and bigger until sooner or later (probably sooner) the whole thing falls apart.\n\nWhat do they do then? They are marooned on a world humans were never intended to live on without a great deal of technology to keep them sustained and alive and when that technology starts to break down, they're screwed.\n\nThey might possibly regret kicking most of the humans off Pandora, because a lot of those people were there to keep everything up and running and without them, things will fall apart.\n\nI would not want to be in Norm, Max, and the others' shoes when that day comes.\n\nImperius Dictatio\n\n07-03-2010, 09:44 AM\n\nWe never saw any of the Techs left behind.\nOnly the Science team.\n\nSo yeah, I've been saying this for a while.\nThey're all screwed.\n\nScottWashburn\n\n07-04-2010, 03:04 PM\n\nSnow Rider makes some good points. I deal with quite a bit of that in my \"Aftermath\" fan fiction as well. Aftermath Chapter 1, an Avatar fanfic - FanFiction.Net (\n\nSnowRider\n\n07-05-2010, 03:54 PM\n\nAnother thought occurs to me.\n\nThe only way for Max, Norm, etc. to survive for a long time on Pandora if/when the infrastructure of Hell's Gate starts falling apart would be for them to in essence, \"go native\" and downsize their standard of living as much as is possible.\n\nScottWashburn\n\n07-05-2010, 07:23 PM\n\nConsidering the hasty evacuation of Hell's Gate by the humans, there is probably quite a bit of unobtainium lying around. Max and the other humans who stayed behind could probably buy pretty much anything they needed if the humans in orbit were willing to deal with them.\n\nSnowRider\n\n07-05-2010, 11:06 PM\n\nMore than likely, yes. But that is a very big if.\n\nIt would mostly depend upon how desperate the humans in orbit are to turn around and go home.\n\nI mean, can you imagine what it would be like to come out of cryo and find out that the Na'vi have booted the humans off Pandora?\n\nYou've spent almost six years in cryo, you come out, and find out you have to turn right around and head home?\n\nThat would suck dead dog farts.\n\nftxey Keye'ung\n\n11-04-2010, 02:22 AM\n\nThe power source for Hells-Gate was never mentioned on screen or elsewhere in the movie due to obvious reasons of keeping the pace and story going.\n\nTo add my two cents worth:\n\nThe Swan's and the mining vehicles would most likely be powered by hydrogen fuel cells or battery. ie: they recharge and are fixed to quadrants of the planet for certain amounts of time in designated areas for a few weeks perhaps before returning for a re-charge/re-fuel and overhaul to remove any build up of dirt, transmission wear and as we saw, the sporadic attacks by the natives.\n\nAs for the material resources, they would probably have to bring some with them to begin with and then mine the rest from the planet at source, they also have a massive stencil machine that carves the components from the raw or alloyed materials.\n\nThey would also have a recycling plant that melted down the old machines or damaged machines and then re-use them to build more.\n\nThe technology of the humans in the movie is pretty standard and could just as easily be today, with the addition of Unobtanium they could have giant flying mining equipment and vehicles such as the mag-lev trains on Earth using a series of overhead lines leading from the mines to Hell's-Gate....although they did seem to use roads on Pandora for the mines.\n\nImperius Dictatio\n\n11-04-2010, 01:09 PM\n\nExcept for the fact that none of the humans who remained on the planet are Techies or Engineers as they all seem to be Scientists with Soft Fields. (Anthropology for example.) nor are their a lot of them to begin with.\nAnd their in the frigging jungle....I'll give Hell's Gate maybe two or three years rops before the place is a wreck.\nThough it should only take a year for the power systems and air circulators to break down.\n\nScottWashburn\n\n11-06-2010, 07:09 AM\n\nLong-term survival would definitely be a problem for the remaining humans. One thing they do have operating in their favor is that there are a handful of them (10? 20?) living in a base meant for a couple of thousand. If they shut down everything except one small section they could then move to a new section when an old section fell apart to the point they couldn't fix it. Hopefully the RDA was smart enough not to have everything powered from a single generator or all the air coming from a single recycler. With multiple redundancy built in it might be possible to keep the place going for many years. And it would seem that the equipment is amazingly reliable. Consider the shack at Site 26: It could be left unattended, reoccupied, partly dismantled, carried somewhere and set up again and keep running with little or no maintenance.\n\nftxey Keye'ung\n\n11-07-2010, 01:53 PM\n\nRDA...and good old human ingenuity = Efficient modular buildings that are easily constructed and can be re-designed for multiple uses...the one thing we're good at...for the most part.\n\nImperius Dictatio\n\n11-16-2010, 09:18 AM\n\nStill it's a doomed effort.\nMachines break down if theirs no one their to maintain them or fix them up.\nNot to mention their in a jungle which if left unattended will creep onto the base and breaking stuff apart or covering it in a layer of choking vines and creepers and clogging up machinery.\n\nIt also doesnt take much to start wreaking the place up.\nThe building itself HAS to be airtight and maintaining that is going to be a pain.\nBecuase if theirs even a small hole or leak you'll be slowly letting in a dangerous toxin that you cant smell or taste.\n\nEven if they shut areas of the base down it's only prolonging the fact that in a very short time they will all die."

For reference, these are the types the Spireling AI gets:\n\nThe rotter, ripper, teleporting leech, and miniram don't get a lot of love around here, it seems, but some of the others are pretty highly favored (or hated, if the AI draws them).\n\nCoppermantis:\nThe one I've got right now is the best one I've found, but if you were to find one with, say, Gravity Drains, Blade Spawners, Leeches and Tractor Platforms that'd be cool. I'm not too far in, so a restart would be alright if such a seed exists.\n\nAs far as this game goes, The Scan has revealed a shard on Xil. My Fleet will be more than enough to handle the operation.\n\nkeith.lamothe:\nTook a while, but found this one: 89607298\n\nWith: Map Type: Simple Planet Count: 80 Campaign Type: Conquest Expansions: all three on Available Ships: Complex Cloaking, Teleporting, Parasites, Tractor Beams and Swallowers on (the others may be on or not on at your discretion)\n\nIt's got Drains, Blade Spawners, Teleporting Leeches, and Tractor Platforms in a connectable fashion. Up to you if you want to use it :)"

      "text": "Main menu\n\nSearch form\n\nTitle\n\nThis Sunday at 21:00 UTC, the CSM held an open town hall Q&A on the Eve University Mumble server. The CSM has returned from their recent Iceland summit, and discussed the upcoming expansion, CCP's future plans, and other players concerns. Eve Radio has recorded the Townhall, and the meeting has been transcribed below.\n\nCCP has increased UI customizations recently; will there be possibilities to customize or mod the EVE UI like other MMO's?\n\nTrebor: CCP is hesitant to allow the UI to be 3rd party customizable, as there is a lot of legacy code that is difficult to work with. Secondly, CCP is afraid players would create powerful mods that would imbalance the game. I don't agree with latter cause, but with the resources CCP has, cleaning up and securing the UI code for 3rd party modification may not be best use of resources.\n\nSeleene: Also CCP is really anal about the way their game looks and feels; they want the game to look a certain way whenever it is presented to the media. It's very unlikely that CCP would allow people to change the way the game looks to any significant degree. While there are code issues, I have not seen CCP put significant efforts towards making the UI modular.\n\nHans: That being said, CCP is working to improve the UI and add their own customization and information display, but they will all be first party as opposed to opening up UI development.\n\nRegarding the CSM election reform proposal, is it going forward the way that Trebor proposed, or some other way is being implemented?\n\nTrebor: We don't know for certain, it depends on CCP Xhagen.\n\nRegarding out of game Communications, are there any plans to allow EVE Voice to work during a client crash? Some players do not have the resources to rent their own voice servers, and a native voice client should be superior for authorization purposes.\n\nTwo Step: You can already use EVE voice out of client through EVE gate, but Eve Voice sucks.\n\nSeleene: CCP is talking about this, but as Players already have good 3rd party voice clients, they don't feel it's the best use of developer resources.\n\nWhat is the CSM's feeling on DUST representatives being elected to the CSM?\n\nTwo Step: There is no CSM consensus; the concern is while DUST is connected to EVE, it is another game, and the CSM mainly deals with EVE. A DUST rep has to be relevant during the 99% of the time when the CSM is talking about EVE; he has to be useful during that time. A DUST rep has to be able to deal actively with EVE, it's more likely there will be EVE CSMs that play DUST, or a separate DUST council.\n\nAre there plans to improve the drone UI, such as a \"deploy drones\" hotkey?\n\nTwo Step: That was on the CSM minutes last summer, but we don't know what happened to it; we thought about having drones being controlled like a module that you can drag onto the taskbar.\n\nHans: CCP likes to do mockups of little things they would like to do while working on the main project, and they'll look at the plausibility and ease of implementation before committing. Mockups of Drone UI exist, but so far no implementation is planned.\n\nHow is the stakeholder project working out? Are you guys having an effect on the summer expansion? As CCP Seagull basically said \"sorry but no\" to the POS revamp, what's happening now?\n\nSeleene: Stakeholder is working much better, part of that was CCP changing how they will be doing their development process, part of that was changing the way expansions are planned. Since then, we've see an increase to information flow, we've been asked to go to meetings and presentations. We are shown what's happening from day one of development - we asked for this last time and didn't get it. We will document as much as possible to help CSM8 to carry the torch.\n\nTwo Step: I was not expecting a \"oh we'll start doing POSes\", it's not realistic to expect that the thread will coerce CCP into anything. While we do have a lot of access, the point of the thread was to let CCP know how important POSes are, that they are not only used by \"a minority of players\". What is important to me is that some fixes are implemented in the summer, and work on modular POS is started ASAP, and that the thoughts and concerns of the community have an effect on the eventual outcome.\n\nHans: There is certainly a lot of room for small fixes in the summer expansion. CCP has not definitely said no to taking POS off the table for summer.\n\nIssler: I think the stakeholder thing has advanced dramatically, CCP has changed their approach to the planning of the future of EVE. The one good thing about the POS threadnaught was that it was a good example of the way the CSM and playerbase can influence the development of EVE.\n\nSeleene: The CSM has gone under a lot of changes from 5 to where we are now, and a lot of people have their own ideas about what the CSM does. If you are running for the CSM, it's important to know that the CSM is much more involved now, not just a couple chats and a trip to Iceland. Communication is weekly and the \"free trip to Iceland\" meme is out of the window. If you plan to vote for a CSM, know the impact they will have on the game.\n\nIs there any plan to use the certificate program being used improve the newbie learning experience?\n\nSeleene: I was the last person to touch certificates, that was years ago. At the time it would have branched off into an achievement-like feature. Since then, I can't recall certificates being discussed at all.\n\nKelduum: Absolutely nothing about certificates has been discussed at our CSM.\n\nDoes CCP have anything new for the NPE (New Player Experience), the career funnel missions?\n\nTrebor: CCP recognizes that improving the NPE is one of the best returns on investment; every newbie that subs to the game is a huge win. The exact changes are in planning, and we don't have concrete information yet. You will definitely see improvements to the NPE in 2013.\n\nWould you consider it a failure on CCP's part if nothing about nullsec is being revamped in 2013? Null economy, industry, and Sov mechanics are all very problematic.\n\nElise: CCP is not avoiding nullsec, it just wasn't on their schedule. You can see this on the meeting on the CSM minutes. CCP kind of knew what was wrong with nullsec, and has ideas to fix the largest points of contention. I can assume that many issues will be resolved in 2013. CCP is not clueless about Null issues, including industry and objectives for small gangs.\n\nTwo Step: The first couple of nullsec meetings I had with CCP were like \"yea yea we'll talk about it but no commitments\". I felt a lot better after coming out of the second meeting; that CCP has reasonable approaches about nullsec. CCP has revamped FW by applying fixes and observing, this same approach can be used to fix Null.\n\nTrebor: An encouraging sign is the new development strategy rolling out. What will not happen is CCP devoting an entire expansion to a feature and never coming back. Every feature will be tweaked, observed, and iterated on in subsequent patches and expansions. Nullsec will not be fixed in a day; changes will be incremental in doable chunks that control the impact to other aspects of the game so you don't break something else in the process of fixing one thing.\n\nYou guys seem to have a consensus on SOV being based on use?\n\nElise: I believe that if you have an empire, it should not be just 'pay isk have space'. You should have to harvest and work and live in your space for you to own the space. There are many ways of doing this, but the CSM cannot actually implement anything, but we can tell CCP what would be a good idea and guide them on the right path - but telling CCP \"This is the one true way to fix null\" is not something we do.\n\nSeleene: There should be some level of activity that is needed to hold sov. Sov right now is a room with just a floor, no walls no furniture. You should live in your space to hold it.\n\nTwo Step: My view is that sov is part of the reason that 0.0 has not been touched for a while. \"lets fix null by fixing sov\" is not the right approach. The approach I have believe would be to address \"why do we want sov?\" before fixing sov mechanics.\n\nWith the Battlecruiser skill changes and the added armor tanking skills, there seems to be more skills that a newbie needs to train to become combat effective. Is there anything to address the issue of high SP barrier before newbies can be effective in PVP?\n\nTwo Step: I don't like how they are widening the skill point difference, and CCP adding lots of 'have to train' skills, like the sensor comp skills. While the game needs new skills, CCP should add new skills for new things instead of adding skills for existing things.\n\nElise: You are right that you need more skills to fly a ship, but the amount of SP needed to fly a combat effective ship has been greatly reduced. It used to be that if I wanted to fly logistics on a roam, I would have to train logistics V and other tech 2 skills. Tech 1 ships are very combat effective and can be used in serious fights without having to use extra skills. Before, you fly a Rifter, and then you fly a Drake, and keep flying a Drake for the next year. Now you can fly a variety of ships and still be effective, logi, ewar, you name it.\n\nIs there any plan to make PVE more engaging?\n\nHans: There are big plans for EVE PVE, CCP has a sense of where they want to take it. CCP is aware that EVE PVE sucks compared to everything else, there have been things done like bringing in sleeper AI, but that's a Band-Aid.\n\nTwo Step: PVE is a lot like other MMOs, but EVE is not like other MMOs where you run raids with a dozen friends weeks on end. I know some people play EVE as a PVE game but EVE is just not a very good PVE game.\n\nDo you guys feel the Corp role system is something that is holding down POS revamps?\n\nKelduum: Yes, corp roles are a mess, yes they will be sorted out.\n\nTwo Step: The way the corp roles are coded is a mess. There are ways to fix POS that don't involve corp roles, but corp roles don't help the mess in the slightest.\n\nSeleene: The corp code is based on bitmaps, and running out is a limitation. It's very old code, and it's an absolute mess.\n\nWhat is CCP's views on Miner bumping/ganking/harassment?\n\nIssler: Some say it's working as planned, mining is not meant to be a \"fall asleep and mine\" thing. We've put up with wars and bumping. We don't like it, but it's the price you pay to mine. It's great that barges have been buffed. The change in crimewatch makes it easier for miners to retaliate, and don't pay the bumping bastards. If war decced, fight back. We don't like war, but some members like the change.\n\nHans: The general feeling about James 315's shenanigans is that it's emergent gameplay, but if someone is picking you the player out and following you from system to system that's harassment. But if miners are not doing anything active like counter war-decs, dodging bumpers, and hopping systems, CCP is not going to intervene.\n\nIs there a possibility of changing active skill training from outside of the game client?\n\nSeleene: CCP used to like that you have to log in to EVE to change skills, but they've seen the progress of mobile devices and decided to go along with history. The Crest API should allow much more powerful interaction from out of game, such as skill training and market orders.\n\nLast Fanfest there was a tech demo that showed off tessellation in EVE, when is that happening?\n\nTrebor: There's no way we can influence that, that's all depending on CCP's art team.\n\nSeleene: Tessellation is cool but hard, it's not 'turn on a switch and look pretty'. I would not recommend CCP spend resources on that when there are much more pressing matters to attend to.\n\nIt's clear from CCP's methods that they use SCRUM internally, has it been serving the CSM well?\n\nTwo Step: EVE tends to attract technical people, Trebor used to write code with rocks and sticks. CCP uses SCRUM differently from others, it's part of the learning curve. IF you are running for CSM, I recommend you learn what SCRUM is.\n\nIssler: I used to be a software programmer, CCP seems to have adaptive AGILE pretty well to their product. There's not an awful lot of time to sit around and plan, success depends on reacting quickly to situations and feedback. A Software engineering background is very useful to being on the CSM.\n\nEarlier there was discussion of changing SP training from outside of the game, is there any plan to extend or abolish the 24 hour training limit?\n\nTwo Step: We haven't really talked about that, CCP has been traditionally resistant to allowing external modification of skill queues.\n\nHans: The idea of having gimmicky things like having people log to train skills is bad. If someone is only logging in to train skills, then you have already lost their interest, you have already failed to provide them with entertainment. Don't force people to log in if they don't want to, make them want to log in and PLAY the game. This is applicable to DUST as well, as Active skill points in Dust complicates the matter further.\n\nIs there any talk of changing moongoo production and tech 2 material bottlenecks?\n\nElise: What we have talked about is changing how you acquire material and move away from trickle down production. Harvesting should be done IN space, which populates space and creates content and interaction; almost all income should come from bottom up to increase member involvement. CCP does think space should not be equal, as good space should form a conflict driver, so a gradient of system quality should exist.\n\nSeleene: We've had discussions with CCP about all this, and we should be informed quite soon. The worst possible thing is CCP working on something for 4 months in secret, and then yelling surprise and putting it on the server. CCP not vetting stuff through the community and CSM causes broken monuments.\n\nRegarding the CREST API, it seems CCP is not giving a lot of guarantees of security for third party applications. Will we there be a standard for API security when using third party apps?\n\nSeleene: No, the whole idea of CREST is to give a set of tool to developers so CCP has more time to do their stuff. Access restrictions will be clear, but there be good apps and bad apps, players decide what they will use.\n\nIssler: When you download a CREST, there should be clear restriction and indications of what that specific app has access to. It should not be possible for say, a jump planner app to have access to your wallet. IF you download an app that openly says \"this app can modify your wallet\" and you use it, and your wallet gets emptied, that's your fault.\n\nTrebor: It should be fairly similar to Facebook apps, where when you install one, the app tells you it is allowed to check friend lists and post on your wall. The capabilities of an app should be absolutely transparent.\n\nBecause CCP has been fluffing up stuff for new players, what are they planning to do for 100mil sp players?\n\nSeleene: I would love to tell you that CCP have a concrete plan for veteran players, but they don't. But the best way to do so is fixing the broken stuff in the game so we have fun when we log in and play.\n\nDUST question: When the economy merges, how will they make it so EVE does not hold us ransom? 10 mil is a lot for us, but chump change for EVE.\n\nHans: We have no idea right now, economies are very complex and probably one of the last things to be connected. There needs to be reasons for cooperation, but a massive wealth disparity between EVE and Dust is not healthy for either game.\n\nHas there been any talk of updating the wardec mechanics? Is there anything planned to let defenders to inflict damage on the attackers or end hostilities?\n\nKelduum: I will say that I have been talking to CCP, and the CSM thinks the wardec system is messed up.\n\nTwo Step: We had an argument; I feel that attackers risk too little and defenders risk a lot, I would like to see consequences for failed wardecs and more reward for successful wars. If Alekseyev was here, he would have a lot to talk about it. There is a wide range of allowed aggression that people believe should be possible in EVE.\n\nSeleene: The CSM has some differences regarding this question. CCP likes and promotes how EVE has a lot of freedom and allows you to do anything to anyone, to be the ultimate asshole or ultimate hero. Finding the right balance can be hard.\n\nIssler: Wars have to have conditions for both sides, with clear goals. If you dec and lose, there should be repercussions. If you defend and win, there should be rewards.\n\nDoes CCP have any plans of going over certain PI products? Some items like hydrogen batteries are still NPC seeded. And the resource requirements for various components can be unbalanced.\n\nTrebor: There are some parts of PI that can be frustrating, such as reconfiguring large amounts of processors. The less NPC item seeding the better, and PI is a good way to provide for replacements to seeding. CCP Unifex has stated that PI was something that would be a good example of moving [gameplay] out of the EVE client, such as onto tablets.\n\nSeleene: PI has been somewhat insular since inception. I would like DUST to greatly affect PI. But mostly I want to bombard the hell out of people's PI from space.\n\nHans: PI needs to have better integration with the economy. PI needs to provide key components before it can become important enough for DUST mercs and EVE players to bother fighting over it. While POCO shooting is a nice conflict driver, there is much more that can be done to increase the amount of combat PI can cause.\n\nIs CCP planning to do more iteration to drone warfare? Currently it seems like sentry drones are the only drone that have major impact.\n\nElise: With the current EVE environment, drones are a very effective weapon in PVP, with ECM, sentry, and neut drones all being quite effective. For small-scale combat, sentries are not very good, but I would like more ships being able to be effective droneboats. To be honest, there are things more pressing and broken than drones that need to be fixed first.\n\nHow does CCP intend to balance Nullsec and Highsec?\n\nElise: Null and high should have distinct roles, and have lots of interaction. But we should not have to import all our Tritanium from high, and high should not be absolutely reliant on null for some things. Overall null should be better, but there should be things that high sec can do very well.\n\nTwo Step: Right now the balance between null and high is whacked. Nullsec is supposed to be this high-risk, high-reward place, but right now there is not a lot more risk and not a lot more reward. There's a lot of risk in taking territory in null, but not a lot of risk once that's done, things like ratting and moon production are all relatively safe.\n\nSeleene: Nullsec is great as it allows players to have control over their environment, and as such, null has more inherent problems. Null has been broken for a long time, and there have been many failed attempts to fix it, but players should not have a terrible time just living there. Right now highsec is working, and null is not.\n\nIssler: Risk reward is broken, it seems like null can be extremely safe, and the passive rewards are not proportionate to the risks. The difficult part was null logistics.\n\nT2 BPOs seem to be broken, is CCP planning to address this issue?\n\nTwo Step: As a T2 BPO owner; I don't think they should be removed. I didn't get my T2 BPOs from lottery. They are not as broken as people think. It's nice that T2 BPOs form a kind of end game goal for industrialists. Although Seleene having lots of T2 BPOs is not related to him being a former dev.\n\nIssler: I was back there in the lottery but never got one, my corp makes money from T2 production, but I don't worry about people with T2 BPOs. You can make money without them; the volume from T2 BPOs reduces their impact on the market.\n\nAny plans to improve other API? Along with plans to improve the in-game browser.\n\nTwo Step: The existing API is not something CCP wants to deal with; after CREST is done, people should have more information to work with from API. As for the IGB, it would be nice for it to have more functionalities, but we shouldn't expect anything soon.\n\nAny further changes regarding Titans?\n\nElise: Whenever we speak about supers, the response from CCP is \"we'll deal with supers when we are done with this\". I think the Titan nerf was overdone. With the amount of ISK damage, converted to plex, we would have wrecked a BMW. Fozzie and Grayscale thinks that supers should have some role, they should have uses in some way, they've been changing subcaps at a breakneck pace, you should expect Supercap changes SoonTM\n\nSeleene: The reason that CCP is dragging super rebalancing is that CCP has a lot of other things to do that gives immediate impact to the game - everyone in EVE flies subcaps. Supercaps are a big deal, not just to the people flying them. Number tweaking will not suffice; CCP will have to put a more thought into it, which is why they are putting it off.\n\nIt seems that CCP is introducing Learning Skills 2.0, with more mandatory skills like sensor comp skills instead of just nerfing ECM. Why are some modules such as armor plates getting skills, and others like ASBs are not?\n\nTwo Step: CCP should not be adding skill for the sake of adding skills; new skills should mean new interesting things you can do. I don't like how people have to train through sensor comps just to be able to fight. But people need stuff to train; I'm training stuff for fun at this point.\n\nElise: I'm ok with the new skills because they are not necessary skills, but skills like armor comp lets you specialize without wasting too much time on them. I like the idea of being a better pilot in a certain ship because you put a bit more time in it. Although the ranks for some of the new skills could be lower.\n\nHow has the actual running platforms for the CSM7 election affected what you guys actually do/what has been accomplished?\n\nTwo Step: I ran on a POS platform and made a big fuss about it, and some things are being done. Some people ran for CSM with grandiose \"how to fix everything\" ideas. The most important skill for being on the CSM is being able work with other people, being able to communicate and provide appropriate feedback, rebuking CCP to hard might cause them to ignore the CSM altogether. The point of the CSM is not to play junior game designer, but rather looking at specific points.\n\nSeleene: I ran on getting the CSM more power and responsibility. If the CSM has no power, no influence, then it becomes irrelevant. I tried to define a role for the CSM, getting it more involved, and getting the stakeholder project running. I think CSM8 will probably be the most empowered CSM that will take office.\n\nTrebor: anyone who runs on a specific platform of \"I'm gonna do this\" is being a bit naïve. The best use of a platform is giving voters an idea of how they think, how they work, their sense of professionalism, and how well they would handle responsibility. The arguments that hold the greatest sway with CCP are the ones where you can make a good business case that the action will create/retain more subscribers over another. Crafting a good argument is key.\n\nSix out the eight of you here are not running for CSM8. Why not? And for the two that have not stated intentions (Trebor and Greene), are you running?\n\nTwo Step: One of the reasons I'm not running is that it's taking a lot of time, and I miss playing Eve. I live in the US where vacations are less frequent, 2 Summits and Fanfest means I have no vacation time for anything else. If not for that, I would probably run again. Putting a lot of time into the CSM burns you out; some people just need a break. Perhaps I'll run again later\n\nHans: I have personal reasons regarding marriage and continued education. I planned to come in for only one year, and this played out how I expected. CSM is exhausting and rewarding; I'm looking forward to playing the game rather than just talking about it. In the past some CSM members get frustrated with the CSM and CCP when they finish their terms and they'll walk away from the game. This time, most of us are just leaving the CSM but staying in EVE.\n\nSeleene: It's a time issue. I've been to Iceland a lot. I just started a new job a few months ago, and the amount of time you have to put into the meetings and reviews and feedback is exhausting. It's a young man's game. We've gotten a lot done, and I'll leave happy that we left CSM 8 a very solid foundation to keep working. Anyone that can stay on CSM for more than a few terms is probably not right in the head, or has a lot of time.\n\nTrebor: I have no final decision, I'll decide when white paper edits are released and when I see who else is running.\n\nGreene Lee: it's a very complicated situation, there are lots of really good things about the CSM, but real life calls. I'll make a decision next week.\n\nIssler: I think the CSM is in a very good position now. I've done all I can do and would like to get back to play the game. CSM is a lot of work; it's not a free trip to Iceland. Don't run if you can't commit your time.\n\nElise: I was really passionate when I first ran. It's not like that I'm burnt out, I can do this again. But I want someone else to take up the reins of the CSM, and get that experience, and do their part. One of the reasons CSM6 was so successful was that it was full of fresh blood, and fresh ideas. If I ran again, I would be denying someone else that experience. Despite rumors, I don't plan to work for CCP, as my game design ideas are crap.\n\nKelduum: I want to actually play the game, working with E-uni and not just the CSM.\n\nCCP requires people to place their IRL identity to run for CSM. Is that preventing a lot of quality candidates from running?\n\nTwo Step: I agree that putting your real identity on is not a good thing, but it's not our decision, its CCP's.\n\nSeleene: This has come up in every summit, CCP' answer has always been yes, you need your real identity.\n\nAngry Mustache\n\nAngry Mustache is a novice EVE player who is very often reminded of his poor decision to start his name with the Letter A. He also regrets wasting all three remaps within the first month. Extremely proficient at losing ratting Tengus."

Either way it should result in no modules being dropped, or at the very most a chance for your cargo items to drop (I think this is the case now).Well, as for me, I never knew that SDing didn't drop anything and as far as I am concerned, they can hide/mask the mods of the SD'd ship on the mail and destroy everything in the ship (except for the salvagable wreck!) or somesuch shennanigans.

These only kick-in though if there is any contention.\nSo, how about making the ports dependent more on these things, that is, if they don't get a regular supply of the items then unrest starts and contention points start to be automatically gained for the none owning factions.\n\nThat actually gives none PvPers a more active role in the game. You want that nice port to stay uncontested, then you also need to help feed it with what it needs\n\nI gotta say I support a \"Convoy\" type mission system. It would be difficult to make it so its not a gold farming machine though.\n\nPerhaps if it were made with the same intent as the freetrader missions. Eventually you convoy from port to port and once you've compleated them all you get a nice general slot item. Maybe like \"Lead Lined Convey Armor\" specially made to escort friends and block enemy fire."

      "text": "The Enemy of By Enemy is My Blob\n\nCombat in EVE Online is conducted on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis. From an alliance war declaration that rocks the political landscape to an obscure border skirmish that is forgotten the next day, the decision to engage is always made according to what each party has to gain or lose. Other player interactions are also based on the same economically rational patterns of thought - buy and sell orders, contracts, scamming, mining operations and wormhole expeditions - but these instances are hardly surprising.\n\nWhat sets EVE apart from the MMO norm is that when two players, gangs, fleets, corporations, alliances, power blocs, or any other arrangement bring their arms to bear, the order to engage or to mobilize for war is not given based on the answer to a subjective question like \"will this be fun?\" but is instead framed by an objective question like \"what do we stand to gain, and does that outweigh what we stand to lose?\" This peculiar, inexorable consideration that is forced upon the capsuleer is is source of the foremost complaint about PvP in EVE - \"blobbing\" - and the quasi-mythological status of its opposite, the \"1v1.\"\n\nThe choice to engage in PvP combat is made according to a cost-benefit analysis because the \"death\" of the player - the destruction of their ship - is final. Destruction is a possibility that the player must confront and accept every time they undock a ship, whether it be to other players, NPC belt pirates, or an accidental click of the self destruct button. However it happens, once a ship is destroyed, it doesn't come back. The player doesn't rise as a ghostly apparition out of a nearby graveyard, make the trek back to the scene of his death, and slip back inside his pristine, intact ship. When a ship dies, the player doesn't just lose the time and effort he put into getting the ship, but also the time and effort attached to the modules, rigs, cargo, and - if he is unlucky - his pod and its implants.\n\nThe numerical measure of a ship's existence is how much it and its accessories cost to obtain, as is the measure of its destruction. Killboards everywhere tirelessly tally and record the ISK forever consigned to space dust; according to BattleClinic, I've helped send over two billion ISK to its cosmic grave. Money flows in and out of EVE every day, entering the world through the magical printing presses of Game Time Cards, bounties and loot, and leaving it again in thousands of brilliant blue flashes. It enters and exits through incessantly flashing wallets, leaving each player to make the call when the time comes to throw themselves headlong into PvP. How much they will lose if they die is the cost factor of the analysis.\n\nThe benefit can take several forms, but it is essentially the same monetary measure of how much the opponent will lose. Sometimes - such as in alliance fleet battles - it is enough to inflict the monetary loss, betting that the enemy's will to continue fighting cannot outweigh the costs they incur. Piracy aims to extract money through ransoms or high security ganks, manifesting the cost differently. Complications aside, the deciding factor in whether or not two forces come to blows boils down to at least one of the two coming to the conclusion that the potential benefits outweigh the potential losses - the risk of death is worth taking."

      "text": "Saturday, January 26, 2013\n\nGiving Newbies Some Space to Learn\n\nNewbies have it tough in EVE Online. They're thrown into the deep end, no swimming lessons or inflatable armbands to help keep them afloat. It's a sink or swim scenario, and many newbies sink.\n\nIf a newbie is lucky, they find a group of people willing to help them out. Throw them a line. Be patient with them. Answer their 8000 questions.\n\nMore often than not, they're left treading in the weeds, always struggling to stay afloat.\n\nEVE Online might benefit from a newbie starter zone. Every other MMO has one. And, yes, there's something to be said about a game so cruel and unforgiving, that it's left to chance whether a new player succeeds and stays, or is frustrated and quits. EVE Online is an old game though, nearly a decade old. It needs new players to survive for yet another decade.\n\nNow, before you get all out-of-sorts, I am not suggesting a safe starter zone. Simply a starter zone that allows newbies to make their mistakes alongside people of similar skill level and/or experience in the game. (Always the former, not necessarily the latter.)\n\nThe Starter Zone Pocket\n\nThe starter zone would be walled off from regular New Eden. It could be in it's own pocket of developed wormhole space. I would suggest that there be one pocket for Minmatar/Gallente and another pocket for Caldari/Amarr. Or there could just be a single pocket, if there's a desire for increased population, leading to more player-to-player interactions.\n\nEach pocket would consist of fifteen systems. seven highsec systems, five lowsec systems, two nullsec systems, and one w-space system. The normal rules for each type of system applies. No secstatus loss in nullsec. No local in w-space. CONCORD in highsec.\n\nOne of the highsec systems should be an island, only accessible via lowsec. The nullsec system should be a shortcut between the lowsec systems (to teach players about chokepoints.) The w-space system should be accessible from highsec (this would be something players have to scan down, during the scanning tutorial, and considering how difficult scanning is for new players, allowing them to do it in relative safety is important.)\n\nI would also suggest placing two permanent bubbles on the gate-to-gate warp in the nullsec system. This, to teach players about bubble mechanics, and let them discover methods of avoiding gate-to-gate bubbles.\n\nThe Skillcap and Leaving the Starter Zone\n\nThere will be a skillcap for playing within the starter zone. Perhaps 2.5 million skillpoints. Perhaps 5 million skillpoints. When players reach the cap, they are immediately transported out of the starter area to one of the traditional racial newbie stations. All of their collected items (no matter where they are located in the starter zone) are \"hauled\" to their new station. (There could be hard caps on certain types of items transferred, especially those mined and manufactured, in the event players find \"get rich quick\" loopholes.)\n\nPlayers can, of course, elect to leave the starting area at any time. An option to do so would appear in stations.\n\nPlayers can elect to stop their training so that they can remain in the starting area indefinitely. Perhaps because they want to engage in PvP with newbies. Perhaps because they want to act as recruitment for their alliances and corporations. It doesn't really matter the reason. Sure, there will be gankers, but that's okay. New players still need to be introduced to the harsh realities of EVE. In the starter zone, they get to do so with characters near their skill level. It is far easier to get retribution upon a ganker if he too has the skillpoints of a newbie.\n\nInteractions with New Eden\n\nThe only way into the starter area is via a new character. Once a character leaves the starting area, there is no method to return.\n\nInteractions between characters in the starting zone and characters in New Eden proper should be kept to a bare minimum. Given that the area will mostly be limited to T1 items (see Market and Industry below), the opportunities for getting rich would likely be low.\n\nReally Tailoring the New Player Experience\n\nThe new player tutorials can really hone in on specific aspects of gameplay, because of the diversity of systems, and the limited area of play. Perhaps one mission teaches players how to run a faction warfare plex in lowsec, while fighting rats. Perhaps another mission teaches players how to scan down a wormhole, enter it, and then complete some objective.\n\nAll areas of the game can be taught, without sending players on lengthy suicide runs. The starting zone can teach the fundamentals of lowsec, nullsec and w-space. Players can learn, through the starting zone, what areas of the game most interest them.\n\nIndustry, manufacturing and mining can and should be taught as well.\n\nThe Market and Industry\n\nThere should be a fully functioning market in the starting area, but distinct from the New Eden markets. A number of items should still be seeded, but blueprint copies should be available, so that players can manufacture, creating and affecting certain sub-markets themselves. Certain items should be restricted, such as interdictors and bubbles, for instance. Maybe all T2 ships in particular are restricted. (Of course, certain types of gameplay will be restricted due to the skillpoint restrictions.)\n\nPlayers don't need to learn everything in the starter area, and there is the danger of experienced players creating newbies with very specific skill plans, the aim to dominate certain aspects of the zone. So some care has to be taken in seeding the blueprints for manufacturable items.\n\nAll of this should be relatively easy to tweak, though, if problems arise.\n\nOpportunity for Recruitment\n\nOne of the real benefits of the starting zone is as a recruitment tool. Major alliances and corporations can set-up recruitment alts in the newbie zone, to help new players along, and to eventually recruit them into their organizations. It will help alliances narrow-down their search, to locate players that may be of value to them, and who demonstrate specific skillsets.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe newbie starting area is not a panacea for the new player retention problem, but I believe it would help greatly. It's far easier (and less frustrating) for new players to learn a game on a more even playing field with those around them. And it allows the tutorial system greater flexibility and a wider range of options on what can be taught. Currently, the tutorial system teaches highsec, because every other area of space is simply too dangerous for a newbie. The starting area as described allows new players to explore more of what EVE has to offer in an environment where they're more able to defend themselves, in an environment where they should feel less helpless.\n\nThe only people who are the carriers of Eve culture and Eve experience are the veterans. The only way culture is transmitted is from veterans to newbies, through communication. (\"Culture is positively selected social experience expressed in semiotic systems.\")\n\nBy being segregated in this manner the newbies will be forced to reinvent that culture, and it will, instead, be transmitted from older newbies just about to leave the pocket to newer ones. The culture built anew inside the pocket will be radically distinct from the culture outside, simply because the huge number of dice involved never falls the exact same way twice, but once rolled they stay rolled, through the normal process of cultural regeneration.\n\nCulture clash upon emerging from this pocket will be severe, and will cause an even lower new player retention than now.\n\nSorry, you need some other way to prevent newbies from being in conflict with veterans than only letting newbies have conflict with newbies.\n\nIt is, however, a culture, even though all the distinctly gamelike elements have been excised. It's the place where women PVP. (And I'm dead serious. While men in Eve are satisfied with destroying each other's toy spaceships, women in Second Life sink each other's friendships and marriages.)\n\nDon't forget that the dominant culture of EvE online is, well, kind of crap for newbies. If the goal is to sustain the game by attracting more new players by making the introduction less irritating and prone to the whims of jerk vets, maybe it would be *good* to avoid transmitting too much of that culture into the new player zone. Maybe the softening of EvE's existing culture would be one of the greatest benefits of such a scheme.\n\nUnfortunately by the time they get out of the pool, they'll still be more or less unable to compete with the vets, but will suffer from culture clash. And remember, people never get out of the new player pools in groups -- for pure timing reasons it's always a solo endeavour.\n\nI actually wrote about it already so I wouldn't want to repeat myself. Eve's new player experience indeed needs work, just like it's existing culture needs changes to survive -- and no end of either, if anyone cares about my opinion -- but segregation will only make things much worse.\n\nI have been in EVE since 2006, almost exclusively mining and industry, and decided to start an alt to try out FW. I also wanted to see the Aura tutorials. What I found in the Caldari Kisogo-Umpas-Uitra starter area was vets bragging about how many players they had killed. They were proud of making new players mess up and aggress, usually stating how important it was to explain the tough EVE world by blowing them up. The asteroid belts are stripped clean every morning after DT so that those missions in 3 different arcs that require mining an asteroid look impossible (yes, there are ways around it). Those \"helpful\" vets are so quick to help by blowing someone up, but couldn't be bothered to answer a single question. As someone said, \"if you already know EVE, everything is great...otherwise it's a crappy experience to get into.\" Watching this sort of stuff makes me understand why you would propose an alternate area. And while I agree with Mary Titor that the social experience is the best of EVE, it is also the worst. But there was some positive that I saw...\n\nI got 2 private convos. The first was a newbie corp asking me a few questions and then just giving me a much better starter ship and a link to their beginner's guide. They never asked me to join their corp, although there was plenty of info on how to do so. They added me to a private channel that was almost as busy as the NPC corp channel, but full of people actually answering the questions and at times escorting people around up to 2 of the early arc missions. The most helpful advice was how to avoid the \"tough guy\" vets hanging around the starter systems.\n\nMost surprising, the second was from a GM asking what I was interested in and what I had tried. He gave me links to guides/wikis and stayed in chat as long as I wanted to ask questions. He encouraged me to contact him if I ran into problems later. So, I think these positive kinds of interaction with newbies is far, far, far better than isolation. IF IF IF something was done to intervene, I would only go so far as to monitor kills in the starter zones and remove those few vets who think ganking 2 days old newbies is fun and/or educational.\n\nBTW, if anyone wants to visit Uitra, feel free to say hello in that special tough EVE way to LoadedFront/LoadedFront2 and Sir Bulletproof. They are two of the few years old vets seeming to be looking for \"goodfights\" in all the wrong places.\n\nSo it will end being the same as the regular shard accept a smaller version,2-5 mil SP Goons, PL, Test or any big alliance for that matter running things with alts. Why would you want to do that? Totally seems like a waste of developer time to me.\n\nI'm inclined to agree with mary on this one. eve has a steep learning curve, and one of the biggest factors leading to what we feature in the fly reckless failmail parade is player isolation. much like society the odds of becoming a fully function member of the world drastically decreases when you're limmited to a relatively small contact pool. people NEED to bounce around in the hubub of the eve community. they'll learn more in 10 minutes of chatting with people than they will from the tutorial 9 times out of 10. left to their own devices? we run into people who fit 6 different types of weapon to a dual tanked hurricane fitted with a civilian afterburner o_o\n\nI'm not seeing a reason why - why is a newbie going to have a better experience spending their first 2-5 months on a separate newbie server?\n\nPart of what made Eve amazing was that you were part of this huge, living world - massive battles were happening around you which, if you wanted, you could fly to (obviously you wouldn't, but it's a cool thought). You'd see a guy in a freighter autopiloting through hisec, and be blown away by the scale of it. That's a big part of what sold Eve to me.\n\nI guess the only real advantage I see is that instead of going into a lowsec full of high SP vets, newbies now get to go into a (very small and farmable) lowsec to fight the SP-capped alts of vets who specifically came there to fight newbies. Which honestly, is probably worse. Aside from that, I'm not really seeing what you could do with this model that you couldn't do *without* sealing it off from the rest of Eve.\n\nThis. I honestly don't think that the average person just starting in EVE for the first time wants to be sequestered away from the rest of the experience. They're already sequestered enough as it is by their lack of skillpoints. What *inspires* players to get beyond that point is seeing stuff like battleships, freighters, etc. and thinking \"Wow! How can I get into one of those?\"\n\nWe have to think back to how we felt when we first started the game. Would we have wanted a special little area for noobs? I can't say that I would have. In fact, the tininess of such a world would likely have led me into a misunderstanding of the size and scope of the main game. There's no way to really give players the correct perspective without dropping them into it.\n\nThe only reason why I can imagine Poetic actually suggested this is to prevent the occurrence of very highly skilled players ganking newbies. That is really the only point served by this separation. But even when that does happen--and I'm not even convinced it's a super-pervasive problem--people are typically willing to give newbies a few million ISK to kit themselves out again. It's not a very big deal unless the player rage-quits before the ISK hits their wallet.\n\n\"The only reason why I can imagine Poetic actually suggested this is to prevent the occurrence of very highly skilled players ganking newbies.\"\n\nThat, but to a small degree. Mainly to let players experience the various types of space (lowsec, nullsec, and w-space) with other players near their skill level. As it currently stands, the tutorial newbie experience is purely highsec, because any newbie that ventures into lowsec/nullsec/w-space is very very likely to get trounced by a 50M SP veteran. (I see this frequently in lowsec.)\n\nMy idea allows newbies to do a bit of exploring, figuring out what they'd like, in an environment very similar to EVE, but among players of their general skill level. (Which would likely make the experience more fun for them.)\n\nBut if those noobs are unlikely to get trounced going into low/null systems, then what does the experience actually teach them about the game? I could see some noobs coming out of the starting area and thinking, \"Well, lowsec wasn't so bad back there, why don't I try going there now?\", getting trounced, and then being pissed that they'd been ill-prepared for the reality of the actual New Eden.\n\nI don't like ganking, mostly because I feel like the people who do it are the worst kind of bored-ass tools, like people who find Two And A Half Men funny. But the reality is that it happens, and that EVE players are already quite responsive to newbies in need of financial help, fitting tips, etc. And honestly, getting baited into aggressing some dumbass isn't likely to happen more than once to the same player anyway.\n\nHow simply having a button somewhere that says 'What can I do?'. From that, there is a dedicated tutorial on aspects of the game such as FW, the market, low-sec piracy, and exploration, perhaps including a virtual video description.\n\nLots of information already exists about every part of the game. Arguably what's missing is the signpost. For instance, there could be a better advertisement for corporations that recruit newbies than on the launcher splashscreen. Who pays attention to that? Have it accessible in-game, when a newbie wonders what to do next.\n\nI would have to agree with Poetic, it is a good concept. What would happen is most major Corporations would end in a recruitment toon and there would be a decent number of Veterans to help guide, and recruit the newer people. I don't know if it would ultimatley work, but I do understand why Poetic brought the idea up, since there is a \"culture\" in EVE to gank newbies and that's just not good for retention.\n\nThis solves exactly nothing, since you suggest all the \"harsh realities\" are left intact. What is the issue, and how does this help? You don't begin to link new-player retention to this idea in a concrete way.\n\nDo you also realise that players already do this? They start in a newbie system which has unique rules (no can flipping, no messing with them) and then fly off to arnon, where they largely work with other newbies to do those missions. I know I did.\n\nI hate the whole idea of starting noobs in high sec, or other protected space. They should just be forced to start out in one of the NPC stations in null, with no stupid rules about can-flipping, etc. Survival of the fittest.\n\n@ Mary Tito - Being an eve vet I learned the game from scratch without any help at all. So will todays people. They do not need the alliances helping them learn the basics of the game. If the like what they were learning and playing the way the OP wrote then they would stay with the game just like I did. So sorry, YOUR the one that is off base. There is no culture clash since your forcing the issue in your example and in the OP's example it is for them to choose.\n\n@ mordis mydaddy - good post :-)\n\n@ Rixx Javix - Where don't you post online? ;-P and yes he did talk about it before!\n\n@ Connall Tara - I not only disagree with you and you might want to try staying in one corp for a change. People that hop back and forth out of their corporation have issues. How do I know this? I am one of the Bitter Vets that the OP is talking about and I have been here since beta. If you even gave a damn about Eve you would be trying to talk it up and not tear it down. Even CCP is starting to realize that the people like Mary are the main reasons why Eve is not growing like they would like to see it do. They are changing to improve the game. You should want to support that view.\n\n@ Azual - You're in an NPC corp. You're a Hypocrite! You don't embrace eve, you HIDE FROM IT! and if you're an alt then post with your main! Stop giving grief when you have no idea what the game is like. NPC CORP!!!! BAH!!!\n\n@ pjharvey - Good idea but needs to go further. The OP's idea is solid.\n\n@ Khanhrhh - the rules are not followed because the new players do not know what the rules are to petition. So they just quit and that is that. There needs to be more hand holding if they want to keep the new players interested long enough to see the Eve Universe for what it can offer. Not some asshat can flipping or killing them.\n\n…and I am a bitter vet. Been here since Beta, names Interceptor in game and have many different accounts.

      "text": "The design system appears to be taken from WEG's old game Shatterzone and mashed up with some elements from the Star Wars d6 game. It's fairly easy to use but includes a few oddities, such as engines being the same size no matter how big the ship actually ends up being. In the examples, an 879-ton corsair (220 m long) with a speed of 8 has a drive that's 10 tons, while a dinky one-person fighter with the same speed has a drive exactly the same size. How does that make any sense?\n\nIt's not perfect, but it's also free, so it's not like I can tell someone it's not worth their time to download.\n\nI find that the game idea is amazing, and most of it is very well written out. But I agree with Gary on the Steel Helix part, and the whole being unable to create characters thing. I'd love to learn more about the universe here, and have some examples of adventuring here. Along with giving character creation.\nPlease fix this. I want to try and play it most of them good in my opinion. I have always prefered the freedom of the D6 system to most of the others that I have encountered, you just pick a skill and role the dice, and don't worry about feats or bonuses or anything like that. The additions this brings to that simple formula might bring some complexity, but I think they give some good fleshing out to things such as unusual characters and talents. Best of all, its free and plugs pretty much right in with any of the old D6 stuff you still have lying around. What is not to like.\n\nBill Coffin's Magnum Opus Septimus is yours for the asking.\nUsing the D6 system you can now play in this far future setting of a dying empire and a huge Dyson's Sphere.\n\nThis book is the ultimate in expression of the D6 system. Everything you need to play for years is here. Like the characters, there is so much to uncover here that it would take a group years to run out of ideas. If you area fan of Dune, Foundation or of the D6 system, then this really is a must have.\n\nNothing turns me off a game faster than a vague, confusing character generation system. You are told you get 18D to divide between your six Attributes, and how many you can put in any one attribute. Ok, clear. But then you are told to \"prioritize\" your other abilities, like Skills, Modfications, Resources, but not told how many dice this prioritization gives you for each. If I make Skills my top priority, how many D do I have to divide between them? How many skills? How do I determine at chargen how much Resources and nanotech I get? Where I come from? No word that I can find is devoted to these pressing questions. At the very least, the information is unclear. Also, something called \"Steel Helix\" is repeatedly mentioned as effecting the setting but is never simply explained."

The reason the really good detectors are so expensive is because they have been very carefully calibrated and tuned, and have much more sensitive electronics in them.\n\nIndeed, if you take it for a test drive, you can take it to a friendly shop (maybe fora small fee) and they'll hoist it up and see if there's any major defects.\n\nAt the absolute least, you can drive it around for about an hour, see if anything sounds weird, and go to an O'Reily or Autozone and have them plug in an ODB2 reader to get data off all the cars sensors. They are always happy to do this for free btw, for anyone has had their Check Engine light come on and want to know why.\n\nAssuming you already have an orbit, but it's elliptical, here's what you do:\n\n1) Thrust either prograde or retrograde until either your periapsis or apoapsis reaches the altitude you want your circle to be at.\n\n2) Time accel until you reach the periapsis/apoapsis, whichever is opposite of the node that is at your target altitude.\n\n3) Thrust retrograde until your periapsis/apoapsis nodes try to flip sides (it will happen very suddenly!). You should be very close to circular at this point, and you can add a little extra thrust to try and tweak it if you want to.\n\nTo further explain this, the earlier you burn in a trajectory, the less fuel you have to use. Picture a cone, with your ship at the point. A very long tall skinny cone is when you burn early. The angle of the cone is very narrow (indicating very little fuel is needed to change direction). If you have a short fat cone with the same size base, the angle is larger, indicating you're going to have to burn a lot more fuel to get to the same place since you waited longer.\n\nI always thought that was pretty awesome to do/watch. Coordinate the entire platoon to skydrop onto a target at the same time, and watch the hail of drop pods descending beside you (or on you!). Really cool sight IMO. Never seemed overpowered either, because usually what happens is that everyone is fairly randomly spread out, making it very difficult to form a front or flank anything more than small clusters of enemies.\n\nDepends on where you need to go. DHL can be pretty affordable, especially to some of the more out of the way countries. If you do ship it, make sure you get the customs documentation squared away correctly, or you may end up having to pay import taxes on it, which can be as high as 30% of the declared value (most EU countries for instance).\n\nI'd recommend shipping it via a shipping company (UPS, Fedex, DHL). They're going to treat it way better than any airline. And if it does get damaged, you can claim the insurance that you put on it (you did pay the extra $5 for insurance right?).\n\nI put a tower on a flight from Arizona to LA once. It got there with a dent in the side (inside a box with peanuts!) and the CPU cooler had snapped clean off it's mounting brackets. How the GPU didn't snap off the PCI slot I'll never know.\n\nIt is something that is occasionally wrapped on games that also have a Mac version\n\nThis is not correct. Using the GFW logo on a game requires the game to adhere to a specific set of requirements laid out by Microsoft. Among them is support for the Xbox controller. Having a set of standards is not an entirely bad idea, and most of the requirements are sensible.\n\nHaving the GFWLive logo on the other hand, means that the game uses and requires the GFWL online multiplayer service, which is a cock-sucking stain of a system built on the crumbled ruins of broken dreams."

If the Victor is in the game, there will be even less reason to use a Hunchback, because the Hunchback doesn't do anything better than a Victor. I might use a Swayback for farming, though, since it will have a very low cost to run.\n\nNo reason, other then perhaps the Hardpoint system, and the fact that it can, indeed, potentially move faster if given a better engine. Remember we are not from the post 3060s, we can make the Hunchback into a Blitzkrieg now, so long as they let us alter the Medium Mech's engine.\n\nMain difference is using an Atlas gives you more choices in firepower over a Hunchback. It also gives you enhanced armor in comparison meaning you take more to kill. The downside if that your a lot slower then a Hunchback.\n\nHonestly the Hunchback was designed along the same lines as the Urbanmech, a cheap highly effective urban combat mech useless in open combat. Stock there is no reason to use the Hunchback over an Atlas, the thing is though the AC20 is so strongly associated with the Hunchback that if you were to strip it out for other weapons then you can easily take people by surprise if you swap it for like a Gauss RIfle at which point you just made a Hollander, a highly effective sniping unit, especially if you can stick JJs on it.\n\nI suppose another way to consider this is to reverse the question; Why take a Hunchie over an Atlas?\nI would like to see a situation where the Atlas isn't sent into battle, it's committed to battle.\n\nBy that I mean, I want to have it so that when you commit that Atty to the front lines, you'll suffer as a team big-style if you need to bring him back to the rear lines or to your base. You put the Atty somewhere, and you've committed to keeping him thereIn today's class we will explain why 2 mechs of different chassis will never have the same armor!\n\nToday we intend to prove the following thesis - It would not be possible for = armor per weight on an atlas vs. a hunchback.\n\nLet me explain:\n\nWe shall use 1 ton of armor as our unit and pretend that 1 ton of armor covers 10 feet at 1 inch think. (These are fake numbers used to explain clearly the examples used). Then let us assume you are putting 10 tons of armor on the front torso of a mech.\n\nIn order for you to have the \"same\" protection as a hunchback on the atlas you would need more armor than the hunchback, as the atlas is taller and the plates need to cover more surface area. Let us say that an atlas torso is twice the size of a hunchback.\n\nIF you used the same tonnage of armor to cover twice the area then even though it would have = armor in terms of weight the armor would be half as thin. The hunchback would have 10 tons of armor 10 inches thick and the atlas would have 10 tons of armor 5 inches thick. In this case the hunchback would be MORE armored in terms of defense then the atlas as any single location could take twice the hits.\n\nTHIS is why mechs are made smaller. So that you can get more protection out of the same weight in armor.\n\n*Bell rings*\n\nOK people, make sure you are prepared for tomorrows quiz! Class dismissed.\n\nIf you want a 'mech that's like the Archer, but better in every way, wait a few in game decades and roll with a Dervish DV-8D. It has 2 LRM-15s with Artemis and 4 medium lasers, plus it goes 5/8/5, something an Atlas will -never- be able to do.\n\nI understand that the stock hunchback isnt top of the line technology as far as medium mechs go, but my question is this.\n\nIf you can take an atlas, strip down the weapons to the same loadout as a comparable medium, and use the left over tonnage to reach speeds very comperable to said medium, 65 kph in the case of the stock hunchback, quite easy with alot of tonnage left over in an atlas, why would you use the hunchback.\n\nI understand things like being lower profile or not precieved as a high threat target mabye buying you some time from being shot at, but the balance at least for me on the tabletop came at both sides having the same tonnage limits. Since there will be no such restrictions why not just use the atlas? Way more armor and I doubt even a terrible loss with little or no money made is going to be a good enough reason to deter you.\n\nApart from the many reasons already listed, another deciding factor would be initial cost, followed by maintenance costs.\n\nHunchback: small head\nAtlas: can you miss that head? is it possible? it's huge!\n\nHunchback: quicker\nAtlas: slower\n\nI can see some people having a mech bay with an AC20 theme since, truthfully, in my experience playing tabletop battletech, I look at my enemies forces and say to myself 'where are the AC20's?' AC20s are just battle winning guns, they de-limb and end mechs altogether better than anything else out there. So, for those who want to fill their mech bay with AC20 laden mechs, 4 atlas' are probably going to take a while to put together - it might be smart for that kind of player to have hunchbacks as backups to their Atlas(es). I could see the cataphract being popular to these types of players too, since the chasis looks like it pretty clearly will be able to support an AC20 and it's a heavy mech.\n\nThe modification potential of the Hunchback allows it to be tailored for ,any roles other than a short range brawler. You can easily get it to 85kph with a standard engine and a long range loadout for sniping/harrassing. You can even get it up to 118kph (Jenner speed) with an XL engine while still keeping armour and a reasonable weapons loadout. Great light killer or Catapult botherer. Thats why it will be my starting mechPeople keep saying how the Hunchback is noticeably faster but isn't it only like 10kph difference? 4/6 vs. 3/5 in TT that is a nice difference as it means you still get that +1 even when turning but in an open battlefield the ATlas can advance faster than the Hunchback can retreat unless it wants to expose it's near lack of rear armor.\n\nI trust the developers to balance medium mechs versus assaults, and there has to be some economic advantage to fielding them. So I chose as my founder mech the hunchback to stack the +25% c-bills with said developer trust.\n\nBesides, you can crank a hunchback up as fast as 90+ kph if you're willing to spend the cash, and that's a very maneuverable big gun. (though you have to drop back to an AC10 or a Gauss to accommodate the XL engine.) An Atlas, meanwhile can (if you spend a ridiculous amount of cash) move as fast as 65 kph, which means that it is easily outmaneuvered in battle if it's pilot is not careful. An end run around a force to smash their base is harder to pull off against mediums than it is against assaults."

Do all ships other than fighters really take over 50% less damage from auto-cannons?\n\nThis game follows a traditional RTS format, it doesn't matter what the upgrades do it matters what damage type you're flagged as and what armor you're going against.\n\nSpecifically armor types. I know there is an armor medium value in the game and probably light , capital , and heavy or I would guess at the very least. The damage values are the same and correspond to a table stating what the *real* damage is.\n\nThat being said, the game seems to have soft counters not necessarily hard counters which makes it even more interesting.\n\nSo Knighty4, the only way to find out is to dissect the files that have the damage information, then compare and contrast and you'll know what reductions you're up against and what bonuses you are granted when fighting against a certain thing."

      "text": "From the start I've been interested in anything that can enhance the lighting in Freelancer. And since I have no idea how yet the effects in Itano Circus and Plasmafire were achieved (haven't had the time yet to really look into it either), I started with something simple, dynamic headlights. It worked nicely and the effect is pretty nice as well, but it caused a crash when a lot of (dynamic) lights appear in your vicinity. I read a relevant topic on this forum, and it mentioned that Freelancer cannot handle more than 6 (or was it 8?...) lights at the same time. And there was no way around that, at least not at the time where the topic was written.\n\nI was wondering, since that post was at least a year old, whether there have been made improvements in that area, that don't involve hardcore coding / re-writing engines etc. Judging by W0dk4's reply to my introduction post, you would expect there is:\n\nQuote:\n\nHowever, recently, there have been found some nice hacks regarding dynamic lighting without completely changing the engine - check the limit breaking and lighting threads.\n\nI haven't been able to find any information about it though, just the tutorial on dynamic headlights.\n\nAlso, were the effects in Itano Circus and Plasmafire done by re-writing engines / other really complicated stuff, or just by creative coding? I'm curious, because if it involves complicated stuff like that, there's little point for me to look into it. And if it's done by creative coding, I'm all the more interested!\n\nThanks for any info.\n\nPosted on: 2011/7/12 17:26\n\n\"Never argue with an idiot.

You can always go through and see if you can't replicate some of the stuff they do there. Obviously it wouldn't be very respectful to then go use the copied stuff, but it would be a learning process to making your own.\n\nThough I'll be perfectly honest, even if it does raise some eyebrows, but given PF's stupid EULA, I think they deserve to be ripped off.

I personally would NOT recommend anybody trying to mimic their style because while it might be striking for the first minute, I'd never want to play in there unless I was screening people for epilepsy.\n\nItano Circus has moderate bloom and masterful use of ALE editing.\n\nSo in both cases, no, there hasn't been a lot of hacking about, just creative use of tools already available to all.\n\nPosted on: 2011/7/12 18:42\n\n\"Cynicism is not realistic and tough.

      "text": "Author\nTopic: Carrier Alternative (Read 977 times)\n\nI like Carriers, but I think the problem they solve (keeping the number of ships down to reduce CPU/RAM load) might be better solved in another way. What if instead of Carriers, AI-spawned ships could spawn in small stacks. So instead of spawning 2000 ships, it could spawn 200 ships, each in a stack of 10. You wouldn't even need to display anything special about stacks if they automatically split when the total ships in the system dropped. For the best feel, stacks should be mixed with normal ships. So if a wave should spawn 2200 ships, instead of 200 ships + 2 carriers, you would get say 800 regular ships and 140 stacks of 10. Only a total of 940 units are spawned, but the fight's difficulty reflects 2200 ships.\n\nIf I were to break down the details, I'd go with: 1) All ships in a stack are of the same ship type 2) A ship stack's damage is multiplied by the number of units in the stack 3) When a stack's health reaches zero, the number of units in the stack is reduced by one and the ship is fully healed 4) AOE damage is multiplied by the unit count of the stack 5a) Stacks require one tractor beam/unit in the stack, and cannot be tractored if fewer tractors are available from a single source 6a) Paralysis duration is divided by the number of units in the stack 7a) Engine damage is divided by the number if units in the stack 5-7b) Ship stacks are immune to tractor beams, paralysis and engine damage 5-7c) Ship stacks split off one ship when struck by tractor beams, paralysis or engine damage, leaving the rest of stack unaffected When the total number of ships in the current system drops below a given threshold, stacks of units begin to split into individual ships\n\nGranted the AOE damage handling isn't perfect, but it is a fairly reasonable approximation given stacks would only appear in very large battles.\n\nWouldn't stacks of ships be less efficient in terms of damage output ? If I understand you correctly a \"stack\" of ships would be treated as a single ship and thus save CP power. But to accomplish this a stack would have to fire on a single target. If this target is a fleet ship, it would probably be killed and any \"excess\" damage the stack inflicts would be lost.\n\nPS: I'm not familiar with the current mechanics involving carriers: I seem to remember they are capable of firing but I do not know if they attack a single or multiple targets. If the former, then of course my argument isn't valid.\n\nI do like the idea in that you can actually see what ships you're up against and use counters effectively instead of the \"surprise\" you get when a carrier deploys a few hundred bombers right next to the homeworld command station shields.\n\nThis is a cool idea, as it would preserve the balance of large battles much better than even the new revised carriers would. It also sounds like a nightmare to code...\n\nFor the single shot vs the multi shot thing, I guess you could have it increase the number of shots instead of increase the amount of damage. Though this could lead to silliness like 400 shots per salvo. A combination of increasing damage and increasing shots per salvo for each extra ship added could be used to keep large stacks from getting too out of hand, but some fancy math would be needed to keep the DPS of the stack around the same as the DPS of N individual ships. (Basically, how can you take N * damage and turn it into X * (Y * damage), such that X can be made an order of magnitude less than N for large Ns, but still make X * (Y * damage) a decent approximation to N * damage? N is the number of ships in the stack (integral) , X is the number of shots per salvo of the \"stacked ship\" (integral), and Y is the multiplier to individual damage of the \"stacked ship\" (might or might not be integral), where both X and Y are functions of N)\n\nAs for the mechanics of Carriers, here are some of the relevant mechanics of carriers in terms of damage scaling with fleet size in (as of this writing, unreleased) version Prerelease 5.036:\n\nQuote from: Prerelease 5.036 release notes\n\nPreviously carriers were way less dangerous than the ships they contained, tending to make a wave + a stack of carriers feel a lot more like that many back-to-back waves. This is better than the pre-carrier condition of waves capping out at 2000 ships, but still tends to cause the actual difficulty of waves to increase much much slower with the size of the wave than is desirable. So:\n\nNow gets +1 shots-per-salvo per 16 ships inside the carrier (that's on high caps; per 8 ships on normal, 4 on low, 2 on ultra low). So a carrier containing 1000 ships on a high caps game has 63 shots per salvo. Base Attack Power from 1400*mk => 19200*mk (the base strength of 16 fighters on high caps, but without the fighter's bonuses). Seconds-Per-Salvo from 2 => 4 (same as fighter, cuts down a bit on shot-spam). Can no longer fire as though ignoring through forcefields, but it can still move through them. Shot type from dark matter => energy bomb as the idea is not for these to be easily counterable via counter-dark-matter turrets. Hull-bonus against Turret from 0.1 => 1. Hull-bonus against Structural from 0.1 => 1. Hull-bonuses against Scout and Command-Grade staying at 0.1. In summary, a full carrier is now pretty dangerous, but the firepower is still significantly lower (by about 3x, probably) than its total contents. That's fine as they'll probably still feel more powerful than you want them to be. Thanks to Wanderer for inspiring this change.\n\nWell, ignore my former comment: it seems the stack mechanic Hearteater proposes would result in a more accurate approximation of a large group of attacking ships than the present carriers do. It would also give more visual feedback about the attacking fleet's composition.\n\nThe excessive overkill issue could be a problem. Obviously no approximation solution is going to be perfect. A few ways of mitigating the overkill issue are:\n\n1) Double the number of shots fired by a stack, multiple the damage per shot by half the units in the stack. This compromises shot size for some additional processing of extra shots. So x2 attacks and x5 damage for a 10 unit stack, instead of x1 attacks and x10 damage.\n\n2) Prioritize high health targets for stacks. Less frequent overkill when any high health targets are around.\n\n3) Save extra hits from each attack. Determine the number of hits required to kill the target of a single attack, and save any extra to apply to the next attack. Add additional bonus shots when saved attacks exceed the number of units in the stack.\n\nExample: A Teleport Battle Station Stack of 10 ships fires. A single TBS has 8 shots, so the TBS stack has 8 shots. Each shot \"hits\" 10 times (once per ship in the stack). Their first shot hits a target with only 5000 health. Since each TBS hit does 2800 damage, two hits are expended to kill the target and the other 8 are saved. The second shot of the TBS is now resolved, only it has 18 hits now (10 from the ships in the stack, +8 saved over from the previous shot resolution). This continues until all 8 shots have resolved. If the saved shots are 10 or higher, the stack will get an extra shot (just like current attack refunding for targets dying with shots in flight) for every full 10 saved shots. Any saved shots below 10 are just held and added to the next normal attack resolutionCan this go up on Mantis? That way, it won't be lost in the \"shuffle\" of the forums. I guess have a link to this post on the forum in the description so people can see some rational and further ideas on the topicHow many fleet-sized ships do you get with 224 H/K Vs? I could see large ships stacking starting at smaller amounts in that situation. For example, if fleet ships start by stacking 10 ships/stack, starships and up might stack 2 ships/stack. I think an ideal goal would be past 1000 ships in a wave, ~75% of the total ship icons in the wave represent single ships, and the other 25% are a stack of some size. So if large ships made up more than 75% of the ships in a wave, they'd start getting stacked too. And there is nothing to say a stack of fleet ships couldn't be 1000 ships, but probably somewhere around 25 or so it would be too much just from the standpoint of visually being able to identify threatsWaves, not exo waves, I did not bother to count the ships in there.\n\nAs for number of large ships, that save has 1272 massive ships with a total firepower of 1,215,972 (yes, 1.2 million) en route to my planets. So I am seeing thousands of very large ships attacking me. Granted those ships are spread out, but they are there. The AI very much is not happy with me in that game at all.\n\nYeah, but 1000 ships should be roughly the same load on a processor regardless of size. Carriers don't appear until a wave breaks 1000 ships. So 1272 massive ships is just barely above the threshold that would suggest a carrier should be used (and I'm not even certain if Exo-Waves ever use carriers anyway). Just doubling-up those massive ships into stacks of 2 when possible should get it below 1000 units easily though."

      "text": "Yes, I know it's been discussed to death and I know that it's been brought up by the CSM to the devs and (from what I gathered from the minutes) they (the devs) recognize that it's an issue and will be looking to improve them. The point of this thread is to discuss how to improve them and hopefully shape the devs' design decisions.\n\nThe issue:\n\nBlackOps are currently only worthwhile as a tool for bridging Stealth Bombers onto a target for quick ganks.\n\nHow to change this:\n\nLet's examine what really makes a BlackOps special: It has a jumpdrive and can cyno past jumpgates, it can bridge ships in to Covert Cynos and it can fit a cloak without suffering a 30 second sensor recalibration penalty. Other than those three things, they're completely the same as any other battleship, and in most ways vastly inferior to other battleships. Do these benefits make up for the cost and lack of performance? Not at all.\n\nAs far as stealth and combat effectiveness goes, you can fit a cloak to a regular battleship and have the exact same functionality, save the recalibration penalty. Due to the fact that BlackOps suffer the same scan resolution penalty as normal battleships do when fitting a cloak they're no better off than a normal BS when it comes to gaining an advantage while fitting a cloak when attacking targets. The target is almost always gone before the BlackOps ship can lock it, even when using sensor boosters.\n\nFurther more, BlackOps don't have the grid or CPU, EHP and cap to be considered a BS. They're a glorified BC. For the skill requirements and materials required to produce them they should be as good as any Tier 1 battleship with respect to slot count, Grid, CPU etc.\n\nTo address the scan resolution issue: give BlackOps the special bonus of an increase in scan resolution when fitting a cloak. This bonus will be fixed such that when fitting a T2 cloak the scan resolution penalty will be zero, and when fitting faction cloaks there will actually be a scan resolution INCREASE. A negative penalty (bonus) if you will.\n\nBlackOps haven't become the horribly overpowered killers that CCP had feared they would be. Indeed, they're basically useless as front line PVP ships. These are T2 BS, they should act like such. Not some emasculated bad joke of an oversized BC that can bridge bombers.\n\nor..or..give it a cov-ops cloak and bring cpu/power grid up to Tier 2 BS's. I want to train for a Redeemer soooooooooooooooo bad but currently there really is no point in it which makes me a very sad panda.\n\nwell i done some black ops gangs and its pretty doable now.. you dont have to watch for cyno jammed systems anymore. 1 black ops with 30 man sb gang can just be done.. with 1 covert ops hauler.. its expensive tough.. fuelwise\n\nThis was one of the problems highlighted by players when black ops were introduced, however, during the black ops boost CCP improved the scan resolution of the ship line to compensate, effectively adding a built in sensor booster with a scan resolution script.\n\nFor example, a redeemer with a T2 cloak has a scan res of 102mm (Dread Guristas cloak - 124mm) whereas an armageddon without a cloak has a scan res of 110mm.\n\nFurthermore, my armageddon only does 6% more damage than my redeemer if I drop the faction heat sinks for T2. Although the armageddon has 30% more tank, the redeemer has more options to pick its fights and escape.\n\nOriginally by:Neurotica ZeshiYour post is exactly why the ships need to be buffed. Simply using them as a jump bridge for bombers is NOT good enough. And no, fixing the scan resolution issue won't make them OP \"for people such as myself to sit at gates all day\".\n\nHell, I'd forgo every other improvement as long as they fix the scan resolution penalty and give them very good lock speeds with a cloak equipped (like 250-300 scan res with a DG cloak fit).\n\nFFS, they're exotic, highly specialized T2 BS and they suck. Very few people in the game use them. I can use all four and so far I've only bothered trying the Redeemer on TQ because the rest of them are so crappy, and the Redeemer is complete crap anyway. They don't do anything PVP wise that I can't accomplish with a regular BS with a cloak fitted to it. The only difference is the targeting delay of 30 seconds which makes zero difference if you're warping in from a safe spot to kill something. In all respects PVP-wise, a normal BS with cloak fitted out performs a BlackOps BS in every way. That is my point, and yes, it IS a problem.\n\nThese are T2 ships and should act like them. Their performance is lacking vs other T2 ships. T2 usoualy has double the spec of their T1 counterparts. This is not the case with a black ops. Lets compare a AF to a regular frigate. AF's have massive performance advantages double everything, EHP, cpu, pg, DPS, bonuses, and so on reflect being X2 more advanced then their T1 counterparts.\n\nThis is not so with a black ops like it is with a recon or a SB even. Even they have very powerful advantages that make them deadly for a T2 ship. A recon can practically outclass any T1 cruiser with their ewar and with their enhanced resistances they have better tanks. A curse can kill almost any ship that requires cap given enough time and the pilots skill and fitting. A curse can take down even the most powerful BS. If the curse pilot knows what he is doing.\n\nA BS is not a counter to a BC, or is a BC to a crusier, or a destroyer is to a frigate. Bigger is not better in this game. And fights don't turn out like that if the pilot is better then you. Just because your in a destroyer doesn't mean you can take out a AF. I have had people say one thing and then get shown another. Its all about fitting and skill. If you have more experiance and you know what your doing. A AF will even kill ships many times their size simply because they can't be hit easly.\n\nLook on the KB's and eventually you come across ace pilots who kill BS's in rifters. A rifter can kill any ship if the pilot has the perfect fitting and knows how to pilot it. So don't tell me a BlackOps can be overpowered if you give it the proper performance of a T2 ship so it has the same survivablity as atleast x1.5 the standard of a T1 BS. It should also have the ability to use the cov ops cloak or just that would make it useable in surprise attacks with SB's.\n\nCurrently a blackops is just a just a underpowered battleship that never sees the front lines with the exception of the widow. Now thats a decent ship. Give all blackops the same ewar capablity as recons do like a widow does as its comparable to a rook. Then maybe the blackops won't be subcombat battleships.\n\nThe ship costs more then 1/2 bill as it is, make it perform like a half a bill worth of hardware.\n\nPS A blackops is not a glorified BC. A glorified BC is a command ship and they can have the DPS and tank of a BS, Astrate 1250 DPS max, nighthawk 1000/1500 DPS tank or 900 DPS with kin HAM's and 150k EHP, Damnation 500K EHP. A Black ops can't do that because its sub par in performance to even a command ship. Its about as comparable to a T1 BC in defense and DPS.\n\nI think one of CCPs concerns are shown by groups like Burn Eden and Dirt Nap Squad. they are very good at dropping in on the right targets and pwning them. So they might think that buffing them would make them overpowered.\n\nOf course this shouldn't be who they look at. Because there are gangs of rifters that WTF pwn things far more powerful, just because they are better organized.\n\nThe only thing I would wonder, is how often are the other expencive faction battleships used in pvp. A blaghorn (sp?) is about the same price isn't it?\n\nI think they should be able to use interdiction fields like HICS or intedictors. Sure HICs and Interdictors already can, but they can't lock onto covert cynos and make jump bridges. That way you have a covert ship that can uncloak and prevent everyone from warping.\n\nThen they wouldn't need to lock faster, be vitally important, and you don't have to buff their damage/tank.\n\nNo, i think you missed the point of my post. Blackops are not made to be as good as normal bs they are not made to be used as front line weapons, they are not as good as normal bs because they are not designed to be able to go toe to toe with a normal bs.\n\nThey are made to be used in Gureilla wafare tactics hence the jump drive, so you can hotdrop small to medium sized gangs then cloak and hide and then jump out. And they are extremely effective at doing this\n\nOriginally by:Last WolfChrist on a cracker.\n\nPlease come up with an argument that doesn't include 'bridge another N+1 stealth bombers in...'\n\nYes, I get that when used in this fashion they can and do sometimes work. Frankly, as the design currently is, if you jump your Black Ops in with the rest of the ships you're doing it wrong. Why bother? If you've managed to get a few recons together (1-2 Arazus, a few Falcons and a Rapier) and a dozen or so stealth bombers for DPS then what is the point of risking the Black Ops on the front line other than to ***** on the killmails?\n\nPlease try reading what I'm writing before posting next time. I'm saying that currently, from a PVP perspective the Black Ops ships do *NOTHING* that a regular T1 BS can't do with the same cloak fit, besides the issue of the 30 second sensor recalibration time. Same crap lock speed, less DPS, less tank, less EHP.\n\nSo again, *if you're actually going to try and use a Black Ops for PVP*, you're better off just fitting a cloak to a regular T1 BS as long as you can work around the sensor recalibration time, which I can, because the lock speed is so horribly bad anyway that I can't tackle anything with it anyway so the recalibration time is a moot point.\n\nFFS, ignoring the (small) request to fix the grid/cpu/EHP etc., could we at least get the scan resolution issue fixed?\n\nBellum actually does have a point. Why the hell does the Widow, for example, get ECM bonuses if it's never supposed to see the front line? Right now it's pointless. It makes far more sense not to risk the expensive hull and just let the fleet you're bridging around do it.\n\nNow, removing the scan resolution penalty is a horrible idea. It's a battleship hull. With a t2 cloak it already has comparable scan resolution to t1 BS, which is fine. They should, however, have at least similar combat capabilities to t1 BS, if not very slightly more. They would STILL be primarily a logistics ship for cloaky gangs...No one's going to blow an extra 700+ million ISK for a cloak bonus when you could get a faction BS which is actually noticeably superior in direct combat HoweverOriginally by:Anile8erIsn't that the idea behind being \"BLACK OPS\" ? i.e. behind the enemy lines... disrupting local activity... commerce raiding... not going head to head with more generalized PVP ships.\n\nUnfortunately that idea only works in theory. In practice, the only thing you can hope to disrupt are asteroid belt NPC farmers.\n\nAll the real commerce and industry happens in stations and POS. All the valuable traffic goes thru cyno jumps or death star jump bridges.\n\nNobody uses gates anymore for anything really valuable. Not like the old days.\n\nThey currently aren't combat ships, the argument is they should be. And by combat I don't mean sitting in the middle of 200 other ships, I mean sneaking behind enemy lines, attacking isolated targets (ie a ratting BS) and disappearing before the blob can show up. I think that's called guerrilla warfare. This is exactly how a proper recon is flown currently. My pilgrim can ruin a pve'rs day if they aren't paying attention. Why should I be forbidden to do the same with a redeemer?\n\nNow yeah, it has a jump bridge that allows cov ops cloak equipped ships like a pilgrim to travel 3-4 systems without using the stargate. That's a worthless bonus. Ships with cov ops cloaks can quickly and easily make their way there without the jump bridge. Also, as stealthy ships they typically operate in small numbers, not big gangs. Are you really going to whip out a minimum of 1x BO's, 1x Cov ops and a third ship to attack a target that the third ship could simply solo via jumping through a stargate? It makes no sense HoweverDood, with all due respect, if you jump a Black Ops into a bubble camp, you're doing it wrong.\n\nOriginally by:Bellum EternusDood, with all due respect, if you jump a Black Ops into a bubble camp, you're doing it wrong.\n\nThere is no wrong way to play EVE, just profitable or not profitable - until the player quits the game.\n\nAnyway, if you are serious about black ops discussion, you have to consider all possibilities, that's rule #1 of game design.\n\nAgreed, but you're missing my point.\n\nCiting a Black Op's cloaked speed bonus as a dramatic and effective difference worth the seven fold difference in price just doesn't hold any water.\n\nAnd while your use of a Black Ops BS may be notable and unique, if I'm flying my shiny 1B+ BS around in 0.0, I'm damn sure going to be scouting with something less expensive and more agile. Again, sure, it's possible to do it, but why take the chance when there is a MUCH simpler/more effective way to do things?\n\nAs it sits, if they kept BlackOps BS *exactly* how they are now and allowed them to use CovOps cloaks then I'd say fair play and leave it at that. But if they're going to not be allowed to warp cloaked then they need to have the same effectiveness as a regular BS with a similar cloak. It's just not that big a performance increase to warrant it's use over a T1 BS.^ discuss?\n\nMaking them EW warfare ships like recons is a combat role though. As I said previously, they need to be sneak attack ships that can actually take the lead role in the attack, not just sit around as a gimped jump bridge.\n\nIn regards to specifics, previously I suggested just beefing them up to be a direct combat ship with the ability to jump around. I've said in previous threads on the subject many times that turning them into BS sized recons is better. However this needs to be thought out better than just making them a bit better at gank and tank. Turning the redeemer into a BS sized curse is probably a bad idea. It would epically overpowered and would crush the bhaalgorn which *should* be superior.\n\nHere's why: the curse keeps it's t1 arbitrator bonuses (TD and drones) and gets a 20% neut/nos amount bonus + a 40% per level range bonus. Follow that setup on a redeemer and you have:\n\nEnd result is a 75km range on basic t2 heavy neuts sucking out 1200 cap at that range. The range bonus is too much imho. So I would give it the force recon bonus instead, a cov ops cloak rather than the neut/nos range bonus but keeping the amount bonus. In either case it would also get the same buff to defenses that the recons get which incidentally is around +3k armor (to make it equal with t1 counterpart), a ton of resists and +1 low slot or more. This would also require +200 cpu and around +5k grid.\n\nOriginally by:xXxSatsujinxXxTotaly agree on that. There is another proposal for BOs \n\nEdited by: Hirana Yoshida on 12/03/2010 08:26:17 As much as I like the idea of making them worthwhile (ie. worth jumping in after bridge), I still wouldn't do it even if EHP and sensors were on par with T1 BS.\n\nCloaked speed bonus is nice, but travelling any sort of distance without propulsion is detrimental to ones sanity and the occasions where one can honestly say \"wow that bonus is really good!\" are exceedingly rare.\n\nThe only thing they have going for them is the bridge, all other aspects are better covered by other ships. The idea of tying up 5B+ in five ships behind enemy lines because \"it works\" is ridiculous .. you can do so much more with 5 bombers at a fraction of the cost (and its a lot more fun to boot!).\n\nWe need to find a reason to jump in after the minions and I have still not seen any idea that encourages that.\n\nMy suggestions: - Let them inherit a dumbed down version of the Titan bonuses or an entirely unique set. Essentially allow them to act as gang-boosters without the need for gang-links (assumption: does not work cloaked). - Add a maintenance array with minimal or no space for ship(s), a frigate/destroyer hull at most. Allows reloading and refitting for whole gang when out and about."

Using full cap of both mark I's & mark II's (24 & 22 respectively) with a full cap of mark II fighters, mark II bombers, full caps of all the free unlock starships & 3 mark I engineers I've yet to lose a ship when assaulting AI worlds. May want to look at reducing the FF radius they project as it's big enough that when one takes enough damage, another ends up covering it while the damaged one gets repaired.\n\nMy old lame tactic of using reclamators (Leech SS and/or Parasites if available) to build up a massive blob of free ships including types I couldn't build myself isn't possible any more due to the changes to the AI Eye & reclamators which is a good thing. AI Eyes in 4.0 used to be a walkover using that tactic as you'd reclaim units so fast you'd be able to just head straight to the AI Eye & kill it using the ships it spawned itself. I haven't got Parasites to play with yet but Leech SS seem to do enough damage to AI units that they are reclaimed with full health however I guess this is balanced in that they only fire one shot at a time.\n\nMRS appears to be quite 'niche' now. May need it's knowledge unlock amount lowered from 4K as I see no reason why I would unlock it when I can unlock mark II & mark III engineers for the same amount of knowledge which are vastly more useful in v5.0 in my opinion.\n\nCore Shield Generators are a great addition from what I can see. I haven't played long enough to get to an AI homeworld but I like how they force your hand with taking certain systems. I didn't particularly like the old mechanic of forcing you to kill all the guard posts in a AI core system before you could take out the AI core as it locked you in to a certain way to tackling the AI homeworlds.\n\nMy first ARS gave me Space Planes. Not sure if I like them or not yet. Also I've just unlocked mark I Riot SS as one of the AI's has Raptors which I keep having to send my Raid SS after since they like to kite. Hopefully the Riot SS will be able to pick them off or at least slow them down so I can kill them easier.\n\nThe AI Eye would counter-blob you, you'd reclaim the AI blob which would trigger the AI Eye to blob you ad infinitum. It was so lame it made the game a walkover as you could practically generate units anywhere in the galaxy.\n\nYou can still farm somewhat with parasites, but not with \"non-stop continuous spawning\" buildings. Also, thanks to the new parasite mechanics (as of 5.001), farming for high level ships is much, much harder (but still possible)."

Forms convoys and travels between Train Stations causing various problems for the human forces depending on the type of trains in the convoy. Note that Astrotrains do not have a direct attack themselves, they cause problems in other ways....\n\nAstrotrains are enabled individually for each AI under the AI Plots tab during game setup. The range varies from 0 (off) to 10 (nigh-impossible) with 4 being considered the default.\nWhile Astrotrains are extremely difficult to kill, some of the more dangerous ones are easier (relatively) to destroy.\n\nWhen this plot is enabled for an AI, it will spawn Astrotrain Stations on its planets that act as way points for the Astrotrains. Destroying Astrotrain stations reduces the AI's possible destinations and can be used to influence the routes the trains take.\n\nThis plot can be enabled for one or both AIs depending on the challenge you are looking for. Note that the higher this minor faction is set to the nastier the train types it will have access to are. Increasing the intensity of the minor faction will also result in larger convoys so their are more trains in total.\n\nTrain Types (Minimum Intensity to spawn)\n\nTrain Station (1):\n\nWaypoint for astro trains. Destroy to influence train routing. Causes 3 AIP on death. Note that the AI can build Train Stations once the game is under way by purchasing them from the Zenith Trader. Train stations bought this way do not incur any AIP on death. Stats\n\nArmor Booster (1):\n\nActs like the unit of the same name: boosts armor of all AI ships on the planet.\n\nArmor Inhibitor (7):\n\nActs like the unit of the same name: negates armor of all enemy-to-AI ships on the planet (also disables shields, like that unit does, though that may be changed in the future for both; it's a holdover from when the armor inhibitor was the shield inhibitor).\n\nAttack Booster (1):\n\nBoosts the attack of all AI ships on the planet.\n\nCargo Train (1):\n\nHarmless in itself, but each \"delivery\" contributes towards a counter for that player, and when that fills up (you'll see an alert once it's past 50%) it spawns some surprises. The spawns are unpleasant but not massively so (unless you're on intensity 8 or higher, where you're asking for it).\n\nEMP Train (6):\n\nBasically an EMP-guardian in train form. This is another one of the train types that's got way less hp and thus more feasible to destroy than others. If you have scouting on a planet with one of these, it shows up in the alert box.\n\nForcefield Jammer (7):\n\nPrevents human forcefields/shields from working on the planet it's on.\n\nGravity Train (4):\n\nHalves the speed of all enemy-to-AI ships on the planet.\n\nGravity Jammer (6):\n\nPrevents human gravity emitters from working on the planet it's on (the limited-range stuff, not planet-wide stuff like logistics stations or grav drills).\n\nNuclear Train (10):\n\nKinda like an EMP guardian, but only triggers on non-destroyed planets with a human command station present. Oh, and it's a nuke instead of an EMP. Destroys itself when it goes off. This is one of the train types that's got way less hp and thus more feasible to destroy than others. If you have scouting on a planet with one of these, it shows up in the alert box. If destroyed by hostile fire the nuclear explosion does not go off.\n\nRadar Jammer (4):\n\nActs like the unit of the same name: halves attack range of everything on the planet. There's also a MkII variant that only halves enemy (to the AI) ranges.\n\nRegenerator Train (1):\n\nResurrects AI units that are destroyed on the same planet. Sacrifices its own health to do so and resurrected units are teleported to a nearby AI planet nearby.\n\nRepair Train (1):\n\nBasically a super-MRS.\n\nShield Train (2):\n\nBasically a shieldbearer (the shield does not push enemy units). Has a lot less health than most of the other trains and is thus somewhat feasible to kill.\n\nSpeed Booster (1):\n\nBoosts the speed of all allied units.\n\nTachyon Train (2):\n\nProvides planet-wide tachyon coverage for the AI.\n\nTachyon Jammer (3):\n\nPrevents human tachyon emitters from working on the planet it's on.\n\nTractor Train (2):\n\nHas a bunch of tractor beams.\n\nTractor Jammer (6):\n\nPrevents human tractor beams from working on the planet it's on.\n\nWidow Train (4):\n\nHas a bunch of paralyzing tractor beams.\n\nNote that the intensity as listed is the lowest intensity you will see that type of train. As the intensity setting goes above this minimum the more you will see that type of train, and higher Marks of trains for the types that have abilities that scale.\n\nTrain Station\n\nTrain stations simply act as waypoints for Astrotrains and have no abilities or attack of their own.\n\nTrains Stats\n\nMost Astrotrains are high-health trains with their own special ability. Note that all trains have the Tachyon Emission Ability that varies based on the specific train type.\nMark level for Astrotrains is in relation to the special ability only, none of the trains base stats change based on Mark.\nThe following table lists the standard train stats, train specific abilities and other stats are listed below."

As IdrA pointed out in his Real Talk episode with JP, balance completely aside, it's simply a boring and luck-based dynamic, requiring no real skill or much effort to deal with. In Brood War, actual mechanics and skills were much more important, also making the game more of a sport. That's why I think it's a problem in game design.\n\nSo how do we resolve this issue? Removing the Mothership doesn't seem to be the answer, because then Protoss wouldn't have anything to deal with Brood Lords.\n\nSo here's my suggestion:\n\n• Remove Vortex, add some other ability to the Mothership that would still make it a worthwhile unit (such as the \"Planet Cracker\" from early alpha) • Remove the Broodling(s) spawning from the Brood Lord's attack, instead increase theEDIT: To clarify, I'm in no way complaining about balance. Just that this would, in my opinion, make SC2 better as a game and as a sport.\n\nRemOn May 26 2012 19:18 Ballack wrote: RemMy problem with this is that the Mothership is not an issue, Vortex is.\n\nRemoving the broodling mechanic completely ruins the point of broodlords. Its also incorrect to say maxed brood lord infestor vs mothership armies is luck based and skill less, if anything it takes too much caution and care to play out. Its just that its an endless stalemate which is heavily dependent on the map as to which side can break it. On the current map pool, zerg is favoured to win such a stalemate eventually.\n\nBalance issues should not be dealt with by game alterations like new abilities or units or what not. Just tinker with what already exists. In this case, reduce the cost of carriers, both time and gas wise to enable toss to get enough of them out to deal with a maxed brood lord army. The mothership already exists to buy time against anything less than 15 brood lords, (for 8 or so brood lords, pure blink stalkers will even do), but carriers are really required for the crazy 20+ brood lord armies. Maxed brood lord armies take a long time to set up and move out, the zerg needs massive spine walls, high energy infestors, and the brood lord crawl is v slow. Its silly that even that time is not enough to get out a sufficient number of carriers without worrying about dying to a sudden attack.\n\nOn May 26 2012 19:14 emis wrote: So how do we resolve this issue? Removing the Mothership doesn't seem to be the answer, because then Protoss wouldn't have anything to deal with Brood Lords reason why void rays can't be used against broodlords is that they get owned by infestors before they can deal significant damage.

And going back to guardians would seem very boring.\n\nI actually agreed with Idra on this. I think some other pro players also have stated this. Balance completely aside, it is simply horrible in late game ZvP where everything is Mothership+army against BL+spine+spore which creates an uninteresting game. There is no diversity as everything is the same in ZvP late game.\n\nI hope Blizzard would just redesign the mothership but seems like they are removing it at HotS.They should remove the boring collosus and put in the reaver or something similar.\n\nI agree with the OP's suggestion. I have never liked the fact that broodlings are A) invulnerable until attack and B) are infinite, unlike carrier interceptors which function in a nearly-identical fashion. I'd like to add that if broodlings aren't removed entirely in favor of a new attack style (similar to the guardian), then they should cost money and take time to build and rebuild. I'd also like to see the attack rate of the brood lords reduced slightly so that protoss units actually have a chance to get near and underneath them, which is nigh-impossible at the moment without a mothership[Just tinker with what already exists. In this case, reduce the cost of carriers, both time and gas wise to enable toss to get enough of them out to deal with a maxed brood lord army.\n\nThe problem is that, by this point, the zerg is on at least 5-6 hatcheries. When the first carrier or two come out, the zerg just holds down the C button for a second and 10 corruptors beat everything that's coming out of the stargate.\n\nMothership is not only a vortex machine. I think Ace played a beautiful game while using recall all the time.\n\nI don't know what exactly to do for PvZ but i sure hope that Blizz will do something (new unit/new abilities) that don't do aoe damage. Something microable would be a ton better. I much rather see a micro dance, where maybe Protoss has to chip some units away from Z rather than ball vs ball action\n\nThere are more than enough tools available for Protoss to use against Zerg in the late game.\n\nIf only the Mothership had a useful ability that wasn't Vortex.. if only!\n\nProtoss players are generally used to deathball style play. Switch the play book, multitask your way to zealot/dt warp ins at expansions, warp prism harass, ht drops, blink stalkers into mass recall, put cannons everywhere and if you do somehow get lucky you can even go for the ultimate carrier/void ray, archon/ht, mothership ball of death.\n\nThe match up may be volatile and there are certain moments where each race has a powerful advantage over the other, but generally it's not an unbalanced match up. It's volatility makes both Zerg and Protoss players happy to complain about different things. It's not perfectly balanced by any means and some things really don't work very well, but it's not completely biased in either way right now. Whether that changes as Protoss players step up their late game play, we shall see.\n\nOn May 26 2012 19:14 emis wrote: Removing broodlings would make blords too weak against mass marines, and generally a lot weaker, so that lategame would have to be re-balanced.

Blizzard did not want their game to be mechanically demanding, and they could not have guessed that it would have 10+ years of success for the mechanical skill ceiling to rise that high. This is clear from their later games, where with improved technology, they removed the obsolete skill caps required to play, what is ultimately, a real time STRATEGY game."

And finally new elements to the map; system view has planets, and galaxy map shows a fading zoom-in special effect on current star system.\n\nLittle by little coming together, just few more features to be able to neglibly call it a game\n\nReleased 0.1 version in the ftp, just to get feet on the door before competition closes Ok, maybe there is still over 24 hours time left, but i can still upload new versions later, right?\n\nIt's still heavily in progress, although the main thing, travelling is done. I hope you like the warpdrive. Mothership is slightly different and bigger from the normal combat ship, and also, while exploring v0.1 you will find enemy ships in unknown systems. They just don't do anything. All ships in same systam as player is in, have highlighted crosshair in the map."

Immobilizing transports will force their passengers out. Preventing an enemy vehicle from shooting for a turn is often enough (unless it can shrug off those results like GK), etc. While every DE player dreams of having first turn and alpha-striking most of the enemy off the table, this will (almost!) never happen in reality. Instead, you need to use your movement and weapons (and cover, hence why LOS blocking stuff is vital) to hide from some of his army, and shutting down the rest (whether it be through stunned, shaken, etc).\n\nWhen I play DE, I generally plan my movement and shooting around preventing my opponent from shooting back in his turn. Nothing more annoying than having your vehicles which can see the enemy unable to shoot due to damage table results, while the ones who can shoot are either out of range or out of LOS!"

      "text": "First, nothing is ever easy in interstellar trade. You've got to find commodities that are worth the trip, get them to a different planet, and then convince the locals to give you other worthwhile commodities or local currency rather than simply killing you and taking your stuff. If your target market is a reasonably civilized world with mature markets, there's relatively little danger. Which is why everyone else in the sector is already there, trading ahead of you and driving down profits.\n\nEven assuming you can get the stuff there and get it sold, you have to take your pay in local credits or commodities. In a default game of Stars Without Number, currency differences are glossed over because they're not terribly important. If PCs intend to make trading a serious part of their game, however, it becomes much, much more important. Credits from Gateway are almost worthless on Polychrome, because the locals of Polychrome have no way to translate Gateway money into usable goods or services. Instead, a Gateway trader brings in a load of spike drive components and trades them out for Polychrome cyberware, which he brings back to Gateway and converts into a new load of drive components and a local profit which he plows back into goods and services on Gateway.\n\nMoney in a trade campaign is specific to each world. You can usually convert small amounts of credit to and from other currencies on worlds with active interstellar trade, as collateralized claims exist to support modest amounts of exchange, but you're not going to be able to haul a million credits of Polychrome currency over to Gateway and buy yourself a new merchant frigate.\n\nBut let's assume the players want to go through this after all, and are willing to put up with the difficulties of the enterprise. You want to give them something more elaborate than the simple profit roll given in the GM's Guide section of the core rulebook. What do you do?\n\n1 ton of safe, low-margin but easily salable goods costs 1,000 credits. These are electronics, rare industrial chemicals, plastics, seeds, medical supplies, et cetera. Most planets already have their own supplies of these goods, but by carefully choosing variants that they don't possess or are short on, the captain of a trade ship can expect to be able to sell these on most planets.\n\n1 ton of risky goods costs 5,000 credits. These are unique planetary specialties, exotic rare earths, cyberware, local art, or other niche goods that may or may not have a market on any other world. Getting these sold requires either excellent market scouting or a great deal of wheeling and dealing on the ground in order to find the right buyers.\n\n1 ton of treasure can't be purchased reasonably, but is worth 10,000 credits. Treasure is fabulously valuable stuff that can find a buyer anywhere- usually pretech gear and components, construction nanites, pretech medical supplies, or anything else that has almost universal applicability and desirability. If the PCs want treasure, they've got to go find treasure, and that means adventuring to get their hands on the stuff.\n\nOnce the PCs have spent their local credits, they can haul the cargo to whatever planet they think will make a good market for it. Once it comes time to sell, let them roll their Business skill, modified by Int or Charisma. Apply the following modifiers to their roll.\n\n-2 for selling risky goods. -4 for selling on an anarchic hellhole with no real law. -2 for selling on a world without a secure rule of law. -1 for selling on a world where they've angered some important local.\n\n+2 for selling safe goods. +1 for selling on a world where they've made a powerful local friend. +2 f or selling on a law-abiding and civilized world.\n\nOn a roll of 2 or less, they've managed to get the locals bent on stealing the cargo and their ship, either through brute force or through legal shenanigans. Pick a local grandee or government official; that NPC is going to do everything in his or her power to seize the cargo and the PCs' ship, though a particularly large favor performed might get the ship released.\n\nOn a roll of 3-6, they can only sell the goods for half their purchase price, unless they perform some favor for a local buyer. Maybe he needs help before he can afford to pay decent prices, or maybe he only needs the goods if a certain difficulty is solved for him. If the PCs work something out, they make 1d4+2 * 10% profit on the sale.\n\nOn a roll of 7-9, they manage to move the goods with minimum fuss, and make 1d4+2 * 10% profit on the deal.\n\nOn a roll of 10-12, they can sell the goods for 1d4+2 * 10% profit, but there's a special buyer who's willing to give them twice that percentage if they can do them a little favor.\n\nOn a roll of 13+, they find a desperately enthusiastic buyer, and can sell the goods at 100% profit.\n\nMarkets are subject to flooding. There are only so many tons of anything that a world needs to buy in a given timeframe. You should feel free to cap the maximum number of tons of goods that PCs can sell on any given world in a month. A full merchant frigate's cargo hold is usually a good limit; the massive cargo freighters that still exist only make economic sense on limited high-volume runs between major powers.\n\nThe above little system isn't enough to hang an entire trade campaign on it, but it should be enough to suffice for those PCs who want to make occasional trade runs. Letting the PCs earn large amounts of credits isn't really a balance problem in SWN, because there's not anything unbalancing they can actually buy with their money, unless the GM intentionally allows them to invest in pretech artifacts or major warships. Cash most often serves as simply a tool for accomplishing the goals that the PCs have set themselves, and a GM should feel free to just sit back and let them use their wealth accordingly- taking into account, of course, the myriad troubles that tend to accumulate around those who are both wealthy and subject to squeezing by other powers."

It really isn't enough to make a difference though, not like when I played pre-Exodus anyway (where ships would often pop with small amounts of armour and shield left because of the sheer amount of bleedthrough that happened back then)\n\nQuote:The idea is that if you are tanking shields you most likely have higher resistances there and a hit taken in armor would be more damaging.\n\nAgain, though, if the mechanics of TSM have indeed been changed then this is no longer the case and there is no longer any advantage in having it untrained.\n\nOriginally by:Rawr CristinaThere is NO shield bleedthrough at 30%, regardless of what level of TSM you have trained.\n\nShield bleedthrough doesn't start until 25%, by which point you are already dropping well below your peak recharge. If your passive shield tank didn't hold at 30%, it will be going down so fast at this point that bleedthrough will not gain you any noticable recharge. If you kill off enough incoming damage or warp out before your shields fail, then you will be better off if there was no damage done to your armour at all.\n\nOriginally by:Esmenet No it does not. You dont understand how it works. The bleed through comes in addition to shield damage.\n\nDefinately didn't used to work like that , must be a recent change.\n\nI tested this about 2 years ago for the first time (i was actually testing the bug this skill had when trained to lvl5), but at that time it already was additional damage so it is not a very recent change Because of the small amount of leak-damage it doesn't really matter though."

      "text": "There are only three ships in this game that can out do the patrol escort\n\n1) The Bug. Why? Faster, heartier, more agile and has the same potential outlay\n\n2) The Fleet Patrol Escort. Self Explanatory.\n\n3) The Chimera. Bigger, thicker, more crew = faster healing, The Phaser Lotus (BFaW activated with the more powerful phaser lotus? Talk about a beautiful death) And then the DTS Console? She is my answer to the question if the god like set up of the fleet patrol would work in a cruiser. Answer? Oh God yes.\n\nI have been preaching this for years the Fleet patrol outclasses every escort in this game she has the perfect set up. If you want more dps EPtW if you want more heals EPtS, just that pivotal skill alone changes the balance of this ship.\n\nThe Steam runner is fine and dandy but there is not much you can do Eng wise to really help your ship since eng basiclayy repairs your hull not so much your sheilds which is far more important. If the steam runner did not step down a peg in sci I would put her on this list but because she stepped down you lose pivotal skills like RSP ESS both which are pivotal skills to be repleaced be a debuffer and two EPt's. If they made one of the eng slots universal I would say it's a go.\n\nThe other escorts folishly give up that pivotal eng slot for a tac one slot, that tac one slot is just weird it's like the tail wagging th dog their is not any more potential damage in that so I'm not sure why people say their is if their is any it has to be Beam O one or something since EPtW far out classes it if it's anything other then that and even then over the length of the skill you will do more damage. So unless those other ships have some super nova console which most do I wouldn't bother with them... unless I was just buying the ship to move the console like if you get the temporal set... talk about worth the effort.\n\nWhy isn't the Fleet Saber on this list? It has the same layout as the Fleet Patrol, but has slightly better manuverability, on par with a Defiant. It is just as good as the Fleet Patrol.\n\nDon't say 'It's the low Shield Modifier' because like other retrofitted tier 2 ships, it has some sort of hidden bonuses to it."

For Mittens, and others of his ilk, it isn't space ships but their indirect ISK faucet from moon goo they are fretting about losing.\n\nAre we about to see sov null alliances involved in NPC null and low sec skirmishes (or even high sec wars!) because they are too afraid to fight on home turf against a meaningful opponent?\n\nIn a previous alliance we were firmly told not to fight in our own space. The view was that high kill stats on DOTLAN mark us as a target for roaming gangs which makes life difficult for our miners and ratters. We had just had a really good fight against Brick Squad and were told that's exactly the sort of thing we don't want to happen in our own space.\n\nIt was really depressing.\n\nIt's also why we see deployments used as conflict avoidance. FA have deployed to Great Wildlands, partly to help SOLAR as their propaganda triumphantly claims but more to run away from TEST black ops secure in the knowledge their structures won't be touched.\n\nIt's always best to burn the straw man in effigy, after all, this is internet spaceships. We wouldn't want to take it too far and cause/inspire real life harm over an online game, would we? Oh, wait . . .\n\nI bet the SRP for 800+ billion in ships really put a dent into this months RMT income.\n\nBorrowing a term used by your minions, you sound butt-hurt. Surely the head sociopath, who makes his living spinning deceit and mis-information, can handle a little criticism?\n\nBottom line, you clowns have converted null into a themepark, and the only \"content creation\" you can claim now is when mistakes are made.\n\nIf Soundwave made good on his apparent wishes to turn moon goo into an actively scanned/harvested product, then we would see some life in null. But we all know that is not happening. The tech must flow.\n\nEsp. since the ISK from tech moons is flowing into the hands of the RMTers. Even if these null sec clowns eventually get perma-banned, they have already made thousands of RL dollars - and, as we say, \"are crying all the way to the bank\".\n\nMittens compared a catastrophic loss in a spaceship battle, and the many checkpoints that should have prevented it, to those various disasters, not a spaceship battle in a general sense that a reasonable person, not pursuing their own specific agenda, would accept.\n\nA coalition that maintains a fleet doctrine that it expects to lose... welp fleet... isn't exactly solid in the \"spaceship battles are bad\" column.\n\nIn fairness Jester was talking specifically about sov-level fights; I'm not 100% on CFC doctrines but I believe the welpfleet is more about goodfights, roams etc than serious sov warfare?\n\nConsidering that the Asakai battle was by all accounts enjoyable for most of the participants and has sparked interest in EVE players who normally have nothing to do with this aspect of the game as well as gamers who have nothing to do with EVE, seeing Mittens basically refer to it as a perfect storm that shouldn't ever happen and going through all the safety procedures that exist to prevent is is pretty disheartening.\n\nI am not sure how you (or Jester) derived a \"sov level fights\" conclusion, since the whole \"spaceship battles are bad, m'kay\" retort was built up from a fight that not only had nothing to do with sov warfare, but which took place in low sec, so sov couldn't even enter into it. It was an attempt at a \"goodfight\" gone wrong. So straying into \"this is why sov sucks\" seems to be trip into completely unrelated territory.\n\nAnd, to attempt fairness from another perspective, Jester has specifically called me out, personally, for saying that I had fun in a fight that we lost and which was in heavy TiDi. Cognitive Dissonance was what he said it had to be. So bringing up \"but it was fun\" doesn't really put you on his side. Jester has declared such things to be unfun.\n\nAs for the fight itself, I missed going to it by mere minutes, but had a friend in it who sent me updates and screen shots as things went along. He reported that it was interesting and fun in the way that such big, TiDi bound battles can be, until the node got so overloaded that even TiDi wasn't helping and people started getting black screens and disconnects. That was, by all accounts, not fun.\n\nBut, the fun of individuals aside, at an alliance level it was still a loss, with a lot of cap ships lost for little return. That is what the safety procedures are supposed to prevent, as alliances that bleed cap losses at that sort of ratio repeatedly do not last long. And then where will the fun be? Spinning this as \"the doctrine prevents fun\" seems to willfully ignore reality.\n\nAnd, as a FYI, welp fleet is a throw-away fleet designed to kill super caps or die in the attempt. It is a super cap murdering doctrine, though any fight fight that kills a super cap is a goodfight I suppose, so that makes it a goodfight doctrine as well.\n\nYes, I noticed the same thing after I read the article. Mittani did not comment that fights like these are the lifeblood of EVE's new player attraction.\n\nAnd from what I read - the pilots involved had a blast - even if they lost. They were part of something epic, made EVE history, that is what this game is all about. The Mittani seems more comfortable piloting a website than a space ship.\n\nYeah, one of my account recently joined a nullsec alliance after spending a while in OR. I don't recall shooting at some many POS, Stations, SBU or TCU, What-have-Us in a long time. We get a lot of fights out of it but still. I'm so glad we're not actively trying to grind sov for sov's sake.\n\n\"Granted.\"\n\nAbsolutely. This is one of the *worst* game mechanics ever... in any MMO game.\n\nHell, even grinding down a single POS is nothing but tedious, and absolutely no fun. And, personally, I'd just like to see an end to reinforcement timers and force fields. The whole idea that your POS should be invulnerable until you can get around to defending it is absurd. If you don't have enough members in your corp/alliance to defend it 24/7, during a war, then you should either be forced to take it down or risk losing it.\n\nHe was comparing the mistakes that where made to those that would result in a reactor melt or an airplane crash, not the fact that there was a fight at all.\n\nThe large majority of sov alliances aren't pvp'ers. At least not in the sense you and I are. They have an empire and they have resources to defend or expand that empire. If those resources get committed to accomplish the wrong goal \"mistakes are made\".\n\nNow that is not to say they don't fight, don't have fights or don't roam or whatever. They obviously do. But they do so without using strategic resources. Resources that secure their empire. Their titans, their supers, their full arsenal. The loss of a few fleets worth of BC's or BS's can be replenished straight from Jita. Strategic resources not as fast.\n\nThat is what went wrong. Strategic resources where committed without a high-level of safety or success to accomplish a strategic goal.\n\nTo be honest, it's not even remotely related to sov. The.\n\nBecause if you eliminate the chance of losing, the only 2 outcomes are a stalemate or winning.\n\n\"The.\"\n\nNOT deploying those strategic resources is a deliberate and explicit goal. They have ships whose primary contribution to combat is to dissuade it, or at least dissuade it in places that might matter to them. It's a safe, strategic, and thoroughly boring strategy.\n\nBut rather in terms over the breakup of the railways or AT&T. Two rather large monolopies of null is zero benefit in a game intended to revolve around conflict and chaos. So when is CCP going to step in as government should, site anti-trust as the reason, then proceed to breakup the blue donut into red slices?\n\nShall we compare this to all of the noise on the eve-o forums concerned the lack of risk in hi-sec and the status-quo of wardecs. The argument touted is either the defenders in wardecs jump corp or decline to undock, sited as \"un-eve\" because it is avoiding non-consenual combat. But wait, the king of space has declared that when victory is not assured, do not engage. a prime example for us all to follow.\n\nand Mittens wall of text? I stopped reading after page one, all the spin was making me dizzy.\n\nBeing in the Goons is a major yawnfest these days. The leadership is too caught up in meta-gaming and isn't doing a whole lot to keep us PVPers busy and interested. My mates and I are probably going to be moving over to the Tuskers - at least, they are having more fun than we are.\n\n\"... the multitude of deployed squads who are getting great fights every day.\"\n\nlol... what a joke! Let's see... everyday, you log on, wait a couple of hours for some idiot to pull everyone together, and then log off when the whole thing is called off, for one reason or another. If you are very lucky, you'll get one great fight a month. In the meantime, you roll an RvB alt, like a lot of other Goons....\n\nHe's pointing out that Mittens' article compares the exact sort of gameplay that both CCP and much of the playerbase want to see to various kinds of real-world catastrophes. That's making an observation, not picking a side. It's not as if GSF is the only alliance in the game that's unwilling to field supers. Hell, they've rolled alliances that couldn't even get their supers to *log in*.\n\nHe's not saying that this is unreasonable behavior, either. In fact, if there's a problem with it, it's that it's eminently reasonable behavior"

      "text": "About Me\n\nMonday, October 22, 2012\n\nThe purge of idiots from icefields\n\nThe Goons are back with their friends, killing miners again in highsec. After it was made practically impossible by CCP. Why? Because many miners are dumb as the rocks they shoot. Look at these horrible loss reports: 1, 2, 3, 4. Zero tank. Nada. These poor things are already in the company of the MLU stacking arch-moron in the afterlife for ships piloted by braindead monkeys.\n\nLet me put it as simple as possible: if you are piloting something like these on the Gallente ice fields, you are a capital idiot. No, these aren't \"max yield\" fits, that would include a \"medium ice harvester accelerator\" rig:\n\nBut first let's see what a max-yield fit Mackinaw gets in the ice fields:\n\n762m3/minute. The cost is using up all the CPU from any decent tank. It still allows to put on an indecent tank but the failures messed that up too. 19K EHP just don't keep you alive if someone smarter than an Playstation FPS is after you.\n\nNow if we remember the Exhumer rebalancing, we can tell that CCP created a specific ship to the miners who don't want to die to gankers:\n\n693m3/minute. -9% yield, +250%. Can it be ganked? By 10 Catalysts, yes. If you are fast enough to overheat (78K EHP), 14. If you use shield repping drones on your other ships (mining drones can't take ice), even more. A ganking catalyst costs about 10M. So the price is 100-150M to kill your 99M-insurance Skiff and I did not include the opportunity cost of waiting out GCC because \"time is free lol\". You're welcome by CCP.\n\nNow that we agree that using a Mackinaw for ice mining during Goon Ice Campaign is dumb, let's move to the advanced stuff. What shall you do if your style is AFK mining? I mean target the ice, start laser, go AFK.\n\n[intense drumming]\n\nGet the hell out of the icefield idiot! Do you seriously expect to live during a griefing campaign in a PvP game while being AFK? Go and mine Scordite in a Mackinaw! Seriously! There is no way the Goons or anyone else can cover all highsec. You will always find a peaceful corner to AFK-mine something.\n\nSo you plan to keep mining ice during Ice Interdiction and ready to take it seriously? Do you have an Orca supported multi-miner gang? If no, just move to something else. Going trough the trouble for the income of only 2-3 mining accounts is silly. Go mine Scordite! If you have 6+ mining ships and an Orca and ready to reap the profits of the increased ice prices, you need to PLEX 1 more account. If you already have at least 7, +1 isn't that much.\n\nNo, not a Scimitar with 4 reppers. That ship has 30% less EHP than a Skiff and costs 40% more, they'll gank that after they failed first time. The extra ship is a link Tengu with Armored Warfare Link - Passive Defense I, Siege Warfare Link - Shield Harmonizing II and Siege Warfare Mindlink implant. This ship sits off-grid and boosts the gang for higher shield and armor HP and resists, rising the 66K EHP of the Skiff to 101K (121K overheated). Don't forget to fit buffer tank on it, it can be tanked up to 190K. It can sit on a remote location.\n\nThe Orca acts as squad booster (wing booster is the Tengu, always place the Tengu above the Orca). There is no need to boost ice harvester capacitor use as the Skiffs are stable at high capacitor. Have a shield transporter if the Skiffs are close, a tractor beam if far. If you can't buy a booster Tengu pilot fast, just fit the shield harmonizing link on the Orca and replace the mining Mindlink to Siege. Shield maintenance drones shall be deployed, Skiffs pre-locked to engage them fast. Orcas cannot be ganked by Catalysts. Goons claim that they can do coordinatedattacksonOrcas, but the linked ships aren't Orcas. They are \"abominations created during a session in the daycare for Down syndrome children\". This is how an ice field Orca shall look like:\n\nIf you overheat, you get to 370K EHP. Higher than of a Navy Apocalypse that can tank a whole Tengufleet.\n\nThe above makes ganking totally unfeasible. The gankers lose 2x more ISK then their targets and need an extremely organized fleet of dozens where the fail of one player can end up in a big waste of money, time and security status. But what if they keep coming back, just to show who is the boss? Give up 9% more yield and show them who is the boss!\n\nGanking miners without extreme effort is impossible. Anyone dying to ganks simply deserves to die by the law of Darwin.\n\nSome more news from nullsec. We took the station in GE-8JV, the former capital of the c-A-rebe-A-rs. The supercapitals took down its hull while the enemy were camped in their station:\n\nThey now live in an NPC station in Stain. We have a tower in this system with lot of juicy titans:\n\nThey also have a tower, but with only one titan and lot of our titans waiting for a spy to bump it out (but no spy was able to):\n\nFinally some laughs: Have you heard people whining that the enemy upshipped, ruining a good fight by bringing battlecruisers against T1 cruisers? Well, PL brought upshipping to a new level.\n\nSaturday morning report: 169.8Sunday morning report: 172.0Monday morning report: 173.4\nGoonswarm is not doing this campaign to make money blowing up miners, they are doing this to jack up the price of Gallente ice by eliminating the competition in high sec. Anything that drops from the high sec ice miners is gravy - the real money is to be made screwing the market. Looking at the sovereignty map, Goons have caldari ice, while Fatal Ascention, Executive Outcomes and Test have Gallente ice. I know I'm missing something, but I'm not sure what Goons get out of this.\n\nAll my mining barges (except one) are tanked as much as I can make them. The sole exception is one only used for mining missions, and that one has a microwarp and nanos, because quest asteroids don't last half a laser cycle, and getting from rock_a to rock_b is far more important.\n\nOn your skiff brick, I would probably have put a DCU instead of the second IHU. And probably a warp stabilizer or nano instead of the remaining IHU. And probably use EC-300 drones if others in the belt are using combat drones."

Thank you. .Seriously if kenzoku was so great why did you guys literally lay down and let your entire space holdings be destroyed, then magically think you are superior when AAA comes south?

It's not like you got locked out of your accounts or didn't have fleet commanders, or didn't have all your ships, ammo, and gear stationed in your systems.\n\nAs far as I can tell, you just didn't fight back effectively.

Given your vast tower majorities, given a ticking sov clock in your favor (with only three weeks until sov 3), you hedged against a straight-up loss by claiming the whole game was rigged, scooping up your toys and stomping on home to empire.

I hope that there's some Polish to the Game before F2P that adds more \"Remastering\" to Eposide missions to improve them.\n\n\"The developers found that players didn't really like paying for content\"\n\nI think you'll generally find players have no problem paying for good content. It's bad/lacking/no content they begrudge shelling out for.\n\n\"it's possible for players to hit the level cap and get the best gear inside of a single day\"\n\nThat's a bit of an exaggeration, isn't it? Surely. I'm two years in (off and on) and happily plodding along at Lt. Cmdr.\n\nIts not an exaggeration LOL. If you look at players who got so bored but loved star trek so much they stayed around for a long time and kept buying character slots there are a lot of accounts out there that have 10-50 VA/LG's. Is only difference between the factions is that the federation side's content is more from the end of commander to VA. Where as the KDF sides is more of from Lt to Captain. It's all about how you grind each faction out you can casually play a few hours a day and be a VA or LG within a week thats what they are talking about and when you hit that rank you pretty much have enough data samples to craft out the best gear in the game do 3 STF's and you got nothing to do on that character after that.\n\nEdit: [snip] I was corrected by another forum member and found I was incorrect in what Dstahl had previously said.\n\n2) \"The developers found that players didn't really like paying for content, so for Star Trek Online Cryptic is taking a very different approach.\"\n\nWith respect, this is an unfortuante conclusion to come to considering many developers successfuly sell DLC in addition to their games. The simple fact is, if it is worth the buy, they will buy the content. If it is not, they will not.\n\nI propose that we bury the term \"Content\" here once and for all and replace it with a new term that might be more clear: STORYLINE MISSIONS\nPlayers want missions. If it is worth it, they will buy even more missions, if not, they will not."

And I can't remember the last time I saw a Mk XII drop in an elite stfPlasma is mostly weak in PvP, where many people are still running the STF set shields, which have a 20% Plasma damage reduction. It's only slightly weaker in PvE due to the fact that its bonus is damage over time instead of a short, sharp burst of damage like disruptor breach or AP crits can deliver (meaning that it's not as good at immediately KOing an opponent but more for wearing it down over time). However, Romulan Plasma weapons have both the enviable [Acc]x2 modifier freely available as well as providing the Disruptor Breach proc along with the Plasma Fire proc, making them better than normal Plasma weaponsits useless in PvP due to everyone having shields that reduce the plasma damage and running HE to undo the DoT proc...but PvE is still really good for a cheap set of weapons.\n\nIts possible that with a ship like the vesta that has lots of tac slots and lots of sci slots you could combine the plasma romulan sci consoles to easily available purple tac consoles and negate the stf set reduction.\n\nDont think we can say anything till they get the complete romulan rep tiers working and get the placeholder items out or at least updated as far as sets go. At any rate it will definitely be a barnburner of a PvE set.\n\nAntiproton stuff is sorta hit in the head now if you dont have the borg pieces as the fleet advanced stuff isnt that great.

And I assume, that they all know well this classes , )\nIf the thread moves the community I will gladly involve my self to a discussion in deeper way, not just separate my opinion to advanced classes, to even for skills, gears, team play, solo play issues.\n\nIn my eyes\nranged combat in SWTOR means : when you see a character (opponent) in 10-30m range and you can interact with it, then the played class HAS the range ability. For me its no matter if the character shots space shuttle travels the seed of light, or handle a short knife by the game animation, if its within 4m, the ability is a melee one, if its has the ability to bypass 4 to 10 or 30 (35)by ignoring walkable terrain, then its a ranged.\nWe can say, that Shadow has 10m skills, but he can't bypass that 10m for his 4m skills and from this reason has absolutely zero advantage till he can't make distance from 10 (lets don't count a 2 minute cool-down skill with 2 shots - force potency) to have shelter, or can't bypass the distance to use his 4m tools (I don't count force speed, till it can be used just in walkable terrain - not range)\n\nGuy I quoted is right. Op, you have no clue. A Sorceror is not the same as an Assassin, much like how a Powertech isn't the same as a Mercenary. Those are the CLASSES, they define the players gameplay to go into a pack of Gold mobs and not be 1 shot by 1 of them and instead take a beating by 4 while their counterpart (I wouldn't even go that far to even call the other class a counterpart) hangs back and brings the heals.\n\nYou could have made sense with your post if you actually defined what Juggernauts and Marauders had in common (ie Vicious Slash, Charge, Smash) instead of confusingly stating GBTF and such.\n\nYou are not next to them and you are not in a huge mess of AOE, till they don't want you to be there, the question is, can you move your self out if they focused on you? (insta move out, changing place in a fast way - mobility, by keep your self alive with heals till you flee)) Can you handle the upcoming dmg by your defense? Can you resist the cc for mobility? So what tools classes have and what not.\nNow you will say, its more chaotic, like it was, but its not about animation, RP, fantasy (this time) no matter that your fantasy project something, like you are a close combat jedi knight or telekinetic ranged sage, but more about the tools.\nForget the background of the class this time and see the pure gaming tools, and if you have all this classes and you play a lot of pvp, pvp you will see what is my issue , )\n\nYou could have made sense with your post if you actually defined what Juggernauts and Marauders had in common (ie Vicious Slash, Charge, Smash) instead of confusingly stating GBTF and such.\n\n, ) but if I start a thread like that, it will be just a simple qq thread (the 1000. qq thread connected to this skills: )) And the goal in my eyes would be not the nerf of this skills, or any other skill, but the upgrade of the consular class (the upgrade of there tools not dmg outcome from an existing skill or a bit more AC - it won't handle anything, just would lead to unbalance and would open threads like \"Vicious Slash, Charge, Smash OP nerf them\" - it don't serves the game in my eyes...\n\nThe reason way I opened this issue in this chaotic way and not coming out with spec skills, ability, that it would be way to subjective and split by supporting my subjective view about that skill or not . But it would be more a lobby for your favorite class , ) So has no meaning. I'm more interested about the tools, what a class can use till game play, then the power of the existing spec skill.\nAnd ones more, we all know this classes, we all know how they work, what they can do with there tools and if some one not, then he should go and try them (its not a tutorial, ))"

      "text": "Context Navigation\n\nGameplay Description\n\nThis document describes what the experience is intended to be like playing Epiar v1.0.\n\nObjective\n\nTo be entertained through acquiring more powerful ships, finishing more difficult missions, exploring the galaxy, and possibly following mini-mission story arcs with endgames.\n\nThe Player\n\nThe player is a single ship which moves in all directions on the screen. The attributes of the ship (picture, speed, weaponry) are determined by the type of ship they own and can be upgraded through money. The player cannot play multiple ships at a time. It is unclear whether the player should have the ability to own multiple ships in that all but one would be 'parked' somewhere (this might be a bad idea). The player may, however, amass a fleet of ships to order around, either through purchase or conquest.\n\nEquipment\n\nThe player has a shield and hull to defend himself. The shield typically takes the hits, while the hull usually can only be shot a few times before the ship explodes. The shields are powered by a reactor, which also powers any non-ammo weaponry, the engines, and others. The player can buy an upgrade to control power distribution, e.g. more power to the shields. The shields are broken up into four segments, forward, back, left and right. If a player is on the run and being shot at from behind, the back shield may fail completely while the front and sides work fine, so a shield distribution upgrade should also be available.\n\nThe Galaxy\n\nThe galaxy is made up of planets, space stations and asteroids. There are no stars, and we may implement nebulae as hazy gas clouds. There are no black holes or other elements because of their radical effect on gameplay, though any good idea is open to discussion.\n\nMovement Through the Galaxy\n\nThere are many movement options: thrusters (regular moving), jump engines (only for very large ships), and jump gates (for small ships to travel great distances). Jump gates typically have fees, and one can book an entire network of travel, e.g. go from planet A to D, via B and C.\n\nPlanets\n\nOne of the primary pieces of the game is the planet network: players will land on planets (or space stations, which for all gameplay matters, are the same as planets) and have the following options: see a planet picture and summary (for the sake of experience), be able to outfit their ship (not on all planets, equipment varies with the planet), visit the shipyard to buy a new ship or sell theirs (again, varies), go to a bar, seek employment through the mission board, or buy and sell commodities.\n\nDistance Between Planets\n\nJump gate networks may take a day or two or three depending on the distance (let's say due to queues, e.g. you have to wait four hours before jumping at a gate: the player won't have to wait but the calendar date will pass), while jump engines are near instant (but require a lot of money and energy resources and a large ship), but the player may also manually travel between planets. Since Epiar is an open universe and the player may travel in any direction, we need to establish a reasonable distance. Very close planets might take about 30 seconds to travel between (this is practically the same solar system), while the average planet should be a few minutes away (we will have navigation on the HUD to help the player cross such vastness of space). Very, very far planets, on manual thrusters, shouldn't be more than 8 minutes away, as you're really testing somebody's patience (although auto-pilot is another idea for an upgrade).\n\nMaking Money\n\nThe primary form of experience in this game is not EXP or levels but money. The more money (or money converted into material things) you have, the longer you've been playing and the more likely it is that you are powerful. You can make money by trading commodities, taking missions, stealing it (via battle with other ships), gambling (on planets), or via mining (which will cause pirates to love to attack you and requires a mining vessel).\n\nDedication to (Somewhat) Real Science\n\nWe'd like to at least propose the idea of a game that respects science, even if it requires incredibly leaps in technology. As such, we would like very few or no alien races: most colonies or other empires should be humans. This is due to the nature of the universe: while other intelligent life is likely, it's likely incredibly far away and very foreign (watch Sagan's The Cosmos in its entirety before arguing any of this).\n\nWe'd also like to explain things whenever possible: jump engines or gates will be 'folding space', etc."

Jump Portal can be swapped for a heavy neut without changing anything else (hence the named DCU) if you just need to jump in and shoot stuff in the face:\n\nI've seen alot of Tach fits and that's what some of the guys in my Alliance use - when they are out lolGanking stuff.\n\nTach fits are a good counterpart to the blapping Panthers; the volley damage is about half, but the rate of fire is good enough that it's easy to get two shots while you're waiting for the cloak reactivation delay.\n\nBut yeah, in the end the exact fit really depends on what you want to do. Stenner covers the traditional fits pretty well, and Atticus is another good one for decisive one-sided ganking. When being a dedicated bridgebitch, besides the cloak and bridge in the highs I usually fit 2 armor RR, 2 hull RR and a nos. The nos is useless in combat, but it's a little bit more cap/s when you're waiting to jump again since cap boosters, while awesome for getting jumpcap quickly, take too much of your already tight cargo.\n\nedit: for cloaks, the best bang for your buck is the Dread Guristas. Since BOps don't have to wait to target after uncloaking, the only attributes that matter are the scan res penalty and velocity penalty. If I remember right, it was something like 'Guise' < DG/CN < Concord/officers. The Syndicate one isn't worth it, the penalties are much too big for the slightly faster reactivation.\n\nfor my own retarded reasons (I was thinking about distributing a handful of blops across 4.5ly of space, each fit with a covert cyno, so they just hang out cloaked until they find a target then pop the cyno and jump everyone in. Obviously this is a Bad Idea). This is what I came up with; it's tighter than a twelve-year-old but it fits the bill without being too pricey:\n\nThey have terrible raw HP to begin with, it seems like a waste trying to buffer fit it, especially with how terrible LSEs are on BS hulls. Buffer fitting it gets you, like, 16k ehp more, which is pretty bad. The booster outpaces that in about thirty seconds\n\nThis. I also use this fit, heavy neut included. The nano-deemer is fun, but it also limits your engagement potential as it will melt under focused fire.\n\nAnd if you plan to bridge often, look into either a Sin or a Panther. Panther has the most cargo space, with the Sin following closely behind. They're also both better on cap than the other races, making it good for reps.\n\n[B]I PAID 25 EUROS FOR A SIG AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS SHITTY TROLL ATTEMPT[/B]"

Goes up to 140 or so at closer range, which is perfectly acceptable against other frigates.\n\nPlease don't accuse people of EFT warrioring unless you understand the difference between ships fighting in optimal and fighting in falloff. i dont care that the incursus/taranis/thrasher/enyo/wolf does 250 dps, it has an optimal of about 1km and 3k-15k falloff - which means your doing no damage for 10 seconds while approaching a target (such as the retribution i have posted) meanwhile you are taking full damage. By the time you get in range, you already lost over a thousand EHP, which is a lot when you only have 4-8k to start off with.\n\nThen you have your 250dps versus his 140, but the retri also has 10k EHP which means you will still die before killing it. Also it has a rep so things are getting worse by the second.\n\nThe Rapid Light caracal is generally considered to be a 'frig shredder' which is correct - but its 'paper' dps is only 140. Lasers and Missiles always operate within their optimal range - that's why the DPS on EFT is so low... because in the REAL WORLD (e.g. online space ships) that DPS is very reliable and very constant, with no falloff to worry about.\n\nSo yea, 100-140 DPS in optimal is just as good as a ship who uses falloff and does 200dps.\n\nPlease don't make wild accusations of EFT warrioring when you yourself are using stats on a page to justify something. Fights don't happen under 1 set or circumstances, the circumstances change during the fight constantly, and the retribution can take advantage of that - which is exactly why my fit is about.That merlin would kite out of MF range, so swap to scorch - and scorch WILL track him - remember his MWD will be turned off.\n\nAnd btw when you said you didnt fly frigs, that was all you needed to say. I fly in RVB and frigates are the norm, it's widely accepted that the retribution is the best frigate in the game for its ability to do these things. Dual prop fits on frigate take up A LOT of fitting and as such either sacrifices EHP or DPS, which still leaves you with the advantage.\n\nThere is no dual prop, 8k EHP, 350 dps frigates out there.\n\nSpeed\nDPS\nEHP\nRange\nTackle\n\nBasically pick 2, and get 50% of a third. The retribution however gets EHP by default and about 80% of the range, That means you can plug 2 other holes and the range issue and end up with 4/5 instead of 2.5/5.\n\nThe vengeance is exactly the same except it NEVER gets range.\n\n----------P.s.\n\nThat fit only does 110 DPS and needs hyrbid rigging level 5 to even fit. The retribution would EAT that thing without even going into half armor.\n\nThat fit only does 110 DPS and needs hyrbid rigging level 5 to even fit. The retribution would EAT that thing without even going into half armor.\n\nOverheat its guns, load decent ammo for the range, and remember it's capable of 2.8km/s before heat, 4km/s with, with full tackle, so starting from 9km away it only has to burn out of your long point while you start at 40% of your base speed. How would you kill it? 3seconds before it's gone, and you could never keep up with it anyway. As for fitting, cheap implants, and/or downgrade the MSE.\n\nThe Enyo I was looking at was something like [Enyo, new? cheap MAPC]\n\nPseudoelectron Containment Field I\nMagnetic Field Stabilizer II\nMicro Auxiliary Power Core I\nSmall 'Accommodation' Vestment Reconstructer I\n\nFractionally faster, dps is 300 at 4+4 with Null, 374 at 1+3 with fAM, 416 at 2+1 with Void. Before cheap implants. The key point being I wouldn't expect the pilot to try chase you from the edge of your point range and thus never get into optimal but instead engage closer or warp off, and you can't chase him down becase of no real speed diff+no tackle, and that they'd turn back in your face and have you held in optimal in a second or two. Remember too your thermal hole.\n\nHow do you handle scram+web+rails Ishkur? Actually how do you handle any AF that can do >2km and has a scram? To keep them you must chase directly after, do so and can't they just drive-by scram and be off before you've turned & starting moving from 350m/s again?\n\nThis (your Retribution) is an AF, what other AFs can it keep & kill? Of course it'll take out some T1 frigsLost that slicer thanks to the remote sensor boosting on the cane. warp into bubble with another frig, instantly scrammed, dead. sucks :<\n\nAnd yea the fit isn't amazing at any one thing, but it does well at a lot of things. It makes it an excellent ship for unexpected encounters.\n\nAnd people REALLY need to grasp that this things has like 20km optimal. Rail gun fits just wont trouble it...\n\nP.S.\n\nDaneel, you have literally no EHP on that fit compared to a plated AF, which is where the retri would have its advantage.\n\nFrom some analysis my buddies in TeamLiquid did, it turns out that a Nanofiber > Overdrive UNLESS if you burn in a straight line for ~20 seconds, at least for a Rifter. Plus, considering how much of a Retri feels like when kiting, I would strongly recommend swapping Overdrive with Nanofiber. Also gives you more m3 for loot.\n\nSeems kinda silly to fly after experiencing my harpy, but it isn't bad, and I suppose it would shake things up if ppl are used to seeing a harpy raping stuff.\n\nSimilar dps (219@21km optimal, so ~8 more dps with heat), 5.2k EHP (.2 less than the harpy, but it's in armor so nonregenable..). It has more cap stability - 4m 19 as opposed to 2m 28 on the harpy; just prop, tackle, and guns running in heat. Aligns in 5.4, 2428 m/s pre heat, both marginally better than the harpy, but u lose the extremely sexy \"STOP RIGHT THERE\" that the dual webs of the harpy has.\n\nRetribution does have one tangible benefit tho - if/when something does manage to scram you and get close, you can instaswap to IN MF for 274 heated dps, or conflag for 306 heated dps. (conflag has 7km optimal, so works even if they try to semi kite u). This + your superior tracking (literally 3x + better) does help to slightly make up for your lack of dual webs, but I'd still rather have the better range the harpy is capable of + regenable buffer + dual webs.\n\nI may buy a few just to have a look-see at how effective they may be. An old m8 of mine from Raiden flies a similar setup (this setup was partially inspired by his) so it has been confirmed to work ingame.\n\nJust as a side comment, someone asked me about the whole heating/mod placement on my EFT fits - I prefer to be able to easily see whats ON a ship in my EFT fits. I fit mods according to heat placement in game. Placing them a certain way on EFT only makes it harder to see what's on the setup.\n\nMind you, when they change them to include ammo loaded & in cargo, along with restoring the rig fitting feature, we'll see if the format needs changing.\n\nI build my fit manually the first time, then save it ingame. I only import fits so others can easily click link to see fits.\n\n@Warmenhoven - True, but ur cap stability is generally fine as-is, tho it isn't a huge dps difference between the two. (Also I seem to have derped, u have 7m 17s of cap, not sure how I got the lower cap amount). I just auto fit burst to all my fits :P"

      "text": "Main menu\n\nSearch form\n\nTitle\n\nThis Sunday at 21:00 UTC, the CSM held an open town hall Q&A on the Eve University Mumble server. The CSM has returned from their recent Iceland summit, and discussed the upcoming expansion, CCP's future plans, and other players concerns. Eve Radio has recorded the Townhall, and the meeting has been transcribed below.\n\nCCP has increased UI customizations recently; will there be possibilities to customize or mod the EVE UI like other MMO's?\n\nTrebor: CCP is hesitant to allow the UI to be 3rd party customizable, as there is a lot of legacy code that is difficult to work with. Secondly, CCP is afraid players would create powerful mods that would imbalance the game. I don't agree with latter cause, but with the resources CCP has, cleaning up and securing the UI code for 3rd party modification may not be best use of resources.\n\nSeleene: Also CCP is really anal about the way their game looks and feels; they want the game to look a certain way whenever it is presented to the media. It's very unlikely that CCP would allow people to change the way the game looks to any significant degree. While there are code issues, I have not seen CCP put significant efforts towards making the UI modular.\n\nHans: That being said, CCP is working to improve the UI and add their own customization and information display, but they will all be first party as opposed to opening up UI development.\n\nRegarding the CSM election reform proposal, is it going forward the way that Trebor proposed, or some other way is being implemented?\n\nTrebor: We don't know for certain, it depends on CCP Xhagen.\n\nRegarding out of game Communications, are there any plans to allow EVE Voice to work during a client crash? Some players do not have the resources to rent their own voice servers, and a native voice client should be superior for authorization purposes.\n\nTwo Step: You can already use EVE voice out of client through EVE gate, but Eve Voice sucks.\n\nSeleene: CCP is talking about this, but as Players already have good 3rd party voice clients, they don't feel it's the best use of developer resources.\n\nWhat is the CSM's feeling on DUST representatives being elected to the CSM?\n\nTwo Step: There is no CSM consensus; the concern is while DUST is connected to EVE, it is another game, and the CSM mainly deals with EVE. A DUST rep has to be relevant during the 99% of the time when the CSM is talking about EVE; he has to be useful during that time. A DUST rep has to be able to deal actively with EVE, it's more likely there will be EVE CSMs that play DUST, or a separate DUST council.\n\nAre there plans to improve the drone UI, such as a \"deploy drones\" hotkey?\n\nTwo Step: That was on the CSM minutes last summer, but we don't know what happened to it; we thought about having drones being controlled like a module that you can drag onto the taskbar.\n\nHans: CCP likes to do mockups of little things they would like to do while working on the main project, and they'll look at the plausibility and ease of implementation before committing. Mockups of Drone UI exist, but so far no implementation is planned.\n\nHow is the stakeholder project working out? Are you guys having an effect on the summer expansion? As CCP Seagull basically said \"sorry but no\" to the POS revamp, what's happening now?\n\nSeleene: Stakeholder is working much better, part of that was CCP changing how they will be doing their development process, part of that was changing the way expansions are planned. Since then, we've see an increase to information flow, we've been asked to go to meetings and presentations. We are shown what's happening from day one of development - we asked for this last time and didn't get it. We will document as much as possible to help CSM8 to carry the torch.\n\nTwo Step: I was not expecting a \"oh we'll start doing POSes\", it's not realistic to expect that the thread will coerce CCP into anything. While we do have a lot of access, the point of the thread was to let CCP know how important POSes are, that they are not only used by \"a minority of players\". What is important to me is that some fixes are implemented in the summer, and work on modular POS is started ASAP, and that the thoughts and concerns of the community have an effect on the eventual outcome.\n\nHans: There is certainly a lot of room for small fixes in the summer expansion. CCP has not definitely said no to taking POS off the table for summer.\n\nIssler: I think the stakeholder thing has advanced dramatically, CCP has changed their approach to the planning of the future of EVE. The one good thing about the POS threadnaught was that it was a good example of the way the CSM and playerbase can influence the development of EVE.\n\nSeleene: The CSM has gone under a lot of changes from 5 to where we are now, and a lot of people have their own ideas about what the CSM does. If you are running for the CSM, it's important to know that the CSM is much more involved now, not just a couple chats and a trip to Iceland. Communication is weekly and the \"free trip to Iceland\" meme is out of the window. If you plan to vote for a CSM, know the impact they will have on the game.\n\nIs there any plan to use the certificate program being used improve the newbie learning experience?\n\nSeleene: I was the last person to touch certificates, that was years ago. At the time it would have branched off into an achievement-like feature. Since then, I can't recall certificates being discussed at all.\n\nKelduum: Absolutely nothing about certificates has been discussed at our CSM.\n\nDoes CCP have anything new for the NPE (New Player Experience), the career funnel missions?\n\nTrebor: CCP recognizes that improving the NPE is one of the best returns on investment; every newbie that subs to the game is a huge win. The exact changes are in planning, and we don't have concrete information yet. You will definitely see improvements to the NPE in 2013.\n\nWould you consider it a failure on CCP's part if nothing about nullsec is being revamped in 2013? Null economy, industry, and Sov mechanics are all very problematic.\n\nElise: CCP is not avoiding nullsec, it just wasn't on their schedule. You can see this on the meeting on the CSM minutes. CCP kind of knew what was wrong with nullsec, and has ideas to fix the largest points of contention. I can assume that many issues will be resolved in 2013. CCP is not clueless about Null issues, including industry and objectives for small gangs.\n\nTwo Step: The first couple of nullsec meetings I had with CCP were like \"yea yea we'll talk about it but no commitments\". I felt a lot better after coming out of the second meeting; that CCP has reasonable approaches about nullsec. CCP has revamped FW by applying fixes and observing, this same approach can be used to fix Null.\n\nTrebor: An encouraging sign is the new development strategy rolling out. What will not happen is CCP devoting an entire expansion to a feature and never coming back. Every feature will be tweaked, observed, and iterated on in subsequent patches and expansions. Nullsec will not be fixed in a day; changes will be incremental in doable chunks that control the impact to other aspects of the game so you don't break something else in the process of fixing one thing.\n\nYou guys seem to have a consensus on SOV being based on use?\n\nElise: I believe that if you have an empire, it should not be just 'pay isk have space'. You should have to harvest and work and live in your space for you to own the space. There are many ways of doing this, but the CSM cannot actually implement anything, but we can tell CCP what would be a good idea and guide them on the right path - but telling CCP \"This is the one true way to fix null\" is not something we do.\n\nSeleene: There should be some level of activity that is needed to hold sov. Sov right now is a room with just a floor, no walls no furniture. You should live in your space to hold it.\n\nTwo Step: My view is that sov is part of the reason that 0.0 has not been touched for a while. \"lets fix null by fixing sov\" is not the right approach. The approach I have believe would be to address \"why do we want sov?\" before fixing sov mechanics.\n\nWith the Battlecruiser skill changes and the added armor tanking skills, there seems to be more skills that a newbie needs to train to become combat effective. Is there anything to address the issue of high SP barrier before newbies can be effective in PVP?\n\nTwo Step: I don't like how they are widening the skill point difference, and CCP adding lots of 'have to train' skills, like the sensor comp skills. While the game needs new skills, CCP should add new skills for new things instead of adding skills for existing things.\n\nElise: You are right that you need more skills to fly a ship, but the amount of SP needed to fly a combat effective ship has been greatly reduced. It used to be that if I wanted to fly logistics on a roam, I would have to train logistics V and other tech 2 skills. Tech 1 ships are very combat effective and can be used in serious fights without having to use extra skills. Before, you fly a Rifter, and then you fly a Drake, and keep flying a Drake for the next year. Now you can fly a variety of ships and still be effective, logi, ewar, you name it.\n\nIs there any plan to make PVE more engaging?\n\nHans: There are big plans for EVE PVE, CCP has a sense of where they want to take it. CCP is aware that EVE PVE sucks compared to everything else, there have been things done like bringing in sleeper AI, but that's a Band-Aid.\n\nTwo Step: PVE is a lot like other MMOs, but EVE is not like other MMOs where you run raids with a dozen friends weeks on end. I know some people play EVE as a PVE game but EVE is just not a very good PVE game.\n\nDo you guys feel the Corp role system is something that is holding down POS revamps?\n\nKelduum: Yes, corp roles are a mess, yes they will be sorted out.\n\nTwo Step: The way the corp roles are coded is a mess. There are ways to fix POS that don't involve corp roles, but corp roles don't help the mess in the slightest.\n\nSeleene: The corp code is based on bitmaps, and running out is a limitation. It's very old code, and it's an absolute mess.\n\nWhat is CCP's views on Miner bumping/ganking/harassment?\n\nIssler: Some say it's working as planned, mining is not meant to be a \"fall asleep and mine\" thing. We've put up with wars and bumping. We don't like it, but it's the price you pay to mine. It's great that barges have been buffed. The change in crimewatch makes it easier for miners to retaliate, and don't pay the bumping bastards. If war decced, fight back. We don't like war, but some members like the change.\n\nHans: The general feeling about James 315's shenanigans is that it's emergent gameplay, but if someone is picking you the player out and following you from system to system that's harassment. But if miners are not doing anything active like counter war-decs, dodging bumpers, and hopping systems, CCP is not going to intervene.\n\nIs there a possibility of changing active skill training from outside of the game client?\n\nSeleene: CCP used to like that you have to log in to EVE to change skills, but they've seen the progress of mobile devices and decided to go along with history. The Crest API should allow much more powerful interaction from out of game, such as skill training and market orders.\n\nLast Fanfest there was a tech demo that showed off tessellation in EVE, when is that happening?\n\nTrebor: There's no way we can influence that, that's all depending on CCP's art team.\n\nSeleene: Tessellation is cool but hard, it's not 'turn on a switch and look pretty'. I would not recommend CCP spend resources on that when there are much more pressing matters to attend to.\n\nIt's clear from CCP's methods that they use SCRUM internally, has it been serving the CSM well?\n\nTwo Step: EVE tends to attract technical people, Trebor used to write code with rocks and sticks. CCP uses SCRUM differently from others, it's part of the learning curve. IF you are running for CSM, I recommend you learn what SCRUM is.\n\nIssler: I used to be a software programmer, CCP seems to have adaptive AGILE pretty well to their product. There's not an awful lot of time to sit around and plan, success depends on reacting quickly to situations and feedback. A Software engineering background is very useful to being on the CSM.\n\nEarlier there was discussion of changing SP training from outside of the game, is there any plan to extend or abolish the 24 hour training limit?\n\nTwo Step: We haven't really talked about that, CCP has been traditionally resistant to allowing external modification of skill queues.\n\nHans: The idea of having gimmicky things like having people log to train skills is bad. If someone is only logging in to train skills, then you have already lost their interest, you have already failed to provide them with entertainment. Don't force people to log in if they don't want to, make them want to log in and PLAY the game. This is applicable to DUST as well, as Active skill points in Dust complicates the matter further.\n\nIs there any talk of changing moongoo production and tech 2 material bottlenecks?\n\nElise: What we have talked about is changing how you acquire material and move away from trickle down production. Harvesting should be done IN space, which populates space and creates content and interaction; almost all income should come from bottom up to increase member involvement. CCP does think space should not be equal, as good space should form a conflict driver, so a gradient of system quality should exist.\n\nSeleene: We've had discussions with CCP about all this, and we should be informed quite soon. The worst possible thing is CCP working on something for 4 months in secret, and then yelling surprise and putting it on the server. CCP not vetting stuff through the community and CSM causes broken monuments.\n\nRegarding the CREST API, it seems CCP is not giving a lot of guarantees of security for third party applications. Will we there be a standard for API security when using third party apps?\n\nSeleene: No, the whole idea of CREST is to give a set of tool to developers so CCP has more time to do their stuff. Access restrictions will be clear, but there be good apps and bad apps, players decide what they will use.\n\nIssler: When you download a CREST, there should be clear restriction and indications of what that specific app has access to. It should not be possible for say, a jump planner app to have access to your wallet. IF you download an app that openly says \"this app can modify your wallet\" and you use it, and your wallet gets emptied, that's your fault.\n\nTrebor: It should be fairly similar to Facebook apps, where when you install one, the app tells you it is allowed to check friend lists and post on your wall. The capabilities of an app should be absolutely transparent.\n\nBecause CCP has been fluffing up stuff for new players, what are they planning to do for 100mil sp players?\n\nSeleene: I would love to tell you that CCP have a concrete plan for veteran players, but they don't. But the best way to do so is fixing the broken stuff in the game so we have fun when we log in and play.\n\nDUST question: When the economy merges, how will they make it so EVE does not hold us ransom? 10 mil is a lot for us, but chump change for EVE.\n\nHans: We have no idea right now, economies are very complex and probably one of the last things to be connected. There needs to be reasons for cooperation, but a massive wealth disparity between EVE and Dust is not healthy for either game.\n\nHas there been any talk of updating the wardec mechanics? Is there anything planned to let defenders to inflict damage on the attackers or end hostilities?\n\nKelduum: I will say that I have been talking to CCP, and the CSM thinks the wardec system is messed up.\n\nTwo Step: We had an argument; I feel that attackers risk too little and defenders risk a lot, I would like to see consequences for failed wardecs and more reward for successful wars. If Alekseyev was here, he would have a lot to talk about it. There is a wide range of allowed aggression that people believe should be possible in EVE.\n\nSeleene: The CSM has some differences regarding this question. CCP likes and promotes how EVE has a lot of freedom and allows you to do anything to anyone, to be the ultimate asshole or ultimate hero. Finding the right balance can be hard.\n\nIssler: Wars have to have conditions for both sides, with clear goals. If you dec and lose, there should be repercussions. If you defend and win, there should be rewards.\n\nDoes CCP have any plans of going over certain PI products? Some items like hydrogen batteries are still NPC seeded. And the resource requirements for various components can be unbalanced.\n\nTrebor: There are some parts of PI that can be frustrating, such as reconfiguring large amounts of processors. The less NPC item seeding the better, and PI is a good way to provide for replacements to seeding. CCP Unifex has stated that PI was something that would be a good example of moving [gameplay] out of the EVE client, such as onto tablets.\n\nSeleene: PI has been somewhat insular since inception. I would like DUST to greatly affect PI. But mostly I want to bombard the hell out of people's PI from space.\n\nHans: PI needs to have better integration with the economy. PI needs to provide key components before it can become important enough for DUST mercs and EVE players to bother fighting over it. While POCO shooting is a nice conflict driver, there is much more that can be done to increase the amount of combat PI can cause.\n\nIs CCP planning to do more iteration to drone warfare? Currently it seems like sentry drones are the only drone that have major impact.\n\nElise: With the current EVE environment, drones are a very effective weapon in PVP, with ECM, sentry, and neut drones all being quite effective. For small-scale combat, sentries are not very good, but I would like more ships being able to be effective droneboats. To be honest, there are things more pressing and broken than drones that need to be fixed first.\n\nHow does CCP intend to balance Nullsec and Highsec?\n\nElise: Null and high should have distinct roles, and have lots of interaction. But we should not have to import all our Tritanium from high, and high should not be absolutely reliant on null for some things. Overall null should be better, but there should be things that high sec can do very well.\n\nTwo Step: Right now the balance between null and high is whacked. Nullsec is supposed to be this high-risk, high-reward place, but right now there is not a lot more risk and not a lot more reward. There's a lot of risk in taking territory in null, but not a lot of risk once that's done, things like ratting and moon production are all relatively safe.\n\nSeleene: Nullsec is great as it allows players to have control over their environment, and as such, null has more inherent problems. Null has been broken for a long time, and there have been many failed attempts to fix it, but players should not have a terrible time just living there. Right now highsec is working, and null is not.\n\nIssler: Risk reward is broken, it seems like null can be extremely safe, and the passive rewards are not proportionate to the risks. The difficult part was null logistics.\n\nT2 BPOs seem to be broken, is CCP planning to address this issue?\n\nTwo Step: As a T2 BPO owner; I don't think they should be removed. I didn't get my T2 BPOs from lottery. They are not as broken as people think. It's nice that T2 BPOs form a kind of end game goal for industrialists. Although Seleene having lots of T2 BPOs is not related to him being a former dev.\n\nIssler: I was back there in the lottery but never got one, my corp makes money from T2 production, but I don't worry about people with T2 BPOs. You can make money without them; the volume from T2 BPOs reduces their impact on the market.\n\nAny plans to improve other API? Along with plans to improve the in-game browser.\n\nTwo Step: The existing API is not something CCP wants to deal with; after CREST is done, people should have more information to work with from API. As for the IGB, it would be nice for it to have more functionalities, but we shouldn't expect anything soon.\n\nAny further changes regarding Titans?\n\nElise: Whenever we speak about supers, the response from CCP is \"we'll deal with supers when we are done with this\". I think the Titan nerf was overdone. With the amount of ISK damage, converted to plex, we would have wrecked a BMW. Fozzie and Grayscale thinks that supers should have some role, they should have uses in some way, they've been changing subcaps at a breakneck pace, you should expect Supercap changes SoonTM\n\nSeleene: The reason that CCP is dragging super rebalancing is that CCP has a lot of other things to do that gives immediate impact to the game - everyone in EVE flies subcaps. Supercaps are a big deal, not just to the people flying them. Number tweaking will not suffice; CCP will have to put a more thought into it, which is why they are putting it off.\n\nIt seems that CCP is introducing Learning Skills 2.0, with more mandatory skills like sensor comp skills instead of just nerfing ECM. Why are some modules such as armor plates getting skills, and others like ASBs are not?\n\nTwo Step: CCP should not be adding skill for the sake of adding skills; new skills should mean new interesting things you can do. I don't like how people have to train through sensor comps just to be able to fight. But people need stuff to train; I'm training stuff for fun at this point.\n\nElise: I'm ok with the new skills because they are not necessary skills, but skills like armor comp lets you specialize without wasting too much time on them. I like the idea of being a better pilot in a certain ship because you put a bit more time in it. Although the ranks for some of the new skills could be lower.\n\nHow has the actual running platforms for the CSM7 election affected what you guys actually do/what has been accomplished?\n\nTwo Step: I ran on a POS platform and made a big fuss about it, and some things are being done. Some people ran for CSM with grandiose \"how to fix everything\" ideas. The most important skill for being on the CSM is being able work with other people, being able to communicate and provide appropriate feedback, rebuking CCP to hard might cause them to ignore the CSM altogether. The point of the CSM is not to play junior game designer, but rather looking at specific points.\n\nSeleene: I ran on getting the CSM more power and responsibility. If the CSM has no power, no influence, then it becomes irrelevant. I tried to define a role for the CSM, getting it more involved, and getting the stakeholder project running. I think CSM8 will probably be the most empowered CSM that will take office.\n\nTrebor: anyone who runs on a specific platform of \"I'm gonna do this\" is being a bit naïve. The best use of a platform is giving voters an idea of how they think, how they work, their sense of professionalism, and how well they would handle responsibility. The arguments that hold the greatest sway with CCP are the ones where you can make a good business case that the action will create/retain more subscribers over another. Crafting a good argument is key.\n\nSix out the eight of you here are not running for CSM8. Why not? And for the two that have not stated intentions (Trebor and Greene), are you running?\n\nTwo Step: One of the reasons I'm not running is that it's taking a lot of time, and I miss playing Eve. I live in the US where vacations are less frequent, 2 Summits and Fanfest means I have no vacation time for anything else. If not for that, I would probably run again. Putting a lot of time into the CSM burns you out; some people just need a break. Perhaps I'll run again later\n\nHans: I have personal reasons regarding marriage and continued education. I planned to come in for only one year, and this played out how I expected. CSM is exhausting and rewarding; I'm looking forward to playing the game rather than just talking about it. In the past some CSM members get frustrated with the CSM and CCP when they finish their terms and they'll walk away from the game. This time, most of us are just leaving the CSM but staying in EVE.\n\nSeleene: It's a time issue. I've been to Iceland a lot. I just started a new job a few months ago, and the amount of time you have to put into the meetings and reviews and feedback is exhausting. It's a young man's game. We've gotten a lot done, and I'll leave happy that we left CSM 8 a very solid foundation to keep working. Anyone that can stay on CSM for more than a few terms is probably not right in the head, or has a lot of time.\n\nTrebor: I have no final decision, I'll decide when white paper edits are released and when I see who else is running.\n\nGreene Lee: it's a very complicated situation, there are lots of really good things about the CSM, but real life calls. I'll make a decision next week.\n\nIssler: I think the CSM is in a very good position now. I've done all I can do and would like to get back to play the game. CSM is a lot of work; it's not a free trip to Iceland. Don't run if you can't commit your time.\n\nElise: I was really passionate when I first ran. It's not like that I'm burnt out, I can do this again. But I want someone else to take up the reins of the CSM, and get that experience, and do their part. One of the reasons CSM6 was so successful was that it was full of fresh blood, and fresh ideas. If I ran again, I would be denying someone else that experience. Despite rumors, I don't plan to work for CCP, as my game design ideas are crap.\n\nKelduum: I want to actually play the game, working with E-uni and not just the CSM.\n\nCCP requires people to place their IRL identity to run for CSM. Is that preventing a lot of quality candidates from running?\n\nTwo Step: I agree that putting your real identity on is not a good thing, but it's not our decision, its CCP's.\n\nSeleene: This has come up in every summit, CCP' answer has always been yes, you need your real identity.\n\nAngry Mustache\n\nAngry Mustache is a novice EVE player who is very often reminded of his poor decision to start his name with the Letter A. He also regrets wasting all three remaps within the first month. Extremely proficient at losing ratting Tengus."

One (1) metric ton of dessicated coconut. Forty-six of those funny nasal strips that stop you snoring.\n\nOriginally by:Ben AlmanI'm not exactly sure what you want. But I will hijack this thread to demand celestial objects actually moving on orbits around the sun, planet, moon etc.\n\nI will one up your hijack with a demand for a fix for the additional lag that sending constant positional updates for every single object in the solar system, down to the last asteroid, will cause in a 750 vs 750 fleet fight, as well as the one for rendering bookmarks useless. Also a fix for runon sentencesThey could probably manage to update things like POSs and outposts too, but i'd be concerned with 'drift' caused by little errors adding up (imagine your POS mods slowly flying apart as the tower orbits) and how to handle players.\n\nI mean, if you recalculate positions when the server is up players would either have to move with objects or be left behind as everything updates. If you do it during downtime, you have to recalculate the position of players logged off in space to the relative position of whatever they were closest to with great accuracy. The last thing you want is someone logged off landing 30km outside a POS bubble because of some rounding error in the orbit calculation\n\nedit: and the really big question is, 'why bother?' How exactly is eve enriched by adding in an orbital mechanics simulation? Sure, it adds :awesome:, but it costs tons of dev time and doesn't really add gameplay in the slightest\n\nThe planets do rotate and some of them have great graphics. You can create a station in null sec. I am also certain that the planets do rotate around the sun. However I don't want to sit in one spot for a year to find out. You might consider watching the videos about the creation of EVE. It is based on another game that was good in its day. The game was called Elite 2.\n\nOriginally by:Jane Griffincelestial orbits are secondary to, TAKE PLANETS OUT OF WARP PATHS, lol.\n\nJust rationalise routes between stations and gates, even if you did end up going through a planet every now and then its not too bad, right now its just far too common imo.\n\nI've got an idea that might solve this issue:\n\nIncorporate magnetic catapults into stations that launch exiting ships above the system plane, from where you can then warp to wherever. (certain Minmatar stations would not even have to be modified... ) With proper orbital mechanics this would instead launch the ships to a lagrange-point. (which would be secured by turrets in empire)\n\nplayer designed space stations.the CCP designed ones lack imagination.why is there only one kind of wheel space station in the game.why not a space station complex with orbiting space docks and varoius types of ships inthem.be able to take a shuttle trip thru the complex and get a close up look at the ships and the construction activity on going with them.this would be a lot more better than INCARNA/DUST 514/Walking On Station.where is the imagination when it comes to EVE.we can orbit stations but cannot orbit planets and moons.r ecall a station in eve about four years ago that had a very visual active docking bay with led type ad signs and other type active traffic happening in it.is that type of EVE visual forever gone.I can envision a EVE AND ALL THE WONDERS IT WOULD BE...."

For example is it commander level, fleet size, research tech? from discussions with the ORION players, they don't consider it to be warfare.. but what is it? IN YOUR OPINION?"

The only import, at least at this point of Owen's Planet is that something happened there, and that our guy may or may not have been there (I'll allow that I haven't decided yet).

FlashTom is correct, but damn near incoherent due to all the solecism.\n\nYou need to consider several factors when PvP'ing: Hull Research, Hull verses hull, Commander, Weapon research, and gem casting / bionic chips. Maxing out your weapon of choice and your shield tech will increase attack and allow to attack multiple targets per strike. Your hull may cause you to take an automatic 5% increased damage taken; for example, a frigate verses a cruiser—automatically the cruiser adds 5% damage against a frig, and also the frig takes 5% increased damage against cruiser. Not to mention if your commander is a C rank in your hull which takes 10% more damage.\n\nWhich brings me to the next factor, commanders. You do not really want to use less than a B rank in your weapon and hull. S rank is the best, but be happy with an A if you are free-to-play. Before you level your commanders, make sure to hover your mouse over their attributes to learn the growth rate of each stat. When dealing with named commanders, certain attributes will increase their chance to proc their skill. Simply use a reset card to reset the growth rate. Keep in mind if your commander is above level 1 it will reset back to level 1. Ideally you want over 4.0 growth rate on your proc skill. (As far as I know, it only goes as high as 5.0)\n\nObviously you need to increase your hull and weapon research to give yourself a more powerful ship design. Do not mix your fleets with different weapons unless you know how to layer them properly. I'm not going to explain the importance of casting your gems and chips because it should be obvious. That and I'm tired of typing, quite frankly.\n\nInstead of putting this stuff in the game, how about fixing what is broken and actually improving the experience in total, not putting a single commander for paying people and claim it to be a big release? Prioritize guys…\n\nPretty much what James said. Officially they aren't allowed. In reality IGG won't do anything since the majority of alt players pay cash. Do they massively imbalance the game? Absolutely. Would it be fairer if they were genuinely disallowed/shutdown? Yes. Is it going to happen? No. Alts have become so ingrained into the ethos of the game that quality players who otherwise stick to the rules and are respected by the community simply don't see them as 'cheating'. It's that kind of 'everyone does it so it's okay' attitude that most people have to downloading music illegally etc.\n\nGiven that, your options are – join them and make one yourself to try and keep up; just keep playing and accept some people will have massively more resources than you purely for this reason; find them and farm them (with probable retaliation from their main account); keep giving IGG a hard time on the very small off-chance they do something about it.\n\nactualy its bad if somone gets evriting w/alts instead of buying resources and stuf from IGG for real cash.\n\nYes but going after alts is a time/money investment for IGG… with marginal utility of…?\n\nI crud up this game's forums precisely because this is the worst of a series of farm-to-farm wait-to-play games that have been on Kong. Caesary was indeed much better directed towards at least a game-like purpose in playing it, but like you say, just because it was a ripoff of Senatry, I think it was. I forget. It was actually a less polished game that Caesary then improved on, but problem was, the guy behind Caesary was a former employee of the original game and just ripped it off piecemeal.\n\nLord of Ages is a little more decent but the problem there too is that it's easy to forget what you're farming anything for (more farming).\n\nAs for what Fortunate may have wanted me to say: this game is run by Google Translate and people who don't understand gameplay design and instead just wanted to draw spaceships and charge people money for as corny items as they can get away with, like \"Legendary Robert\" or \"Galactic Gumballs.\" As a result this game is populated by gamers with extremely low standards who are quite entertaining to watch.\n\nnot really not really not really born do you know what the point was i dont see currency games get it change to smaller amounts often on kongregate also people wont like having to spend more\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\ni hate the world but the world loves me\n\nYup. Point still missed…\n\nHint: They will cost more in a market sense because the value of MP by any market definition has to be the value set by the greatest value pack, which will not be the smaller amounts. So, they are almost surely going to \"end up costing you more anyway,\" especially since paying players very rarely end up not making more than one purchase. To think that Fortunate was talking about the actual price in this context is missing the point in pretty much the most inane way possible.\n\nCongrats on needing it spelled out.

      "text": "Contest: Homeworld Plotholes (v0.2)\n\nThe previous thread being both moribund and very, very long, it's probably time to start afresh.\n\nSo, to open the batting, here's one from the second mission in Cataclysm. The Kuun-Lan's commanding officer mentions 'a dual signal on the emergency channel' that turns out to be from a drifting disaster beacon. Now, I can just about believe that it could stay mostly functional for a million years straight -with radio-electric decay by something with an extremely long half-life for a power source and really good workmanship it's just about possible- but doesn't it strike you as slightly unlikely that the Galactic Council has retained the same Interstellar Distress Frequency since before most of its current members left the oceans?\n\nGalactic council? Wasn't the Naggarok from outside the galaxy? And launched way before the galactic council was even formed? But the point still stands that they have the exact same emergency channel as the naggaroks creators. Maybe the beast organism infecting the probe was \"listening to the electromagnetic chatter of your tiny self/worlds.\" and configured it to send out signals on that frequency to get someone to come and pick it up.\n\nThat's a point actually; what did happen to the Naggarok's crew in the end? If they had time to trash the engines and radio transmitter badly enough that the Beast couldn't fix them without outside assistance, they could certainly have run like buggery for the lifeboats.\n\nMaybe, but I can't help wondering whether some of them got off the ship in time, and what happened to them if they did.\n\nI'm pretty sure they made a point not to leave as not to completely ruin the point of stranding the infection in space in case any got on the escape ship too.\n\nAlso, if the beast DID infect them it'd know how to jury rig a solution to repair its drives.\n\nIt can know how, but with no way of building or repairing and I assume no resources since those launch tubes looked like they worked but they never built anything (and presumably all the mutations and warping of the Beast Mothership's hull didn't come out of thin air) those parts it's out of luck until something comes along and repairs it for them.\n\nI'll be of little help *gasp shock horror* since this is Cataclysm territory and I never made it past the 'sneak through the dust clouds next to the Imperialist base' mission (and I don't have a working disc), so...\n\nI know that when the crew of the Naggarock disabled the engines, the hsip automatically jettisoned a distress beacon pod. Does it say in-game that the Naggarock even has escape pods? If not, to avoid infection they could have just killed themselves by opening an airlock into space.\n\nIs there any mention of escape pods on any ships in the Homeworld universe? Also, what's to say they didn't jettison any of these supposed pods around the same time they disabled the engine and ruined the com-arrays?\n\nSpace is also BIG. I don't know how large the Naggarock is in comparison to any of the other Homeworld ships, but the likelihood of someone picking up a Beast infected escape capsule that isn't functioning or transmitting a signal after a million years of stellar drift is impossibly low. Especially in a planetary system where the gravitational pull of planets could send the said pods into the crushing depths of a gas giant.\n\nI think it'd be a good idea to copy the first post of the old thread (along with the links) so that we wouldn't go through resolved things all over again. A moderator could 'Edit' it and copy it, so that you wouldn't have to relink everything, right?\n\n\"The Beast Cruise Missile was first seen in Seera Tel system, when a Kiith Manaan frigate squadron sent a frantic message that it was under attack by unknown drone craft. When no further word was received, Manaan Fleet Command sent in a full Carrier group to investigate, but initially all that was found was the wreckage of one Assault Frigate; the remaining four Ion Beam Frigates were nowhere to be found.\n\nEventually a lone escape pod was found with one alive-but-nearly-insane Manaani bridge officer aboard. When an psi-tech was finally able to piece her psyche back together again, the mystery was finally solved.\n\nIt seems that soon after issuing the report, the incoming drones closed at ramming speed too fast for the Ion Beam Frigates to track. As the drones impacted, it became obvious they were huge missiles carrying a warhead of Beast plasma; the missiles blew through the frigate's hull, the plasma warhead burst, and the infection spread through the ship in seconds, subverting the ship and dissolving her crew.\n\nThe battle took less than two minutes, as the three infected Ion Frigates turned on the one assault frigate that had managed to destroy the cruise missile targeted on it before impact. The lone surviving officer had been shoved into an escape pod by her captain, along with the battle telemetry; she was ejected moments before the last frigate was cut to pieces...\"\n\nIt's just something to keep the conversation going. We've talked about less in the past.\n\nThe Star-Metal scrolls were of deep religious significane to the Somtaaw, supposedly written by Jakuul (whoever that is) himself in a language no living man could read. It wasn't until the discovery of the Khar-Toba and the Guidestone that the scholars of Kharak started to be interested in the Scrolls, and other mythological artifacts (the Sobanni sword Caaliburnos, the Flaming Spear of Gaalsi and the Somtaaw's Chalice of Life) from the early days of Kharakian history. But, due to politics, they were never looked at by researchers and historians due to the BurningIt's obvious that they were important, but to think that if the Somtaaw hadn't been stubborn and put the world before themselves, the entire Homeworld War could have been avoided or at least made much less painful.\n\nHere's another one, if that's not suited enough to your liking.\n\nWhich is more powerful: Hyperspace, or Slipgates? They both open into hyperspace, but one is naturally occuring while the other is generated. However, only the Cores had the capabilities to jump the great distances that the Slipgates were said to do. And then there's the overcharged Bentusi Slipgate that they try to run away in.\n\nThe way Slipgates sound like they work is a hole in reality between two points, enter one end, get shot out the other. The Bentusi Slipgate had a natural exit vector outside of the galaxy and was artificially enhanced to shoot them far past that exit and into another galaxy. That makes the Eye of Arran look like a toy in comparison, which could only transport ships through a system of gates.\n\nAnd, one could go even further and say that Balcora was a overcharged Slipgate, with an exit hole at the Lagrange point between the supermassive black holes.\n\nNatural phenemenon are more powerful than what beings can create. However, the downside to this is that you can build a jumpgate anywhere that you want almost. Slipgates stable and large enough are few and far between. Also, there is the problem of finding where they leadAlternatively they could've just been scrolls that had been written and had nothing to do with the Khar-Toba or earlier, but no one knows because no one looked. That's not a plothole, though, just a mystery.\n\nI haven't fully read the thread but on the subject of the Crew of the Naggarok escaping. They probably figured that if the ship was infected so were any of the escape pods, vehicles, and other space-borne craft they may be able to use to escape with. That's my two cents there\n\nAye, I believe it was supposed to be an act of sacrifice for the greater good (tau?).\n\nI have a thought on....well, not really a plot-hole, more something that I'm surprised has never been addressed in fan-fic.\n\nUsing PDA's for mining and construction seems to be a method popular among the more savvy races, if not being the norm galaxywide. Far as we've been led to understand, they build up and break down target objects atom by atom.\n\nNow, given that quite a few capital ships have been stolen by most races at some point or another, what is to stop a thieving navy from using a PDA to create a bunch of copies to be used for false flag ops?\n\nOK, it'd be very illegal. But that doesn't always stop us in the real world, hmm?\n\nNot much point really; to achieve complete tactical surprise they'd have to crack the enemy's IFF codes ahead of time, and reconfigure the assembly line to fabricate a whole bunch of non-standard components and bolt them together."

Either way, I do like the idea.\n\nI'm wondering if the devs/art team are a little gun-shy of creating too many different models out of concern for the monumental task of updating them all when the graphics engine changes again as it did 3 years ago with the Trinity expansion. If this is the case, I would be happy to come up to Iceland myself and do some whip-cracking to make sure the job gets done on time. ]\n\nI'd actually like to see more progression in the empires armaments programs. Like with the Scorpion, you don't keep the same weapons and assets around forever, you upgrade them to keep them current and once they get too old your redesign them. It would make things in EVE seem more fluid.\n\nThis thread is older than 90 days and has been locked due to inactivity."

Unless your running a mech gaurd army, I don't really see it happening unless your a very highly skilled tactician.\n\nSpace Marines would give you more of an edge in this department for the sole reason that if your a trait chapter, you can give most if not all of your marines Infiltrate, allowing you to deploy in key positions and givving you the room to pull out fast. Because its a smaller army as far as numbers go, you'll have alot of table room to maneuver, giving you a tactical edge when these opportunities are taking.\n\nGive us a little more information on your army composition and we can give you a better answer.\n\nI will tell you that you can never go wrong with a Baneblade. Possibly one of the most durable super heavies in the game with quite a payload of weaponry that can be brought to bear on your enemy. Expect it to cause alot of damage and mayhem amongst your enemies lines. Combine it with a few other support tanks and you got a solid anchor in your lines that the enemy will have a hard time dislodging. This will allow the rest of your force to flit about like faeries and hit the enemy where it hurts.\n\nEDIT: didn't realise that you were talking about a business...sorry...but i still think its good adviceThere's a thread in the trading board where a couple of people report getting their items.\n\nI don't think the GTGU guys have much (if any) stock. You order from them and they order from GW. I'm not sure of the mechanism by which they are able to get their discount from GW and then in turn be able to offer us 30% off of the list price.\n\nA big item like a baneblade is almost certainly something they had to order.\n\nalright thank you i just wanted to make sure i didn't get cheated 65 bucks that's allAs far as I know GW requires a minimum order of $800 or something, so it is possible that the store you are buying from waits a bit to get a bunch of orders together that equal up to the minimum so the order will go through and they don't have to buy extra stock of stuff that they may not sell."

      "text": "CEarth Battle Armor - from PA(L) to Assault Armor\n\nA thread dedicated to the discussion of potential CEarth Battle Armors. There should be discussion on everything Battle Armor related, from weapons and equipment to the different PA(L) and Battle Armor types.\n\nTry to include pics when you suggest something to help everyone get a visual idea of what you are suggestingThe Elemental power requirement sounds about right.\n\nThe thing is that battery life depdends heavily upon the type of Battle Armor that is being used. If it is a PA(L) then you could have a battery system that could last a soldier 24-36 hours or more. If we are talking about an Assault Class Battle Armor then we may only be looking at maybe 12 hours or so.\n\nNow that all being said, I don't recall any passages saying how Battle Armor gets charged, it could need specialized power feeds or it could be something as simple as plugging it in to a portable generator or simply switching out a power cell. I do recall a number of instances where Clan Elementals and other BA armored troops were able to continue using their armor while out in the field for days on end without any real major sources of power nearby other than Mechs and other vehicles.\n\nI think I recall somewhere that it might have been mentioned that a BA and a PA(L) can simply hook up to almost any fusion engine powered vehicle to get recharged. Can anyone verify that?Well its not like we couldn't use them like a swat team. Have a unit in trouble put out a call for some kind of back up. Heavy power armored shock troops show up and hulk smash the strong point, then have PA(H) recalled for resupply of retasking.\n\nOk, since Kerrus has already described the 'KnightHawk' armor as being very much like the Mjolnir Class armor from Halo mixed with a few elements of the NightHawk PA(L) I have this suggestion to make. Since producing such PA(L) might not be cost efficient or what have you for a decade or so, how about using a cut down version. I'm thinking something that is like a partial PA(L). Something like the ODST armor.\n\nIt would be more cost effective, easier to produce in larger quantities, and require less specialized training in order to use it. It would be something that could be issued in large numbers to a number of GDI infantry units in order to make them deadlier and up their survival rates. Without any weapons or jumpjets tied directly into it this armor would not run down the battery life so quickly, mainly using the power for the sensors and electronics in the helmet and for a limited amount of movement and strength enhancementNo. Superconductors would allow for more than a mere twelve hours of use. Seriously1. You can charge them two ways- the first is the way you normally charge batteries, and can be done from any proper conenction.\n\n2. You can 'jump charge' them, which typically requires a connection to a fusion reactor. This basically does a flash overcharge, dumping a massive amount of power into the battery over a very short period of type. Jump-charging degrades the battery, but can be used to basically instantly charge it- and theoretically you could do it in the field via convincing a storm to hit you with a lightning bolt.\n\nThe damaging effects of jump charging are reduced by running the battery- as the electricity cycles through the system it realigns the atom orientation of the battery, although not to the extent that charging it normally does.\n\nEven so, Fusion Cells degrade, and each time you jump charge it, you cut years off its expected operational lifespan (which is some ludicrous number like eight hundred years)\n\nFusion Cells are a precursor to Lithium Fusion batteries. The Columbus expedition brought back several of these batteries, but in a 10 ton form designed for vehicle use throwers throwersGood postI'm thinking that at first we will see CEarth forces sporting PA(L), maybe even cut down versions. These would have no weapons attached and thus rely upon hand carried weaponry. However, they would have strength and movement enhancement abilities as well as sensor equipment beuilt into the helmet and also be armored to withstand almost anything short of an RPG round or a .50cal armor piercing bullet.\n\nNow when I say cut down version I mean that it would be lacking a few things that the regular PA(L) would have. Stuff like the jump pack.\n\nCEarth first generation PA(L) would be meant mainly for enhancing infantry to better deal with other infantry and to give them a bit more of an edge over regular infantry in confronting BattleMechs and armored vehicles.\n\nI don't see CEarth starting to produce Battle Armor of Medium weight and higher for a few decades. Maybe the first prototypes of Medium BA seeing some action in 3039 at the earliest opinion (which I know differs from a lot of you), you jump to the CSN Protomechs....once they get developed....eventually....and then up to the light battlemechs opinion (which I know differs from a lot of you), you jump to the CSN Protomechs....once they get developed....eventually....and then up to the light battlemechs.\n\nUh, Barricade? You do realize that there is a difference between PA(L) and Battle Armors, right?Ok. I was just making the point that you may have made too many specializations regarding PA and that some of them as you describe them sound more like BA instead of PA.\n\nAh. I misunderstood. I was combining both the PAs and the BAs into one overall list.\n\nPAs would be:\nGDI 'standard', Plugsuit/g-suit/tanker-suit, and the Marine PA (which is right on the border between a PA(L) and a Light BA). None of them have weapons that are even worth mentioning when pitted against anything larger then 20 tons. You'd need whole platoons firing in order to even equal a Medium Laser's impact. These guys are designed to kill infantry, unarmored support vehicles/buildings, and deal with other PA/BAs.\n\nBAs would be:\nHeavy & Assault. Assault is quite obviously just that, an Assault grade BA. Heavy is what everyone else likely considers a 'heavy' Medium, in that it gives up armor to mount better light-armor weaponry. Only the Assault suit should really be used against Mechs, but the Heavy is the first one that's designed to actually SURVIVE in combat against them. Anything smaller, if it sees a 'Mech coming, or anything large enough to mount a LL or PPC, should run for cover and damn well stay there. A Heavy can at least survive one or two hits and at least 'scrape the paint' of a 'Mech, before they run off. Assaults on the other hand are the proverbial 'piranha/zerg swarm' to a 'Mech or Vehicle, and will simply bury it in numbers.\n\nHere's a bare bones ultra light PAL write up I did some time back. It has no gimmicks other than basic stealth which, by the Btech source books, Earth already can do. The stealth isn't as good as a DEST suits but it does have two points of armor and has basic IR suppression and Earths version of low radar cross section materials and design engineering. I gave it a speed two as due to its strength, when loaded down with the normal infantry gear, such as, a ruck sack, weapons, ammo and most importantly heavy support weapons, it can still move twice as fast as normal infantry.\n\nAs for electronics, I figure it will have advanced, lightweight Earth microelectronics providing advanced sensors (short range probe), ECM (localized fire team level), and C3 like capabilities.\nIf I were using the old Btech infantry sheet, this suit would count as an L2 (not L2E due to myomers), basic stealth armored, infantry unit with a probe and ECM chit.\n\nIn games I've played, squads equipped with this suit have proven dirt cheap, easy to maintain and when armed with simple range 2 semi portable support machine guns, able to obliterate three to six times their number in normal IS rifle, laser, and MG ground infantry. SRM inferno platoons can be a bit rough though. Thank goodness they're not that common.\n\nYou can even load them down with heavier anti mech missiles for decent ambushes although expect a few lossesI was thinking maybe fulfill the same mission profile as the light Grey Death armor, not heavy enough to mount its own weaponry, but light enough to use infantry-scale weapons or heavier infantry weapons.\n\nOr maybe a suit employed in boarding actions, allowing a ship with a small compliment to take over, say, a jumpship. Not that I am saying that would be a common occurrence at all.\n\nPersonally, I'd rather see them as mass produced things, something easier to field than the equivalent of an Elemental or whatnot, but I doubt that would be feasible, considering CSN is just getting into this business.\n\nEdit: Unfortunately, in all the campaigns of CBT I've ever played, I never used BA, so I'm not exactly sure what BA was used for other than ripping up infantry and vehicles. I exclude Elementals from this since I do remember them ripping apart mechs when swarming. Me, I just equipped A-pods on my mechs, brought along some armor, and called it a day."

      "text": "Any 1 play the Beta 'Battletech 3025'?\nthe game was cut , but they had a system to balance the Mech class so the new guys in light mechs wouldnt always be wiped out by the old guys in the heavys.\nthere would be battles with restrictions on the class of mechs , some dropship issue or what?\nso to get into some planets you could only use light mechs , some would be\" team\" weight restrictions, !00 tons say 2 \"50 ton mechs\" or 4 \"25 ton mechs\" the idea was a team had a limit and would work it out them selfs before the fight. other planets would be a free or no limits but only 4 to a team.\n\nany Ideas out there?\n\nplease tell me the dev s know about 3025 , the game engine i heard was released as the original battlefield.\n\nThis is completey dependent on how they have the launch system setup. Does it go to a ready room where you can swap out gear and talk about strategy? Or does it just drop you into a match that's 5 seconds from starting battle each and every time? It's too speculative right now. I'm hoping for a \"CIC\" (Combat Information Center) where you have time to choose gear and load out while going over a strategy myself.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken some planets will have rules, but so far the only confirmed was a Melee planet (to my knowledge).I'm in favor of somethign like that. I prefer a system that stipulates a maximum combined drop tonnage per side - each side gets to use a combined max of 500 tons that could be spread across any number of players. If you want to field 5 Atlas' knock yourself out. If you want to go out with 10 Hunchbacks that's good too.\n\nNo suystem will be perfect I suppose. There's going to likely be some form of limitaiton on what players can use. Possibly by \"ranking\" or experience points or some other systemWell, we're talking about a pretty small sample size here. With no way to measure the player's ability which is the biggest factor. The Jenner and Hunchback are pretty close in weight (35 vs 50 tons) which is a far cry from the hunchback, atlas example i used (wonder how 2 hunchbacks would do against the atlas). I don't see anything wrong with 2 hunchbacks eeking out a 2 kill win over 2 jennersA lot of factors have to be weighed in that Match up. The Jenners, although lighter, run much faster (118 vs 64) The Range battle is = across the board, save for the SLaser the Hunchies carry. The Jenners are Jumpers, and depending on the environment, that can play a huge role and advantage, given knowledgable pilots.\n\nWe have no way to know what, if any, the Module load outs of the 2 Teams. Given what can be assimilated just from the actual data available on each Mech and thier load-outs, there is no reason that 2 Hunchies should be wiping out 2 Jenners simply due to some pre-concieved, 15T weight advantage.\n\nI would like to think that the Heaviest of one weight class, should be able to have a decent chance to reply favorably, during a fIght, to the 3rd weight group in the next closest weight class. Otherwise they may as well just run off and hide and leave it to the Bruiser classes...Assuming they're using the tabletop as a baseline, 4ML do the same damage as an AC20, and it's not like the Hunchback is the most armored thing ever, so yes, Jenners and Hunchies are more equal than was assumed in this thread.\n\nFinnMcKool, on 23 January 2012 - 05:23 PM, said:No comprendo. Numbers are not \"always\" better. Take a Clan Star vs 2 IS Lances, or Binary vs Company, for example. The Clan technology advantage overcomes or balances the \"numbers\" issue. Also, I don't think there are going to be any planets in this game where heavies or assaults can't play, as it's based upon 8v8 or 12v12 fighting, with different roles encompassing 'Mechs of all weight classes. New players can start with any weight class 'Mech as well - light, medium, heavy, or assault. Obviously they will not be starting in a Daishi, but something like an Awesome or Zeus is entirely plausible.\n\nNik Van Rhijn, on 23 January 2012 - 01:42 AM, said:Actually, I was almost positive that the devs were working on a new system that is basically a \"BV3\" for this game, for the sole purpose of matchmaking. I will try to find the quote but I swear I could have read it on here at some point.\n\nThere has been mention that BV3 is being developed externally. The problem is dealing with player ranking as stats are easily \"massaged\" etc and it is player skill that makes up the main difference. The one conclusion from previous threads about matchmaking was that no one is going to be satisfied. I get the feeling that this sort of info is going to be a few months away yet. After all the only thing we do know is that they \"hope\" to have up to 12 v 12\n\nThere was a lot of talk about similarities with World of Tanks so I decided to play the game to check what the fuss was about. The matchmaking system there seems to work so anything similar would be fine for me here.\n\nInstead of tank tiers mechs could have Battle Value based on what they equip. I mean if you're using old IS tech with non-XL engines and PPCs then your BV would be low and if you are decked out with full Clantech then you'd be through the roof.\n\nMaybe the game will even allow for a 5 vs 8 battle if there are like 2 full clan mechs on the team of 5 and all crappy old IS tech mechs on the team of 8.\n\nI do hope they manage to get it up to 12 vs 12 on launch. It would make things a lot more fun, but they could also have a flexible system that will make an 8 vs 8 or a 4 vs 4 if there are not enough qualified mechs queued up for your tier instead of making you wait 40 minutes.\n\nLike I said before it could also go with uneven numbers depending on the BV of each mech (then you can go rage in the forums when that top tier Madcat on your team AFKs the match). Allowing uneven teams based on BV will certainly bring on that Clan domination feel by allowing clan mechs to have their insane damage weapons but the matchmaking system will ensure that there are:\n\n1) less of them on the team they are fighting or\n2) matching them with other teams that have clan mechs.\n\nI hope match making is based both on BV and tonnage.\nTonnage so you don't see Assault only lances all the time, and BV since its the real balance mechanism.\n\nI'd like to see at least two match makers.\n1) A preset system where you get a lobby, invite friends, open up slots for randoms and pick mechs and loadouts before dropping. These would be matched vs other preset lances. Possibly have several BV brackets.\n\n2) A random quick find feature where you pick a mech and it attempts to find you a match by BV. I wouldn't allow groups of more than 2-3 to drop together in this with a 12vs12 limit.\n\nWeight Limits, I would have to say that is the best way to balance any drop.\n\nWoTs match Maker is hands down the worst ever. The Match Maker is designed from the ground up to feed the paying players(Higher Tier Tanks Cost a fortune to use) with all the mid tier players. If you are Tier IV-VI you are fodder. If someone can explain how a TierV-VI tank is supposed to be in a match with 10 Tier VIII-X tanks..and no it wasn't a scout...and the Match Maker has NO player level controls at all.\n\nCan you tell, I find the WoT MM horrible. I should be able to choose what i use in the Drop, or what maps I'm on. MW4 wasn't to bad when it came to game drops, wasn't the best but not to bad either.\n\nUnlike WoT mechs vary quite a bit in capability per weight class. A 3025 mech may be 1/3 the value of a clan mech of the same weight for example. Weight alone is not sufficient to balance in mechwarrior. Weight lights really are just to force a diverse force composition as not everyone can take an assault mech.\n\nmaybe they wont try to make everything even , give more for clan mech and less for IS?\n\nBut if they let you see who and what your dropping against, and you feel your team is up to a challenge,\nMaybe you think you have better players who know how to work together, and you know those other guys\nare just there for a quikie? anyway if you have the choice to drop against them or not? Or maybe an option\nto pull out if it looks really bad (I think the honor thing didnt matter to much to IS, at least not as much as\nto the Clanners)\n\nI hope they give more options for a player or team to make choices, on everything not just on drops.\n\nFunny but I was just looking at it from the perspective of the other Mech games , could be this will have\nsomthing very different????\n\nBoth of those are only indirectly related to effectiveness. BV is what you want. Its already in canon as well. Though they are moving to BV3 for the TT.\n\nBut the Battle Value cannot take into account the players actual skill. It can take into account the Avatars overall ability. Not only that, but if a resource system is used, this can spill over onto Large scale engagements, like Clans/Guilds taking over planets and limiting how much they can use as an attacking force, vs a defending force. BattleValue is fine for Small Skirmishes but will require a double effort if something similiar tomy suggestion is used, where as the resource based system can be used in broad strokes.\n\nEach side is allow X Weight and X resources for the battle, how that is used is up to the players/Clans/Guilds..."

      "text": "CFC didn't have a huge blob, they would be getting blobbed by your supers (isn't that what you did to Test when they tried taking vale?). The blob is necessary thanks to super caps, a different sov system won't change thatI think EVE players have been crying about blobs since 2 dudes ganked a solo pilot. It's part of the game. Adapt or die think EVE players have been crying about blobs since 2 dudes ganked a solo pilot. It's part of the game. Adapt or die.\n\nI have been in the blob and fought the blob I am not crying my point is no small alliance will take and hold space regardless what you do with the sov system because of the blob and hearing CFC come up with all these ideas to encourage small alliances in 0.0 is funny because they are one of the first people that will dog pile pure numbers to destroy any entity that might want a piece of Cloud Ring or Pure Blind for example (Not sure why anyone would though) and they would not do it looking for good fights but with 1200 dudes piled into a system at a time.\n\nIn theory there ideas could work if for the simple fact there was no such thing as a blue list a mile long for them. All it comes across as is \"we don't want to grind a region as long as we have to, because hell Raidendot is not even fighting us.\" But rolling 1200 dudes out is probably more of a reason why they are not getting fights then anything else like how you are complaining about the occasional amassing of FORTY (40) of a shiptype as blobbing VERSUS constant 1500+ man fleets lmao stupid goons\n\nIt is going to be near impossible to convince ccp to remove blobbing. They only spent the last year defending the game mechanic as a way to generate huge, impossible battles that they can show as a sign of \"bigger things to come\".\n\nWhy not add options, instead of trying to completely overhaul the current system? There is a gameplay gap that could be filled and that would harbor the small groups that can't compete on a timers game: Add space \"between\" wormholes and nullsec. Make it so that mobility works just like k-space (static gates, cap and supercap jumping, etc)... but give it no local and no static resources (instead, you can use an incursion-like mechanic where a type or resource, be it rats or minerals, appears at random intervals in random areas). This would require a few fixes to make it work, including making POSes something bearable and a (long overdue anyway) rework of profits from highsec to w-space, so this new \"fringe regions\" sit between wormholes and nullsec in terms of income.\n\nThe blob is never going away, short of CCP instancing the objectives or some other stupid mechanic, and it's part of EVE's charm (huge fleetfights can be awesome, and we all know that), so instead of trying to fix horses, let's make bycicles for those who don't want to ride hairy beastsHow do you know this is all they ever field if you have never been in a big coalition? Why do you assume they are always in \"1500\" men fleetfights? Have you read this somewhere, and taken it as gospel? Can you not think for yourself?\n\nThere are as many 10 men gangs as there are \"1500\" men fleets. You can actually make a gang of what ever size you like. Seems like you decided your playstyle is the \"right\" playstyle in a sand box game. Why don't you fuck off then think you misunderstand how the CFC works. PVP in many of the members if either 100% or near as damn it reimbursable. If you take part in an official alliance fleets, be it small gang, bomber, roam, gate camp, sov warfare etc you lose something you get it back. That means you can do as much PVP as you want it in any type and you don't have to worry about ratting/mining/trading the lost back up.\n\nOther alliances who have a more elitist membership policy may get to fly more expensive ships but I'm not sure they get the level of enthusiasm you get in a more casual organisation.\n\nPeople generally only moan about blobs when they are losing, otherwise they past of their victories as a sign of their awesomeness. In my experience the skills you use in small gang are pretty much the ones you use in large fleets, when it comes down to skill of the FC and the ability of the fleet members not to be morons - other peoples mileage my varyThere is very little need for skill in today's EvE. If you can join goons/test/current blob-of-the-month you need minimal player micro/macro ability. The smaller the fleet the more need for player skill is how i've always seen it think you greatly over-estimate most EvE players. Most people want a game they can log into and be handed regular pvp. Joining a blob means they can win a fair number of times and they need very little skill to do their partMy point now lost in the conversation of blobbing and faggots is null sec will never attract a bunch of small alliances into it because no matter the sov mechanics the blob will wipe the smaller groups out. ThatThatPL has shitloads of supercaps because pilots know that if they join PL, they'll get to use them.\n\nCFC has huge blobs because they get out and *do* shit.\n\n\"Anyone wanna go blow up a couple of CSAAs?\"\n\n<1500 hands go up>\n\nSomeone was asking above why someone would want to join a huge alliance like goons/test -- it's because there's always shit to do.\n\nNo one in this game can rally your boys as well as you can. I'm not sure how or why. Sov grind is just not enjoyable (unless it was their first time doing it or something).I don't understand what is taking them so long to fix this problem honestly. Tech has been problematic for years now. Even if they didn't tweak the formulas for T2 production, a stop gap approach could have been just redistribute the moons and make sure each region has 10-15 or whatever. Let the players take it from there and create a market for moon survey probes!\n\nThere is no other resource in the game outside of a personal grudge that has caused more content and ships to blow up.\n\nYou went to school right, and you hated it because fuck school I want to have fun. (Unless you found school fun; hey, it happens.) But it was self-improvement.\n\nYou're suggesting people go to school.\n\nExcept it's not mandatory and doesn't even offer tangible benefits and they can just not show up/stop logging in.\n\nAnd they're paying for it anyways, so while they're not logging in they might as well stop paying.\n\nDo you now grasp why this idea that people will seek to improve themselves at the expense of actually doing shit that they enjoy is stupid? That's not why people play games. It happens anyways, from simple contact with the game, but those who actively pursue such a thing are rare. It's not considered worth it by the vast majority of human beings to even play internet spaceships, and you think those who do will want to be ~internet spaceship elite~ when they can instead have internet spaceship fun."

Now gotta get a couple kills ahead of him again so that people don't start thinking he might be as good at pvp as I am ... or that I am as bad as he is! Sec, you know I love you <3He didn't want that Archon anyway.\n\n[spoiler=Elite Intel Leak]Or all the corp funds he embezzled to reimburse himself afterwards.[spoiler=JK]He gave it back ... Allegedly.[/spoiler][/spoiler]\n\nI don't really know what to make of that fit. Lasers aren't necessarily braindead since the Moa has no damage bonus, but why he would choose the largest of the small lasers is strange. I personally would fit small autocannons (150s prolly) if I was doing a troll-frigs Moa.\n\nSo we formed up Ruptures to show all the new guys in DIAT (we're up to 90 in corp now) how awesome they can be and how fun it is to fly with us. We flew directly to 6VDT hoping to run into a TEST BC gang that we had seen earlier. We got there and began shooting at things on the station, instapopping a bunch of T2 frigates and such before the Carriers came out along with some Abaddons/Maelstroms. We had no logi, so we hightailed it off to the B170 gate and kept bouncing back and popping more stuff. Finally, we hear \"B170 local spiking\" and we move to 30k off the gate. Despite the fact they had about 15 BC(total gang size) including 3 Scimis, they refused to jump in. Eventually we cleared off gate and warped 7BX.\n\nA few moments later local spikes and we return to the B170 gate, albeit at a spot 200k above. A purifier decloaks in the middle of us and quickly dies as the fleet lands 50k off. Our 4 Blackbirds and Falcon quickly get jams on the Scimitars and the first few ships die. Inexplicably, suddenly the whole fleet except for the Scimitars warp off, so we point the Scimis and get to work. 2 of them die and the 3rd is in 25% shield when the gang lands. We start primarying Hurricanes and they go down quickly, one after another. All of our guys that get shot simply warp off, while they're losing ship after ship. Finally, there's only an Onyx left, which gets popped after a long minute of firing, putting up it's bubble while it dies.\n\nIf this seems quick and boring I apologize; it was amazing, mainly because we took on a gang equal to ours and even though they made mistakes, we lost nobody against 3 Scimitars, while having no Logi of our own. Literally every one of our ships was utterly inferior to what they fielded, and we only outnumbered them by about 3.\n\nA lot of the guys just thought it was so great that we would sit 30k off an undock and insta frigs when they came out. It proved to a lot of the new guys that flying T1 stuff can be great fun and you can even win.\n\nNow for the welp; we got to Delve and jumped into 60 in local, seeing a few on gate. I order decloak and begin shooting a Vaga, which burns away. Suddenly, like 10 bombers decloak and bomb us. We're bubbled and for everyone except me (for some reason) it's instant death. I manage to stick around for 20 more seconds and alpha 2 bombers but the loss was kind of hilarious as massive guffaws of laughter were heard after I told people to shoot bombers (everyone was dead.)\n\nIt's ok. Apparently it was all a very overcomplicated trap that was intended to let the carrier get into structure and THEN have the HD fleet land at 0 in order to save him.\n\nIn other news, today a CTA was called to defend some jump bridges. After some fancy jumping, the MM fleet seemingly left, so welpfleet went out to derp around. Meanwhile, 2 hero carriers warped to the jump bridge pos to rep it even though it didn't need it AND the FC told them not to.\n\nThey died in glorious fashion shortly after to a surprise gangbang by the returned MM fleet and even before the killmails were posted we already knew it had been Test, including the goon leadership present in comms. \n\nHow did we get sov? That must have been some kind of accident. I feel slightly embarrassed now, like I'm going to have to go explain to this sov that it was just a mistake and its mother and I never planned to have it in the first place."

      "text": "Margaret Weis Productions, Ltd.\n\nOlder Games\n\nPreamble So I have been looking around for a good system for a Sci-Fi RPG and I think I may have found a home in Cortex. That said, I have yet to find a rule set that satisfies me when it comes to Starship Combat.\n\nA lot of games seem to like to treat a starship like its own character: with its own stats, skills, etc. that every player is expected to play at once.\n\nI don't really care for this approach. Each character should be doing something, with choices, rather than the Pilot rolling Pilot, and the other players each taking a gun and firing on the enemy ship. That doesn't have very much finesse, and not much is going on. It seems like most GMs avoid this sort of combat for this reason.\n\nSo, scouring about I found two systems I liked: 7th Sea, and Alternity. Both are similar enough to Cortex that I believe I can take each of their ideas and apply them seamlessly into Cortex.\n\nThese rules are still a WIP, so bear with me.\n\nStarship Statistics\n\nAttributes\n\nMuch like characters, Starships have attributes. They are as follows:\n\nAgility: Represents the Starship's speed and maneuverability. Thrusters and Engines.\n\nStrength: Represents the power behind the Starship's offensive systems. Beam weapons and Missiles.\n\nVitality: Represents how well-put together the ship is, physically. This translates into how thick the hull is, and how well the physical components of the ship react to stress.\n\nAlertness: Represents the quality and scope of how well the ship's sensors and targeting programs work, both inside and outside the ship.\n\nIntelligence: Represents the quality of the ship's virtual intelligence and computational power. A high intelligence does not necessarily equate to having a true AI.\n\nWillpower: Represent's the fortitude of the ship's power grid, and how well it moves from one system to the next. Also represents the power of the ship's shields.\n\nSkills\n\nStarships do not actually have skills. On it's own, without a crew, a starship is simply a collection of attributes, not capable of doing anything without a crew.\n\nIt is the crew that provides the skills. They do this by being in certain locations on the ship called stations. Each station allows a crew member to lend his skill die to the rolls of the ship.\n\nThese stations are usually manned by the player characters. Sometimes, however, the stations can be manned by NPC crew, or the ship's VI. In this context, the NPC Crew is a collection of nameless NPCs who work aboard the ship, but have few notable skills. The ship's NPC Crew and VI are usually rated around d2 or d4, or rarely D6 for exceptional examples.\n\nThe GM may introduce named NPC's on the ship with their own skills to bring to bear, but these NPC's are not what is referred to as the NPC Crew.\n\nThe stations are:\n\nCommand Station Skill: Discipline Title: Commander The command station is the central hub of the entire ship. From the command station, a character can coordinate and issue commands to the entire ship.\n\n-A discipline roll can be used to provide a 1 step bonus, or more, to one station, or more on their next roll. (I don't have the difficulties worked out yet.)\n\n-In combat, the Commander can attempt to out strategize his opponent. Make an opposed roll against an enemy commander's discipline skill. If the roll is successful, he may give one enemy station a 1 step penalty to it's next roll.\n\n-The Command station can also be used to take control of another of the ship's stations, while possibly locking out whoever may be there.\n\n-In an emergency, the Command station can even lock down all stations, or perform drastic measures such as initiating a self-destruct sequence.\n\nNote: Without a PC or a significant NPC to take the role of Commander, this station cannot be used. VI's are completely incapable of commanding a ship, and the NPC Crew that some ships are equipped with are typically not command material.\n\nHelm Skill: Pilot Title: Helmsman, Pilot The Pilot's station provides all of the ships navigational information, and provides controls for the ships sublight drives. This is also the station which activates and directs the star drive.\n\n-The Helm provides movement to the ship. Without a Helmsman, the ship will simply drift in space. VI's can function as the ship's autopilot, but it is rarely capable of more than routine maneuvers, such as liftoff, landing, or maintaining orbit.\n\n-Dodging in a ship works much like it does normally. Without spending special effort to dodge, a ship gets it's innate defense, which is it's agility. Otherwise the helmsman can dodge as a reaction, and roll the ship's agility + pilot.\n\n-The pilot can also move to make offensive maneuvers as well, rolling his pilot skill to provide a bonus to the Weapons station. (much like the commander. Again, I don't have the difficulties for these actions worked out.)\n\nCommunications Skill: Tech Title: Communications Specialist, Comm Spec The Communications station (also known as \"The Comm\") monitors the traffic sent on all known communication frequencies. This station also is equipped with the capability to interfere with those frequencies, and even insinuate itself into those frequencies.\n\n-The Comm provides means for the ship to communicate with the outside world.\n\n-The Comm can jam enemy communications with an opposed roll.\n\n-The Comm can reflexively be used to defend against having their communications jammed.\n\n-The Comm can also decode encrypted data.\n\n-In Combat, the Comm can be used to interfere with the enemy ship's computer systems. By making opposed rolls, The Comm can levy step penalties against enemy ships, or even shut down enemy stations.\n\nSensors Skill: Perception Title: Sensors Specialist The sensors form the eyes, ears, skin, nose and tongue of the ship.\n\n-Having someone stationed at the Sensors station enables the ship to make Perception checks to notice things. Without someone stationed here, the ship can still see, but small details may go unnoticed.\n\n-The Sensors station can also provide valuable targeting information in combat to the Weapons station. A high enough Perception check can provide a step bonus to the Weapons station.\n\nEngineering Skill: Mechanic Title: Engineer The Engineering station is the lifeblood of the ship; it is the Engineer that keeps the ship together while it is under stress.\n\n-The Engineer can recover damage to the ship's shields (stun damage).\n\n-The Engineer can also attempt to recover damage to the ship's hull (wound damage) but this is much more difficult.\n\nWeapons Skill: Heavy Weapons Title: Weapons Specialist In times of conflict, the Weapons Specialist takes the fight to their foes.\n\n-Lasers do stun damage, as these weapons are best used to disable the ship's shields. Against the hull they are nearly useless.\n\n-Missiles do wound damage, but will explode uselessly against activated shields.\n\n-Plasma cannons do basic damage, and for this reason are much feared.\n\nScience Skill: Science Title: Scientist The Science station is rarely used in combat. Some starships do not have a science station at all. Most warships, and very few trade vessels have these capabilities. However, most ships dedicated toward exploration of the galaxy have one of these.\n\n-The Science station performs miscellaneous functions on the ship. It has no predetermined function in combat.\n\n-The science station is typically used when analyzing strange data from anomalies that the Sensors have picked up.\n\n-By working with the GM, the Scientist may be able to design and use prototype technology with limited application. The Science station could be used to escape dangerous anomalies, weaken otherwise invulnerable space creatures, or other threats, given enough time."

This is about a trilogy.\n\nAnyway, regarding ME space combat - is it just my impression, or is it seriously heavy on capital-class ships? And if it is, how does that make any sense? They'd have been outclassed by smaller, more maneuverable ships ages ago. Okay, I know I'm trying to comment on realism in a BioWare game but still, what. Formations used best for catching stray shots, capital ships, why, why? BioWare cannot into military history.\n\nSpace warfare wouldn't even be anything like naval or air warfare, so historical accuracy or military realism makes no differenceSpace warfare wouldn't even be anything like naval or air warfare, so historical accuracy makes no difference.\n\nIt'd still be more close to air warfare than that - heavily reliant on mobility, since a bunch of smaller and faster interceptor vessels would punch holes in a capital ship while it'd try to aim. And yeah, sure, you could arm capital ships with fast-tracking turrets and so on, but at the same cost you could probably provide enough firepower to wipe it out and keep most of the force intactMotherfucking Mass Effect,\nThe story is so deep\nMotherfucking Mass Effect,\nConclusion is so sweet\nMotherfucking Mass Effect,\nWhen Reapers come for you\nMotherfucking Mass Effect\nThey'll read our review\n\nThey'll see we gave them ten of ten\nAnd that we liked butt sex\nThey'll like us all the better then\n'Cause Mr. T's like Wrex\nThey'll give us banner ads and cash\nAnd take us to a bar\nWe'll drink and dance and smoke some hash\nAnd give an extra star\n\nThe Reapers don't even seem all that powerful. It takes the one who humps that ship quite a while to destroy it.\n\nOne of them gets killed by a tresher maw too. Epic. Although, going by all the spoilers, maybe that's what Bioware is giong for here - to depict the Reapers as less monstrous along with the revelation of their purpose. This seems too stupid to be anything else; certainly any sense of horror about them has well and truly been lost at this point.\n\nEditor's Note: Here at Pixels or Death, we're dreamers, always dreaming big. Sometimes, (ok, most of the time) these dreams are of the \"fever\" variety, descending upon us like a drunken epiphany while we're mid rage-quit blackout (Call of Duty's lesser-known gametype \"Whiskey Headshot\" is a hell of a game). But because we're oozing almost as much journalistic integrity as we are vitriol and spittle, we feel like we should share even these depraved insights with you all; what awaits below is just such a dream.\nYou probably would have figured this out anyway, but needless to say, this isn't a \"real\" review of Mass Effect 3. We didn't play the game early, and are in no position to make any sort of legitimate commentary on its contents or story. So if you've clicked this link hoping for a hot scoop into what the \"real\" (whatever THAT means) Mass Effect 3 is like, sorry, I guess. But what we can offer you here is so much more. Nothing so base as mere \"entertainment\" (though we hope you derive plenty of that from this as well), but more importantly, we can offer you a glimpse into the mind of a dreamer. A look at what some of our favorite games COULD be. And hope. Hope that one day, an ambitious developer picks up on our lofty ideas and wild imaginings, and being the brave soul that he or she is, makes sure they never, ever see the light of day."

A nice way to make the system balanced would be to make it so you have to be atop the opponent to beam the mercs down, so it's a bit harder to get a live working ship, instead, you could shoot down the ship, then beam your guys down and fly the damaged ship (beam down some skutters first of course, cant have any hull holes.)\n\nMy plan was more to make it so tha the boarders were manueverable, and were a secondary. rather than change your ship, I was thinking of making it a wingman in order to keep balance. making the projectlil slow but manueverble with a long lifetime counter would be truer to the origional idea.\n\n--------------------\n\nFaust Military Industries needs your help.

K in the new version. been busy breaking it to find the bugs lol. I'll let you know later tonight when I get there (just about to jump to charon but that will have to wait until I get home lolItem Name: X blaster Item Description: extremely powerful weapon developed by the (some random corporation) Item Type: weapon Value: 300000 How to get it: get from high end station damage: number of hp on your armour(total)\n\nItem Name: Nanopod™ Item Description: A unique vintage gadget that was once used to play music files and videos now costs more than some rare gems themselves. Effects: None Item Type: Trade Goods Only Value: 2000(Ringers) 12000(commonwealth) 6000(black market) How to get it: Random Loot from high end ships/stations, or randomly destroyed ships that are scattered in maps... Or by killing scavenger ships(maybe)\n\nItem Name: Cloud Seeder Item Description: Was made by a tinker rivaling Hiro himself, though his name remains a mystery. One of his inventions was the Cloud Seeder, which when installed into the ship's engine would enable nebulae vaporization, turning nebulae clouds into fuel when the ship flies above it. Effects: Rather than deplete gas, it would refuel gas while you fly above nebulae clouds. Item Type: Item Upgrade(you know, those weird information chip thingys) Value: 15000 How to get it: From an enemy in planet with nebulae clouds. Slavers mostly. Destroyed transport ships. Korolov shipping questline(when you get to be the legendary pilot they have)\n\nItem Name: Private Settlement Item Description: A small settlement that you rightfully own. Inside is a kitchen, a living room, a bedroom, and a bathroom. Lightings and furnitures included. Spare keycard included. Ease of installation designed for full-time space travelers. Effects: Acts like an unused armor that you can drop anywhere. You can dock on it, and when you dock on it it acts like a cargo hold and resting place for your character(gas won't be consumed while you are here) and your crewmates(adds a command to 'Rest' when a settlement is in that galaxy). You can also loot it back if you want to change locations(but the settlement should have nothing inside, else it won't be repacked). While inside you can watch the news, take a bath, eat(only if there is food on the settlement's freezer), sleep(which would make your character randomly dream about stuff), or talk to your crewmates. This adds a more 'RPG' feel into the game.\n\nThe news would vary greatly, depending on what you do. Example you saved the korolov station from the charon pirates at the charon space system, the news would appear when you watched the television, or while it's under attack. Or when you win the arena, or when you cleared up a whole space system of all the enemy space stations.\n\nTalking to your crewmates would also give a little backstory in them(example would be to volkov telling a story about his missing wife, or just murmuring them).\n\nItem Type: Consumable. Can be used as long as it's not destroyed. Value: 150,000(commonwealth) 200,000(black market) 50,000(ringers) How to get it: You buy it from commonwealth, black market, or ringer stores. If not, you get it from them through a quest.\n\nIf possible there could also be a korolov settlement(bigger cargo hold plus can have an auton that would act as a trader, which would sell the items in your settlement's inventory when you leave items there for at least 40-60% of their selling cost) and military settlement(has defense system, can be equipped with weapons and armor, like an immobile space ship)\n\nItem Name: Commonwealth Glasscutter Item Description: An advanced weapon that even the military considers a threat themselves. The Commonwealth Grasscutter would pierce through any defense, any ship, but deals a very weak damage. Though being able to cut a ship in two makes up for that. The efficiency of the weapon is also very convenient, seeing as it only takes 30MW to power it up. Effects: A simple laser weapon that beams forward(means that it shoots in a straight line, not like the bullet type with spacings), passing through enemies and ignoring their shields. Has a weak damage but can sometimes instantly kill an enemy ship if the laser hits the ship fast enough in a slash-like attack. Item Type: Laser Weapon. Possibly Military. Value: I don't know how to price weapons. How to get it: Through Military stores, Infirmary prize, Black Market, Ringers.\n\nItem Name: Prey Item Description: Yet another invention from the unknown tinker that rivals Hiro himself. The Prey is a weapon that literally 'salvages' an enemy ship's part, stripping it off from the ship's body. Effects: The weapon acts as a missile launcher that charges itself with electron-charged particles, which when it comes into contact with any metallic material, would turn it's magnetivity to rapidly increase and decrease, setting off a minimal \"gravity bomb\" that, in turn, would strip off parts of the ship away from it, or destroy it in the process.\n\nThe missile launcher charges every 5 seconds, giving off a max of 50 missiles in it's arsenal. When a missile is shot, it appears like an Ares Lightning Cannon's ion attack. When it hits an enemy, there is a chance that a part of the enemy would be stripped off, leaving some sort of debris or cargo box behind him. If not, just flying bits of metal would appear around the enemy. The cargo box would be indestructable and cannot be picked up for a few seconds after it was 'salvaged'. the animation would be that the cargo box would be electrecuted.\n\nThe missile has no damage, but it would have if it suddenly removes every single part of the enemy's ship. It's possible, but the salvaged parts would still end up in three ways, \"in good condition, damaged, or destroyed\".\n\nItem Name: Advanced Solutions and Messages 3ncrypter (ASaM3) Item Description: Unlike the Quantum PC, ASaM3 is used mainly by hackers to alter datas and coding from memory cubes and the like, enabling them to have the power to read the contents of it. It was illegal when it was introduced to the public, but since everyone found it to be quite convenient in most cases, the ban of it's use evaporated.\n\nMeaning the memory cubes and quantum arrays would now have uses, but mostly would just be full of stories that have no connection to the game whatsoever. Maybe a questline can be added where you suddenly unveil a mystery from reading tons and tons of quantum arrays, maybe about aliens, or the Iocrym and stuff.\n\nYes, it can fail at reading what's inside the cube. Maybe a foreign language or random gibberish. Or maybe add a twist and put chinese/japanese text inside them.\n\nItem Type: Sort of like the Quantum PC(I forgot what it's called) Value: 12,500 How to get it: Anywhere. It's not illegal and is common.\n\nItem Name: Lambanog of the Oriental Pearl. Item Description: A rare type of alcoholic drink that's sort of a weaker type of vodka. Ringers loves these, not for the taste but because of the price. Effects: Nothing. Sellable loot. Item Type: Random loot. Value: depends. can be sold to ringers. How to get it: Ice Farms, high level pirate ships.\n\nItem Name: Himagsik. Item Description: A rare weapon rom made by the anarchists scattered all throughout the space. The quality of the effect of the rom varies differently, and it's use is illegal anywhere in space. Effects: Gives random enhancements to weapons(Efficiency/damage/speed/etc.) and the percentage of buffs that it might give can go up to 110%(in damage only) Efficiency can go up to 60%. It can also malfunction and destroy your weapon, or do the opposites, rather than buff your weapon, it might nerf it. Item Type: Weapon upgrade(rom) Value: 1000-3000 How to get it: Has a chance that it would be given to you by a space station that you will save. Black market. Illegal trade ships. Random ships in space, Anarchist camps, etc.\n\nItem Name: Kadi-Liman Item Description: A weapon made by a once prominent asian race from earth. The weapon turns any damaged material into cable wires, which when used links the ship onto an enemy's power source, stealing all of it's remaining energy, effectively shutting off it's power supply. It's production has long ended, but at recent more and more of them have resurfaced throughout space.\n\nEffects: Turns any damaged materials into useable cable wires(the quantity depends on how much weight the item has) which is used as ammunition by the Kadi-Liman. When an enemy gets 'hooked' by the wires, it shuts it's main power, and when you dock into the ship, enemies can either surrender to you, or kill you, or you could attack the ship little by little first until they surrender. When they surrender, they would give you more than what the ship has, and all of the items they will give would be undamaged.\n\nExample, you can get items such as the reactor, the ship's main weapon, all of it's armor, etc, without any damage at all. Along with drugs, slave coffins, military badges, gems, etc.\n\nAnd also, when they surrender, a commonwealth ship would arrive, and would thank you for making them surrender 'and' leaving the spaceship undamaged.\n\nIt could lead out as a military mission if ever. Where after obtaining Kadi-Liman, you can be assigned to salvage more 'undamaged' ships to study it's mechanical composition, for military purposes unknown to you of course. And if ever, you can change your ship into one of the ships that you can salvage, meaning this weapon 'would' be the best weapon if you get bored of your current ship design."

      "text": "Clanbuster\n\nContents\n\nThe informal term Clanbuster was coined by ComGuardsMechWarriors on the eve of the Battle of Tukayyid, when ComStar upgraded certain BattleMech types with new technology to face the superior Clan technology. It could describe either an individual 'Mech that had been upgraded in this way, or any one specific Clanbuster configuration.\n\nWhen the Battle of Tukayyid was arranged, the upgrades were purposefully designed as field refits that were quick and easy to apply within a few months with ComStar's resources at the time. To this end, only readily available components were used that were reasonably easy to swap, mostly exchanging weapons for more advanced but similar weapons. ComStar also made extensive use of Vlar 300 XLfusion engines for these upgrades because they had a huge cache available on Terra.\n\nIt should be noted that the Clanbusters, while sporting advanced technology that made them superior to most Inner Sphere 'Mechs at the time, were not as powerful as the moniker suggests. Although some were Star League era designs, they still essentially were basic frames with some quick and simple upgrades as opposed to advanced designs. Not designed to make the best use of the available advanced technology, they were still inferior compared to frontline Clan 'Mechs."

      "text": "Mister Earl\n\n3rd August 2010, 07:35 AM\n\nI've thought about stuff like this before, mostly as a mental exercise and to amuse myself. The capabilities and the situation with the enemy would dictate what weaponry you use and how you would deploy it. Let me give you one example:\n\nFor this mental exercise, I put the enemy in planetary orbit already, equipped with good detection systems and countermeasures, both electronic and weapon countermeasures. Ideally, the way I would go about destroying them is to have weapons packages in various orbits beforehand. The primary means of tracking these packages would be radar, so they'd have to have radar absorbing casings. I'm not sure whether or not LIDAR would be effective in space, so I left that out. Now, ideally, you'd use these weapons packages already in orbit to attack without notice, so as to limit retaliation. In a perfect scenario, all targets would be engaged simultaneously and destroyed within moments of each other. A figured a kinetic impactor would be best for this kind of thing. So I mentally constructed my weapons packages as one-use radar-absorbing shells full of steel ball bearings, with slow but stealthy orbital adjustment systems. Chemical rockets, however small, would leave a thermal signature, so I figured ion engines would be better. Very slow, but efficient over time. Now, the battle plan would be thus: All packages in orbit to take part in the strike would synchronize orbits with the target, in a manner that brought them into intersecting orbits with their targets at roughly the same time. Within a minute or so of striking, each shell would open up and disperse its steel ball bearing payload. Effectively, this is like a shotgun in space, at orbital velocities. The structural damage that any target would take from this sort of thing would be severe if not immediately fatal to the crew.\n\nshadron\n\n3rd August 2010, 07:43 AM\n\nMy boy, you simply haven't read enough fiction.

In submarine warfare (at least currently) communications between vessels is extremely limited so coordination of sensors and weapons from multiple platforms really isn't possible. In space this would be far easier; laser or maser datalinks for example could tie all vessels into a single CIC and allow synergestic benefits in sensor data processing.\nProbably a better analogy than subs would be air-to-air combat using interceptors (with missiles) and AEW/EW aircraft; RADAR emissions from the latter can be picked up by the interceptors and used for targeting without the interceptors using active sensors. This is especially useful with stealth(y) aircraft as the benefit of their reduced signature would be severely reduced by using active RADARYes I've played both and also prefer Traveller, especially in small ship combat. Plus it emphasises the stupidity of a small merchie picking a fight with a real warship.:)Exactly. Though this is a stage beyond what I based my original post on; I envisaged a small group of vessels stalking each other before a major engagement. Maneuvering for advantage before the first shot is fired.\n\nAnother consideration is speed of comms; in a large space engagement the delay involved in light-speed communications might well become significant; this I think could be especially true with Traveller style technology, relatively low acceleration (by epic SF standards) but negligble reaction mass considerations.\n\nHave you looked at GURPS: Transhuman Space?

The required maneuverability of the weapons platforms would create g-forces much too high for human occupants.I'd prefer drones. It costs time and money to train a pilot, or to program. Where as you put basic AI into a few drones, and allow a human to control one of them, switching between them. Put the controls in a familiar format--say, an X-box style controler. Give them a screen, and keep them close enough to the battle for communication to work.\n\nThe military has already realized that video game controlers=very very VERY fast troop training, so that part of the tech is here. \"Close enough\" here could mean as close as the Earth is to the Moon or so. The AI would be pretty simple--nothing more advanced than what's in a lot of video games.\n\nSo you get fast training, cheap-ish AI, and re-usable pilots that you can put in a bunker somewhere if they're not in a massive ship with all kinds of defences. Not as sexy as flying an X-wing, but infinitely more logical. Particularly considering we could do most of this with today's technology.\n\nOut of curiosity, are there any stories about a single-system civilization? I mean, we have stories about a civilization on one planet, and stories about civilizations on multiple systems, but to get from the first to the second pretty much requires some exploration of the system itself. Hyperdrives are complex and expensive, after all.\n\n\"Shotguns In Space\" is what I envision space combat to be, at least at the start -- much like the first aerial combats between biplane pilots, which were essentially flying gun battles with hand-held revolvers. I'm envisioning more Horatio Hornblower. Even better if the solar sail idea catches on. :D Shotties basically are the equivalent of grape shot, after all. And while grape is useful, chain, hot, and straight shot all have their places. And let's face it, other then the gause canon we're still using the same basic concept as Hornblower's time; it makes sense to use our more advanced concepts (magnetic firing, etc) as the common weapon of the next battlefield.\n\nRoboramma\n\n3rd August 2010, 05:47 PM\n\nAm I the only person on this website that ever studied thermodynamics?\nDid you happen to see this post:GodMark2\n\n3rd August 2010, 05:54 PM\n\n\"Close enough\" here could mean as close as the Earth is to the Moon or so.\n\nIn space, you either need AI, or will have to put humans in the line of fire, cause there's nothing to hide behind.\n\nIn orbit, you can at least hide behind the planet, assuming a good enough array of comm satellites to relay your directions.\n\nXephyr\n\n3rd August 2010, 07:56 PM\n\nWell let's see.\n\nFirst we have to perfect the science/technology of space travel.\n\nThen we have to perfect the science/technology of spaceship weaponry.\n\nThen we have to come up with the funds to build the spaceships, weaponry, and sundries necessary for human sustainability.\n\nThen we have to perfect the science/technology of training the average joe to navigate the spaceship.\n\nThen we have to perfect the science/technology of training the average joe about spaceflight combat maneuvers.\n\nDang.\n:boggled:\n\nSoapy Sam\n\n3rd August 2010, 08:53 PM\n\nThrowing rocks works.\nEspecially if you can do so at a significant fraction of c.\n\nrjh01\n\n3rd August 2010, 08:57 PM\n\nIn space it can be made very hard for the enemy to detect you. This is one of the issues faced by ICBM in space. The enemy sees an ICBM approaching. However it will also see heaps of balloons. They would not be able to tell the difference between a balloon and the ICBM. A balloon in this case is a very light object ejected by the ICBM that looks like on radar an ICBM. So as long as the ICBM is in space it would be very hard to destroy.\n\nThe same story would be true of spacecraft. A real one can eject objects that look like real spacecraft.\n\nCuddles\n\n3rd August 2010, 09:17 PM\n\nI'm going to disagree with most people and say that space combat will basically not happen. As a couple of people have mentioned, spacecraft are rather fragile. No matter how much you try to cover them in armour and such, the amount of energy involved with even fairly small bits of rock is just too big. You don't need any fancy weapons, detectors, tactics, or anything like that. Just throw a bunch of rocks really hard in the general direction and any spaceships will be crippled or destroyed. Worst of all, there's really no way to see that coming. Spotting large asteroids is extremely difficult without plenty of time, spotting a bunch of pebbles is pretty much impossible.\n\nThe other problem is what is the point of the war? If you're trying to capture territory, then saturation rocking to get rid of any space-based defense should be fine. But what if you're not trying to capture it, and are simply wanting to damage enemy production capabilities, or simply wipe them out? All you need to do is throw slightly larger rocks and anywhere from specific targeted portions up to all life on a planet is toast. The kind of rocks that can do that much damage are virtually impossible to detect until far too late (most near misses with Earth have actually be noticed after they passed). Even if you see them coming, there's nothing a fleet of spaceships can do to stop them in a short time. Blowing them up doesn't change their mass or momentum, the only useful thing to do is push them off course. That's not impossible, even given a very short time in which to do so, but it's the sort of solution that requires lots of telescopes and a quick way of attaching rockets or something to rocks. Spaceships with missiles and lasers would be useless.\n\nIf any space combat did occur, it would basically involve mining stations, telescope networks and big engines to push rocks around.\n\nSoapy Sam\n\n3rd August 2010, 11:17 PM\n\nCuddles. The same might have been said of dugout or birchbark canoes.\nI think we are at that level of technology now with spacecraft.\n\nNo guarantees we will ever get further of course.\n\nThe point of interplanetary or interstellar war will be the same as any other war- hurting someone you are afraid of.

The most salient (I think) being that it would be very similar to submarine warfare - 3D and very, very concerned with stealth and detection.\n\nIf you're planning on radiating all your heat away from your enemy so they can't detect you, how do you know which direction they're in?

Humans adapted comms lasers, fusion drives and mass drivers into weapons to defend the solar system.\n\nHellbound\n\n4th August 2010, 07:49 AM\n\nI have to secodn the idea that it would be more of a hide-and-seek game, rather than stand-up combat. My reasons for this are multiple:\n\n1. As others have stated, it's fairly easy to destroy a spacecraft, armor or not. THis means defense is going to focus on less detectability and evading attacks.\n\n2. As to people remarking on G-forces, reaction mass is expensive. Costa lot to carry and use. I don't really see a lot of high-G manuvering being feasible from the standpoint of resources or economy. You'd simply need way too much space in engiens and reaction mass to make this anything more than a last-ditch strategy. It would be more feasible, however, for small probes/drones or missiles.\n\n3. I'd see a lot of useages of missile-type ordnance. Assuming we could develop directed energy weapons to a sufficient point, they still are limited by light speed and would give away a position, and much of the energy could be disperesed by using various particulates as a shield (for example, a cloud of shiny metallic sheets could do a lot to attenuate a laser...or even a cloud of prismatic particles of some sort). Not sure of the exact effects, but that would lessen the damage. Also, it's space, so long-range is the norm. Even a few light-seconds of distance means the target will not be in the same location you aimed at when the beam hits.\n\n4. I can easily see guided projectiles taking a huge role. Imagine a cannon or railgun system that launches what is, basically, a missle. The projectile travels ballistically until it reaches a certain pre-set range (or until it's sensors detect a target), then it initiates it's engines and finishes off by seeking the target. You could also used a drone or probe with some sort of projectile or directed energy beam in the same system...it gets close ballistically, then begins firing. This gives several advantages. THe launching mechanism means more of your projectiles reaction mass can be used towards hitting the target, instead of accelerating to it. If the missile is restricted to passive systems until activation, a purely ballistic trajectory makes it much harder to track and detect. Make them from radar-absorbing materials, cool the outer casing to ambient temp, perhaps building in a heat sink of some sort, and they'll be hard to detect until they activate. In fact, using a low-speed missiel with high stealth and a \"cool\" manuver system, such as gas jets, and you might even be able to hit your target before they know an attack is coming.\n\n5. Likewise, I see the \"shotgun\" idea being used, but not so much for combat (you'd have to close to so short a range, and again consdiering the distances allowed for space combat and the fragility of any space vessel, and you basically end up with a MAD scenario). Rather, I'd suspect they'd be used more for anti-missile attacks and point defense (and anti-beam weapon. Assuming such were developed, they could double as the launchers for whatever particulate you use to interfere with the beams).\n\nThat's just my thoughts so far, but perhaps gives a bit of food for thought.\n\nuruk\n\n4th August 2010, 08:26 AM\n\nI think the type of warfair or battle would heavily depend on the type of propulsion and the fuel you are using.\n\nAt present we are using chemical, (and perhaps ion propulsion). Your manuevers would be limited by the amount of fuel you are carrying on board. Mass and fuel are huge determining factors in what kind, how many, and the duration of manouvers, and tragetories you can take to avoid projectiles or chase, or retreat.\n\nIf you are figting a space battle in the solar system you are limited to doing sling shots around planetary or gravitational masses. You would have to watch your velocities as you could sling shot your way out of the solar system or slam into an atmosphere.\nTh efuel limitation would only allow you to do a limited number of accelrations, de-accelerations and course changes.\n\nThere would come a point where you be forced to choose between avoiding a projectile or or being parked around Pluto or stuck in an orbit around the sun (and be a sitting duck) or sailing off into interstellar space and hope a rescue ship with enough fuel and velocity could over take you and either refuel your ship or load up you and your crew and return home.\n\nI think a battle in space would be a chess game of trajectories, velocities, and time.\nI can emagine a scenario where a ship is out of fuel, stuck in a orbit beyond the range of rescue with a projectile heading toward them in an intercept course that will impact with them in days and there's nothing the crew or anyone else can do about it.\n\nPure hell, waiting for an inevitable death. Not very exciting or glorious at all.\n\nHellbound\n\n4th August 2010, 08:29 AM\n\nUruk:\n\nYeah, and that ties into why I think it'd be more similar to submarine warfare, as least to a degree. You don't have the capability for rapid evasive manuvers (as so far, every propulsion system we've come up with that's feasible either requires a lot of reaction mass, or is very-low acceleration, or both). More a matter of stealth and sensors fighting each other, and likely the first shot to land ends it.\n\nuruk\n\n4th August 2010, 08:49 AM\n\nThe battle could be decided in the first few moments of an engagement and the shot that ends it could take days or weeks to hit. That would royaly suck if you were on the losing ship.\n\nuruk\n\n4th August 2010, 10:58 AM\n\nOr you would be faced with the choice between a relatively quick death by allowing the projectile to hit or a protracted death by starvation or suffocation in interstellar space or in an huge elliptical (comet style) orbit around the sun\n\nuruk\n\n4th August 2010, 11:07 AM\n\n~snip~\nIf any space combat did occur, it would basically involve mining stations, telescope networks and big engines to push rocks around.\n\nSpaceships with missles and lasers might be effective against other ships who are carring mining equipment to asteroids and hauling big engines to attach to push rocks around. Not to mention attacking space borne telescope networks.\n\nMaybe just the missles are needed.\n\nDinwar\n\n4th August 2010, 11:31 AMIf you really WANT to use the absolute extreme of what I said, this is a reasonable possition. However, it's not necessarily the case.\n\nFirst off, I highly doubt there's going to be too much combat away from planets. Space is just too big--there's too many ways to dodge your enemy, making it not worth the effort. If you DO engage in combat, it's likely to be from fairly far away, with these drones used to fight other drones/disable or destroy incoming rounds. Meaning you're probably not going to be as far away as the Moon when you're piloting the drones. You're either going to be on a planet (if it's a pitched battle) or near your ship (if it's away from the planet).\n\nAlso, I'm not necessarily arguing against AI. I'm saying that this is a perfectly workable intermediate step between \"put the humans on the front line\" and \"all craft are AI\". Simply put, our AI isn't that good and is relatively stupid. There's a reason we don't put AI autopilot into cars. Given relatively cheap AI AND human control, using programing we already have (squad-based FPSs and all that), we could theoretically construct these drones tomorrow. More advanced AI is better, but if you don't have it you may as well work with what you've got.\n\nAn efficient EMP device might be all you need to disable an enemy vessel. Such a pulse may be produced without the need for a thermo-nuclear reaction. Not if you've got one equiped with a solar sail. That can be run mechanically if needed. Not a fast means of propulsion, but enough for at least some manuverability, making the EMP a good weapon but not perfect. That's why I argued for Hornblower as a model for space combat--if you want to capture the enemy vessle you need to disable it, and using the \"throwinig rocks\" model you're talking chain shot (for solar sails) and destroying the rudder (in this case, the engines). The rest is submarines--evasion and detection.\n\nben m\n\n4th August 2010, 11:51 AM\n\nThe battle could be decided in the first few moments of an engagement and the shot that ends it could take days or weeks to hit.\n\nThat's why I think the most likely scenario would be a mutual-assured-destruction stalemate. It's got exactly the same ingredients as US/USSR ICBM warfare: offense is easy, defense is very hard, first strike is easy to see coming.\n\nCorsair 115\n\n4th August 2010, 02:36 PM\n\nAssuming we could develop directed energy weapons to a sufficient point, they still are limited by light speed...\n\nBut light speed is a heck of a lot faster than a missile, cannon, or rail gun could achieve.\n\n...and would give away a position...BenBurch\n\n4th August 2010, 05:57 PM\n\nCounter-fire against rocks is likely to be effective - Hit the rock with another or with some sand while it is still several minutes from impact, and if it was aimed at something the size of a spacecraft, it will likely be diverted enough to miss.\n\nCounter-fire against SAND however is not likely to be very effective.\n\nHellbound\n\n5th August 2010, 06:00 AM\n\nBut light speed is a heck of a lot faster than a missile, cannon, or rail gun could achieve.\n\nYes, once you find the target and at shorter ranges. My focus on missiles was for several reasons:\n\n1. A kinetic projectile has a pretty well unlimited range, especially if it has terminal guidance and manuverability (such as a cannon-fired missile). Slower to get to the target, but it can run it's own attack once there.\n\n2. I suspect that for the foreseeable future the weight required to mount and use beam weapons of any appreciable energy will be restricitve, especially considering the power needs. Basically, missiles and/or cannon are going to give you more boom per ton. Also, both missiels and cannon give you the option of varying ammunition types: penetrators, fragmentation, HESH, EW and ECW modules, recon packages, etc. The versatility is another weight and space saving feature not present with beams.\n\n3. Yes, you get immediate delivery of energy to target, but you have to get close enough to the target, be in line of sight, and accurately predict where they will be when the beam reaches them. With a missile-type weapon, you don't need line of sight, you only need to get into the general area of the target to let the onboard guidance take over, and even at shorter ranges you can fire missiles from all sides of the craft and have them track around to the target (where with a beam system you can only fire those weapons facing the target).\n\n4. Finally, and related to the second point, I suspect missiles will be much more of a one-hit-kill weapon than beams. You can get much larger areas of damage, especially with some type of stand-off fragmentation weapon. Additionally, using shaped warheads can give you precision targetting, as well. Beams are pretty much limited to precision targetting (although, admittedly, you can \"walk\" a beam across a target, but that adds to the aiming difficulties mentioned earlier).Yes, power is higher, but I had quite forgotten that the visibility is due to air ionization (doh!). Good point :) I addressed most of this above. Besides, under the idea of a stealthy missile, the time to target doesn't nmatter so much. It's going to be much easier to detect your ship (with its crew and energy systems and such), than a missle (designed for stealth and running ballistically until close range). My suspicion is that missile attack would be viable at a range greater than beam, so a beam-armed ship is likely to get attacked by a steath misile before it can get close enough to accurately target it's opponent...much like subs against ships.\n\nTo close, though, primarily I'm thinking more about technology that might be available relatively quickly, and I don't see directed energy weapons beign viable against missiles, cannons, or even railguns/guass guns for some time yet. As teh technology matures...that may change :)\n\nOf course, I'm quite willing to be shown wrong :)\n\nCuddles\n\n5th August 2010, 06:52 AM\n\nCuddles. The same might have been said of dugout or birchbark canoes.\nI think we are at that level of technology now with spacecraft.\n\nI think Roboramma's is correct here. In general, our weapons and defences have been fairly equivalent. Dugout canoes could handle a few arrows or rocks, but later on we needed ironclads and then battleships. Then those were shown to vulnerable in their own ways and the current trend is large fleets defending aircraft carriers, with defence meaning shooting the other person, or the things they fire at you, before they hit. And then you get to the more extreme case of nuclear weapons. Other than trying to stop them reaching you, there simply is no defence. Since it's trivially easy to just fire enough of them to overwhelm any attempt to stop them, the only option is to stop them being fired in the first place. Which either means having enough of your own as deterrent, or simply being really nice to the people who have them.\n\nThe trouble with space combat is that in the absence of magic forcefields, we are already, and always will be, at the nuclear weapon stage. No matter how much more armour you stick on a spaceship, you can always just throw rocks a bit harder. It's already pretty simple for us to throw a rock that would hit with the energy of a nuclear bomb. Even assuming we could somehow cope with that, we could just throw one with the energy of two bombs instead. There are already rocks floating around capable of wiping out all life on Earth, so it's rather unrealistic to think we could ever defend against it. No matter how good our defence could get, the potential of kinetic weapons in space will always far exceed it.\n\nDoesn't that assume the spacecraft stay on the same course?\n\nNo. Perhaps I didn't elaborate enough. I'm not suggesting throwing a few rocks in the direction of a spaceship, I'm suggesting throwing a ******** of rocks covering the whole volume that you want to clear. You have essentially unlimited rocks, and assuming you have enough energy to waste actually fighting space battles rather than just trying to get somewhere, you presumably have enough energy to throw an awful lot of rocks. If the planet you want to attack has spaceships defending it, you just send a meteor shower that will cripple anything not protected by the atmosphere. The only defence is to not be there when it arrives, which effectively means you've won even if you don't actually hit them.\n\nSmall metal pellets, lots of them.\nMade of anti-matter.........As for missiles, that's a trickier question. Obviously being able to steer would be useful, but at the same time it makes you much more visible and therefore easier to destroy or avoid. There's also the problem that it is possible to destroy them at all. As noted earlier, the big advantage of throwing big rocks at people is that if you try to blow them up you just end up with a bunch of smaller rocks carrying exactly the same energy. However, since missiles rely on correctly detonating and not simply on their kinetic energy, it's much easier to render them ineffective. I suspect the advantages and disadvantages would outweigh each other differently depending on the situation.\n\nThe laser's power is also not reduced since it does not have to punch its way through an atmosphere.\n\nLaser power is still reduced simply by range though. At a distance of just a few thousand, or hundreds of thousands, of kilometres, your high power laser will probably hardly be noticed by your target. And those are fairly short distances when it comes to space travel.\n\nThere's also the problem that you need to be able to see your target. I don't just mean that in the line-of-sight sense mentioned by Hellbound, but simply in needing to know where your target is at all. Saturation rocking of an area from millions of kilometres away requires no knowledge of where things actually are at the time. Guided missiles don't really need to know where anything is at the time they are fired, you could just set their guidance systems to turn on after a certain time when you think they'll be able to find something nearby.\n\nSince there seems to be general agreement at least on the point of the difficulty of detecting each other and a likely focus on stealth, only being able to shoot when you're nearby and can see exactly what you're shooting at is a pretty major disadvantage.\n\nHellbound\n\n5th August 2010, 07:21\ncatsmate1\n\n5th August 2010, 08:01Or a self-forging or canister warhead; the missile is launched, travels to the vicinity of the target and blasts it with shrapnel from outside interception range. Smaller and less damaging impacts, but lots of them; grinding off external sensors, radiators and similar would be a benefit.\n\ncatsmate1\n\n5th August 2010, 08:05 AMWell that example was from a non-canon Traveller game; the trick was locating and using naturally occuring anti-matter.\nMissiles that launched millions of tiny anti-iron pellets at a fleet from beyond missile interception range pretty much ended that war......\nAnd rendered that star system unhealthy to visit.\n\njimbob\n\n7th August 2010, 07:33 AM'Ooh, you're nice and warm,' the little brown and yellow creature mumbled sleepily, snuggling into Sma's neck as the headed down a deeply carpeted corridor for Sma's quarters.

      "text": "Sounds a lot like the Diplomacy system from Vanguard, which was a pretty great addition for a MMO. It was really a way to drive the games story and produce gamewide events and triggers. Done right, with the right method of play it could be a decent idea. BTW, the Diplomacy System in Vanguard was my second favorite thing about the game so I'm not knocking the idea. Only concern I have is that it might be a little more than the Cryptic Crew can handleI did try it and found it just didn't fit into what I would think of when trying diplomacy. It is a card game that made very little sence to me. I just could not wrap my head around choosing cards as a battle of words with a winner and loser.\n\nI believe there should be diplomacy in this game. It makes sence as an IP and an option for game play. The diplomacy should be part of the game with a choice that determines your actions. Kill or let live. Chase or let them leave. Believe what a diplmate tells you or don't with different outcomes. It should feel as a part of the entire game. One game with more than one outcome. If they are seperate, you can ignore it. I would prefer it all be part of the game. That would make diplomacy mean something in game play. Not just a side show as in Vangaurd.\n\nAfter reading a few posts about what people are thinking for pvp and end-game struggles, I think diplomacy would make for a great pvp conquest idea. This would work if there are just Federation and Klingons, but will also work when (if) there are other factions added.\n\nThe basics being that both sides want to expand their control of systems. The choices are either conquest through force (pew pew) or through diplomacy. Each faction would then have to negotiate with the neutral planet. The better one faction is at negotiating, the harder it becomes for the other faction. There could be a tie-in for combat as well, so if one faction is attempting to conquer by force they then would not be able to negotiate. I think this would evolve some pretty interesting strategies at high levels as to whether to talk or fight.\n\nBy allowing this kind of end-game strategy session, you could give meaning to rank. Admirals could assign missions (prebuilt by cryptic and available to X rank admirals who... Haven't really fleshed this out yet) to negotiators to complete or commanders to attack. Then you change the entire concept of rank so that people are promoted based on accomplishments instead of grinding. Would also help with what is happening now which is there will be far too many admirals and not enough lower ranks.\n\nI guess that I really enjoy the idea of player run content where we decide how to shape the Federation or the Klingon Empire. Would save Cryptic from having to constantly create content and allow things to progress more organically and realistically. I think we have a lot of good players out there that would take this and run with it making something truly unique and new.\n\nPerhaps instead of PvP, it could be a way of getting at that 'competitive PvE\" that STO mentioned they'd have. Instead of players directly engaging with each other, they compete for the systems in question through diplomatic control. Of course, I'm not against direct PvP, either.\n\nPerhaps a zone divided into three sectors (like we have now)... the outer zones are competitive PvE--diplomacy, resource control, and so on--where each faction tries to hold control of systems through a variety of means. The center zone is where actual PvP combat determines control. But, of course, for any zone like this to work, we'd need to have a REASON to control those zones... I'm not sure this game really has anything in place for that.\n\nI find them pretty thin, myself. Basically, it ends up that your choices boil down to the \"Aggressive\" option, the \"Defensive\" option, and the \"Passive\" option. Since dialogue has to be written for each possible response, development time means that fewer lines are written. There's usually even some overlap, to reduce that time... which also reduces the number of possible outcomes. Usually, the max is 3.\n\nWhat's more, it means that your character can be one of THREE people. Not the one you want him to make, unless you want him to be one of THREE people. The system puts words in your character's mouth, forces a particular specific personality on them, and then mascarades itself as a \"choice.\"\n\nSo, yeah, I don't find ME, KOTOR, or their sequels to be all that impressive in terms of \"choice.\" But what's more, they are SINGLE-PLAYER games.\n\nWhen you have too many endings in an MMO, making the consequences of the endings to great means you run into problems with grouping... or with continuity of story... or with development time (what if only 10% of the population ever chooses option C? do you abandon it, or does that 10% get equal time to the other 90%?) So, either you create far too much work and hassle... or the endings are pretty similar, so it's really not consequential anyway.\n\nThe problem here is a choice system that focuses on ENDINGS. You choose the ENDING by virtue of which pre-programmed path you take. But once you crack the code (I mean, once you figure out which of the three golden paths you're going to walk) you just mash that response and go for it--because there is usually more benefit to min-maxing it, just like everything else.\n\nI'd prefer a choice system that focuses on METHODS. Instead of choosing the ending, per se, you choose HOW you get there. Maybe, yes, the reward is different for a mission, but for the most part the answer ends up the same--good guys win, bad guys lose, innocent folks survive to make more innocent folks. But what's different is that you got to choose how YOUR CHARACTER would have done it.\n\nYou wanna blow things up? Go for it!\nYou want to reason it out? Do it!\nYou think you can sweet-talk them and persuade them to see it your way? Let's see what you've got!\nYou'd rather be more direct, and threaten force--in hopes of avoiding battle? By all means!\n\nIn a dialogue system, you can't really choose anything but option 1 if you want some sort of reward. Why? Because there's no strategy involved in clicking dialogue choices. Your opponent can't surprise you, or land a lucky crit, or otherwise throw off your plan. Combat takes longer and involves more choices, so it gets a bigger reward... so if you choose diplomacy, you're just nerfing your rewards.\n\nUnless, that is, we have a diplomacy system that actually involves strategic, chess-like gameplay. We take out the specific, intermediate dialogue, and instead focus on the tit-for-tat aspect of verbal interplay. YOU decide what it is your character says, YOU decide his or her personality, and you use SKILLS that fall in line with that (rather than forcing your CHARACTER to fall in line with the DIALOGUE offered). And then you engage in a strategic verbal \"battle\" that is far more comparable in difficult and scope to combat.\n\nNow you've got a system in which you can ACTUALLY choose diplomacy over combat, when the option arises, and the game is justified in giving you an equivalent (though different) reward for your efforts.\n\nWell I like it. This is a depth of gameplay I think I would enjoy OP! I would also like to say I was never a fan of biowares moral choice systems. No real moral choices can be made if your getting lightside/darkside points. Its not just about what you do, but why you do it."

Its no fun to be the 1 guy that spawns in an arena, when the other team is full! Its no fun to be the full team hunting down the one guy that did spawn!\n\n2) Why is it, that we have to queue up for a particular map? Why can't we just queue up for the next available space map, or the next available ground map? I'd live in one (or both) of those queues if they were available, because I don't care which of the three maps I get when I queue for space or ground ... in fact, almost every team I'm on, always queues for all three maps of whatever type of PvP they want to do.\n\n3) Something is wrong with the map queuing logic .... I am talking to my friends, they are in assimilated cruiser ... there's three of them in there. They say, \"Come into assimilated with us.\" So I queue. I get put in a map by myself with ZERO opponents ... and they still only have 3 in their instance of it ... against a full team of opponents. Come on.\n\n4) While I applaud the effort made with the queuing system in the last patch, you apparently broke something, because now, if you queue and change maps (go to a different sector, enter a fleet action, warp out of a mission) it randomly drops you from a (or even all) queue.\n\n5) Set up the maps so that when the other team leaves the arena because they don't want to lose (or let you win) ... it starts a 2m timer .... at the end of that 2m, the arena starts awarding the team that still there 1 point every 15s until they win or opponents come into the arena.\n\n6) Once you fixed it, so people only go in with full teams ... anyone leaving an arena should have a 15m cool down timer before they can queue for any further PvP.\n\n7) No one should respawn on top of an opponent. No one. That is just non-sense. I can't count how many times I've respawned alone in the middle of an entire team of opponents, or visa versa.\n\n8) Spawn camping should be a NO! Seriously, every time you log into a game one side or the other is spawn camping!\n\nI won't even get into the all the graphics problems of the maps ... that's already been discussed.\n\nAn entire faction is dependant on a broken system. THAT ALONE should make this a #1 priority.\n\nAnd frankly guys, PvP queues are MMO-101 stuff at this point in any MMO development. You shouldn't still be having these problems!\n\nWhat is with, you use a hypo, or a shield recharge ... and you're killed before the animation ever starts, but yet you're still charged for the use?\n\nEither you used it, or you didn't. You shouldn't be charged for it if it wasn't applied.\n\nAnd also ... how is it EVERYTHING I need for PvP is at Ganalda (as it should be) .... but as a Fed, if I want to buy Hypos or Shield Recharges .... I have to to go to DS9 or Andoria, buy them, and then fly back to K7????\n\ni don't know if it has been fixed but... today playing like a klingon we were 7 to 3... in a small map (five min on team... and it seemed that the game incorporated 2 feds to the klingons faction automaticaly!!!\n\nThere're a lot of things wrong with the PvP and the klingons factions (like have the fed icon on yor windows contact on the side of the name)\n\nThere are a number of different issues currently affecting the PvP queue system. The development team is examining each of them and working on fixes as quickly as possible. So, you can be assured that they are giving PvP the love it needs, but you won't see it suddenly fixed overnight. Each change needs to be fully implemented, tested, and approved before it can go in."

      "text": "Best Shot at FTL?\n\nBest Shot at FTL?\n\nThe easiest thing is just to come up with some source of negative energy. We know that with negative energy some forms of time travel of feasible. Of course in real life there isn't any negative energy, but thats were fiction comes in handy.\n\nA few comments that I hope help; firstly if you haven't seen it already atomic rockets is a great resource for budding SF authors IMO (EDIT: Just saw that you have earlier up thread). It contains many pages on the various troupes of SF with advice and comments that can help you weave ideas into a story as well as containing a lot of side information to point out the effects of the causes (plot devices) e.g. if you're going to allow faster than light travel you either have to throw out causality or relativity or include some form of CPC (Larry Niven invoked the plot device that any attempt at time travel removed the reason for the journey and thus it never happens). This is also a good resource for addressing causality and other effects of FTL communication or travel. You don't have to address it of course but some readers may question it and the best SF is generally regarded as that which fully examines the effects of the plot devices and story premises. Finally on that specific topic you don't have to have FTL to make space opera as Al Reynold's Revelation Space demonstrated with its gigantic, near-light-speed travelling ships.\n\nMy second general piece of advice would be to pay considerable thought to the ecological considerations of your book. If you're going to have space habitats or ships you are going to need the technology to make closed ecosystems: environments that contain sustainable food webs capable of maintning a healthy human population. If you can't do this then either all ships and habitats will need resupply from Earth or you'll have to include further technologies that allow for resources to be scavanged in space or on other moons/planets that can be processed into nutrients for the environment. I know this sounds like a small thing but it has huge effects because if you can do it then there is no need to leave the solar system (simply build a station in space or a tented/domed settlement on a moon/planet) and if you can't do it then leaving the solar system wont solve anything. Reason being if there is an alien world out there with a biosphere it is either going to be so different as to be inhospitable; can't eat the food, can't grow crops on land with alien soil biota etc or if it is similar enough it's going to kill everyone via some immune response be it superantigenic or just simple infection from a pathogen we have no immunity for. Even if that weren't the case introducing terrestrial life to alien environments is going to have a huge effect as all cases of invasive species do. Funnily enough we had another SF author here recently who touched on this topic so rather than typing out further suggestions I'll quote my response to them;\n\nQuote by Ryan_m_b\n\nOf course as this is science fiction you could tap dance past this by either not addressing the peculiar similarity with Earth or having it that the ecosystems can't mesh so humans simply clear out areas and plant terrestrial ecosystems or have it that humans use advanced immunology to give themselves immunity to an entire alien ecosystem. I've seen examples of the latter in SF before (one example that springs to mind is a story by Ken McLeod wherein the characters wear suits that take in samples from the air and soil in the environment, run the samples through sophisticated lab on chips and then inject the occupants with rapid vaccines, after a few hours they can take off their suits safely. Given that there is some progress towards genetically engineered immune systems IRL (in HIV research no less!) this isn't so much of a stretch. You could perhaps add in some gene therapy or cell therapy for digestion too such as GM or synthetic gut flora capable of breaking down alien biomolecules.\n\nI suggest you take Mark Twain's advice,\n\"Never let the fact get in the way of a good story.\"\n\nMost of our best science fiction writers take that, marry it to the KISS principle, and produce outstanding science fiction. Take a concept or a technology as a given. Establish your own rules on how it works, and stay consistent with those rules in your story. It makes it much easier for your characters to react consistently and beleiveably.\n\nRemember, science fiction isn't about the science, it's about the people."

      "text": "Umbra pattern bolters, which armour mark do they fit? Do they fit the mark 3? I have been ghosting other sites and i'm getting confused on what i'm hearing about the bolter type.\n\nAlso the Mark 3 armour, how plentiful would they be in the Iron Hands? I'm asking because the fluff states that they were used for boarding actions and close confine areas. The Forge World mark 3's don't have assault arms, so would this go against fluff?\n\nI was thinking of using Mk3 for assault and maybe tacticals. Mk4 for officers and devastators. Would this be right? What ratios would the armour marks be in a company?\n\n\"Assault\" does not mean the same as \"close-assault\", i.e. hand-to-hand. It usually means a specific directed attack. \"Assault Marines\" are only so named because they are pro-active in attacking the enemy.\n\nUmbra bolters are basically the Rogue Trader ones. Some people prefer that look for any armour mark up to MK6, but I think they look best with MK1-MK3.\n\nI don't think there is any fluff-based reason to limit armour marks to specific roles. Mix and match as you prefer. Generally, the only thing that each new mark of armour added to the Astartes repertoire over the previous mark, was 'more mobility, better protection'. I wouldn't be too tempted to overthink beyond that.\n\nAnd for the umpteenth time, we don't really know how big companies were. Reports differ.\n\nI know we have a thread detailing the armour marks, but do we have one detailing marine equipment? Like bolters, special weapons, and heavy weapons. It would be nice to have pictures of what they look like and maybe pictures of bits from FW or GW to give example of them.\n\nWhat type of bolters go with Mk4 to mk6? The bolters that come with the normal GW marine box sets, are they just for mk7s?\n\nAFAIK they had something which at least looks very much like the standard plastic 'Godwyn' pattern bolters as far back as pre-MK4. I wouldn't worry too much.\n\n1) Astartes worlds? You mean, the primarchs' homeworlds? Interesting - my answer would be \"probably\" as all worlds were required to contribute tithes of some kind, and militarily-inclined worlds usually raised regiments to fulfill them. If a population was military enough to produce Astartes recruits, it's a fair bet that they also raised IA regiments.\n\n2) I'm sure you now mean the primarchs' homeworlds. Remember that there were no Astartes on these worlds before the Imperium, and it would have taken a fair few years to start recruiting from the population and producing mature Astartes (10-15 years for full power armoured Astartes?) to supplement the existing Imperial forces from Terra and the other recruiting worlds. And yes, as per the first novel, when a new world was made compliant, Imperial personnel and structure would have been assembled to take control. It's the \"Modernist\" system where you give a central unity to all areas, regardless of individual composition.\n\n3) See above.\n\n4) I don't think it is a deathworld as such, just not a very nice place. Like Leeds."

      "text": "I have to give it a seven. While the mod most certainly looks nice, it's scale, both visually and gameplay-wise, doesn't work well in Sins. All costs have been increased and so has resource collection, but they feel harder to control as a result. As for the appearance, all the systems appear to have been scaled up in size and the ships scaled down. I would have preferred the game to have more of a vanilla Sins feel than it has now because it makes you feel more involved when you can see your ships without having to zoom in nearly all of the way. Also, ships feel too fast, at least from a game play perspective.\n\nIt seems like a lot of these elements were made to be more reflective of the scale of the Star Wars universe, but it ends up feeling like the elements of the game were stretched to their limit to get that effect. On the other hand, I still believe it to be a very playable mod and those issues I note are mostly able to be overlooked with a little effort.\n\nGreat mod visually but the scale is a bit off. The gravity wells feel too large for the ships and the ranges of ships doesn't allow the beauty of multiple models to be seen at once which significantly reduces my enjoyment.\n\nTechnically well done but as mentioned, personally, enjoyment is lacking which is what gaming is all about.\n\nUnit size, too small. Cost for the basic ships? Too high. Epic fights? once again size plays a factor, and since theyre so small they have limited guns compared to vanilla. research? Be done with it in an hour in all fields, easy.\n\nI have to rate this a six. While I have been waiting for a SOASE mod based in the Star Wars universe, this one fails in some fundamental ways, drawing away from the base economic structure of Sins, and for little to no reason.\n\n-Asteroid and planetary populations are low, but the tax rates remain the same, meaning the more planets you have under your control, the less tax income you have. This does not translate well from the Sins system, as planetary populations should (at the very least), not handicap your credit income, and at most, give you a reason to hold onto systems, and their populations.\n\n-Far, far too many asteroid mines. I've counted as much as 13 mining stations in some gravity wells, with the standard .6-.7 rates for each one, leading to a huge influx of resources early on, which in my opinion, stems your reasons for expansion, as you could keep a small, clustered group of systems and have all the resources you need.\n\n-The scale of battles is not indicative of the star wars universe. Look at the Battle of Naboo, Yavin, Coruscant, any large 'naval' battle had precious few large ships, and mostly fighters, you will not find a battle with 48 star destroyers versus dozens of other ships. The scale of ship battles in vanilla rebellion (One titan, a dozen or less capitals, a few dozen corvettes) would be perfectly set for a 'realistic' Star Wars conflict.\n\nThe scale of the ships is, as some other reviewers have mentioned, also a problem. If we are willing to suspend the disbelief of the resource income, we can suspend the disbelief of the scale of a planetary system. I would have much rather liked to see large capital ships crusing slowly through a plantary system than small blips and icons floating around.\n\nIn closing, the ship models, visual effects, 'lore' based research text, and sound effects are very nice in this modification, but the fundamental lack of understanding of the game's basic resource, ship and economic mechanics leave much to be desired.\n\nexcellent mod, gets updated very fast.... very good thing too. stability is pretty great too. the 500+ planet map is awesome also. just so wish dumb 2G ram problem would go away, but i know we have to wait for the game to be written in 64 bit format as SINS 2\n\nI had to give it a 6. While I really want to like this star wars mod I cant.\n\nThe cost of everything while increased and the speed at witch you get resources is increased I feel that it takes to much control from the player. Also when I finally got the resources to build an SSD it auto built and then I never did see it build it is building.\n\nBut for me the big glaring issue is that the mod crashes every hour on the hour. I have a fairly beefy machine and was only playing on a small map vs one ai and it would crash.\n\nThe game captures some of the Star Wars flavor, but fails to embrace the epic scale that we've come to love about Star Wars. There are unlikely to be any Battle of Endor moments where the game makes your jaw drop. Ship scale and planet scale are disappointing, and ships lack the detail that made me love the HW2 mod.\n\nBalance is somewhat out of whack, both in resource cost and combat ability. The cost of ships and tech means that the early game is tedious. This also has the ancillary effect of screwing over factions that start with neighboring systems that have high numbers of militia ships; by the time they are overcome, they are too far behind to be a challenge. It also means that the pirate faction is incredibly overpowered, as a typical pirate raid has enough missile ships to one-volley a capital ship off the field.\n\nThere are some AI problems as well. It feels like it's difficult to get the AI to engage in a fight, and gravity well generators tend to break the AI; They can't flee, but they don't fight either. Instead they sit at the system's edge and die one-by-one.\n\nFinally, the sense of scale is affected greatly by the Sins-style combat design, where ships trade blows from incredible ranges; this is in complete contradiction of the Star Wars universe where ships trade fire from fairly close range, even intermingling. All in all, the mod presents a functional Star Wars experience, but lacks the essential spirit of the universe that really brings it together: a sense of scale."
