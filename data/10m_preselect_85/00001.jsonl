{"text":"Thursday, April 5, 2007\n\nThe Human Face\n\nThe human face abounds with examples of the Golden Section or Divine Proportion. We'll use our building blocks again to understand design in the face:\n\nThe head forms a golden rectangle with the eyes at its midpoint. The mouth and nose are each placed at golden sections of the distance between the eyes and the bottom of the chin. The beauty unfolds as you look further.\n\nHuman beauty is based on the Divine Proportion\n\nThe blue line defines a perfect square of the pupils and outside corners of the mouth. The golden section of these four blue lines defines the nose, the tip of the nose, the inside of the nostrils, the two rises of the upper lip and the inner points of the ear. The blue line also defines the distance from the upper lip to the bottom of the chin.\n\nThe yellow line, a golden section of the blue line, defines the width of the nose, the distance between the eyes and eye brows and the distance from the pupils to the tip of the nose.\n\nThe green line, a golden section of the yellow line defines the width of the eye, the distance at the pupil from the eye lash to the eye brow and the distance between the nostrils.\n\nThe magenta line, a golden section of the green line, defines the distance from the upper lip to the bottom of the nose and several dimensions of the eye.\n\nClick on the photo to the left to see another photo which illustrates the following golden sections in the human face:\n\nCenter of pupil : Bottom of teeth : Bottom of chin\n\nOuter & inner edge of eye: Center of nose\n\nOuter edges of lips : Upper ridges of lips\n\nWidth of center tooth : Width of second tooth\n\nWidth of eye : Width of iris\n\nPhi defines the dimensions of the human profile\n\nEven when viewed from the side, the human head illustrates the Divine Proportion.\n\nThe first golden section (blue) from the front of the head defines the position of the ear opening. The successive golden sections define the neck (yellow), the back of the eye (green) and the front of the eye and back of the nose and mouth (magenta). The dimensions of the face from top to bottom also exhibit the Divine Proportion, in the positions of the eye brow (blue), nose (yellow) and mouth (green and magenta).\n\nThe ear reflects the shape of a Fibonacci spiral.\n\nEven the dimensions of our teeth are based on phi\n\nThe front two incisor teeth form a golden rectangle, with a phi ratio in the heighth to the width.\n\nThe ratio of the width of the first tooth to the second tooth from the center is also phi.\n\nThe ratio of the width of the smile to the third tooth from the center is phi as well.","id":"/1636100","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspace/Filtering-Techniques/preselect_training/climblab_10m.jsonl","__label__1":0.851407527923584,"__label__0":0.14861249923706055}}

However, as the number of possible vectors increases, the evaluation of this integral becomes more complicated and the convergence rate of the algorithm becomes higher. In this paper, we employ this approach for the identification of the fractional fractional number of the number in a matrix. This method is based on an algorithm for the numerical evaluation of the integral of the fraction of the number by the product of the Gauss-Legendre polynomials. However, the presented method fails in many practical applications, for example, the problem of determining the probability of a random number being a real number with high probability. This paper proposes a novel numerical algorithm for the identification and the estimation of the fraction in the matrix, and further shows that it can be used to determine the probability of the random number being an integer number. Introduction The problem of discovering a fraction of the real number $x$ has been extensively studied and studied for a long time. It is a very interesting problem and one of the most important problems in computer science. It is well known that the fractional number is an irrational number. For example, the fraction of $\\varepsilon$ is the fraction of $2^{1/2}$ in $\\vareq 2^{\\vareps}\\times \\vareps \\times 2$ matrix. The fraction of $x$ is given by the fraction of real numbers in $\\varrho$. The fraction of $\\psi$ is the ratio of the two fractions of the real numbers. The fractional fraction of the $x$ in the matrix is given by $x=\\frac{1}{3}(p\\ln p+\\ln \\vareq p)$, where $p$ is the probability of number in the matrix and $\\varequo \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2,5}$. The linearity of the fraction is known as the fractional linear program and its proof is based on a series of integral equations. But the main obstacle in the derivation of the fraction may be the difficulty of finding the solution to the integral. For example in the case of the numerical algorithm for solving the problem of the solution of the integral equation, the linear system is a polynomial equation with the solution in the range $[0,1]$. For the problem of finding the fractional algorithm, the polynomial system is obtained by solving the integral equation. However, one of the main advantages of the approach is that the complexity of the system is reduced.\n\nIs It Possible To Cheat In An Online Exam?\n\nIn read the full info here paper, the algorithm for the fraction of a number $x\\in\\mathbb{C}$ is based on evaluation of the linear system of the fraction equation, which has a complex part proportional to $x^2$. In the case when the number of the matrix is a real number, the solution to this integral equation is given by an integral, and the problem of solving the integral is solved by solving the linear system, where the complex part is the solution to a polynomomial equation with a real part. The main difficulty in this case is the difficulty of solving the complex system. Let $A$ be a real number. The fraction $x\\mapsto A^x$ is defined by the product $\\frac{\\exp(x)}2$, where $x\\sim\\exp(x+1)$ and $\\exp(x)=\\frac{A}{x^2}$. It is known that if $A\\sim\\mathbb R^n$ and $x\\not\\sim\\frac{n}2$, then $x\\neq\\frac{2n}3$. However, it is not easy to determine the fraction of this number in the case when $A\\not\\equiv\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.

From the top of the breast to the roots of the hair will be the seventh part of the whole man. From the nipples to the top of the head will be the fourth part of a man. The greatest width of the shoulders contains in itself the fourth part of the man. From the elbow to the tip of the hand will be the fifth part of a man; and from the elbow to the angle of the armpit will be the eighth part of the man. The whole hand will be the tenth part of the man; the beginning of the genitals marks the middle of the man. The foot is the seventh part of the man. From the sole of the foot to below the knee will be the fourth part of the man. From below the knee to the beginning of the genitals will be the fourth part of the man. The distance from the bottom of the chin to the nose and from the roots of the hair to the eyebrows is, in each case the same, and like the ear, a third of the face.\nHidden Meaning\nThe images tell us it is about proportion, but outside this obvious link the Vitruvian Man could have a very simplistic hidden meaning. The Square is masculine and the circle feminine- With the Vitruvian Man being the example of the perfect physical man, but the square and the circle being the spiritual representation of the perfect balance between masculinity and femininity. Also, if you take all the numbers from the first sentence you get 49- which is 7 squared, a number which many believe represents absolute perfection.\nSearching for more meaning to this image I found incredible image above which unifies the Tree of Life and the Chakra system. It also includes information related to our biology, Kundalini Yoga, Astrology, Alchemy and more.\nThis image sheds light on some of the potential hidden meaning behind the Vitruvian Man. The image is a projection of an esoteric understanding of the spirit body relayed on the Vitruvian Man. It is extensive and can be viewed in detail Here and purchased Here (PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMAGES).\n\nQuestion: What fraction of a man's height is the distance from the bottom of the chin to the top of his head?

{"text":"The characteristics of the number Fibonacci numbers is that each one is the sum of the perceiving numbers.\nFibonacci numbers have an impressive pattern. When you divide one number in the series with the number before you get numbers very close to 1.618.\nIn fact, this number is fixed by 13-th in the series and 1.618 is known as the golden ratio.\nIt applies to the ideal human form. When proportions of the body and the face are equal to 1.618, we have the perfect human body.\nProportions in the human face:\n1)The length of the face over the width of the face.\n2)The distance between the lips and the eyebrows over the length of the nose.\n3)The length of face over the distance between the tip of jaw to where the eyebrows meet.\n4)The length of mouth over the width of the nose.\n5)The distance between the tip of the eye between the distance of eyebrows.\n6)The distance between the tip of the jaw to the nose over the tip of jaw to the lower lip.\n7)The distance between the nose to the top of the head over the distance of the tip of the jaw to the nose.\n8)The distance between the tip of the jaw to the top of the head over the distance between the nose to the top of the head.\nThe total width of the front teeth in the upper jaw over their height gives us the golden rule.\nThe width of the first teeth, the center of the second reveals a golden rule.\nThe golden ratio in the human body\nMany artists and designers use the golden ratio in their works because it is perceived as more pleasing to see.\nIn the century. 25 B.C. the Roman architect Marcus Vitruvius Pollio remarked on a similarity between the human body and a perfect building.\nHe inscribed the human body into a circle and a square, the two forms that are considered the images of perfection.\nProportions in the human body:\n1- The distance between the navel and the foot and the height of the human being.\n2- The distance between the fingertips and the elbow to the distance between the wrist and elbow.\n3- The distance between the shoulder line and the top of the head.\n4- The distance between the navel and the top of the head – The distance between the shoulder line and the top of the head.\n5- Navel and knee –The distance between the knee and the end of the foot.\nThe golden ration in your hand\nLook at your index finger and you will find the golden number.\nOur fingers have 3 sections. The proportions of the first two sections to the full length of the finger gives the golden ratio. This, of course, doesn't apply to the thumb that has 2 joints.\nAlso, the proportion of the middle finger with the little finger gives the golden ratio.\nYou have 2 hands, the fingers in them consist of 3 sections, there are 5 fingers in each hand, and only 8 of the fingers give the golden number.\n\nQuestion: What is the defining characteristic of Fibonacci numbers? Answer: Each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.","id":"/2377171","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspace/Filtering-Techniques/preselect_training/climblab_10m.jsonl","__label__1":0.8615583777427673,"__label__0":0.138461634516716}}

{"text":"The objective of this work was to elaborate, to apply and to analyze a didactic sequence to approach the theme of the length and area measures, in a group of the fourth grade (fifth year) of the Elementary School. The difficulties presented by students of the High School and egress of the schools, related to the theme of the greatness and measures, that motivated the research. This theme was present in some moments of their scholarship process. It is believed that the incomprehensions of the concepts are related to a teaching based on the use and memorization of rules and formulas. There was elaborated, then, a teaching proposal betting in the construction of the concepts from the first series of the Elementary School, where the student begins the study of the concepts of greatness and measures. The research was developed as a case study, and the didactic sequence was applied in a group of the fourth grade of a municipal school of the municipal district of Travesseiro, Rio Grande do Sul. During the whole construction process, implementation and evaluation of the sequence, we referred to studies that treat of the act of measuring, the construction of concepts, the use of the multiplicative structures and the children's cognitive development to understand and to analyze the strategies and the methods used by the students involved in the research to solve certain situations.

{"text":"The teaching of the concept of number in the Davydovian and in the modern formalist propositions: some theoretical implications\n\nAbstract: In this paper we analyze two teaching propositions: the Davydovian and the modern formalist, in relation to the introduction of the concept of number in the first year of the primary school. The research problem is expressed in the following question: What is distinctive in the teaching of the concept of number, in the first year of the primary school, according to the Davydovian propositions in contrast to the modern formalist Mathematics Teaching? We adopted as reference for the analysis: the text book of the two propositions and the teacher's manual of the Davydovian proposition. Thus, this work can be characterized as a documental research and has as its theoretical basis the historical cultural theory. Both teaching propositions differ in method and content, which has as consequence: the development of the empirical knowledge, in the formalist proposition, and the theoretical knowledge, in the Davydovian proposition.","id":"/5008999","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspace/Filtering-Techniques/preselect_training/climblab_10m.jsonl","__label__1":0.8505287766456604,"__label__0":0.14949126541614532}}

{"text":"Chapter Ten\n\nWe are able therefore in accordance with the rules propounded further up: Given the Arc of any Chord, to find the Chord both for any multiples of the Arc as for fractions. But any Chords you wish found by the above methods, will give the Squares of the Chords of the other Arcs. And the Squares will give the Chords also, as will be evident from the following propositions.\n\n1. If the Chord of any Arc whatsoever should be added to the Diameter, the sum will be the square of the Chord of the same Arc increased by half the complement to the Semicircle. As the Chord of 36 Degrees of which the complement 144, and of this half 72, the sum of the Arcs 108. Or the Arc of the square of the Chord composed of the Quadrant and from half the given Arc. As for the Chord 36:0': 061803398874989484824.\n\nThe Arc composed from the Quadrant 90:0': and from half the Arc given 18:0': The Square of the Chord of 108:0': 2618033988.\n\nLet AC be the Diameter of the Circle, FE the Chord of 36:0': to which CG shall be equal; I assert AG to be the Square of the line AF\nof the subtending Arc ADF, 108:0': For the triangles BAF, FAG are equiangular. Thus because EF, CG shall be equal and parallel from the construction and the proposition, the Angles ECA, FGA equal to the Angle BAO, and between themselves. Therefore AB, AF, AG are continued proportionals. And as the radius shall be from the preposition unity, AB shall be the side and AG the square of the same side.\n[i.e. AF/AG = 1/AF].\n\n2. If the Chord of any Arc whatsoever should be taken away from the Diameter, the remainder will be the Square of the Chord of half the complement to the Semicircle.\n\nLet DE, DF be equal, and from the Arc EB bisected in C being drawn the line CD: CE, CF will be equal; and the triangles ACB, CBF with equal angles and equal legs; and the Angles ACB, CBF, BFC equal. AB, BC, BF are therefore continued proportionals, and AB unity, BC the side, and BF the Square.\n[i.e. BD - DE = BF = BC2; and 1/BC = BC/BF].\n\nLet DE or DF be the Chord of 117:0': 1705280328708184, of which the complement to the Semicircle 63:0': of which the half 31:30': Of which the square of the Chord is 0294719671291816. And the Chord of 31:30': itself 0542880899730149. [This approach resembles the work in Chapter Three].\n\n3. With the difference of the Diameter and the Square of the Chord of the Arc given, the Chord is in excess or deficient to the double of the Arc given to the Semicircle. For if the double of the Arc shall be greater than the Semicircle , AF the Arc 108: the double 216. The excess over the Semicircle 36. AG the Square of the Chord AF, CG being equal to the Chord EF, 36:0': And if the double Arc shall be smaller than the Semicircle , BC 31:30': BE the double Arc 63:0': BF the Square of the Chord BC. DF being equal to the Chord DE the Arc 117:0': of the complement to the Semicircle.","id":"/9748145","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspace/Filtering-Techniques/preselect_training/climblab_10m.jsonl","__label__1":0.8501108288764954,"__label__0":0.14990916848182678}}

To put it another way, the line perpendicular to the plane which passes through the centre of the sphere will intersect the plane at the centre of the circle.

You already know (I hope) the distance between the centre of the sphere and the circle. An application of Pythagorus' Theorem will then give the distance between the centre of the circle and the circle, in other words the radius of the circle.\n\nThe projection of the center of the sphere on the plane has coordinates $\\frac{\\sqrt 3}{3}(1,1,1)$ and it is the center of the circle.\nTo calculate this, remember that the projection of the top of a pyramide on its base is the center of the triangle ; this center is situated at 2/3 of the altitude.

In a coordinate plane, to find the circumcenter we first find the equation of two perpendicular bisectors of the sides and solve the system of equations.\nHow to construct the circumcenter using a compass and straightedge.\n\nUsing compass and straigtedge to construct the circumcenter of a triangle.\n\nConstructing the Orthocenter\n\nThe orthocenter is the point of concurrency of the altitudes in a triangle. A point of concurrency is the intersection of 3 or more lines, rays, segments or planes. Theorthocenter is just one point of concurrency in a triangle. The others are the incenter, the circumcenter and the centroid.\nHow to construct the orthocenter of a triangle.\n\nUsing a straight edge and compass to create the orthocenter of an acute triangle\n\nUsing a straight edge and compass to create the external orthocenter of an obtuse triangle\n\nConstructing the Centroid\n\nThe centroid is the point of concurrency of the three medians in a triangle. It is the center of mass (center of gravity) and therefore is always located within the triangle. The centroid divides each median into a piece one-third the length of the median and two-thirds the length. To find the centroid, we find the midpoint of two sides in the coordinate plane and use the corresponding vertices to get equations.\nHow to identify the centroid and the way it divides each of the medians.\n\nUsing a straight edge and a compass to create the centroid or center of gravity of a triangle","id":"/9808410","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspace/Filtering-Techniques/preselect_training/climblab_10m.jsonl","__label__1":0.8528335094451904,"__label__0":0.1471864879131317}}

{"text":"How to Find the Vertices of an Ellipse\n\nThe vertices of an ellipse, the points where the axes of the ellipse intersect its circumference, must often be found in engineering and geometry problems. Computer programmers also must know how to find the vertices to program graphic shapes. In sewing, finding the vertices of the ellipse can be helpful for designing elliptic cutouts. You can find the vertices of an ellipse in two ways: by graphing an ellipse on paper or through the equation of the ellipse.\n\nGraphical Method\n\nCircumscribe a rectangle with your pencil and ruler such that the midpoint of each edge of the rectangle touches a point on the circumference of the ellipse.\n\nLabel the point where the right rectangle edge intersects the circumference of the ellipse as point \"V1\" to indicate that this point is the first vertex of the ellipse.\n\nLabel the point where the top rectangle edge intersects the circumference of the ellipse as point \"V2\" to indicate that this point is the second vertex of the ellipse.\n\nLabel the point where the left edge of the rectangle intersects the circumference of the ellipse as point \"V3\" to indicate that this point is the third vertex of the ellipse.\n\nLabel the point where the lower edge of the rectangle intersects the circumference of the ellipse as point \"V4\" to indicate that this point is the fourth vertex of the ellipse.\n\nFinding the Vertices Mathematically\n\nFind the vertices of an ellipse defined mathematically. Use the following ellipse equation as an example:\n\nx^2/4 + y^2/1 = 1\n\nEquate the given ellipse equation, x^2/4 + y^2/1 = 1, with the general equation of an ellipse:\n\nNote that for the general equation of the ellipse, h is the x-coordinate of the center of the ellipse; k is the y-coordinate of the center of the ellipse; a is one-half the length of the longer axis of the ellipse (the longer of the width or length of the ellipse); b is one-half the length of the shorter axis of the ellipse (the shorter of the width or length of the ellipse); x is a value of x-coordinate of the given point \"P\" on the circumference of the ellipse; and y is a value of a y-coordinate of the given point \"P\" on the circumference of the ellipse.\n\nUse the following \"vertex equations\" to find the vertices of an ellipse:\n\nConclude that the four vertices of this ellipse are on the x-axis and the y-axis of the coordinate system and that these vertexes are symmetrical about the origin of the center of the ellipse and the origin of the x-y coordinate system.","id":"/9809300","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspace/Filtering-Techniques/preselect_training/climblab_10m.jsonl","__label__1":0.8619327545166016,"__label__0":0.13808724284172058}}

The altitude of any triangle is easy to draw, but finding the length of the altitude can be difficult for triangles that aren't right triangles. Use the following steps to determine the length of the altitude for non-right triangles.

Many functions are derived from a right triangle—a triangle containing a right (90°) angle. Consider the following right triangle with sides A, B, and C, and angles α, β, and γ.\n\nA commonly used trigonometric relationship for right triangles is the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem is an expression of the relationship between the hypotenuse and the other two sides of a right triangle:\n\nThree trigonometric relationships are based on the ratios of the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. The sine (abbreviated sin) of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side of the triangle opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.

{"text":"Math word problems Essay\n\nCustom StudentMr.\nTeacherENG\n1001-04\n30 November 2016\n\nMath word problems\n\nIn a right angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side of the triangle is equal to the sum of the opposite side and adjacent sides of the triangle (Eves, 1997). This is known as the Pythagoras triangle. There are various applications of Pythagoras theorem in day-to-day situation that involves right angled triangles. An example of the application of Pythagoras theorem involving right angle triangles in day-to-day situations is in the determination of the height of a window from the foot of the ground.\n\nIt is quite difficult to accurately determine the height of a window from the foot of the ground, but with the application of Pythagoras theorem this makes it easier. Assuming, we have a rigid ladder that leans against a vertical house, touching the window whose height is to be determined. This forms a right angled triangle. The distance from the base of the ladder to the foot of the building represents the adjacent side of the triangle and the length of the ladder is the hypotenuse side of the triangle, the height of the window whose length is to be determined is the opposite side of the triangle.\n\nLet the length of the ladder be represented by h, the distance between the foot of the ladder and the foot of the building be represented by a, then the height of the window from the base of the building be represented by o. Each parameter represents the hypotenuse, adjacent and the opposite sides of the triangle. Mathematically, applying Pythagoras theorem, h2= o2 + a2 The length of the window is the opposite side of the triangle and is represented by o above. Therefore making o the subject of the formulae,\n\nWe have o= v (h2 – a2). So given that we know the length of the ladder and the horizontal distance between the foot of the ladder and the foot of the building, then the height of the window can be calculated using the above formulae. The application of Pythagoras theorem in the determination of the height of a window further validates the authenticity of the theorem.","id":"/9852351","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspace/Filtering-Techniques/preselect_training/climblab_10m.jsonl","__label__1":0.8500601053237915,"__label__0":0.14995993673801422}}

Because the triangle is equilateral, the centroid is equidistant from each vertex. As a principle of a triangle, the ratio of a distance between a vertex and the centroid of a triangle to a distance between the opposite midpoint of the triangle and the centroid is 2:1. The radius of the larger circle can be thought as the distance between a vertex and the centroid of the triangle, and the radius of the smaller circle as the distance between the opposite midpoint and the centroid of the triangle.

Many functions are derived from a right triangle—a triangle containing a right (90°) angle. Consider the following right triangle with sides A, B, and C, and angles α, β, and γ.\n\nA commonly used trigonometric relationship for right triangles is the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem is an expression of the relationship between the hypotenuse and the other two sides of a right triangle:\n\nThree trigonometric relationships are based on the ratios of the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. The sine (abbreviated sin) of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side of the triangle opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. Using the labeled triangle yields the following:\n\nThe cosine (abbreviated cos) of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side of the triangle adjacent to the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. Using the labeled triangle yields the following:\n\nThe third function, the tangent (abbreviated tan) of an angle, is defi ned as the ratio of the length of the side of the triangle opposite the angle to that of the side adjacent to the angle.

In other words, the altitudes and suitable circum-radius-vectors are reflections of each other in the corresponding angle bisectors. Also, the sides of the orthic triangle are antiparallels relative to the opposite sides of ΔABC, which also means that the directions of the sides of the orthic and reference triangles are reflections in the suitable angle bisectors.

{"text":"The Nine-Point circle for any triangle passes through the three midpoints of the sides, the three feet of the altitudes, and the three midpoints of the segments from the respective vertices to orthocenter. Construct the nine points, locate the center (N) and construct the nine point circle.\n\nThe Nine-Point circle is shown below. Constructing the circle by using the Geometer's Sketchpad (GSP) can be relatively easy by using the definition of the circle. Finding the center of the circle, however, requires more exploration with the other centers of the triangle.\n\nIn the sketch above, the three midpoints of the sides of the triangle, the three feet of the altitudes, and the three midpoints of the segments from the respective vertices to orthocenter were found, nine points total. Selecting three consecutive points at a time, an arc through the three points was constructed. This process was continued until the arcs joined to make a circle, the Nine-Point circle.\n\nThere are also other ways to construct the Nine-Point circle, along with its center. To do this, three sub-triangles of the the original triangle need to be constructed. These sub-triangles are the medial triangle, the orthic triangle, and a dilated version of the original triangle.\n\nFor the dilated sub-triangle, the orthocenter of the original triangle needs to be found first. Marking the orthocenter as the center of dilation, dilate the original triangle by one-half. The vertices of the dilated triangle are the midpoints of the segments between the orthocenter and the vertices of the original triangle, three points that are required in the Nine-Point circle.\n\nTo construct the medial triangle, the midpoint for each side of the triangle needs to be found. Connecting the midpoints forms the medial triangle.\n\nFor the orthic triangle, the perpendiculars from each vertex need to be constructed. Defining a point at the base of each altitude on the triangle and connecting the points will result in the orthic triangle.\n\nAll of the sub-triangles have vertices that make up some part of the Nine-Point circle. If the circumcenter and circumcircle for each sub-triangle is found, one will notice that it is the same circle and point. This is the Nine-Point circle. Therefore the circumcenter of the sub-triangles, by definition of the circumcenter and circumcircle, will be the center of the Nine-Point circle.\n\nTo quickly find the Nine-Point circle, dilated the original triangle by one-half using the orthocenter of the triangle as the center of dilation. Find the the circumcenter and circumcircle of the dilated triangle. The circumcircle is the Nine-Point circle and the circumcenter is the center of the Nine-Point circle. Even more quickly, the circumcircle of the original triangle could be found and then dilated by a factor of one-half using the orthocenter as the center of dilation. The dilated circumcircle would be the Nine-Point circle.","id":"/9882906","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspace/Filtering-Techniques/preselect_training/climblab_10m.jsonl","__label__1":0.8503867983818054,"__label__0":0.14963316917419434}}

Now, this octagon can by divided into eight triangles, following the same procedure as for the square. The height of each of these triangles equals the distance from the center of the circle to the middle of one side of the octagon. Just as for the square case, the total area of these eight triangles is equal to that of a long thin triangle of the same height, and with base length equal to the perimeter of the octagon. It is evident that the height of the octagon's triangles is closer to the radius of the circle than the height of the square's triangles, and the perimeter of the octagon is closer to the circumference of the circle than the perimeter of the square was. The process is repeated: the octagon is replaced by a regular 16-sided polygon, with all its points on the circle.

{"text":"More Like This\n\nQuick Reference\n\nIn elementary work, a cone usually consists of a circle as base, a vertex lying directly above the centre of the circle, and the curved surface formed by the line segments joining the vertex to the points of the circle. The distance from the vertex to the centre of the base is the height, and the length of any of the line segments is the slant height. For a cone with base of radius r, height h and slant height l, the volume equals ⅓πr2h and the area of the curved surface equals πrl.\n\nIn more advanced work, a cone is the surface consisting of the points of the lines, called generators, drawn through a fixed point V, the vertex, and the points of a fixed curve, the generators being extended indefinitely in both directions. Then a right-circular cone is a cone in which the fixed curve is a circle and the vertex V lies on the line through the centre of the circle and perpendicular to the plane of the circle. The axis of a right-circular cone is the line through V and the centre of the circle, and is perpendicular to the plane of the circle. All the generators make the same angle with the axis; this is the semi-vertical angle of the cone. The right-circular cone with vertex at the origin, the z-axis as its axis, and semi-vertical angle α, has equation x2+y2=z2 tan2α.

{"text":"How to find the length of bisector in a triangle\n\nStrictly speaking, the bisector is a ray that divides the angle in half and has a beginning at the same point where it starts and the rays forming the sides of this angle. However, with regard to the triangle under the bisector of the mean beam, and the segment between one vertex and the opposite side of the figure. The main property (a bisection of the angle at the vertex) is preserved in the triangle. This feature allows you to talk about the length of the bisector and use the appropriate formula for calculating it.\n\nIf you know the lengths of the sides (a and b) of the triangle forming the bisected angle (γ), the length of the bisector (L) can be derived from the spherical law of cosines. To do this, find the value of twice the product of the lengths of the sides into the cosine of half the angle between them and divide the result by the sum of the lengths of the sides: L=2*a*b*cos(γ/2)/(a+b).\n\n2\n\nIf the size of the angle which divides the angle bisector, is unknown, but given the lengths of all sides of the triangle (a, b and c), for calculations it is more convenient to introduce an additional variable properiter: p=½*(a+b+c). After this part of the formula length of a bisecting line (L) from the previous step it will be necessary to replace in the numerator of the fraction put a doubled square root of the product of the lengths of the sides, forming separated by the bisector of the angle at properiter and a quotient of the subtraction of properiety length third party. Leave the denominator unchanged - this should be the sum of the lengths of the sides of the split angle of the triangle. As a result, the formula should look like this: L=2*√(a*b*p*(p-c))/(a+b).\n\n3\n\nIf to complicate radical expression formulas from the previous step, it is possible to do without properiety. To do this, leave the denominator (the sum of the lengths of the sides of the split angle) unchanged, and the numerator shall be the square root of the product of the lengths of these sides to the sum of their lengths, from which is subtracted the length of the third side and the sum of the lengths of all three sides: L=√(a*b*(a+b-c)*(a+b+c))/(a+b).\n\n4\n\nIf the baseline is not given only the lengths of the sides (a and b), forming separated by the bisector of the angle, but the lengths of segments (d and e), in which the bisector was shared by a third party, you also have to take the square root. The length of the bisecting line (L) in this case count as the root of the product of the lengths of the known sides, from which is subtracted the product of the lengths of the segments: L=√(a*b-d*e).\n\nIs the advice useful?\n\nPrint\n\nHow to find the length of bisector in a triangle","id":"/9950284","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspace/Filtering-Techniques/preselect_training/climblab_10m.jsonl","__label__1":0.8592830896377563,"__label__0":0.14073686301708221}}

The customary, more concise, formulation of the Pythagorean theorem is that the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the legs.
